""The kid is taking it coast-to-coast, dribbling through his legs. He's going hard!"" Sims recalls. ""Then they tell me 'Yo, that's your little brother.' ""

Historians place Cooley's farm along the river about where Southwest Seventh Avenue in Fort Lauderdale runs today. Besides a farmer, he was also a justice of the peace.

When a group of settlers murdered a Creek Indian chief, he had them arrested and sent to Key West, the county seat, for trial. But the court dropped charges.

The Indians believed Cooley withheld evidence that could have convicted the killer. When Cooley and others were salvaging a shipwreck on the coast, about 20 Creeks raided his home. They killed his wife, three children and the children's tutor.

The remaining pioneers quickly abandoned the settlement. Three years later, Army Maj. William Lauderdale arrived with troops. But it would be 50 years before any settlers returned to the New River.

Or ""Old"" Dixie Highway as it was known in some parts.

In 1915, when it was completed, it was the only ""real"" highway in Broward County. Actually, it was a network of existing and newly-constructed roads paid for by private subscriptions and some government assistance.

Parts were paved with brick; other sections were made of crushed rock or shell. In the mid-'20s, government funds helped pave some portions with asphalt. The route was identified by signs bearing the red letters ""DH"" painted on utility poles.

Dixie Highway typically followed the coastal ridge, and hewed close to the Florida East Coast Railway — though it sometimes ""jumped the track.""

And even into the 1940s, it was said, you could still play marbles in the middle of the road.

An employer should never have the right, by virtue of religious belief, to dictate what part of his employee's health coverage he is willing to cover. However, that does put Wasserman Schultz, a sizable number of Americans and me at odds with the John Roberts-led Supreme Court.

This is the court that believes the Founding Fathers intended for corporations to have the rights of individual citizens under the constitution. But once a corporation injects its religious or political beliefs into the workplace, customers have the right to take their business elsewhere. Go, Debbie, go.

During the 1930s and continuing past World War II, Meyer Lansky and his brother Jake ran posh gambling houses in Hallandale Beach and Hollywood.

When Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa disappeared in 1975, Anthony Provenzano, an alleged capo in the Genovese crime family, held an impromptu news conference outside his home in Hallandale Beach's Golden Isles neighborhood to deny having anything to do with it. Philadelphia boss Nicodemo Scarfo kept a four-bedroom, waterfront home in Fort Lauderdale, where he tied up his 40-foot yacht Casablanca.

At Fort Lauderdale's Galt Ocean Mile in the 1970s and 80s, FBI agents conducted surveillance on the comings and goings of Gus Alex, a high-ranking member of the Chicago mob. When the FBI arrested Chicago mob boss Sam Carlisi in 1992, he was about to board a plane to return to his home in Weston.

When the FBI arrested Nicholas Corozzo, then-head of the Gambino family, in 1996, they charged him with supervising a loan-sharking operation out of a check-cashing store in Deerfield Beach.","2014-09-15 00:00:00","0","11.0","2.0","3.0","0.0","18.0","0.0","35.0","18.0","0.0","70.0","4.0","12.0","0","194","97.57","76.47","6.39","18.20","27.71","23.71","63.92","38.66","5.15","4.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.61","0.52","1.03","8.25","15.98","2.58","3.61","5.67","0.00","5.67","2.06","0.52","2.58","2.58","1.03","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.00","7.73","1.55","0.52","0.00","4.12","4.12","0.52","0.52","1.03","1.55","0.52","0.52","1.03","0.52","0.00","0.52","1.55","1.03","0.52","0.00","0.00","8.25","3.09","0.52","4.64","0.00","0.52","3.61","1.55","0.52","15.46","1.03","10.31","4.12","4.12","3.09","4.12","2.06","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.95","3.09","7.22","0.00","0.00","0.52","0.00","3.09","0.00","1.03","0.00","0.00","926","9.15","28.142857142857142","280","189","7","52.53","13.9","12.6","12.6","16.1","50","11.875","23.382010582010583","136","25.57","4","0.39","0","6","8","17","0","24","5","0","0","1","31","49","0","7","0","0","5","4","4","0","0","1","6","0","5","12","5","1","1","0","0","0","0","5"

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/celebrity/chi-oscar-nominations-2014-20140116-story.html","Oscar nominations 2014: Laying odds on the six major races","We won't have to wait long to see what kind of final decisions Oscar voters will be making out of Thursday's Oscar nominations. This weekend brings the Screen Actors Guild and Producers Guild awards, with the Directors Guild following on Jan. 25. Those awards will give us plenty of concrete clues about where the most contentious contests -- picture, actor, supporting actress, director -- might be headed.

Meanwhile, Cate Blanchett and Jared Leto can likely work on some new material for their anticipated acceptance speeches. And that screenwriter who recently told ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" director Martin Scorsese that he should be ashamed of himself ... well, he's probably not all that happy right about now.

Here's an early peek at how the major Oscar races look for the long haul this morning:

PICTURE

""American Hustle,"" 2-1

""12 Years a Slave,"" 4-1

""Gravity,"" 9-2

""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" 15-1

""Nebraska,"" 15-1

""Dallas Buyers Club,"" 25-1

""Her,"" 30-1

""Captain Phillips,"" 40-1

""Philomena,"" 50-1

Analysis: This race might be over and done when the Producers Guild hands out its trophies Sunday. The PGA winner has matched the academy's pick six years running, largely because the guild uses the same preferential ballot (with voters ranking their choices) that the academy employs. If ""American Hustle"" wins the PGA, it will confirm what many have suspected for the last several weeks: A fizzy throwback trumps a harrowing history lesson, simply because it has a broader appeal. More voters are likely to place ""Hustle"" higher on their ballots than ""12 Years a Slave."" Entertainment over art.

Fox Searchlight can certainly counter this by appealing to voters' consciences, highlighting the way that ""12 Years"" tackled an important subject in an uncompromising fashion. The film's three acting nominations indicate support among the academy's biggest branch; a SAG ensemble win Saturday would help hammer that point home.

""Gravity,"" with 10 nominations, remains a viable alternative, though one suspects the film will be rewarded much in the same way ""Life of Pi"" was last year. ""Gravity"" will likely win the two sound categories, visual effects, original score and cinematography. And director Alfonso Cuaron stands as the front-runner for director. Five Oscars would be a satisfying haul.

ACTOR

Matthew McConaughey, ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" 2-1

Chiwetel Ejiofor, ""12 Years a Slave,"" 4-1

Bruce Dern, ""Nebraska,"" 6-1

Leonardo DiCaprio, ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" 8-1

Christian Bale, ""American Hustle,"" 20-1

Analysis: The year's most competitive category has started to tilt toward McConaughey, particularly as it has become increasingly apparent that ""Dallas Buyers Club"" has strong support throughout the academy, not just the actors branch. McConaughey's profile has also been helped by his fantastic, five-minute supporting turn as DiCaprio's mentor in ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" a performance that really sets the tone for the three hours to follow. (Money chant!) Add to that ""True Detective,"" the smart, subtle HBO mystery miniseries that pairs McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, and the McConaissance is complete and unassailable. It feels like his moment and then some.

ACTRESS

Cate Blanchett, ""Blue Jasmine,"" 2-1

Sandra Bullock, ""Gravity,"" 10-1

Amy Adams, ""American Hustle,"" 20-1

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/os-tourism-column-080414-20140730-story.html","Orlando hotel occupancy highest since June 2005","Orlando's hotel industry has been having a strong year as evidenced by solid occupancy rates and average daily room rates that are generally higher than last year's.

But Visit Orlando, the region's chief tourism-marketing agency, points out that June's average occupancy rate of 75.4 percent was the best for that month in almost a decade.

The last time June occupancy was above 75.4 percent was 2005, when the average occupancy rate was 76.5 percent.

Those were some fat times. Unemployment in Metro Orlando was 3.7 percent, and the median home value was $218,000, compared with today's $165,000. People were feeling pretty good.

So far this year, occupancy rates have averaged almost 77 percent, up 4 percentage points from the first half of 2013, according to Visit Orlando. The agency said recent data also suggests that advance bookings for the back half of the year are running almost 5 percent ahead of this time last year.

Metro Orlando has about 450 hotel properties, according to Visit Orlando, and about 118,000 rooms.

Haunted Mansion shop to open

A new Haunted Mansion-themed shop will open this fall at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. It will open at the site of the Yankee Trader shop, which closed last month.

Disney is introducing about 100 products based on the attraction. The items will include striped shirts resembling the ones that ride employees wear. Men's shirts will cost $24.95 and women's will cost $32.95. The store also will sell $39.95 bookends and $29.95 cake toppers. The Disney Parks online store will sell some of the items this fall as well.

It will be the first time Disney has created a Haunted Mansion-themed shop for visitors, though it has sold some items in a kiosk and merchandise cart near the ride.

Earnings reports on the way

Walt Disney Co. will report earnings Tuesday, followed by Orlando-based SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. the following week.

Disney will announce results for its third quarter a little after 4 p.m. Tuesday.

Comcast Corp., which announced earnings last month, has set a high bar. Higher attendance and per-capita spending at Universal Orlando and Comcast Corp.'s other theme parks drove a 12.8 percent year-over-year jump in revenue for the properties.

2 eateries ready at I-Drive 360

Two new restaurants are ready to go at the I-Drive 360 complex under construction on International Drive.

Carrabba's Italian Grill and Outback Steakhouse are scheduled to open today at 11 a.m.

The new Carrabba's is 7,800 square feet and features a design that mixes traditional and contemporary touches. It includes an open kitchen, a bar and patio seating.

The restaurant says it has hired almost 120 local residents. It will donate 50 percent of its opening-day sales — up to $5,000 — to the nearby YMCA Aquatic Center.

Outback is donating half of its opening-day sales — also up to $5,000 — to Give Kids the World, the Kissimmee-based nonprofit organization that hosts seriously ill children and their families when they vacation in Central Florida.

Carrabba's and Outback join the Yard House restaurant, which opened in April.

I-Drive 360, a $200 million project, will be anchored by the Orlando Eye, a 400-foot-tall observation wheel under construction. The complex also will include an aquarium and Madame Tussauds wax museum.

The Eye is expected to open in the spring of 2015.

Euro Disney gets new president

Tom Wolber, senior vice president of Walt Disney World resort and transportation operations, has been named president of Euro Disney S.A.S., the management company of Disneyland Paris.

Wolber oversaw all of the 28 resort hotels at Walt Disney World and the property's extensive transportation network. He had been in that position only a few months. He was appointed in March as part of a shakeup of the hotel and transportation divisions.

Wolber also has overseen a number of complex expansion projects, including the launch of the Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy cruise ships.

He was instrumental in the Disney Springs master plan and the continued growth of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts' sports business.

Wolber helped open Disneyland Paris in 1992.

The appointment is effective in September. He is replacing Philippe Gas, who is moving to become general manager of Shanghai Disney Resort.

""One of our greatest assets is the global strength of our teams,"" said Tom Staggs, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, in a statement.

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/elsentinel/deportes/fl-es-sochi-olimpiadas-amenazas-actualiza-1-20140122-story.html","Comités Olímpicos europeos reciben amenazas terroristas antes de Sochi","LIUBLIANA/BERLIN/ROMA, 22 ene (Reuters) - Los comités olímpicos de Eslovenia, Hungría, Alemania e Italia recibieron amenazas terroristas por carta y vía correo electrónico relacionadas con los próximos Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno en Sochi, dijeron el miércoles autoridades.

El Comité Olímpico Italiano dijo el miércoles en un comunicado que recibió un correo electrónico con ""amenazas terroristas"" sobre el evento que se llevará a cabo el mes que viene en la ciudad rusa y que envió su contenido a las autoridades a cargo de la seguridad.

Por su parte, el Comité Olímpico Alemán manifestó que también recibió un correo electrónico con amenazas y que fue enviado a las autoridades germanas.

""Estamos en cercano contacto con las autoridades alemanas relevantes"", dijo el portavoz del comité germano Christian Klaue a Reuters en un correo electrónico.

Horas antes, el Comité Olímpico Esloveno informó que había recibido una carta con una amenaza terrorista sobre los Juegos en Sochi.

""El comité ha recibido una carta con una amenaza terrorista escrita en ruso. La hemos traducido y entregado a la policía"", dijo a Reuters el portavoz de la entidad eslovena Brane Dmitrovic.

En tanto, el Comité Olímpico Húngaro también notificó que había recibido una carta, pero luego dijo que la amenaza contra sus atletas fue analizada y declarada no peligrosa.

El director de Relaciones Internacionales del comité, Zsigmond Nagy, dijo a Reuters en una entrevista que la carta fue enviada al Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) y a los organizadores de los Juegos, que la analizaron.

""Tanto el COI como el comité organizador de Sochi (…) declararon oficialmente tras el análisis de la carta que esta amenaza no es real, y que esta persona ha enviado todo tipo de mensajes a varios miembros de la familia olímpica"", dijo Nagy.

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/elsentinel/deportes/fl-es-olimpicos-putin-inspecciones-20140103-story.html","Putin, vestido de esquiador, inicia inspecciones para Sochi 2014","MOSCU, 3 ene (Reuters) - El presidente de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, comenzó a inspeccionar el viernes los recintos donde se realizarán los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno en el centro turístico de Sochi, cinco semanas antes del inicio de un evento que ha sido criticado por grupos de derechos humanos y que ha generado preocupaciones de seguridad.

En imágenes difundidas por el canal de televisión estatal Rossiya-24, Putin, de 61 años, fue mostrado esquiando con lentes oscuros y casco.

En el lugar, el mandatario y el primer ministro Dmitry Medvedev se reunieron con sorprendidos atletas e inspeccionaron hoteles.

Un portavoz afirmó que Putin inspeccionará todos los recintos olímpicos ""en detalle"" durante los próximos días y que observará un ensayo de la ceremonia de apertura.

El éxito o fracaso de los Juegos será gran parte del legado de Putin, quien se ha identificado estrechamente con el proyecto de 50.000 millones de dólares desde que viajó a Guatemala en el 2007 para persuadir a los dirigentes olímpicos a otorgar a Sochi la organización de los Juegos de Invierno.

Los preparativos para el evento han estado marcados por problemas recientes. Dos atentados con bomba acabaron con la vida de 34 personas esta semana en Volgogrado, a unos 700 kilómetros al noreste de Sochi, destacando la amenaza de insurgentes islamistas que han prometido interrumpir los Juegos.

El Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) ha dicho que no le cabe dudas de que las autoridades rusas podrán entregar seguridad.

Moscú ha recibido fuertes críticas por su historial de derechos humanos y por una ley que prohíbe la difusión de ""propaganda homosexual"" entre menores, algo que activistas y gobiernos occidentales afirman que viola las libertades básicas.

En una medida para mitigar las críticas antes de los Juegos, Putin dejó en libertad el mes pasado a través de una amnistía a varios de los presos más conocidos del país: el ex magnate petrolero Mikhail Khodorkovsky y a dos miembros del grupo punk femenino Pussy Riot.

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/celebrity/la-et-ms-john-lurie-jazz-20140204-story.html","John Lurie re-emerges with 'Invention of Animals'","Looking back from the fragmented media landscape of 2014, it's hard to imagine someone like John Lurie was ever possible.

An immediately recognizable character actor who appeared in landmark indie films including Jim Jarmusch's ""Down by Law"" and ""Stranger Than Paradise,"" Lurie was also a brilliant saxophonist who helped push the boundaries of jazz in the '80s and '90s with his band, the Lounge Lizards.

But Lurie was forced to give up music and acting after being stricken with advanced Lyme disease and has since switched to painting (his work has been exhibited numerous times and was collected in a 2007 book, ""A Fine Example of Art"").

PHOTOS: Best jazz albums of 2013 | Chris Barton

Lurie's low profile in recent years is also because of significant trouble with a stalker — a situation that was examined in a 2010 New Yorker profile (the facts of which Lurie has vigorously disputed).

Still, he recently ventured back into the public eye with ""The Invention of Animals,"" a new set of live tracks and rarities by the John Lurie National Orchestra, his trio with drummers Calvin Weston and Billy Martin of Medeski Martin and Wood. Here, The Times catches up with Lurie with an email exchange.

You were diagnosed with advanced Lyme disease in 2004 and have fought health problems relating to it as far back as 2000. How's your health these days?

My health is pretty good these days, but then out of nowhere I get whacked with it from time to time. For an hour or a day or for three weeks. But I am so much better than I was. When it comes back, I am astonished at how hideous it is and that I lived with it for years. There is always something going on with it, and it is nuts because the symptoms migrate, but I am pretty adept at living with it now.

I swim and paint every day, which I never thought would be possible 10 years ago.

PHOTOS: Faces to watch 2014 | Pop music & jazz

Does it still prevent you from playing any music at all? Is there any chance of improvement?

I can play the guitar. I can play the harmonica. But I don't so much. All of my creative energy goes to painting now.

If I play, I start to get ideas. Then I want to actualize the ideas. But then I would need to ... [do] all that other unpleasant stuff that goes around making a musical idea into something people can listen to — this I am not prepared to deal with. So ideas have to be stopped at all costs.

Given the breadth of your recordings, this trio is an interesting choice to revisit with ""The Invention of Animals."" What inspired you to come back to that project?

My hero assistant Nesrin wanted to hear music of mine she hadn't heard yet. I remembered that trio concert in Thessaloniki [Greece] to be something special and I put on the tape for her. I was shocked by the power of it. It was like standing inside a waterfall. So when Billy wanted to rerelease the ""Men With Sticks"" record on his label, I thought — no, let's put this other stuff out instead.

INTERACTIVE: Times music staff best of 2013 list

I read where Billy Martin talked about an idea you guys shared that this music is like ""a field recording from a lost civilization."" I hear a lot of African and tribal-sounding rhythms there — was this band put together to delve deeper into that style?

I don't hear this as so African sounding. To me it seems to fall somewhere between Ravi Shankar and Coltrane. And please, I don't need 9,000 angry bloggers saying, ""John Lurie thinks he is Coltrane"" — I am just saying stylistically that is the terrain that it falls in for me. Though that wasn't the intention when we did it, I am just hearing that now on revisiting it.

It seems strange now, but a lot of pains were taken by some in the '80s and '90s to place your music outside jazz (the terms ""punk-jazz,"" ""no-wave"" and whatnot). Did that bother you? Or did you appreciate that divide?

You know, partly I think it was the humor. And partly it was that I was in movies. And we did start out as a punk jazz band and, almost unfortunately, we got a lot of attention. As the music became more serious and more elegant, more beautiful, I think those people you speak of refused to look at it. They thought they already knew what it was and it was no good. At the time, it did bother me because it would have opened some doors for us.

CRITICS' PICKS: What to watch, where to go, what to eat

Being a percussion and saxophone trio, this project is a real showcase for your playing, which to me still sounds like nobody else. As you guys were coming together, was there a sense of finding something new here?

It allowed me to play and concentrate on the playing without all the headaches that go with running a nine-piece band. (""What do you mean you forgot your passport?"")

Is there an archive of material from the Lounge Lizards or Marvin Pontiac that could also see release?

Yes, that is possible.

GRAPHIC: Faces to watch 2014 | Entertainment

To broach an uncomfortable subject, your safety seemed very much in doubt years ago. Given you're a bit more in the public eye of late, has that situation improved?

The situation is in no way resolved. It still is altering my life. I am kind of used to it at this point.

You — and many who know you —- were very vocal about being misrepresented in that New Yorker piece, to the point where I'm a bit surprised you're willing to do any press at all. Is there anything you've never gotten a chance to clarify from that time that you'd like to now?

I would very much like to address the horrors of that New Yorker article and the incredible damage that it needlessly did to my life but can't imagine you have room for that here.

What one would hope is that the beauty in the music and in the paintings can somehow transcend and invalidate the kind of sickness that led to the article being written as it was and the kind of irresponsibility that allowed it to be published.","2014-02-04 08:45:00","0","44.0","17.0","3.0","0.0","26.0","0.0","46.0","18.0","0.0","85.0","4.0","18.0","0","1078","60.72","56.64","46.67","62.70","17.39","17.07","86.46","55.84","16.23","7.61","3.99","0.46","2.23","0.74","0.19","8.53","6.40","15.03","8.53","5.38","6.49","1.48","15.58","4.08","2.41","1.86","1.39","2.78","5.38","3.62","1.67","0.28","0.37","0.19","6.68","0.00","0.19","0.19","0.83","12.15","3.25","1.39","1.30","3.71","1.21","2.23","3.99","1.30","2.32","0.28","1.86","0.37","1.39","0.00","0.09","4.36","0.93","1.11","1.21","1.21","0.56","5.29","8.91","0.65","13.08","1.86","6.12","5.57","1.11","4.08","0.28","0.19","0.09","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.00","15.86","4.82","3.53","0.46","0.00","1.11","0.00","0.46","2.04","1.95","0.74","0.74","4595","6.68","17.983606557377048","1436","1083","62","79.09","9.4","6.6","8.29","8.3","149","17.333333333333332","14.503231763619576","479","16.44","39","0.53","0","42","19","103","0","136","55","1","1","11","140","80","1","33","1","0","94","15","66","4","0","4","40","0","52","52","24","24","39","29","10","9","0","7"
"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/careers/fl-construction-training-20141113-story.html","Construction workers in growing demand","As South Florida's construction business rebounds after years on its knees, Delray Beach-based Meisner Electric is looking to beef up its workforce. Currently it employs 200 electricians – average age is 40 -- and with new projects on the horizon, more will be needed.

That's easier said than done, according to Doug Hutchison, the company's chief financial officer. Turns out there just aren't that many young people who want to be electricians, or carpenters, or concrete finishers, or heavy equipment operators.

""Young people would rather run a mouse than a backhoe,"" Hutchison said. ""Construction is dirty, demanding and dangerous. They're going to sweat and it's demanding because we work on deadlines and schedules.""

A growing shortage of young construction workers is occurring as new projects gain steam.

To ensure they'll have the manpower, contractors and trade associations are creating new training and apprenticeship programs and expanding existing ones.

""Right now the supply is falling short of demand,"" said Andy Allen, project director in South Florida for Skanska USA, one of the state's largest building and heavy civil construction firms.

Skanska is paying 10 percent more than last year for skilled tradesmen, especially plumbers, electricians, carpenters and sheet-metal workers, Allen said.

Construction employment in Broward rose by 2.3 percent to 35,400 and in Palm Beach County by 9.5 percent to 30,000 in September over a year ago. Miami-Dade County, with its boom in condominium construction, increased by 12.8 percent to about 39,600 construction jobs in September.

And the construction sector is expected to be the South Florida metro region's fastest-growing industry, with employment expanding an average of 10 percent annually, according to University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith.

In a survey released in October by The Associated General Contractors, 46 percent of Florida contractors said they were having difficulty filling skilled trade positions and more than 80 percent rated the pipeline for training available as ""poor"" or ""below average.""

Allen said his firm often has to hire two workers instead of one to complete a job, such as installing electric conduits, on schedule.

""A lot of people who are coming into [the industry] just don't have that base of experience or training,"" Allen said.

Many construction workers left South Florida because work dwindled during the recession and housing crisis. Some took jobs in the oil industry while others drifted into other fields altogether.

And as demand shriveled, so did the training and apprenticeship programs that employers depended upon to turn out new generations of workers.

The Associated General Contractors Florida East Coast Chapter shut down its training program during the housing bust because so many skilled trade workers were thrown out of work and weren't available to serve as mentors, said Michelle Anaya DePotter, the chapter's executive director. Apprentices need hands-on work, and there just wasn't enough available.

But recently, the AGC chapter partnered with Florida Training Services to bring back Palm Beach County's apprenticeship program. Florida Training Services offers training in iron work, painting, glazing, sheet-metal work and other trades.

Ernesto Jurarez knows the value of training programs. In 2010, Jurarez enrolled at ABC Institute, the training arm of Associated Builders and Contractors in Coconut Creek, and learned advanced skills in heating, ventilation and air conditioning.

Today, Juarez runs his own business, Innovative Cooling Technologies in Fort Lauderdale, and teaches part-time at ABC Institute. When he needs new workers for his own company, he hires his best students. After all, he's well-acquainted with their teacher.

""I teach them what needs to be done, the right way,"" Juarez said.

The institute currently is training 370 people for construction jobs. That's up from 280 a year ago but still well below the 1,528 enrolled at the height of the construction boom a decade ago, said Ruth Tirado, vice president of training and education.

Some companies are investing in their employees by covering tuition for training programs and paying them to log on-the-job training.

Meisner Electric in Delray Beach sponsors 21 apprentices at the institute and at Florida Electrical Apprenticeship Association in West Palm Beach, said Doug Hutchison, Meisner Electric's chief financial officer.

Meisner had scaled back to about 200 electricians when business fell off in 2010. But with new projects in the pipeline, it needs more qualified workers.

Meisner's apprentices go to night school for four years while working for Meisner during the day. Then they are required to pass a state test to obtain their journeyman's license.

""They want a really good career and a good-paying job,"" Hutchison said.

Once licensed, an electrical journeyman's average wage is $20 to $25 an hour, he said. Those workers can advance into supervisory positions, which can further increase their pay.

For those who like to work with their hands, it can be ""engaging and exciting work,"" he said.

Retailer opens in Delray Beach

Discount retailer Stein Mart has a new store in Delray Beach.

Stein Mart sells brand name apparel, shoes and accessories for men and women at up to 60 percent below department store prices. The retailer also stocks home décor, linens and pet care products.

The new 33,000-square-foot store will open at Delray Place, a new shopping at the southeast corner of Federal Highway and Linton Boulevard. The new shopping plaza is also home to a Trader Joe's grocery store.

The Jacksonville-based retailer says the Delray Beach shop is part of the company's largest store expansion since 2007. In May, another Stein Mart opened in Aventura in Miami-Dade County at a space vacated by fashion retailer Loehmann's.

The South Florida locations were chosen as part of a national growth strategy to increase store counts in key markets, Stein Mart said.

The Delray Beach store is the retailer's ninth store in South Florida.

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/os-florida-bar-warns-attorneys-of-hotel-scam-20140421-post.html","Florida Bar warns attorneys of hotel scam","Here’s a ‘man bites dog’ item: The Florida Bar, the state’s professional organization for lawyers, says attorneys are the target of a scam.

I’ve written a lot about lawyers in Florida over the years, and usually it’s the lawyers warning consumers about scams.

This time the bar says there’s a “booking scam” for attorneys who are attending their 2014 Annual Convention on June 25-28. The convention is at the Gaylord Palms Resort near Kissimmee, and apparently someone is contacting attorneys about booking them into the resort.

“It has come to The Florida Bar's attention that housing companies going by the names National Travel Associates, Exhibition Housing Management, Exhibition Housing Services, (and) Global Travel Partners (USA) are claiming to have a relationship with Gaylord Palms Resort and are offering hotel reservation services for The Florida Bar's 2014 Annual Convention,” the Bar said. “These companies, and others like them, are NOT in any way affiliated with The Florida Bar or the Gaylord Palms and should NOT be used to make hotel reservations.”

According to the Bar, the only official agent for rooms at the resort is the Gaylord Palms itself, which does not make phone calls to exhibitors or attendees encouraging them to book with them.

Atttorneys are encouraged to book rooms through a special website set up by the Bar and the resort.","2014-04-21 15:23:00","0","12.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","29.0","16.0","0.0","73.0","4.0","14.0","0","223","94.77","65.69","13.38","50.91","27.88","27.35","78.92","47.09","7.17","2.69","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.24","4.48","12.11","13.90","7.62","3.59","4.04","1.35","13.00","0.90","0.45","0.90","1.79","0.90","2.24","1.79","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.52","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.45","7.17","0.45","1.35","0.45","3.14","0.00","2.69","1.79","0.00","1.79","0.00","4.48","1.79","0.00","0.00","2.69","6.73","3.14","0.00","3.14","0.00","0.45","1.35","10.76","0.45","11.21","2.24","6.28","2.69","8.07","6.28","2.24","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.39","3.59","5.38","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.45","3.14","3.59","1.79","0.00","1100","8.71","32.857142857142854","342","222","8","51.72","15.6","13.0","13.06","16.8","52","8.3","22.48936936936937","130","27.43","4","0.47","0","9","4","30","0","24","4","0","0","1","30","41","2","21","0","0","8","1","5","0","0","1","7","0","4","2","9","6","7","11","1","1","0","0"

This Florida native shrub produces delicate lilac blooms that attract butterflies through August. In the fall, it's a feast for birds, as pea-sized, magenta-colored berries ripen in dense clusters along the length of weeping branches.

Beautyberry is a rambler with an informal look. Spring and summer green foliage has ovate leaves with serrated edges growing 4 to 8 inches. In fall, leaves turn yellow. The plant is deciduous, dropping its leaves in winter.

Give this shrub some space. It grows 3 to 8 feet tall and as wide. For a more compact presentation, prune hard in spring before it flowers.

July Garden Checklist

Gardening in July is not for the faint of heart. In fact, if you do garden in July, you might faint in the choking heat. Instead, pour yourself a tall glass of iced tea and read up on creating a more Florida-friendly landscape that will attract butterflies and birds, with help from the state and the Florida Wildflower Foundation.

Download it: “The Florida Yards & Neighborhoods Handbook,” a free, downloadable 50-page guide from the University of Florida/IFAS Extension Service and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, explains the environmental benefits of using plants suited to our zone 10 conditions. It has a chapter devoted to plant and tree selection and offers useful information on watering, fertilizing, mulching and attracting wildlife. Info: Download it at SunSentinel.com/FloridaYards.

Identify it: If you don't know a zebra longwing from a cloudless sulphur, then take a look at the online brochure identifying some of our state's most common butterflies and native plants from the nonprofit Florida Wildflower Foundation (FlaWildflowers.org). The downloadable PDF explains the four life stages of native butterflies and identifies almost 100 species and native plants. Info: SunSentinel.com/FloridaButterflies.

Water it: Don't. We're in the thick of rainy season. If it's 3 p.m., it's likely storming outside. Give your irrigation system a well-earned rest and turn the timer off. Use the sprinklers if it doesn't rain for a few days, around November.

Mulch it: Further conserve water by applying several inches of mulch around plants to keep moisture in and choke out weeds. Keep it 1 to 2 inches from plant stems and leaves.","2014-07-01 00:00:00","0","30.0","21.0","3.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","34.0","15.0","0.0","71.0","4.0","15.0","0","461","95.20","63.58","40.27","66.81","17.07","26.68","67.46","36.44","6.29","1.95","0.00","0.65","1.30","0.00","0.00","4.34","7.16","13.67","3.69","1.52","5.42","1.08","8.89","4.56","1.95","0.00","2.39","2.60","4.34","3.04","0.87","0.00","0.22","0.22","4.12","0.22","0.65","0.00","0.00","7.16","2.82","1.08","0.87","2.39","0.43","1.52","3.47","1.30","0.00","0.43","3.90","0.43","1.30","0.00","2.17","3.47","1.74","0.43","0.87","0.65","0.22","0.43","7.38","0.65","16.05","2.17","9.98","3.47","3.25","1.08","1.30","0.87","0.00","0.00","0.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.65","0.00","22.78","7.59","4.34","4.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.17","0.43","1.95","0.87","1.30","2232","8.36","16.962962962962962","670","435","28","64.2","12.1","8.2","14.09","12.1","109","4.777777777777778","18.222988505747125","280","15.81","2","0.38","4","17","11","38","0","59","36","0","0","3","75","70","0","39","0","0","21","4","10","2","1","2","6","0","11","5","12","6","10","18","2","0","0","0"

Solidago sempervirens, known as seaside goldenrod, makes a terrific addition to ornamental flower beds and butterfly gardens.

This low-maintenance plant likes full sun and is often used in coastal dune restoration projects. That means it is highly salt-tolerant, thriving on oceanside balconies. Seaside goldenrod is somewhat drought-tolerant after it is established.

Give this cheerful bloomer room to grow. In the ground, plants can reach 6 feet tall.

In the fall, it is a food source for migrating Monarch butterflies.

This native groundcover keeps a low profile, going by the aliases powderpuff or sunshine mimosa. It's ideal for South Florida gardens because it thrives in the sun — producing cute, cotton ball-sized blooms that emerge from a fast-growing dense carpet of fern-like leaves.

Powderpuff mimosa may be pink, but it's no pansy.

This sun-lover thrives on neglect, is drought-tolerant, attracts butterflies, withstands light foot traffic and can even be mowed. The Florida Nursery, Growers and Landscape Association named it a ""plant of the year"" in 2008.

These attributes make it a terrific replacement for St. Augustine turf because it can be planted in stubborn areas where grass just refuses to grow.

Mimosa's most interesting characteristic: its delicate-looking leaves, which are sensitive to touch. They fold up when handled.

May garden checklist

National Hurricane Preparedness Week starts May 25. Trimming trees is No. 1 on the list of May gardening chores.

Trim it

Dense canopies catch and hold wind like an umbrella. Trimming helps protect surrounding houses and cars from damage, and can help keep a tree from being uprooted. With hurricane season starting June 1, take the time to inspect for damaged or weak branches. Only trim one-third of a tree at one time, or hire an ISA (International Society of Arboriculture) certified arborist.

Another important tip: Always look up before you trim. Florida Power & Light Co. recommends you ""never attempt to trim any vegetation growing near power lines."" Info: FPL.com/Trees, 800-226-3545

Grow it

It may be hot out, but you can still grow edibles. Consider planting an herb garden. Herbs thrive year-round here in Zone 10b and do especially well in containers. Basil, oregano, rosemary and chives are especially easy to grow from seeds.

Download a six-page guide to growing herbs in South Florida from the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension. Info: SunSentinel.com/Herbs.

Water it

May is a critical watering month before the rainy season gets underway in June. New growth and pests put stress on plants, so be sure your irrigation system is in top working order.

March garden checklist

Spring has sprung early in South Florida, as usual. And there's much you could be doing out in the garden. So put these chores on your March to-do list.

Feed it: Fertilize palms, trees, shrubs and lawns. Get help in choosing the appropriate fertilizer at your local garden center.

Prune it: Give ornamental grasses and frost-damaged plants a trim. Prune trees and shrubs when new growth begins.

Kill it: Aphids, spider mites, thrips, scale, mealy bugs and spiral whitefly may be feasting on tender new growth. Try nonchemical control first by blasting undersides of leaves and stems with a garden hose. Or, try a homemade mixture of 2 tablespoons each of liquid dishwashing detergent and vegetable oil mixed into a gallon of water. Add to a spray bottle and thoroughly saturate infested plants. Reapply as needed.

Plant it: Start warm-season crops like corn, watermelon, cucumber and peppers now.

Left­-hander Scott Barnes, who was acquired by the Orioles last month from the Cleveland Indians for cash, was claimed off waivers by the Texas Rangers, while infielder Steve Lombardozzi (Atholton) and left-hander Pat McCoy cleared waivers and were outrighted to Triple-A Norfolk.

Barnes and McCoy had both been added to the Orioles’ 40-man roster this offseason to improve depth in the bullpen.

Barnes, 27, was acquired two weeks ago after he was designated for assignment by Cleveland. He didn't pitch in the major leagues in 2014, going 3­-2 with a 3.69 ERA in 31 2/3 innings with Triple-A Columbus.

Barnes held right-handed hitters to a .194 average and lefties to a .191 clip. He pitched 27 2/3 total innings for the Indians in 2012 and 2013, with a 5.20 ERA.

Lombardozzi, 26, played in 20 games for the Orioles and 78 at Norfolk this past season. The club acquired him from the Detroit Tigers in March for veteran infielder Alex Gonzalez.

Lombardozzi batted .270 with 30 RBIs and only 10 extra-base hits for the Tides in 2014. He hit .288 with two RBIs in 73 at-bats in the major leagues.

McCoy, 26, was claimed off waivers by the Orioles on Oct. 31. He split the 2014 season between the major leagues, Triple-A Toledo and Double-A Erie.

In 14 games for the Tigers, he had a 3.86 ERA with 11 strikeouts and 13 walks in 14 innings. McCoy was 1-0 with a 3.95 ERA in nine appearances for Erie, and he was 2-0 with a 2.59 ERA in 21 games for Toledo.

The Orioles needed to clear at least one spot on their 40-man roster during the winter meetings because they plan to make a selection in Thursday's Rule 5 draft.

November's plant of the month also is Florida's official wildflower.

This sunny-faced bloomer produces abundant 1-inch yellow blooms with chocolate centers. As with most natives, it attracts butterflies, requires low maintenance and gives garden beds an informal, natural look.

It's easy to grow from seed (there are more than 100 varieties) and great for cut-flower bouquets. Plants reseed yearly, lasting several seasons.

Coreopsis is an annual, but happily blooms all year in South Florida. It thrives in moist soil (not wet) in sunny spots.

November garden checklist

Here’s a look at your gardening tasks for November.

Plant it: It’s time to get annuals and veggies such as tomatoes in the ground.

Treat it: The dry season brings mites, slugs, snails, mealy bug and scale. Beetles and weevils, which lay eggs in the soil now, can be treated with beneficial nematodes. Other organic controls include Neem Oil sprayed on leaf undersides. Bayer Advanced Tree & Shrub Protect & Feed will offer protection for about eight months but should only be used in extreme situations. Do not use near water.

Water it: It’s time to turn on the sprinkler system again. Inspect heads and pipes for good coverage.

Buy it: The Fort Lauderdale Garden Club’s plant sale will be from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Nov. 8-9 at the club’s headquarters inside Birch State Park, 3109 E. Sunrise Blvd. Also, the club is having its general meeting at 10 a.m. Nov. 14, with a presentation on honey bees. Info: FLGC.org, 954-561-8475.

If I brush up against them, I feel like I am on fire. What are they and how can they be controlled?

Answer: Going barefoot is not going to be fun when your lawn is full of burning nettle that's becoming a common cool-season weed in local landscapes. The leaves and stems have toxic sap that causes the burning sensation when it touches the skin. A soothing cream helps most gardeners, but it would still be good to eliminate this weed.

Broadleaf weed killers made for your lawn type usually give good control following label instructions. It's best if the weeds are treated when small to eliminate them before they become a hazard. Since this is a cool-season weed, remember to check next fall for signs of the seedlings and make the needed treatments. The weeds can also be dug or pulled from the lawn but only when wearing protective gloves and clothing.

Q: Our banana plants grew to 15 feet tall and even though we did not have a freeze, the leaves are brown back to the trunk that still has some green. How far back do I cut them back?

A: Here is some good news for your devastated plants. They could recover to produce a crop of bananas this year. As you noted, banana plants do not like the cold and any temperature below 40 degrees seems to turn them yellow to brown.

Cut the old leaves back to the trunk. Yes, this is going to leave a rocket-looking plant but just maybe the bud inside the trunk can produce a bunch of new leaves before sending out a flower bud. If this occurs by early summer, you are going to get a crop. Keep the soil moist and feed lightly but monthly March through November with a general garden fertilizer.

Q. Our muhly grass turns pink in the fall and has whitish portions the rest of the year. When should it be pruned and what about feedings?

A. Pruning time for all ornamental grass is during February or early March. Since muhly grass is one of the shorter-growing types, it can be pruned to within 6 inches of the ground. Taller grasses are often left a foot or so higher.

Muhly grass does have the attractive pink-to-purple flowers during the fall that are followed by the whitish stem portions. It is best to remove these portions during pruning. After pruning, give the plantings a light feeding with a general landscape or turf fertilizer. Feedings can be repeated in May and August.

Q. I have a St. Augustine lawn and would like to change it to a ground cover without a lot of digging. The area is a shady spot. What should I do?

A. Consider Asiatic jasmine for this spot, as this ground cover can grow in the shade to full-sun locations. It is low-growing, drought-tolerant once established and competes well with tree roots. Perhaps the easiest way to establish the ground cover is to use Roundup or a similar product that allows planting a week or so after use to control the existing vegetation. Then when the unwanted greenery declines, mow the area to within an inch or two of the ground and plant the ground cover. A very light mulch can be added. Keep the new plantings moist and apply a light feeding every other month until established.

Q. I have been told oak leaves falling on our lawn are causing the soil pH to become acid. Will putting lime on the grass help?

A. It's true decomposing oak leaves over time could make the soil more acid. This change does not occur quickly and depends on the type of soil in your yard. Some soils resist pH changes and the leaves may have little effect. Perhaps it's best to have your soil tested at your local garden center or University of Florida Extension Office to determine the pH. Then, if it's becoming too acid, lime could be applied to make recommended adjustments.

Q. A lot of moss is growing on the bushes around our house. Is there a product that removes it without harming the plants?

A. Controlling the moss is easy but trying to find out why it's flourishing could be a bit harder. Moss is a term many gardeners use when referring to lichens, algae, Spanish moss and ball moss that usually do not harm plants but makes good growth when the trees and shrubs are declining due to other causes.

A copper fungicide can be applied as instructed on the label for your plant type and the moss usually declines over time. Regretfully the plants you are trying to grow may not make better growth. If moss is growing better than the plants, look for other pests or cultural problems that may be causing the decline.","2014-03-08 15:02:00","0","22.0","13.0","3.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","31.0","15.0","0.0","72.0","4.0","15.0","0","835","78.74","49.04","60.75","43.20","13.92","16.53","81.32","50.06","8.38","3.95","1.20","0.60","1.20","0.00","0.96","4.43","10.06","11.98","10.42","4.55","7.19","0.84","15.45","6.11","2.63","1.68","0.72","1.80","3.83","2.40","1.44","0.00","0.24","0.36","4.07","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","14.01","1.68","4.07","2.04","4.55","0.36","4.07","3.83","1.44","0.00","1.92","1.92","0.60","0.24","0.00","1.08","5.63","1.08","1.08","2.99","1.32","0.48","1.32","11.50","1.32","17.72","4.67","6.59","6.71","1.80","0.96","0.84","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.12","0.00","11.50","6.47","2.04","0.48","0.00","0.72","0.00","1.08","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.00","3595","6.91","15.035714285714286","1089","827","52","80.72","9.1","6.0","8.52","7.7","130","7.166666666666666","14.647787182587667","387","14.23","22","0.47","0","35","5","95","0","75","60","4","2","19","141","35","0","52","1","0","34","12","37","1","1","4","30","0","51","8","33","19","27","39","8","3","0","10"
"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/home-garden/os-plant-doctor-tom-maccubbin-1011-20141011-column.html","White powder points to mealy bugs as culprits for hibiscus' lost leaves","Question: Our hibiscus has white powder-like stuff on the stems and leaves. An insecticidal soap spray helped but it is back and leaves are dropping. What should we do?

Answer: One of the most common insect pests of hibiscus is mealy bugs. They are hidden in a white coating that may also have a cottony look. Mealy bugs cover the stems, get into the leaf clusters and encase the new buds. These insects suck juices from the plants and reduce their vigor, and that can lead to leaf drop.

Insecticidal soap is one good control but you have to hit the insects, and repeat applications are usually needed each time the mealy bugs appear. Horticultural oil sprays also give control and are used in a similar manner. Perhaps the best and longest-lasting control is a systemic insecticide applied as a spray or to the soil. Several brands are available at local garden centers and should be applied following label instructions.

Q: Fall has arrived and I am wondering what I should do about my poinsettias, gardenias and azaleas. Do they need a feeding at this time?

A: One thing for sure, pruning time is over for all these plants if you want seasonal blooms. Cutting them back now would interfere with their flowering process. But, it is time for a good feeding.

Fall is the last time to make a fertilizer application for this year. Use any general landscape fertilizer. It would be good to pick one with slow-release properties that can feed the plants for several months. Keep the soil moist and maintain mulches to help control weeds and stretch the time between waterings.

Q: Over the years my Floratam St. Augustinegrass has grown runners over each other and the lawn is so high it is scalped by the mower. Is there a machine to reduce the thickness of the grass?

A: Thick and usually spongy lawns have many causes but those most common includes improper soil acidity, use of preemergence herbicides, too much water and excessive fertilizer. Start by having the soil acidity tested and adjust if needed. Preemergence herbicides often used to control crabgrass can keep the runners from rooting down. If this is the case, you might skip their use or try another product.

By far the most common cause of spongy turf is too good a care that promotes excessive growth. Check to make sure the lawn is being watered only when the turf starts to dry. Also, limit feedings to two to three times a year. The only control for an overgrown lawn is sanding to fill in the voids between the runners or installing new sod. There is no mechanical way to help the overgrown turf that wouldn't devastate your lawn.

Q: My lawn has chinch bugs and I have used several of the common sprays to obtain control. I have switched between the products but they have stopped working. Are these pesticide-resistant chinch bugs?

A: It's likely, as many residents and pest control companies are discovering pesticide-resistant chinch bugs in St. Augustine lawns. These pests have become resistant to the generally available pyrethroid-containing insecticides. Products offering a different type of insecticide to control chinch bugs include the Green Light Chinch Bug Killer with Arena and the Bayer 24 hour Grub Killer Plus. Not all garden centers carry these products so you may have to check with several retailers to find what you need. When using either of these products follow the label carefully for chinch bug control.

Q: I have a large sago that is covering the ground with foliage. Can I cut the bottom leaves off without damaging the plant?

A: Many gardeners like to keep the area under their sagos free of foliage to expose portions of their trunks. Most of these lower leaves are older and are shaded by other foliage higher up on the trunks. Also, leaves hidden within the plant often harbor mealybugs and scale insects. Removing several layers of foliage allows better air drainage that seems to help prevent pests.

Q: The tips of the leaves on my indoor corn plant turn brown. What can I do to correct the problem?

A: Brown tips at the ends of plant foliage often indicate a cultural problem. Check for adequate light and water. The corn plant, a type of dracaena, prefers bright light but no direct sun. Also keep the soil moist by watering when the surface becomes dry to the touch. Avoid areas directly in front of air vents to prevent rapid drying. Feed every other month with house or container plant fertilizer. If the brown tips continue, make sure the plant has a large enough container.","2014-10-11 15:24:00","0","21.0","13.0","3.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","31.0","15.0","0.0","72.0","4.0","15.0","0","786","86.06","46.44","26.89","20.03","14.04","20.61","78.75","45.42","7.76","3.56","1.40","0.25","0.76","0.00","1.15","4.20","9.41","11.70","8.27","3.44","6.36","0.64","13.10","5.34","2.29","0.89","0.89","2.67","3.69","1.65","2.04","0.13","1.15","0.25","3.05","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.85","1.15","3.94","2.29","3.69","1.02","2.80","3.05","1.78","0.00","0.89","1.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.53","7.63","0.64","1.15","4.83","1.27","0.89","1.27","11.07","0.38","14.25","2.93","6.36","4.83","2.67","0.89","0.76","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.13","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.58","6.36","1.91","1.53","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","3613","7.26","14.592592592592593","1094","780","55","73.98","9.8","6.5","9.85","8.2","144","5.4375","15.064615384615387","387","13.94","17","0.43","0","33","7","90","0","69","75","4","4","13","134","36","1","68","1","0","22","10","26","2","3","2","25","0","44","4","20","17","32","32","6","4","0","3"

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-fish-enforcement-reaction-20141210-story.html","U.S. enforcement changes raise concern over seafood fraud","With seafood fraud a continuing problem in Maryland and across the nation, environmentalists, fishermen and lawmakers are expressing concern about a decline in the number of special investigative agents and enforcement cases at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Changes at the agency, which is responsible for protecting fishery resources in federal waters, could make it more difficult to investigate complex cases involving seafood that is mislabeled or caught in violation of quotas, they said, responding to the findings of a Baltimore Sun investigation.

The declines are ""really troubling to see when we have these issues of illegal fish and seafood fraud,"" said Beth Lowell, campaign director at Oceana, a conservation group that has found high levels of seafood fraud across the U.S. ""You can't put one guy on a boat and expect to find a problem. To get a reduction of illegal fishing and seafood fraud, you need to be able to track a network of criminal activity.""

Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, who chairs the Appropriations Committee, noted that President Obama has asked several federal agencies, including NOAA, to develop a plan for cracking down on seafood fraud and black-market fishing. That task force is expected to release recommendations this week.

Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement, ""As the President moves ahead with his task force on combating seafood fraud I will be looking to see how NOAA's resources are best used to balance domestic fisheries enforcement — which are important for keeping our national fisheries sustainable — with that of the important work of investigating cases of international seafood fraud.""

Seafood fraud is a widespread and lucrative enterprise. About 25 percent of all wild-caught seafood imports are part of the illicit trade, according to a study published this year in the journal Marine Policy. Those illegal imports are worth $1.3 billion to $2.1 billion annually across the United States, the world's second-largest importer of seafood.

The Sun found that the number of NOAA special agents who specialize in complex investigations has been cut by more than a third, from 147 to 93, since 2008, with further cuts in the works. Enforcement cases nationwide have fallen even further, according to records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Since 2008, the number of civil and criminal cases sent to the agency's general counsel and U.S. attorneys plunged from 793 to 215 — a drop of nearly 75 percent.

Michele Kuruc, vice president of Marine Policy at World Wildlife Fund, said she considers the president's initiative, announced in June, a monumental opportunity not seen in her 30-year career. But she's worried about changes at NOAA in recent years.

""You have a concern when you see precipitous drop"" in enforcement cases said Kuruc, a former fisheries lawyer at NOAA. ""Cases are an important piece of data to look at when you try to understand the bigger picture of enforcement.""

Mikulski wrote Obama in July, asking the administration to probe the fraudulent mislabeling of seafood as Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic blue crab meat. Her letter, which was also signed by other legislators in the region, said some businesses are importing foreign crabmeat, repackaging it and selling it as the more expensive product.

Crab fraud is a particular concern for Mid-Atlantic watermen and the industry.

Maryland Watermen's Association President Robert Brown said he was concerned about the lack of federal forces to investigate seafood fraud, which is hurting law-abiding companies in the domestic crab industry.

""It started up over the last few years because of the high price and limited availability of Maryland crab,"" Brown said. ""It's limited, but it's false advertising.""

Brown's colleague Jack Brooks, president of the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association, wrote to the Obama administration in August that he was concerned about imported crab being illegally repackaged and relabeled.

Brown said that while he's worried about the decline of NOAA officers who may investigate such crime, he's also concerned about the drop in Maryland patrol officers who protect the Chesapeake's prized crabs and oysters. The number of patrol officers at the Maryland Natural Resources Police has fallen significantly since 2008, according to the agency.

Bob Jones, executive director of the Southeastern Fisheries Association, said he's seen the same kind of fraud in the Southeast, with companies selling foreign catfish costing $3 per pound as more expensive grouper costing at least $7 per pound. He worries about limited federal enforcement at NOAA and the Food and Drug Administration to control the problem, but is pleased that NOAA's staffing plan has shifted from investigative agents to patrol officers.

""It's not like [NOAA] is going after drug dealers,"" he said.

NOAA's Office of Law Enforcement is revising the staffing plan to align its workforce ""in the most effective way possible to address mission priorities,"" according to agency spokesperson John Thibodeau. NOAA officials also say they use other methods to ensure compliance, including written warnings and officers who work with fishermen to see that they report their catch correctly.

In response to recent concerns, Todd Dubois, assistant director of NOAA Office of Law Enforcement, said, ""We are confident that the staffing and other changes made since 2012 will improve the agency's ability to deter violations of law by combining focused and effective criminal enforcement with more extensive compliance assistance, monitoring, patrols, and inspections."" Dubois added that they are also strengthening partnerships with other state and federal agencies ""to protect legitimate fishermen.""

Some of the change at NOAA in recent years resulted from complaints by fishermen in the Northeast, especially Massachusetts. They balked at the agency's regulations and enforcement measures, triggering an investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Inspector General.","2014-12-11 10:32:59","0","38.0","3.0","0.0","0.0","34.0","0.0","55.0","24.0","0.0","108.0","4.0","14.0","0","941","96.83","70.62","6.71","24.09","25.43","33.05","73.01","40.06","6.80","2.87","0.11","0.32","0.53","1.28","0.64","3.93","7.86","16.37","4.78","2.23","4.57","0.32","10.20","4.57","2.66","1.38","2.13","2.02","3.19","1.38","1.49","0.32","0.21","0.11","6.38","0.00","0.32","0.43","0.96","7.44","1.28","2.87","0.85","0.96","0.43","1.38","3.08","1.49","1.49","0.11","0.53","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.32","10.63","1.06","2.13","6.06","0.74","1.38","3.83","6.06","1.06","11.37","1.70","6.59","3.08","8.71","0.32","0.32","2.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.26","4.57","5.95","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.64","2.34","2.13","0.00","0.64","4936","8.8","27.62857142857143","1518","939","40","47.62","15.0","12.5","14.74","16.1","238","17.666666666666668","21.538445154419595","457","25.03","21","0.41","0","29","20","81","0","128","84","2","2","5","146","123","2","67","0","1","29","5","17","5","1","2","33","0","29","34","33","28","22","23","7","5","0","4"
"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-police-report-20141007-story.html","Baltimore officials offer plan to curb police brutality","Baltimore's mayor and police commissioner outlined Tuesday a sweeping plan to reduce police brutality, including the possibility of equipping officers with body cameras, while reiterating that they are committed to restoring public trust in the agency.

""We didn't create these problems, but as leadership in charge today, it's our obligation to do everything that we can to fix the breach between the community and police,"" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said about the 41-page report outlining their plans. The report was released as the U.S. Department of Justice prepares for a months-long review of brutality allegations.

The report, called ""Preventing Harm,"" says Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts wants to increase staff in the internal affairs division, which handles allegations of misconduct, and study the body camera issue. Batts also wants to negotiate with the police union to get wider authority to quickly punish rogue cops.

Batts and other police leaders have been ""reforming the internal discipline process so that bad actors are punished and bad cops are fired,"" the report says. ""The best way to prevent abuse is to train on its use, circumscribe it with rules, and enforce the rules. When bad actors have impunity, the good cops become demoralized and the bad ones are emboldened.""

The report cites a six-month Baltimore Sun investigation showing that residents have suffered battered faces and broken bones during arrests. The city has paid $5.7 million in court judgments and settlements in 102 civil suits since 2011, The Sun found, and nearly all of the people involved in the incidents leading to those lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges.

The investigation also showed that some officers have been sued multiple times over allegations of brutality, and that the city did not track those lawsuits in a comprehensive way until this year.

Batts said public trust is vital to keep the city safe and that the department is moving in the right direction. Many agency policies were outdated or needed major changes, he said.

Although many of the recommendations in the report had already been detailed, Batts said the reforms are ""a guidepost for where we are headed"" under his leadership.

""These are hard-hitting recommendations,"" he said.

Among the biggest obstacles is a 40-year-old state law that guarantees certain legal protections for officers. For example, all internal discipline goes through a review board. Batts said that if the board finds an officer innocent of misconduct, he has no power to impose punishment.

""If I'm going to turn around an organization, I have to have accountability for all conduct,"" he said.

Batts said the law prevents him from taking swift action when officers commit egregious misconduct. He noted a recent incident in which a surveillance video showed a Baltimore officer repeatedly striking a man at a bus shelter. The officer has been suspended with pay.

Police leaders cannot suspend an officer without pay until he is charged with a felony. That needs to change, Batts said. The city's contract with the police union calls for back pay if suspended officers are later exonerated.

""It could have been my sons on that bus stop the night of that event where excessive force was used,"" he said. ""It's unacceptable. It will not be tolerated within this organization. We can never let that happen again in our city.""

The Fraternal Order of Police declined to comment on the report.

The plan detailed new types of outreach, including a citizen's police academy. Officers will learn de-escalation techniques so they do not take things personally on the street when interacting with the public. And Batts wants more officers equipped with Tasers to avoid the use of lethal force. The city's Board of Estimates is set to approve Wednesday $1.1 million more for Taser purchases.

City Council President Bernard C. ""Jack"" Young recently introduced legislation that would require all Baltimore officers to wear body cameras; the bill is pending in a council committee.

Rawlings-Blake said she is close to announcing a panel of residents who will study the best way to implement a body camera program.

Baltimore attorney William H. ""Billy"" Murphy Jr., who is frequently involved in civil rights issues, said such a task force could slow the use of body cameras. He backs Young's plans to require them immediately.

""There's no argument against it,"" Murphy said. ""It is the most effective tool we have to reduce police brutality. It will change what's going on for both sides. It will be all 'sir' and 'madam.' Both sides will be on their best behavior.""

In 2006, Murphy helped persuade a city jury to award $44 million to his client, Albert Mosley, after a 2003 incident in a city jail left him a quadriplegic. City Solicitor George Nilson said the city refused to pay the multimillion-dollar judgment in the case and eventually agreed to a $1 million payout.

Murphy said body cameras could help reduce such payouts. ""Any talk that we can't afford it doesn't make sense,"" he said.

Late last week, Rawlings-Blake and Batts called for a federal review of the Baltimore Police Department.

Kevin Lewis, a Justice Department spokesman, said the federal government has agreed to perform a ""collaborative review.""

""Police Commissioner Batts reached out to us. They recognize they could use the help,"" Lewis said, adding that the probe will include ""a review of their practices and recommendations for improvement to increase trust within the community and avoid use of excessive force.""

He said the review would take six months and is similar to ongoing investigations in Philadelphia, Spokane, Wash., and Ferguson, Mo., where the police shooting of an unarmed teen sparked a national outcry.

Kevin Harris, a spokesman for Rawlings-Blake, emphasized the importance of the commissioner's having wide authority to discipline officers.

""We expect the union to criticize that, just as they criticized our call for a federal review,"" Harris said. On Monday, local officials of the Fraternal Order of Police said a federal review is unnecessary and could lead officers to fear they will be second-guessed in policing the streets.","2014-10-07 20:54:00","0","43.0","6.0","0.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","43.0","19.0","0.0","84.0","4.0","14.0","0","1014","92.04","80.17","7.66","18.50","17.48","24.46","79.78","42.80","7.99","3.85","0.30","1.08","0.00","1.48","0.99","4.14","9.66","12.52","7.59","2.37","3.94","1.08","13.71","2.56","1.68","1.08","1.68","1.68","4.04","1.78","2.27","0.30","1.08","0.10","10.26","0.10","0.00","0.20","1.68","7.30","0.99","1.87","1.68","0.99","1.08","1.48","3.06","0.39","2.47","0.10","1.08","0.89","0.20","0.00","0.00","12.72","1.97","1.97","7.89","0.99","1.58","4.73","7.79","1.97","12.82","1.68","6.71","4.54","8.09","0.30","0.30","1.38","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.05","6.21","4.73","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.00","1.28","3.55","1.78","0.00","0.39","4988","7.9","18.745454545454546","1538","1001","63","63.8","12.0","8.3","12.7","11.1","220","10.6","17.15120879120879","490","17.6","7","0.42","0","23","18","118","1","105","59","2","4","18","178","95","1","71","1","0","40","10","20","0","1","2","35","0","57","47","21","30","24","35","5","3","0","6"
"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-police-settlements-follow-20140928-story.html","Baltimore leaders call for change following investigation into alleged police brutality","Baltimore lawmakers and community activists called Sunday for more reforms and federal oversight of the city's Police Department after learning about broken bones and battered faces from an investigation into allegations of police brutality in recent years.

Responding to results of a six-month Baltimore Sun investigation, two councilmen said they had not known that the city paid money in more than 100 settlements or jury verdicts since 2011.

""The administration likes to keep some of that quiet,"" said Councilman Warren Branch, head of the panel's public safety committee.

Councilman Carl Stokes agreed, saying: ""Obviously, it's been a hidden secret about this issue.""

Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake scoffed, saying the cases get approved before the city Board of Estimates and are detailed on public agendas, though The Sun investigation showed that board documents often omitted key details. Rawlings-Blake stressed that many of the incidents detailed in the Sun article occurred between 2007 and 2010 and took years to go through the court system.

The Sun's investigation revealed that the city has been involved in 102 court judgments and settlements since 2011, making payouts of up to $500,000. The victims ranged from teenagers to octogenarians. Judges or prosecutors dropped nearly all charges against residents.

In 43 of the lawsuits, taxpayers paid $30,000 or more. Such beatings, in which the victims are most often African-Americans, carry a hefty cost. They can poison relationships between police and the community, limiting cooperation in the fight against crime.

""Law enforcement officers are trusted with the task of protecting our communities, and each time they respond with unnecessary violence, they lose that trust,"" said Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Baltimore. ""We need better training for our police, allowing them to handle every situation in a way that keeps the people they serve safe — and we must hold officers accountable when they fail to do that.""

Police brutality was one of the main issues broached by residents in nine recent forums Rawlings-Blake held across Baltimore. She reiterated Sunday that the issue has been one of her biggest concerns, dating back to when she was council president.

She pointed out a host of changes made after she hired Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts in 2012, including disbanding the impact unit that triggered many of the lawsuits. Batts has also toughened the trial boards that determine guilt or innocence, and discipline cases are moving faster through the pipeline.

The mayor stressed she will not tolerate misconduct and hired a commissioner who is known for rooting out problems and transforming police forces.

""We have a straight path that addresses the issues of misconduct,"" she said, noting there is room for improvement.

Councilman Brandon Scott said he wants the mayor to find out why similar departments face fewer lawsuits and pay millions less when residents accuse officers of battery, false arrest and false imprisonment.

He also wants a tougher civilian police review board so members have more authority to impose sanctions against officers. Scott lauded improvements in recent years under Batts, but he said it's not enough.

""We need more changes,"" Scott said. ""We need to push the envelope.""

Heber Brown III, an African-American activist, commentator, and pastor of Pleasant Hope Baptist Church, wants the Department of Justice to open a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Department.

""It's time for oversight of a higher authority,"" Brown said. ""City leaders have proven they can't be trusted alone. The community has to keep the pressure on.""

The Rev. Cortly ""C.D."" Witherspoon, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, agreed.

""We have to have [federal authorities] take control of the Baltimore Police Department,"" he said. ""The relationships with the community are so severed that it's beyond repair.""

In the lawsuits where settlements are reached before a trial, the city and the officers involved do not acknowledge any wrongdoing. But city policies also help shield the scope and impact of the police beatings. The city's settlement agreements contain a clause that prohibits injured residents from making any public statement — or talking to the news media — about the incidents.

When settlements are placed on the agenda at public meetings involving the mayor and other top officials, the cases are described using excerpts from police reports, with allegations of brutality routinely omitted.

The Sun article showed mug shots of 29 residents and went up on projection screens Sunday at Pleasant Hope Baptist Church and Empowerment Temple.

Brown said he told worshippers that the article validates the problems that many residents have complained about for years. He said it is time for Rawlings-Blake ""to stop scolding residents for not working with police"" to solve crimes.

""It debunks the thinking that people had to be doing something that made them suspicious to police,"" Brown said. ""No matter if you are 15 or 80, you are susceptible to the violence of police brutality in Baltimore.""

The Rev. Jamal-Harrison Bryant, pastor at Empowerment Temple, who has railed against police brutality, lauded the work that many police officers perform in Baltimore. But, he said, Rawlings-Blake and other city leaders aren't doing enough to rid the force of bad officers.

He called on elected leaders to loosen state personnel laws that prevent the public from finding out whether officers were ever disciplined for any allegations.

""My heart grieves as a pastor that we have these problems,"" Bryant said. ""We're not getting any answers. We just can't commiserate about this.""

Besides more training and a zero-tolerance policy for excessive force, council members also suggested loosening state laws that stop police leaders from discussing individual cases of discipline.

Last week, Branch and Council President Bernard C. ""Jack"" Young introduced legislation that would require every city officer to wear a body camera within a year. Both men argued the move would cut down on police brutality in the aftermath of several high-profile misconduct allegations.

Much of the council praised the idea, but Rawlings-Blake called the bill a ""piecemeal approach to a comprehensive and complex problem"" of improper police conduct.

Branch said cameras are needed even more now—with the revelations reported by The Sun. After learning about more lawsuits and payouts, Branch said he's getting more skeptical of believing ""the boys in blue"" when it comes to police brutality.","2014-09-28 21:53:00","0","51.0","3.0","0.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","34.0","15.0","0.0","76.0","4.0","13.0","0","1048","93.63","79.94","8.56","12.00","17.47","28.05","77.67","40.55","7.44","3.72","0.10","1.05","0.19","1.53","0.86","3.72","8.21","13.74","4.87","2.96","4.87","0.95","12.21","4.39","2.77","1.05","2.10","2.67","5.15","2.00","3.05","0.48","0.95","0.38","10.97","0.00","0.00","0.67","1.05","9.64","2.10","1.81","1.72","1.91","0.67","2.77","2.86","0.86","1.81","0.19","0.86","0.76","0.19","0.00","0.00","12.50","2.39","1.81","7.44","0.67","1.53","4.29","6.39","0.57","11.07","1.05","5.73","4.48","7.35","0.00","0.76","1.34","1.05","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.18","5.82","4.68","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.15","3.82","1.24","0.00","0.38","5379","8.32","18.946428571428573","1628","1035","56","52.7","12.8","10.5","14.21","13.4","247","13.125","18.945893719806765","498","18.07","6","0.41","0","36","21","103","0","128","52","10","1","7","154","105","2","112","0","0","42","3","25","4","1","5","25","0","30","58","29","26","38","24","10","2","0","7"
"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-settlements-follow-20140929-story.html","Officials call for tougher penalties for police brutality","State and local politicians continued the call Monday for heightened scrutiny of Baltimore police officers who are the focus of brutality allegations, urging tougher penalties for offenders and greater disclosure of internal discipline.

""Police brutality is completely inexcusable. I'm going to apply justice fairly, even to those who wear a badge,"" said Marilyn Mosby, who is expected to be the next Baltimore state's attorney. The Democrat is the only major party nominee on the ballot, though she faces opposition in the Nov. 4 election from a write-in candidate.

Responding to results of a six-month Baltimore Sun investigation into brutality allegations, Mosby and challenger Russell Neverdon said they would hold officers more accountable than Gregg L. Bernstein, the departing city state's attorney.

""I will have a zero tolerance for police misconduct and brutality,"" Neverdon said.

The Sun's investigation revealed that the city has been involved in 102 court judgments and settlements since 2011, making payouts of about $5.7 million. The victims ranged from teenagers to octogenarians, and in almost every case, criminal charges were dropped against the victims of the alleged beatings.

Bernstein has defended his role in such cases, noting that his office had prosecuted 10 officers for assault and 10 others for less serious offenses since 2011. In some high-profile deaths, officers were not prosecuted because they had only seconds to make decisions — cases very different from those where officers assault handcuffed suspects, he added.

Bernstein said improved training and recruitment, a better disciplinary process and greater transparency are needed to build the commnity's trust in police.

Some lawmakers echoed those concerns Monday, calling for the General Assembly to revise laws that prevent the public from learning about the internal discipline of officers accused of misconduct.

""We need to know the discipline in these cases,"" said Del. Jill P. Carter, noting that only a ""closed network of insiders"" know the outcome of cases.

Sen. Jamie Raskin, a Montgomery County Democrat and law professor, said he is hearing more clamor from other officeholders about the need for more transparency involving police officers..

""It's a scandal that there are so many cases in Baltimore,"" Raskin said about The Sun's investigation. ""The reason we have government is to protect people from arbitrary violence.""

Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said he understands the public's frustration with and lack of trust in the Police Department — even though it has made a host of reforms over the past 18 months.

""What is clear for us, we will not tolerate the abuse of power,"" he said.

Rodriguez stressed that Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake are committed to transparency and transforming the agency. He noted that officials spoke publicly about two recent cases in which police were caught on camera hitting suspects. The leaders suspended an officer in one incident, and defended the other officer; both cases are being investigated.

Rodriguez said the agency ""will go wherever evidence takes them"" in misconduct cases, while cautioning that credible evidence of misconduct is needed to get rid of rogue officers. Regarding the accounts of broken bones and battered faces uncovered in The Sun's investigation, Rodriguez vowed to make sure that mistakes are not being made when residents lodge complaints.

Every case will be thoroughly investigated, he said, urging residents to come forward with any allegations. ""We take them very seriously.""

Since 2011, 317 lawsuits have been filed against city officers alleging civil rights and constitutional violations such as false arrest, battery and false imprisonment. Dozens of cases are pending.

On Sunday, Rawlings-Blake stressed that the incidents cited in lawsuits detailed by The Sun occurred between 2007 and 2010 and that the police force is undergoing a transformation.

Carter scoffed at that, pointing to the recent beatings caught on video.

""It should be a matter of priority and urgency,"" Carter said about the mayor. ""These issues are not going to be fixed until serious measures are taken.""

Although it would only be a symbolic move, Carter called on Rawlings-Blake to issue an executive order condemning police brutality in the city.

Rawlings-Blake, through a spokesperson, said: ""Police misconduct is an issue I have personally worked on for several years, as is evident by the reforms already underway within the police department as well as my proactive outreach to the community over the past months. I didn't create these problems, but my track record demonstrates I'm committed to fixing them. As I've said before, I'm not interested in piecemeal change. I want to see bold reforms and we will continue fighting until we get there.""

Carter has also led a charge to revise Maryland's law enforcement Bill of Rights, which some critics say is too protective of officers.

The law requires that disciplinary actions against police go through a three-person trial board. Before the board rules, the police commissioner may suspend an officer without pay only if he or she is charged with a felony.

The law gives officers 10 days to retain an attorney before they can be questioned by superiors, and lets the attorney strike members of the trial board hearing the case. Additionally, the law states an officer may not be investigated on a brutality accusation unless it was made within 90 days of the incident.

Carter said Tuesday she plans to push proposals, including more oversight of the police training commission, to make sure Maryland officers are properly trained and educated.

Raskin said any changes that create transparency need to guarantee that privacy laws are not violated for officers and other government workers.

Since August, the nation's attention has been focused on a white officer's shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Mo. — an incident that triggered days of violent protests. The officer said he acted in self-defense, but many area residents saw the shooting as a symptom of racially biased policing.

In the wake of The Sun's investigation, religious and community leaders have called on the Department of Justice to open a civil rights investigation to examine police policies in Baltimore. The department did not respond Monday to a request to comment.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-sun-investigates-crabs-20141213-story.html","Crabmeat imports flood into Baltimore's port","Two million pounds of crab product from China traveled up the Chesapeake Bay into the port of Baltimore during the first 10 months of 2014. Another million pounds came from Indonesia. In total, more than 4 million pounds of crab from all over the world moved into the port, according to an analysis of import records compiled by Zepol, a Minneapolis-based company that specializes in trade data.

Translated into actual crabs, the imports would amount to 32 million creatures. That's about a tenth of the bay's entire blue crab population.

Some federal legislators and Maryland business leaders have raised concerns about the influx of imported seafood — an issue highlighted in a recent Baltimore Sun investigation. They worry that it could be repackaged and sold illegally as more expensive Maryland crabmeat.

Jack Brooks, president of the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association, wrote to a presidential fisheries task force last summer that ""unscrupulous"" companies are doing just that. Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, raised similar concerns in a letter to the Obama administration.

One Maryland crab importer agreed to talk about the issue and give a tour of its facilities. MeTompkin Bay Oyster Co., a Crisfield-based seafood processor, sells both domestic and foreign crabmeat. Co-CEO Casey Todd said the company would not try to pass imported crabmeat off as Maryland crab — it already has plenty of takers for the foreign product.

Todd said he'd heard rumors of the substitution in other states, but doesn't know of anyone doing it.

""Why risk it?"" he asked, since the foreign product is so easily sold and tastes so different. However, he noted that a distributor might be tempted if it had a customer demanding a lot of Maryland crabmeat but lacked supply due to the bay's low crab population earlier this season.

In any case, Todd said, imports help fill demand from U.S. consumers. MeTompkin began importing crab from Indonesia a little over a decade ago to diversify its risk, he said as he walked around the company's processing facility on the banks of the bay.

His family began catching and selling seafood from local waters back in the 1800s. When they bought into MeTompkin after World War II, its prime product was Chesapeake Bay oysters. When the bay's oyster stock declined, MeTompkin expanded its crab business. Then crabs started declining. Todd said the company started importing crab from overseas to fill domestic voids and compete against bigger companies.

""Our crab tastes better,"" he said, ""But to hang on, you offer [customers] a different product.""

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/bs-md-dc-marijuana-20141107-story.html","Pot legalization faces uncertain future in Washington","Although residents of Washington voted overwhelmingly in favor of legalizing marijuana this week — a move that could put penalty-free pot within an hour's drive of Baltimore — the ballot initiative faces an uncertain future.

The measure, which would make it legal for people over 21 to possess 2 ounces of marijuana and grow up to three plants, has triggered some concern on Capitol Hill and among Maryland authorities.

On election night, U.S. Rep. Andy Harris immediately vowed to fight the measure in Congress, which must approve such laws in the nation's capital.

""The federal government should enforce federal law, regardless of whether local citizens try to legalize marijuana,"" the Baltimore County Republican said. ""I will consider using all resources available to a member of Congress to stop this action, so that drug use among teens does not increase.""

Washington could join Colorado and Washington state, which approved legalization in 2012, as well as Alaska and Oregon, which voted in favor of the move Tuesday, as states weigh the liberalization of drug laws.

In Maryland, advocates who see marijuana as no more harmful than alcohol and tobacco hope that having legal marijuana in D.C. helps their cause. Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, are wary of a nearby haven for what remains an illegal drug in Maryland.

Campaigners for legalization in Washington were jubilant this week. ""This victory is dedicated to everyone still sitting in jail tonight because of marijuana prohibition,"" Adam Eidinger, chairman of the DC Cannabis Campaign, said in a statement.

But they do not expect the measure to be submitted to Congress — a crucial step because the District of Columbia does not have the autonomy of a state — until next year, when Republicans will control the House of Representatives and the Senate.

There is further uncertainty in Washington because the ballot initiative did not create a system for selling or taxing marijuana. Muriel Bowser, Washington's mayor-elect, said she supports legalization and setting up a way to legally sell the drug but added that she would not want to see the ballot initiative go into effect without those laws in place.

""I see no reason why we wouldn't follow a regime similar to how we regulate and tax alcohol,"" she said at a news conference this week.

Bowser said she's ready to work with Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's nonvoting delegate to the House, to ensure that Congress respects the will of district voters.

District officials have clashed with Harris over marijuana before. In June, he proposed a measure that would prohibit Washington from using federal money or its own funds to implement decriminalization of marijuana.

The effort failed — but not until some marijuana advocates threatened a boycott of resorts in Harris' district, which includes the Eastern Shore. In Washington, possession of up to an ounce of marijuana is now punishable by a fine of $25.

Law enforcement officials in Maryland say they'll be watching how things unfold in Washington.

Havre de Grace Police Chief Teresa Walter, who is president of the Maryland Chiefs of Police Association, said legalization could have an impact on Maryland, citing concerns in states that border Colorado.

At a September hearing, for example, Nebraska authorities said they had seen a dramatic spike in potency of marijuana and a marked increase in the number of teens ticketed for possession. The state's attorney general said he ""wouldn't rule out"" taking Colorado to court over Nebraska's increased law enforcement costs related to marijuana.

Regardless of the laws in D.C., Walter said, people who travel outside ""have to comply with [the laws] we have here in the state of Maryland.""

She also said Maryland authorities are still trying to adapt to the state's decriminalization law. Walter said they have ""a lot of concerns, a lot of questions still unanswered"" about the law passed by the General Assembly this year.

Maryland moved toward a softer stance on marijuana with a law removing criminal penalties for possession of up to 10 grams. But it left intact penalties for drug paraphernalia and criminal sanctions for any amount larger than 10 grams.

Some prosecutors have looked at the new law as blessing for an even more lenient policy on marijuana. For example, Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy has said he plans to treat possession of even larger amounts of pot as civil offenses if they appear to be for personal recreational use.

And despite law enforcement officials' assertion that they will enforce Maryland's drug laws, experts said that if Washington establishes a way to sell the drug, some difficult legal questions could arise. What should happen, for example, when officers stop someone with marijuana legally purchased over the border?

""There are going to be very uncomfortable legal confrontations,"" said Eric E. Sterling, president of the educational Criminal Justice Policy Foundation. ""There will be a lot of people who I think in that situation will be really indignant.""

On the other hand, Sterling said, lawmakers might also start to look at the tax revenue Washington generates from marijuana sales and decide they'd like a slice of it, nudging them toward legalization.

Maryland officials already are developing regulations for legalized medical marijuana, which has been authorized by the legislature.

Other supporters of legal marijuana in Maryland are optimistic that the district's experiment will provide a nearby test case — one that will be more difficult to ignore than those in Colorado and Washington state.

Said Sara Love, the public policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Maryland branch, ""It's that much harder when it's up on your border.""

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-zirkin-named-to-head-senate-judicial-proceedings-panel-20141203-story.html","Zirkin named to head Senate Judicial Proceedings panel","Sen. Bobby Zirkin, who cast the pivotal vote in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee to repeal Maryland's death penalty, will take over the chairmanship of that panel, Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller announced Wednesday.

Zirkin, a Baltimore County Democrat, inherits the coveted post from Sen. Brian E. Frosh of Montgomery County, who was elected attorney general last month.

Elected to the Senate in 2006 after two terms in the House of Delegates, Zirkin represents the Pikesville-Owings Mills area. In 2013, he reversed his longstanding support for capital punishment and cast the decisive vote in committee to allow Gov. Martin O'Malley's bill to repeal the death penalty go to the Senate floor. It then passed.

Zirkin, 43, will be the youngest senator serving as chairman of one of the Senate's four standing policy committees. The Judicial Proceedings Committee handled such topics as crime and punishment, traffic laws and the rules governing civil suits. Baltimore Sen. Lisa A. Gladden will continue as vice chair.

Meanwhile, Miller put Sen. Jamie Raskin of Montgomery County, thought to be Zirkin's main competitor for the Judicial Proceedings Committee, in charge of the panel that will considers appointments that require Senate confirmation. As chairman of the Executive Nominations Committee, the liberal Democrat Raskin will be in a position to vet Republican Gov.-elect Larry Hogan's choices for top positions. The previous chairwoman, Baltimore County Democratic Sen. Delores Kelley, was named vice chair.

The appointments to his Democratic Senate leadership team were among several announced by Miller Wednesday in the wake of an election in which one of his committee vice chairmen, Sen. Roy Dyson of St. Mary's County, was defeated. Miller named Sen.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-bernanke-20140128-story.html","The Bernanke legacy [Editorial]","Outgoing Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, 60, probably won't win many popularity contests. He's frequently been vilified by the political left for doing too little and by the right for doing too much. Most Americans probably have no idea what he does — and, whether in full-blown crisis or too-slow growth, the U.S. economy, his chief responsibility as head of the nation's central bank since 2006, has been underwhelming for most of his tenure.

But he will be remembered as being the right man for the times. A student of the Great Depression and a former economics professor at Princeton, he likely knew better than anyone in the Bush White House what was at stake when so many major U.S. investment banks were poised to fail in the panic of 2008. The solution involved unprecedented government intervention, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the bailout of insurance giant AIG.

Those actions remain controversial today and are easily second-guessed. Nor, for good or bad, did he act alone. He worked closely with Henry Paulson, who served as U.S. Department of Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, and Timothy Geithner, who was president of the New York Fed and would later become Barack Obama's first treasury secretary. But most economists believe such extraordinary intervention was necessary, particularly after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the nation's fourth largest investment bank, put the stock market in veritable free fall and took the U.S. economy along with it.

More recently, Mr. Bernanke's policy of ultra-low interest rates and bond purchases have injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy that helped stimulate growth (and a rather spectacular comeback in stock values). Under his leadership, the Federal Reserve took actions on behalf of the economy that Congress and the White House could not, particularly given the partisan gridlock of the last several years.

If one had the benefit of a time machine, perhaps it might be possible to find out what would have happened had the Federal Reserve not adopted such an aggressive response to the global financial crisis — or a more aggressive one. Had Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues rushed to the aid of Lehman as they did earlier with Bear Stearns (now a part of JPMorgan Chase), for instance, might the decline not have been as great? Conversely, if there had been no TARP or interventionist strategy at all, might the short-term pain have been greater but the economic comeback more spectacular, too?

Has Mr. Bernanke's tenure been mistake-free? Almost certainly not. He, like most everyone else, didn't spot the housing bust coming — or recognize the danger of subprime lending. But a second Great Depression seemed quite possible in the bleakness of six years ago, and whether there were missteps or not, Mr. Bernanke successfully steered the nation away from one. That alone may make him the most consequential Federal Reserve chairman in history.

A full assessment of his two terms in office is probably not possible without the benefit of time. Some fear that bond-buying has created its own financial bubble and that tapering will pose an enormous challenge to his successor, Janet Yellen. Certainly, there are signs of renewed uncertainty — or at least of an approaching bear market — but it's a far better, more hopeful economy than what the nation faced in 2008-2009 when unemployment was growing like an epidemic and no one knew exactly where the bottom might be found.

You can be certain Mr. Bernanke won't get his face carved on Mount Rushmore. The Wall Street Journal editorial board has already complained about what accolades he has received, his tenure having featuring too much market intervention for their liking.

A more reasonable review of the evidence suggests that the scenario that conservatives revile — that the nation's economy was on the precipice and the Federal Reserve came to its rescue — is probably not too far from the truth. For this, Americans should be grateful for the MIT-educated man from Dillon, S.C., who once worked summers at its famous South of the Border roadhouse and had both the knowledge and the courage to take the measures needed to keep the U.S. economy afloat during one of its darkest hours.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-voter-fraud-20140902-story.html","Double voting? Not necessarily [Editorial]","The recent report by Election Integrity Maryland that there may be as many as 164 individuals who voted in both Maryland and Virginia in the 2012 election hasn't exactly caused the Maryland Board of Elections to press the panic button. There's a reason for that: The numbers don't prove fraud and more likely point to clerical error.

That's not to suggest the Fairfax County Electoral Board should not seek criminal investigation, as officials announced last week, into 17 possible cases of duplicate voting in that Northern Virginia county — such due diligence is entirely appropriate — but the chances that such incidents will result in fraud convictions are slim. If there's one thing experience has taught, it's that duplicate voter registration is almost always the result of nothing more nefarious than people moving from one state to another and registration rolls not being expunged in a timely manner.

Trumped up horror stories about voting irregularities have fueled a Republican-led push to enact voter identification laws that are far more likely to discourage voting, particularly by young, elderly and minority voters who are less likely to have government-approved ID, than it is to uncover organized (or even disorganized) attempts to alter election outcomes. Voter fraud is not unknown, it's simply uncommon.

So what is going on exactly when you have nearly 44,000 people who hold dual registrations in Maryland and Virginia? In Maryland, it means that newly-registered voters likely failed to indicate on their registration forms where they lived previously. Had they done so, authorities in Virginia would have been notified to drop those individuals from the voter rolls.

People living in the Washington, D.C. area change their state of residence all the time. It's commonplace for an individual to move from Montgomery County, Md. to Fairfax County, Va. or the District of Columbia and back again in a few years' time. Meanwhile, the voter rolls are only expunged if the state has been notified by the voter, the person has died (in which case there's a shared database called the Electronic Registration Information Center that may come into play) or hasn't voted in several elections in which case the registration may become inactive.

But what about the 164 who may have actually voted in both places? Again, this is often due to clerical error. Audits reveal that claims of fraud are often overstated because a vote has been wrongly accounted for. John T. Smith was checked in by a volunteer election judge as John P. Smith or John T. Smith Jr. or maybe Jane Smith because she's next to him on the rolls. Sometimes, people with the same name even have the same birthdays. Double-voting also might be deliberate but not malicious — an elderly person voting in one state and sending in an absentee vote in the other because he or she wasn't certain which would count.

That sounds laughable, but veterans of election boards say stranger things happen. There's as much human error in the accounting of votes as there is in any human enterprise. If perfection was easy, the Motor Vehicle Administration, U.S. Postal Service and Internal Revenue Service wouldn't get so much bad press.

Of course, actual voter fraud should be prosecuted. We've argued before that the Maryland Office of State Prosecutor, the agency responsible for prosecuting such cases in this state, has too often been reluctant to investigate irregularities with its admittedly limited resources. While the logic of such decisions was understandable as the chances of serious wrongdoing are slight, voters require the assurance that evidence of such behavior is at least investigated for possible criminal impropriety.

Still, the bigger mistake would be to see allegations of possible double voting as evidence to support a voter ID law. Not only would such a restriction be useless in cases of double voting, as there's no claim that voters misrepresented themselves, but the effect of such laws would be the equivalent of using a sledgehammer on a fly — potentially suppressing thousands of votes to discourage the rarity of actual fraud, which was estimated at .000009 percent after a review of alleged double-voting in New York after the 2002 and 2004 elections turned up only two incidents, according to a 2007 study by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.

Right wing organizations like to scream from the rooftops about voter fraud because reducing turnout, particularly by minority groups, can turn a close election in the GOP's favor. That's not to suggest Maryland or any state tolerate fraud, but the possible remedies should not be worse than the problem. This latest allegation of double-voting merits inquiry — as authorities in Virginia are already doing — but not necessarily any more than that.

After years of debate, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors overwhelmingly voted in favor Tuesday of implementing Laura's Law, the state measure that allows mentally ill people to be compelled into treatment by a court.

The 9-2 vote wasn't a surprise, however: In May, Supervisor Mark Farrell announced he would move forward with implementing the law here, either by taking it to the ballot or, if he could get the votes, at the Board of Supervisors.

Last month, Farrell all but guaranteed a legislative win when he secured the support of progressive Supervisor David Campos by agreeing to amend the law to include creation of an oversight team that will try to get mentally ill people to accept voluntary treatment first.

""Recent studies and reports show that over 40 million American adults have mental illnesses,"" Farrell said. ""People are falling through the cracks ... right here in San Francisco. We see it on the streets, in the community and in families every single day.""

Named for 19-year-old Laura Wilcox, who was killed by a psychiatric patient 13 years ago, the state law was passed in 2002. But counties have been slow to opt in - and perhaps nowhere has the law been met with more vociferous resistance than in San Francisco, which has struggled for years to deal with its mentally ill population.

Campos compromises

Some mental health advocates have continued to fight the measure, but Campos said Tuesday that he chose to support Farrell's proposal because he did not want the issue to be decided at the ballot box. If Laura's Law was implemented by voters, it could only be changed by another popular vote.

Still, Supervisor Eric Mar, who voted against the measure along with Supervisor John Avalos, said he is worried the law could further stigmatize the mentally ill and may not offer people of different ethnic backgrounds ""culturally competent"" care.

Supervisor Jane Kim said she would have liked to see a pilot program instituted instead of permanent approval. The board instead accepted an amendment proposed by Kim that requires an outside group to conduct an assessment of Laura's Law after three years. She ultimately voted for the law.

Relieves stressed agencies

Farrell said the law will give the city another tool for dealing with mentally ill residents and, it is hoped, help take some stress off the city's public safety and emergency management departments. He said 44 states have similar laws.

""For me, Laura's Law is about helping vulnerable individuals ... get help they need,"" he said. ""Those in need deserve better and their families deserve better.""

At a particularly busy meeting, the board also voted unanimously to place a $500 million transportation bond on the November ballot, which will fund transportation infrastructure projects.

$10 billion needed

The city's streets and transit system need an estimated $10 billion investment in the coming 15 years. The bond will help chip away at those needs, paying for new and redesigned streets and sidewalks, as well as infrastructure improvements and repairs to Muni.

Mar, who represents the Richmond District, said the measure, if approved by voters, will improve public transit in San Francisco. He said the money will be spent equitably throughout the city.

""For us on the west side and in the southern neighborhoods ... I think there's a need for much more efficient transportation that serves the outer edges of the city, not just the inner core,"" he said.

Supervisor Katy Tang, who represents the Sunset District, also praised the measure as an investment that will ""serve not only us but generations to come.""

More affordable housing

Supervisors additionally approved a measure by Supervisor Scott Wiener that he said will encourage developers to include more affordable housing units in their market-rate developments by allowing them to increase the density of a proposed housing project if 20 percent of the new units are earmarked as affordable.

Before the meeting, dozens of workers from nonprofits that the city pays to provide social services marched around City Hall and flooded the board chamber, demanding a pay raise. The workers - who serve tens of thousands of low-income, mentally ill, elderly and other vulnerable residents - are lobbying the board to open up the city budget next week and increase the amount of money provided to these nonprofits.

Mayor Ed Lee included a 1.5 percent cost-of-living increase in both the 2013-14 and 2014-15 budgets, but workers say they previously went years without a raise and want the board to add another 1.5 percent, or about $6.8 million for the fiscal year that began July 1.

Their protest delayed the start of the board meeting for about 20 minutes and resulted in 11 people being detained for disruption of a public meeting, said sheriff's Chief Deputy Kathy Gorwood. No one was arrested.","2014-07-08 15:42:00","1","64.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","28.0","0.0","257.0","250.0","0.0","488.0","0.0","14.0","0","1415","98.04","72.35","7.52","53.68","22.82","26.36","72.37","36.18","5.02","1.98","0.14","0.21","0.00","1.06","0.57","3.04","8.34","14.56","3.82","1.84","3.11","0.71","9.47","3.89","2.33","1.41","5.16","2.61","4.17","2.83","1.34","0.49","0.49","0.14","8.48","0.14","0.07","0.14","1.06","6.01","0.28","1.06","2.12","1.06","0.35","1.91","2.83","1.55","1.06","0.14","1.77","0.14","1.63","0.00","0.00","10.18","1.84","1.20","6.93","0.64","0.42","4.24","3.82","0.78","13.22","1.20","6.50","5.58","8.13","0.21","0.57","1.34","0.00","0.07","0.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.07","0.00","18.16","5.80","4.95","0.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.85","2.12","2.69","0.57","0.49","6987","6.98","29.08","2174","1404","65","58.01","12.9","10.5","13.0","14.0","202","12.875","16.394985754985754","479","25.08","17","0.36","0","32","69","128","0","180","64","12","0","22","199","304","2","89","0","0","27","7","46","6","0","3","27","0","49","71","24","28","21","17","18","7","0","1"
"https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Contra-Costa-s-outrageous-delay-on-mental-5838344.php","Contra Costa’s outrageous delay on mental health treatment law","Contra Costa’s outrageous delay on mental health treatment law

A ntioch resident Linda Dunn asked her elected officials this month: What will Contra Costa County’s legacy be when it comes to serving its most seriously mentally ill citizens? Will it build a guardrail or pay for an ambulance to wait at the bottom of the cliff?

After 17 months of study, several reports, the testimony of countless citizens — family members and consumers, health care providers and law enforcement alike — as well as financial data comparing its project to similar programs in five other counties nationwide, Contra Costa County supervisors whiffed on the decision. They postponed the vote on a proposed assisted outpatient treatment program for as much as 90 days — after the Oct. 28 vote on the state-required three-year mental health plan. The proposed plan includes no funding for a three-year, 37-slot Laura’s Law program, which allows assisted outpatient treatment of seriously mentally ill individuals.

Residents concerned with the state of their county’s finances, and its treatment of its most ill citizens, should be on high alert this next week.

After spending nearly $48,000 in consultant fees and more than 300 man-hours to facilitate discussions, work groups, research and corresponding reports, as well as having independent financial analysis compiled by Contra Costa County resident Douglas Dunn, supervisors learned that an initial investment of roughly $7.6 million could save the county $12 million to $16 million if it adopted Laura’s Law.

Douglas Dunn, whose background includes 25 years in the financial services industry, noted that county behavioral health services staff had a chance to refute his figures at an Aug. 22 meeting, but did not.

One has to wonder why.

Why, also, did supervisors say that they did not want to fund a new program if it meant taking funds from an already-funded mental health program? Isn’t it the job of elected officials and staff to continually evaluate programs to rate their continued value? If Laura’s Law is as big a boon as studies indicate (not to mention providing a compassionate alternative to forced treatment through hospitalizations, incarceration or homelessness), then why are elected officials hiding behind the “we don’t know where the money is coming from” argument?

It is because there has been a gross misrepresentation of state law, which mandates that no program be “specifically reduced” in order to implement assisted outpatient treatment, but does not say that voluntary services may not be reduced.

Additionally, many of the residents who would benefit from assisted outpatient treatment would qualify for Medi-Cal if they could just stick around long enough to sign up. Because they don’t, their care is strictly on the county’s dime. Being in a Laura’s Law program will make them stable enough to complete the Medi-Cal process, moving a good portion of their care cost to the federal government, thus freeing up a lot more money for voluntary services, advocates contend.

An impassioned Teresa Pasquini said at an Oct. 7 hearing, “$753,000 — that’s what you’ve spent on my son in three years, only to have him fail,” speaking of the costs associated with her adult son’s numerous 5150 calls, hospitalizations and court costs.

Contra Costa supervisors can do the right thing and include funding for Laura’s Law in their three-year plan by delaying their vote until they have taken up Laura’s Law again.

“I’m tired of a system of heroics,” Pasquini said. “I want a system of care.”

The Subway sandwich shop across from the West Oakland BART Station has been held up so often that the owners installed bulletproof glass from the counter to the ceiling. Yet right next door, Mandela Foods Cooperative has never been robbed nor touched by graffiti since it opened five years ago.

Owned and operated by four neighborhood residents, it sells higher-end natural foods along with well-priced local produce and is set to hit $1 million in sales.

""There's nothing like it in the country,"" says Mariela Cedeño of Mandela Marketplace, a nonprofit that helped launch the market. ""It's a grocery store that's survived five years and become profitable in a 2,200-square-foot space in a low-income community.""

Although Mandela Foods is one of a kind, it represents the sort of small, full-service markets that seem to be opening as quickly as new SoMa condos.

Likely to have a staff that can grind meat for house-made sausage as well as make a quinoa salad from scratch, these stores have forged a unique connection with shoppers - despite the fact that a gallon of milk might cost $1 or even $2 more than at a supermarket.

These corner markets are locally owned and operated, carry a large percentage of foods grown or produced nearby, are within walking distance, and offer a highly personal shopping experience. The successful ones become a part of the neighborhood's identity.

""In the Bay Area there's been such a paradigm shift from the larger markets,"" says Vince Sanchez, whose family plans to open a market in combination with a Columbus Avenue branch of their popular North Beach brunch spot, Mama's. ""I think San Francisco and the area is going to push that trend.""

Sam and Raph Mogannam, who have operated Bi-Rite Market in the Mission since 1997 and opened a second San Francisco location last year, created the ultimate model: in-house butchery, the best and brightest specialty foods, and a produce section supplied in part by its own farm - not to mention an ice creamery and other offshoots.

Other entrepreneurs are following in ways that aren't always as ambitious, or as high end, but still capture a sense of community spirit. La Wanda Knox is part of a group planning to open Portside Community Market in Oakland's Jack London Square, after raising $19,000 through crowdfunding to cover initial legal fees.

""You wouldn't think of Jack London Square as a food desert, but there's no grocery store,"" says Knox. ""We got a lot of support from the community.""

Although some say the neighborhood lacks the density to support a full-service market, Knox points to the almost full existing housing and the new housing developments planned in the area, including at the old Oakland Army base.

An outsider might have similar doubts about the vacant North Beach grocery store where Sanchez and his family, who have owned Mama's since 1951, plan to open their market and restaurant. A nearby Safeway and Trader Joe's, not to mention Chinatown's markets, have made it challenging for a typical small market to enter the area.

Sanchez says their market will stand out with prepared meals and specialty foods, including their own jams. Plus, any produce and meat that don't sell right away can be used by the restaurant's kitchen. Yet, he's not oblivious to competition from chain stores and the expanding ranks of online grocery delivery companies.

""I sit there outside the store on Columbus and Vallejo, and I see all those Safeway and Amazon Fresh trucks going by,"" says Sanchez.

While those larger retailers have the buying power that can result in lower prices, independent markets offer something that they can't: true community meeting spaces.

Driver's Market in Sausalito, which opened a year ago, has a large communal table where local groups meet. Mulberry's Market in Piedmont, a small full-service grocery on the site of a former run-down corner store, names its deli sandwiches after neighborhood residents.

In San Francisco, Local Mission Market, which opened last year, places a long table down the middle of the store for monthly family-style dinners. At a recent one, Clark March, who lives a few blocks away, says he was impressed by the effort the store made to return a friend's lost wallet.

""You see how they begin to knit the community together with that level of trust,"" he says.

To others, the sorts of products the market sells, like house-made sauces and sustainable seafood, and their according high prices, have made it a symbol of gentrification. The entire storefront was recently covered in graffiti that made it clear it wasn't welcomed by all.

While it's true that artisan food is what sets these stores apart, it's often the simpler things that customers seek.

Richard and Janet Tarlov opened Canyon Market in San Francisco's Glen Park neighborhood with a full bakery, coffee bar, in-house butchery and curated cheese department. But those products aren't necessarily what sell the most.

""We're serving families that don't have another option to walk to in the immediate vicinity,"" says Richard. ""We're really pushing our buyers to make sure that we are never out of Muir Glen chopped tomatoes and 2 percent milk.""

Here are snapshots of four stores that show off different sides of the Bay Area urban market:

Mandela Foods Cooperative

Mandela Foods sells products from more than 25 local vendors and produce from Watsonville-area farms through a distribution company created by its related nonprofit, Mandela Marketplace. Soon, Dionne Knox of Zella's Soulful Kitchen will open a cafe inside.

With the help of grants, worker-owner James Bell, a third-generation West Oaklander, and others surveyed residents about their food needs before opening the store. Later, during a monthlong study of customers that use public assistance, the staff noted that EBT shoppers bought products like coconut water and prepared foods along with lower-cost foods.

""There's a perception that poor people only want low-quality, cheap foods,"" says Cedeño of Mandela Marketplace. It's a stereotype that Mandela Foods has upended.

Haight Street Market

The Vardakastanis family has served the Haight since it opened a market here in 1981. But three years ago, around the same time a Whole Foods opened nearby, it expanded from a single storefront to two, adding a deli, meat counter, cafe and kitchen.

""The only way to compete was to be on an even playing field,"" says general manager Bobby Vardakastanis.

Decorated with Haight-Ashbury Street Fair posters, the produce section is well priced and comprehensive, and in the parklet out front, customers sit down for the store's coffee drinks and prepared foods.

Vardakastanis says the store now has 60 full-time employees and continues to grow.

""We always wanted to do something full service but also keep things small enough to where it's not going to feel like a big monster chain store,"" he says.

Local Mission Market

This market takes locavore to a new level with house-made dried and fresh pastas, crackers, vinegar and hot sauce along with breads, salad dressings and jams.

The produce section is on the lean side, because there are no imported bananas or out-of-season berries. But it has interesting finds like baby flowering kale - not surprising, given that the store is owned and run by Yaron Milgrom and Jake Des Voignes, who also operate the restaurants Local Mission Eatery and Local's Corner.

They also own Local Cellar, a nearby wine and liquor store, which customers can order from and pick up at the market. And there's an online store that offers delivery.

""The things I can find here are amazing,"" says Rose Kovelesky, who has lived in the neighborhood for 15 years.

Driver's Market

Adam Driver and his brother opened this natural foods corner store last spring after renovating the space that once housed Real Food Co., where Driver had worked.

The market includes a deli, juice bar and a meat counter featuring local producers like Marin Sun Farms. Prepared meals come from nearby Cafe Divino.

When Driver worked at Real Food, he noticed that community members were very attached to the store, and would get together there to discuss political and environmental issues.

""It struck me back then that it was a meeting place,"" he says.

He plans to build on that tradition, hosting live music, poetry readings and speakers in the store's airy cafe.","2014-05-16 15:47:00","1","96.0","7.0","7.0","1.0","24.0","0.0","230.0","222.0","0.0","434.0","0.0","15.0","0","1831","94.77","63.88","42.24","45.85","22.60","22.12","78.75","38.78","6.34","1.86","0.27","0.33","0.11","0.60","0.55","4.48","7.86","13.76","4.59","2.68","4.81","0.98","9.61","5.24","2.62","0.93","3.00","1.64","1.91","1.47","0.38","0.05","0.00","0.27","6.23","0.66","0.33","0.22","0.55","7.10","0.71","2.46","0.33","1.26","0.76","1.86","2.89","1.31","0.93","0.49","5.90","0.05","0.76","0.05","5.02","6.28","2.51","1.09","2.51","0.44","0.16","2.08","7.21","1.15","17.91","1.37","11.85","4.81","6.17","1.86","1.91","5.52","0.16","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.05","0.00","0.16","0.00","18.41","4.70","6.66","0.55","0.00","0.22","0.00","2.24","1.64","2.02","0.00","0.38","8763","7.26","23.35","2612","1789","85","58.62","11.5","10.3","12.65","13.4","293","16.166666666666668","16.95114589155953","728","21.79","9","0.37","0","67","49","161","1","217","154","8","2","15","315","268","1","136","1","0","41","15","59","2","1","8","39","0","52","40","25","44","50","62","14","7","1","6"

Over a five-year period, a government-mandated tracking system in France showed that physicians in that country treated 1,979 patients for serious health problems associated with the use of marijuana, and nearly 2 percent of those encounters were with patients suffering from cardiovascular problems, including heart attack, cardiac arrhythmia and stroke, and circulation problems in the arms and legs. In roughly a quarter of those cases, the study found, the patient died.

In the United States, when young and otherwise healthy patients show up in emergency departments with symptoms of heart attack, stroke, cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmia, physicians have frequently noted in case reports that these unusual patients are regular marijuana users.

Such reporting is hardly the basis for declaring marijuana use an outright cause of cardiovascular disease. But last week, cardiologists writing in the Journal of the American Heart Association warned that ""clinical evidence ... suggests the potential for serious cardiovascular risks associated with marijuana use.""

And with a growing movement to decriminalize marijuana use, they called for data-collection efforts capable of detecting and measuring marijuana's cardiovascular effect among American users of cannabis sativa. Voters in Washington and Colorado last year passed initiatives legalizing marijuana for recreational use, and pot advocates are proposing similar initiatives in other states.

""There is now compelling evidence on the growing risk of marijuana-associated adverse cardiovascular effects, especially in young people,"" said Emilie Jouanjus, lead author of the French study, which was also published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. That evidence, Jouanjus added, should prompt cardiologists to consider marijuana use a potential cause of cardiovascular disease in patients they see.

In an editorial published Wednesday in the American Heart Association journal, Drs. Sherief Rezkalla and Robert A. Kloner asked, ""Do we really know enough about the cardiovascular effects of marijuana to feel comfortable about its use in patients with known cardiovascular disease or patients with cardiovascular risk factors,"" including obesity, sedentary behavior, high blood pressure and worrisome cholesterol numbers.

Rezkalla and Kloner combed the recent medical literature for animal experiments, observational studies and case reports linking marijuana use in close temporal proximity with cardiovascular events. They cited evidence that marijuana use probably increases clotting factors in the blood and that heavy marijuana use may lead to significant changes in the tiny vessels carrying blood to the heart and brain, such that even after clearance of a major blockage, blood flow remains impeded.

""We think the time has come to stop and think about what is the best way to protect our communities from the potential danger of widespread marijuana use in the absence of safety studies,"" added Rezkalla, a cardiologist at the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin, and Kloner, a cardiologist at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine. ""It is the responsibility of the medical community to determine the safety of the drug before it is widely legalized for recreational use.""","2014-04-29 17:23:00","1","29.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","134.0","135.0","0.0","190.0","0.0","10.0","0","493","98.18","58.81","29.96","4.82","29.00","36.92","81.14","38.74","4.67","1.22","0.00","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.61","3.45","8.11","16.23","2.84","3.25","4.67","0.00","9.74","3.04","1.01","0.61","1.01","0.61","4.06","1.01","3.04","0.81","0.41","0.20","2.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.97","3.65","5.07","1.01","1.83","0.20","1.01","1.83","0.81","0.20","0.81","9.94","2.84","7.10","0.00","0.20","8.11","1.62","2.03","2.23","0.61","2.43","2.43","6.69","0.81","14.20","2.64","7.51","4.06","5.68","3.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.00","3.85","6.90","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.81","2.03","0.41","0.00","0.00","2772","9.4","33.0","882","488","17","25.42","17.5","16.8","17.24","20.5","134","17.833333333333332","24.46360655737705","265","28.33","1","0.36","0","20","4","44","0","75","53","0","1","2","94","42","1","51","0","0","7","2","14","0","0","1","9","0","12","18","16","8","8","9","1","1","0","1"

A team of UCSF obstetricians and bioengineers is building a wireless device that can be inserted into a pregnant woman's vagina and monitor her cervix and, when necessary, send an alert that the woman may be going into premature labor.

The device, which will be similar in size and shape to a diaphragm used for birth control, would be the first early-warning system for preterm labor, which is the main cause of death among newborns worldwide.

It's still in early development, but the device, called the Smart Diaphragm, just got $2.7 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to start manufacturing and expand clinical trials. A prototype has been tested in about 15 pregnant women at UCSF, and a larger study is planned for this summer.

""We need a way to have an early heads up - who needs to be seen by a doctor, who needs surveillance. That's what drove us,"" said Dr. Larry Rand, an obstetrician and the lead developer of the diaphragm.

""For 30 years, we've been doing research on preventing preterm birth,"" Rand said. ""But we've been focusing too much on the uterus and the contractions, and that's sort of like trying to treat a heart attack after someone has chest pains.""

Monitoring the cervix at a molecular level, he said, may be the answer.

About 15 million babies worldwide are born preterm - before 37 weeks of gestation - every year, according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, about 11.5 percent of all births are preterm. The U.S. rate and the global number have dropped in the past few decades, but not by a lot, to the frustration of public health experts.

Health problems

Babies born prematurely have much higher rates than full-term infants of serious health problems, such as breathing difficulties, developmental delays and cerebral palsy. About 1 million babies worldwide die every year from complications of premature birth.

When preterm labor is detected now - either because a woman has started having contractions or because an ultrasound has detected a change in the size or shape of her cervix - it's usually so far advanced that there aren't many options for doctors to stop it.

Drugs can put labor on pause once contractions have started, but for only a couple of days. Before contractions begin, some women can be treated with the hormone progesterone, which may delay labor long enough for them to carry to near-full term. But not all women respond to progesterone, and it can be difficult to know when, and to whom, the hormone should be given.

Quick treatment

In developing countries, early labor can be more dangerous for women and their babies. Many women live far away from medical help, and by the time they've gone into premature labor, it's too late to call a doctor.

Researchers hope that the Smart Diaphragm would detect very early signs of labor, days or even weeks before contractions, and allow doctors to give treatments that would prevent preterm labor. For example, if they find that the woman has an undiagnosed infection that is triggering labor, they could treat that infection. Or they may be able to give women collagen-boosting drugs to strengthen the cervix.

The advance warning may give women in developing countries just enough time to reach a doctor before early labor begins.

""It opens a whole new window of opportunity,"" Rand said. ""We may already have therapeutics that work, but we've never been able to apply them. We have medicines that could prevent collagen breakdown.""

Part of the problem in addressing preterm birth is that doctors don't know exactly what causes it. There are clues - a bad infection or trauma can bring on premature labor, and there may be a hereditary element. Rates of preterm birth are higher among low-income and minority women, which may be because of a variety of circumstances.

But on a biological level, scientists don't yet understand what exactly sets off premature labor. And that lack of information has hampered efforts to prevent it.

""We're in a position within the next five to 10 years, I truly believe, to get some real explanations for preterm birth,"" said Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson, senior vice president for research and global programs at the March of Dimes. ""How quickly we can translate those findings into action will be uncertain. But we can at least see the path to get off square one, which we've been stuck on for decades.""

Seeking knowledge

The March of Dimes, which is focused on helping women reach full-term pregnancy, has started funding several programs around the country, including one at Stanford, to hunt for those biological explanations. Scientists there are using genomic sequencing to search for genetic clues to what sets off early labor.

Rand believes the cervix may be critical for understanding preterm birth because it undergoes subtle molecular changes a long time - weeks, perhaps- before labor begins.

The cervix, which is the gateway between the vagina and the uterus, is two clumps of stiff tissue made up of collagen - the protein that also forms the ear and nose. Most of the time, the cervix is 3 to 5 centimeters long and so tightly packed that the two sides are clamped together, closing off the entrance to the uterus.

But at some point during pregnancy, before contractions begin, the cervix softens and becomes shorter and looser. It will almost disappear entirely, so that it's less than a millimeter long and the two sides separate, or dilate, to allow a baby to slip out of the uterus.

Once the cervix has noticeably shortened - enough that it can be detected by ultrasound - it can take just a day for it to dissolve away. But that process probably starts on the molecular level much earlier, scientists say.

The cervix softens when the collagen starts to break up. Ordinarily, collagen forms a tight crisscross pattern, like a basket weave, that keeps the cervical tissue stiff. But something causes that basket weave to loosen.

How device works

Rand's device cups the cervix and monitors the collagen, ideally revealing when the basket weave starts to come undone. The device is embedded with two types of sensors - one to monitor electric currents moving through the cervical tissue, and one to monitor fluorescent light. As collagen breaks down, electrical currents move more easily through the tissue, and the tissue bounces back light in a different pattern.

""We're measuring multiple times throughout pregnancy. We're getting in essence a virtual biopsy of the cervix,"" said Mozziyar Etemadi, a postdoctoral bioengineer from UCSF and UC Berkeley who's working with Rand on building the diaphragm. ""This wasn't possible even 10 years ago. The tools that we're using didn't exist - the electronics and the wireless connectivity were not there.""

The idea is to insert the diaphragm into a woman's vagina at some point early in the pregnancy to get a baseline reading on her cervix. Then, the woman would reinsert the diaphragm periodically during pregnancy - maybe every few days or so - to get more readings.

The data would be transmitted wirelessly to cloud storage, where it would be accessible by the patient and doctors. If her collagen structure was changing enough to raise concern, an alert would go out, either to the patient or her doctor, or both.

Advancing research

The prototype being studied now looks like a wand and is attached to a computer. A doctor has to insert the wand during an exam and hold it on the cervix for a minute or so to get a reading. In about two years, the UCSF team hopes to have a version of the device that's small and able to transmit wirelessly that they can test on women in South Africa.

Rebecca Yops of Tiburon was part of the first trial at UCSF, undergoing frequent exams with the prototype device while she was pregnant.

As the San Francisco Board of Supervisors prepares Tuesday to pass the controversial Laura's Law to compel treatment of mentally ill people, a judge from Nevada County who has dealt with the law for six years said naysayers' fears have proved unfounded.

The small, rural county in the Sierra was the site of the 2001 slaying of Laura Wilcox by a psychiatric patient and was the first California county to adopt the law named in her honor to allow family members and others to petition a judge to require treatment of mentally ill patients.

Superior Court Judge Thomas Anderson said that since Nevada County implemented the law in 2008, there have been 41 petitions for compelled treatment. About half of those patients accepted voluntary care, never seeing the inside of a courtroom.

Of those who did enter the civil proceedings process, most wound up agreeing to participate in the mandated treatment plan without any sort of fight.

Just four times did Anderson preside over a contested hearing where the defendant was present with a lawyer and objected to the treatment plan. Anderson ordered the treatment plan in each of those four cases, saying there was enough evidence to show treatment was necessary. He pointed out that all those patients were treated in the community, not through forced hospitalization or forced incarceration, as he thinks would have happened without Laura's Law.

""Having this process of coming in front of a judge isn't about jailing them, which is their previous experience, or taking all their rights away,"" Anderson said. ""It's just about offering support.""

Laura's Law allows a family member, roommate, mental health provider, or police or probation officer to, in limited circumstances, petition the courts to compel outpatient treatment of a mentally ill person. To qualify, the person must have been hospitalized or jailed stemming from mental health issues twice in the past three years and have been seriously violent to himself, herself or someone else in the past four years. There is no provision in the law for forced medication.

Counties slow to act

Laura's Law was passed at the state level in 2002, but counties must opt in, and they have been slow to do that. Los Angeles and Yolo counties have pilot programs, and Orange County recently adopted the full program.

Anderson said there is typically one person referred to the courts under Laura's Law per every 25,000 people living in any particular county every year. That means San Francisco stands to see about 34 people annually, as the Department of Public Health is estimating.

In May, San Francisco Supervisor Mark Farrell announced he had the three additional votes required at the board to place Laura's Law on the November ballot to let voters decide. He said he was willing to pass it through the standard legislative process instead if he could get the six total votes needed.

That should happen Tuesday when the board takes its first full vote on the issue. Farrell has always had the backing of Supervisors Katy Tang, Scott Wiener and London Breed. Last month, he secured the support of Supervisor David Campos by agreeing to amend his legislation to create an oversight team to try to get mentally ill people to accept voluntary treatment first.

Supervisors Malia Cohen, John Avalos and Norman Yee said they will vote for Laura's Law on Tuesday, and Supervisor David Chiu is expected to as well, though he couldn't be reached for comment. That brings the total to nine votes, more than enough to pass the law at the board.

Supervisors' qualms

Supervisor Eric Mar was still deciding on Monday, his staff said. Supervisor Jane Kim was floating the idea of creating a two-year pilot program, but Farrell refused to go along.

""I am very concerned about what forced, court-ordered treatment means, especially by judges who don't have any background or expertise in mental health,"" Kim said.

Tuesday's meeting is expected to be packed and contentious, with opponents of the law determined to turn out in force despite the apparent foregone conclusion they will be on the losing end.

David Elliott Lewis, co-chairman of the city's Mental Health Board that oversees mental health spending, said passing a divisive law that will likely have little effect in terms of the number of patients treated doesn't seem worth it.

""It's dividing the community of people who are trying to help people with mental illness,"" he said. ""It's really hurtful, and it's made antagonists out of friends.""

Anderson said that as a former public defender and criminal defense attorney, he understands opponents' objections. But he said data gleaned from Nevada County's 41 cases show Laura's Law helped decrease patients' rates of hospitalizations and incarcerations and helped formerly homeless people become stabilized enough to secure housing.

Anderson said he regularly has patients return to court to update him on their status and said he has been impressed. Recently, a patient who had been incredibly agitated and paranoid and frequently wound up in the emergency room paid him a visit.

Signs of improvement

""They came in smiling - they even laughed in court,"" Anderson said, masking the patient's gender for confidentiality reasons. He added the patient was living in an apartment with others and attending support groups and social activities.

He said that patients, even those who initially resisted, usually end up appreciating the treatment they've received through Laura's Law.

""They realize this help is real,"" he said. ""They get stable. They get their life back.""","2014-07-07 17:23:00","1","66.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","19.0","0.0","205.0","202.0","0.0","381.0","0.0","15.0","0","1306","94.21","76.65","14.11","43.95","19.79","23.05","73.89","39.97","7.20","3.98","0.08","0.00","0.00","2.83","1.07","3.22","6.13","15.54","6.81","2.30","3.14","0.69","13.63","2.76","1.30","0.92","4.13","1.45","3.60","2.22","1.23","0.15","0.61","0.15","10.18","0.69","0.15","0.92","2.30","7.35","1.61","1.23","0.77","1.61","1.15","2.14","3.91","1.61","1.99","0.23","2.60","0.00","2.45","0.00","0.15","9.26","1.30","1.30","5.90","0.69","0.46","5.21","6.43","0.84","14.32","1.45","8.65","4.59","4.13","0.54","0.77","0.46","0.00","0.38","0.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.08","0.00","17.69","5.74","6.66","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.61","1.23","2.91","0.00","0.15","6269","7.69","24.345454545454544","1926","1292","65","59.74","11.6","9.9","12.18","12.4","251","6.285714285714286","17.730897832817337","551","22.02","7","0.4","0","34","48","100","0","159","78","3","0","8","192","224","1","69","1","0","45","16","38","1","1","9","41","0","47","71","29","41","25","37","6","7","2","2"

Marathon was a mess 1 / 42 Back to Gallery

This week the San Francisco Marathon took stock of the 2014 race and came to a conclusion. Basically it can be summarized in one word.

Whoops.

The computer app that was supposed to allow family and friends to track runners didn't work, water was unavailable on parts of the course and race officials are still trying to sort out the confusion about the winner of the women's division of the first half-marathon. Otherwise things went smoothly.

Let's begin by saying this should be a great event for San Francisco. Over 25,000 runners participated, many from out of town, and they raved about the scenery, the city and the course. The races were sold out despite a stiff entry fee over $100.

An enormous amount of time, money and effort went into putting this on Sunday. And it was a mess.

Most troubling were the problems with the water. On an unseasonably hot morning, runners desperately needed hydration and weren't able to get it. Either the water wasn't available or runners had to stand at tables while volunteers poured it.

""I don't know if they were poorly staffed or poorly trained, but none of the tables had cups of water available,"" said Laurence May, a San Mateo attorney who ran the second half marathon. ""I have run eight marathons, a ton of half-marathons and triathlons. The organizers of those would have been killed if they did something like this.""

In response, Peter Nantell, who's directed the event for the last 13 years, sent a statement to The Chronicle. He said his crew was ready and able to serve runners at 12 aid stations along the course.

However, he added, ""We are aware that water delivery for some water locations was delayed, causing low water levels. As soon as we were alerted to the delay, we responded immediately and supplied additional water to these areas.""

But Jenni Kirk, president of the San Francisco Road Runners, ran the full marathon and says she saw more than one runner passed out on the ground in the hot weather. It was hot, but the lack of water had to be a factor.

""You have to learn from other races,"" she said. ""Boston had a hot year, Chicago had a hot year. You have to plan. It is better to have too much water than not enough. Otherwise you end up as the guy passed out on the side of the road.""

The frustrating part of the race is that the San Francisco brand is a huge draw. Even if there are problems with the event - officials issued an apology for the defective tracking app before the race even began - there is still the draw of a beautiful city and a race course that includes a jog over the Golden Gate Bridge.

Promotion seen as lacking

This should not only be an impressive event, it should be a magnet for tourists. Reportedly, the participants are largely local. Events like the New York City Marathon draw at least a third of their participants from out of state.

But critics say the race hasn't been promoted well in years. More tellingly, the event staff seems to turn over year after year. The only constant is Nantell.

Those close to the inner workings of the event say there are serious financial problems.

""In my humble opinion,"" says Len Goldman, former president of the Lake Merritt Joggers and Striders, ""they seem to have had their share of issues with putting on a quality product. The management has changed over and over, and there's a lack of consistency. This is more of a people's marathon, not like a New York or Boston, but the organizers still have an obligation to the runners to put on the best race they can.""

This was not it. Officials have given conflicting accounts of who won the women's division of the first half-marathon. First they insisted the first runner across the finish line, Stephanie Knast, was the winner, even if another racer, Stephanie Hamm, had a faster time according to her computer chip. Then they revised the times for the first three runners, including Knast, lopping off over two minutes to reflect the fact that they started after the elite runners took off for the full marathon.

""There was a mistake in the original times that were posted,"" said Karmina Zafiro, a spokesperson for the event. ""The half-marathon started approximately two minutes later than the full marathon. This mistake has been corrected.""

Hamm was unconvinced.

""They won't admit it, but I'm sure they just picked which numbers to change,"" she wrote. ""I find this race to be completely unprofessional and unethical.""

For her part, Knast was just happy to be named the winner. She even asked for Hamm's e-mail address to get in touch and congratulate her on a great race.

Timing issues

Meanwhile, Becky Ikenberry, an executive with Race Central, the timing company, said they didn't find out that the first-half-marathon racers would be starting in the second wave at the start until the race started at 5:30 on the morning.

""We had an error on that (results) page that was showing scoring time, but we fixed it,"" she wrote to Knast.

And so it goes.

Seriously, couldn't all this have been prevented with an organizing team that was both experienced and well-managed? Kirk, of the SF Road Runners, has run races all over the country and sees the inconsistency in the local marathon.

""It does seem like there are a lot of changes,"" she said. ""I think the key to success for a lot of big marathons is that they have the same people running it year after year. They have stuck with it and made those races a big success. We need one of those people to stay here and make this race great.""

Now would be a great time to start. What we've got now isn't working - especially for the host city.","2014-08-01 16:59:00","1","79.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","99.0","0.0","643.0","661.0","0.0","1410.0","0.0","15.0","0","3837","99.00","59.78","76.09","33.88","15.47","22.18","70.05","37.76","3.70","1.82","0.16","0.21","0.13","0.52","0.81","1.88","11.15","17.15","3.15","1.38","1.88","0.47","8.18","2.89","1.90","0.50","8.21","1.46","1.41","0.94","0.47","0.03","0.05","0.03","3.67","0.13","0.08","0.44","0.52","3.28","0.34","0.68","0.60","0.83","0.29","0.91","3.39","2.71","0.42","0.23","1.62","0.00","1.36","0.00","0.26","4.25","0.65","1.59","1.93","0.91","0.31","4.20","3.36","0.18","24.97","4.38","9.98","10.69","1.09","6.15","0.81","0.18","0.00","0.03","0.10","0.00","0.05","0.00","0.05","0.00","17.59","6.91","7.25","1.17","0.00","0.08","0.00","0.34","0.73","0.89","0.16","0.08","17817","5.4","22.125714285714285","5444","3822","245","72.56","10.4","7.0","10.84","9.4","240","6.75","10.751773940345368","654","18.89","22","0.38","0","40","242","451","0","591","173","15","3","11","331","1115","30","184","1","0","59","29","68","6","0","27","50","0","51","137","34","74","68","55","4","16","0","2"

Now that George Lucas has selected Chicago as the preferred home of his still-vague ""museum of narrative art,"" Mayor Ed Lee is painting the Presidio Trust as the culprit who chased the ""Star Wars"" creator out of town.

Not a chance. The real culprit - at least in the final months of competition between two compelling cities - is a political culture that views our landscape and waterfront only through a political lens. Instead of planning ahead, City Hall of late has pinned its hopes on one overhyped project after another.

While Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel methodically assembled a well-connected task force to explore sites within his city that might captivate the billionaire filmmaker, Lee made no public gesture in Lucas' direction until early May. That's two months after the trust decided that neither Lucas nor his competitors should be awarded a scenic setting across from the marsh at Crissy Field.

As for the offer to Lucas of a 2.3-acre parcel of land across the Embarcadero from Piers 30-32, it was made in a letter from Lee on May 29 - two weeks after Emanuel's committee released its 56-page report analyzing 57 sites before recommending 17 acres on Lake Michigan.

Lee had been in the Lucas camp from the start, signing a letter that was included with Lucas' formal proposal to the trust last September. But in the high-voltage tug-of-war that followed, the mayor was nowhere to be seen - Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Nancy Pelosi were the politicians who kept pushing in Lucas' behalf.

Lee's plea a bit tardy

In fact, Lee didn't start making a play for the Lucas museum until a week after a call for civic action appeared in The Chronicle from former Secretary of State George Shultz and his wife, Charlotte Mailliard Shultz, the city's chief of protocol.

""The mayor of Chicago is working hard to bring the Lucas museum to his city, so we need to settle the issue promptly in our favor,"" said their April 25 letter. ""So instead of unnecessary discussion and uncertainty, let's get on with it and welcome the museum here.""

Two days later, former Mayor Willie Brown raised the ante in his Chronicle column - saying the collection of vintage art and digital animation would be ideal on Piers 30-32 as ""a tourist magnet and a great addition to the waterfront.""

Only then did Lee's inner circle realize the genial mayor was being outflanked by ""Rahmbo,"" the latest in a line of Chicago politicians who understand the need to make things to happen rather than wait to see what falls in your lap.

Suddenly there were Lee's letters to Lucas and a birthday phone call. A full-page newspaper ad and a banner at City Hall.

The sense of political opportunism extended to the site offered to Lucas on May 29: a parking lot just south of the Bay Bridge that had been part of the proposed Warriors' arena complex. The basketball team shifted its sights to Mission Bay in April and left behind a void. Who better to help fill it than a retired visionary who had been eager at the Presidio to spend $700 million to build and endow a personal museum?

Gloating in Chicago

Now, Chicago power brokers are gloating and Lee and his supporters are in spin control mode.

The mayor issued a statement after Lucas' decision in favor of Chicago was made public Tuesday complaining that the trust, by thwarting Lucas' desire for Crissy Field, ""put San Francisco's chance at landing the museum in jeopardy."" Investor Ron Conway, tech's self-appointed voice at City Hall, fumed that the Presidio Trust ""kept the Lucas Museum from being built in San Francisco, despite the valiant efforts of a diverse group of city leaders to keep it here.""

Feinstein went even further in a statement released Wednesday - not only complaining about ""how George Lucas has been treated by the Presidio Trust Board"" but stating, ""I hope this incident leads to a thorough review and overhaul of the procedures used by the Trust.""

Here's the catch, everyone: The Presidio isn't just a scenic nook within the boundaries of San Francisco. It is part of the National Park Service. It is a National Historic Landmark District. The trust's board is appointed to oversee an American treasure, not a local jobs incubator.

And when Lucas was asked by the trust to respond to specific site-related concerns, such as the height, his team responded in barely perceptible ways.

It might be inevitable that Lucas is headed to Chicago in the wake of the Presidio rebuff. But San Francisco's chances would have been better if Lee et al had turned their charms on Lucas right away.

Long-range bayside plan

In the wake of Chicago's coup, and the recent decision by voters to require an election whenever there is a desire to raise height limits on land owned by the Port of San Francisco, the city does not need any more finger-pointing. It needs a proactive, long-range bayside plan that balances history and tradition with such 21st century realities as sea level rise and emerging potential of active urban mixed-use waterfronts.

If this happens, City Hall won't be stuck hoping that yet another billionaire shows up with yet another big plan for the most stubborn port-owned sites. Rules will be spelled out in advance - and it's a good bet that smart developers will be waiting in line.","2014-06-25 15:00:00","1","71.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","49.0","0.0","360.0","359.0","0.0","732.0","0.0","15.0","0","2023","98.61","67.17","11.65","49.70","21.29","20.81","66.49","36.33","4.35","1.43","0.05","0.20","0.05","1.04","0.10","2.92","8.90","15.22","3.86","1.68","3.02","0.64","7.41","4.70","2.52","0.59","4.79","2.13","3.41","2.32","1.04","0.05","0.79","0.10","6.23","0.25","0.00","0.15","1.04","5.78","0.94","0.69","1.24","1.78","0.25","1.33","4.25","3.31","0.30","0.44","0.54","0.15","0.30","0.00","0.10","5.93","1.04","1.48","2.72","0.79","0.79","2.42","4.50","1.14","13.79","1.04","8.80","3.95","2.67","3.46","0.25","0.25","0.00","0.49","0.05","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.05","0.00","15.92","5.54","4.89","0.79","0.00","0.05","0.00","1.38","1.58","1.43","0.00","0.25","9320","6.88","27.58108108108108","2970","1998","95","58.62","12.0","10.3","11.02","12.1","279","7.0","15.985585585585586","682","25.12","15","0.35","0","38","95","201","1","259","111","8","4","11","321","508","6","57","0","1","13","29","38","7","1","7","51","0","51","60","26","54","14","47","8","8","0","4"

The Presidio Trust called an end Monday to the competition for the 8-acre site on Crissy Field coveted by ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas and two other would-be developers.

The unanimous vote by the trust's seven-member board of directors left the site's future open and rejected all three proposals - including the one by Lucas, who had pledged to spend $700 million to build and endow a museum holding his collection of popular art.

Instead, the board said it wants to work with Lucas to find an alternative site for his museum within the 1,491-acre park. As for the other teams - one led by the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, the other by architecture firm WRNS Studio - the board said it hopes to pursue ""collaboration"" with them regarding future programs at the Presidio.

""We simply do not believe any of the projects would be right for this location,"" board Chairwoman Nancy Hellman Bechtle said at a hastily called news conference Monday afternoon. ""We didn't think any of them quite hit the mark.""

The decision ends San Francisco's most highly charged development tussle in years. But it doesn't answer the question of when - or what - change will occur on land that has been leased to retailer Sports Basement since 2004.

The site is at the hinge where Crissy Field and the Presidio's Main Post will meet in 2016 when the reconstruction of Doyle Drive is complete. That $1 billion project will tuck part of the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge into a tunnel that will be topped by a 10-acre bluff-like park alongside what now is the Sports Basement parking lot.

That future, rather than the nondescript present, is what stirred the interest of Lucas and his rivals, each of whom proposed cultural centers with environmental themes. It also is why such forces as the National Park Service weighed in during recent months, saying any decision should be delayed until work on the new Presidio Parkway is complete.

According to members of the trust board, though, they want to resume planning the site before then.

""I don't think we'll wait for two years,"" member Charlene Harvey said. ""This is an important decision.""

Lucas' high-profile support

The clear loser in Monday's decision is Lucas. His team had waged a vigorous lobbying campaign for the site that included backing from Gov. Jerry Brown, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and, especially, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. There also was support from such cinematic heavyweights as Martin Scorsese.

""This is something that caught us completely by surprise,"" David Perry, a spokesman for Lucas, said of the idea that other large development sites are available within the park, a National Historic Landmark District.

""For four years, we have been told that the only site available is the Sports Basement site, and we have worked and reworked our plan to make it work,"" Perry said. ""Now, literally in the past few hours, we hear there is an alternative site.""

The filmmaker will continue to work with the trust, Perry said. ""I know that they take their stewardship of the Presidio very seriously,"" he said.

Lucas will weigh other offers that have come his way. ""A lot of other people have asked us to dance, and we will start calling them back,"" Perry said.

Conservancy 'grateful'

The response from the conservancy, Lucas' leading rival, was more enthusiastic.

That group helped oversee the restoration of Crissy Field, which has become San Francisco's most popular waterfront open space. Last month, the latest version of its proposal for the Sports Basement site included a promise to ""unreservedly endorse"" any halt to planning efforts there.

""We are grateful to the trust board for taking the long view about this park site ... by making a decision they believe is in the best interest of the American people,"" conservancy President Greg Moore said in a statement. ""The trust has come to a decision that is considerate of the transformation that is occurring here over the course of the next several years,"" such as the new bluff.

The only politician to comment Monday afternoon was Pelosi, who was instrumental in creating the Presidio Trust after the Army base closed.

Rather than dwell on Lucas not getting the Crissy Field site, spokeswoman Evangeline George said in a statement that the House minority leader ""is pleased the board has come to a decision to productively work with each of the sponsors to examine alternate locations within the Presidio.""

The decision comes one week after a hearing where 500 people turned out to see presentations from each team and weigh in. Many of the 96 comments that evening called for a delay.

There was no turning point in deciding to set aside the proposals for the site, board members said Monday.

""We have certainly heard from everyone in the world,"" Bechtle said. ""The only creature I didn't hear was my dog. He has an opinion, but he's not telling.""

We all understand the principle of democracy. We elect our leaders and order them to make informed decisions. If we disapprove of their choices we vote them out of office.

That's not how it works in San Francisco.

""What you are seeing now is a push - mostly from the left - to bypass the government,"" says political consultant David Latterman. ""If they don't like the way the city is going, simply bypass it and put it on the ballot.""

The upcoming November election already has John Arntz, director of elections, worried. It's not the issues that concern him. He's worried about the simple logistics.

With offbeat proposals breaking California into six states, or in San Francisco, two initiatives - one pro, one con - about renovating the Beach Chalet soccer fields in Golden Gate Park, the actual physical ballot is growing at an alarming rate. Arntz reminds us that ballots must be printed in English, Spanish and Chinese, so everything appears three times.

The ballot is already going to be four cardboard cards in length, and ""we still have a chance to get to five cards,"" which is the most he's ever seen.

""We're sending out 200 pounds of paper to each polling place,"" Arntz says, ""and there are 567 polling places. It's a lot of paper and very challenging.""

As we've seen in recent previous elections, the concept sounds simple and harmless - let the voters decide.

There's just one problem. That's not how it's supposed to work.

The Beach Chalet fields are a seminar on San Francisco elections. The proposal would replace the potholed, ragged soccer fields with synthetic turf and night lights. The hours would be extended, more teams would be able to play and the fields would be safer than the chewed-up turf there now.

The changes are opposed by a small group of residents at the end of the park who hate it when you call them NIMBYs. So let's call them NIMPs - Not in My Park. Except it isn't their park. It belongs to everyone who lives in the city and is run by a city agency.

Hearings and meetings have been held on the project all the way back to 2010. It's been examined and approved by agencies from the Recreation and Park Commission to the Board of Supervisors to the California Coastal Commission. When opponents demanded an environmental impact report, and it supported the project, the critics filed an appeal in Superior Court, which was also denied.

""Numerous studies, both the city's own and those of other federal, state, local and international agencies, support the EIR's conclusions,"" ruled Superior Court Judge Teri Jackson.

Rec and Park Director Phil Ginsburg called it ""perhaps the most vetted project in the history of the city.""

Jean Barish of the Coalition to Protect Golden Gate Park says none of that was good enough. Her group has collected over 16,000 signatures to get the issue on the ballot.

""Most of the people who voted on this were not approved by the voters,"" she said. ""This is a few, hand-selected voters. In the opinion of at least 16,000 people, there is strong opposition to the project.""

So now, after all that, it is on the ballot. What's more, to head it off, Mayor Ed Lee and a majority of supervisors have crafted an opposing ballot measure that will invalidate the Coalition's.

That's not how this is supposed to work.

""The way grown-ups do it is people sit down for a year and try to plan things out,"" says Latterman. ""You hash it out. There are compromises. Instead, they are just throwing things on the ballot and hope they can win.""

Hey, it might work.

""With enough money and a good message, you can win elections,"" Latterman said. ""Who the hell is going to pay attention if there are 20 things on the ballot?""

While there are lots of critics of the process, no one has a good suggestion to change it. The threshold for signatures on a petition to get a measure on the ballot is just 10 percent of the turnout in the last mayoral election. That worked out to about 9,700 names. Easily done.

There has been talk of raising that standard - say, to 20 percent - but that hasn't been popular. So we're stuck with this system, a bloated ballot and a few people with money pushing their agenda.

But at least the soccer field issue will be settled after the November election, right?

""No, actually not,"" Barish says. ""There's a pending lawsuit in the California Court of Appeal.""

That's to appeal the denial of the appeal for the EIR, which was approved by the Board of Supervisors, 10-1, back in 2012. Barish's group calls it democracy in action.

I'd call it a sad joke.","2014-07-25 17:12:00","1","64.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","153.0","148.0","0.0","217.0","0.0","13.0","0","809","82.95","72.34","14.72","53.67","14.45","19.16","78.00","50.68","10.38","3.96","0.25","1.36","0.49","0.62","1.24","6.43","10.26","13.47","9.02","4.94","4.94","1.61","14.71","3.21","1.61","1.73","2.97","2.84","3.83","2.60","1.11","0.37","0.37","0.12","8.53","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.37","7.66","0.99","0.87","1.24","2.35","0.87","2.47","1.85","0.62","1.11","0.12","0.62","0.25","0.25","0.00","0.12","8.41","2.22","1.73","3.58","0.99","0.62","3.58","10.38","1.11","12.86","1.73","8.03","3.21","3.96","1.36","0.62","0.37","0.12","0.00","0.25","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.51","6.67","6.06","0.12","0.00","0.25","0.00","1.48","3.71","3.21","0.00","0.00","3593","7.45","14.910714285714286","1102","803","55","73.58","9.6","6.6","9.74","8.3","157","5.5","15.660672478206727","392","13.84","3","0.5","0","26","23","94","1","90","40","2","3","10","109","77","1","54","1","0","45","4","33","1","2","6","24","0","34","20","16","25","29","39","8","6","0","5"

Who knew there was so much drama in golf? The fate of moisture-challenged Gleneagles Golf Course, where die-hard, blue-collar golfers have been losing golf balls in the vegetation for 52 years, is turning into a San Francisco soap opera.

At present we are two days from a drop-dead deadline to come to new lease terms. Operator Tom Hsieh, who has run the course in McLaren Park on a shoestring for 10 years, says if an agreement cannot be reached with the city's Recreation and Park Department before Thursday, he will close the doors, hand over the keys and walk away.

""And we all know that once a golf course goes away it never comes back,"" Hsieh says. ""And unless they have some brilliant proposal, it is probably going to sit for a long time.""

Nonsense, says the department, although representatives from Rec and Park are generally declining comment because they feel Hsieh is attempting to leverage his position in the media. After all, they say, Hsieh is the one who gave notice and announced he'd leave if he didn't get an improved deal.

""The Gleneagles operator has given us 30 days,"" said spokeswoman Connie Chan. ""We have invited him to continue and it is his decision whether or not he wants to continue to do so. We are currently exploring other options to keep Gleneagles open.""

For his part, Hsieh says he thinks their ""other options"" are just wishful thinking. Not only is the course in serious need of an upgrade, but also the Visitacion Valley location is one of the roughest, most violent neighborhoods in the city.

""No professional golf organization in America wants to run Gleneagles,"" Hsieh says. ""They've all looked at it and turned it down. It's got special needs, and it takes a special group to run it.""

Naturally, this all comes down to money. Hsieh says recent Public Utilities Commission rate increases for water - drought-related, of course - have jacked up his costs to the point where it's impossible to make money - or break even.

Rec and Park says it's already made major concessions - paying electric and sewer bills and a partial subsidy for the water bill - and can't do any more.

Although the two sides are talking, it is mostly confined to telling the other group that they are being completely unreasonable. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking.

If there was ever a situation where a grown-up was needed, this is it.

So, a couple of points: First, this isn't just about the golf. Hsieh has come up with an innovative plan that could benefit the neighborhood. He's entered into a partnership with the Northern California Laborers Training Center in San Ramon. The center is designed to provide participants with hands-on training so that they may qualify for an apprenticeship in construction.

Hsieh is proposing moving a wing of the center to Gleneagles and then opening it to young men and women in the job-challenged neighborhood. Gleneagles would get free labor - the nonprofit center is privately financed - and trainees would learn construction skills.

""We would start with manual labor, then move to trimming trees, pest management and then light construction,"" Hsieh said. ""It would be designed like a classroom, and when they graduated they would be ready to go into golf course management or the construction and trades industry with a great resume. I see it as a win-win.""

Even Rec and Park agrees it's a good idea. And, suddenly, instead of saving a dusty golf course, we're talking about a jobs program that could accommodate eight to 10 motivated kids a year.

Surely this can't be that hard. Reports are the two sides are $75,000 to $90,000 apart on the water subsidy.

""We are not that far,"" Hsieh says. ""This is small money compared to what we want to do for the neighborhood.""

And give Rec and Park credit. They've stepped up, allowing the course to charge flexible greens fees, for instance, and offering to fund a tee-time reservation system.

So let's get this done. Find some middle ground, make a deal and let's get on with a golf course that also has a jobs program.

And we can go back to a time when the biggest drama at Gleneagles is a 4-foot putt for $2 a side.","2014-07-28 17:45:00","1","57.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","153.0","148.0","0.0","217.0","0.0","13.0","0","736","74.82","72.49","30.47","61.85","17.12","18.75","84.65","48.78","9.78","4.62","0.14","1.63","0.00","1.49","1.36","5.16","8.56","11.96","8.97","4.48","6.93","1.49","18.21","3.53","1.49","1.36","2.58","1.90","2.99","2.45","0.54","0.00","0.27","0.14","9.51","0.00","0.68","0.14","1.63","10.33","1.77","0.82","2.31","2.17","1.09","3.53","3.26","0.54","1.77","0.95","1.36","0.54","0.27","0.00","0.54","6.93","2.58","1.36","2.04","1.49","0.14","2.85","14.13","1.36","16.30","2.85","8.83","4.76","6.39","2.04","0.82","2.04","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.57","5.84","5.43","0.14","0.00","0.14","0.00","2.45","2.99","2.17","0.00","0.41","3294","7.48","17.511627906976745","1000","723","43","71.34","10.6","7.5","10.32","9.6","138","10.2","16.354854771784233","377","16.33","3","0.47","0","30","16","78","0","68","44","2","2","12","113","60","1","37","0","0","44","5","38","0","1","5","26","0","41","15","19","19","23","40","3","4","0","5"

Sacramento --

State lawmakers have until Monday night to revise the $11 billion water bond that will appear on the November statewide ballot, but have thus far been unable to agree on a lower spending amount.

Gov. Jerry Brown wants to drop the bond to $6 billion, while state lawmakers are throwing out other amounts ranging from $7 billion to $10 billion.

Most everyone agrees the current $11 billion proposal is ""pork-filled"" with billions for nonessential programs.

The Legislature approved the bond for the ballot in 2009, saying at the time that it would pay for a crucial fix to the state's system that distributes water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. But critics say some of the spending has little to do with fixing water infrastructure, and the bond has twice been delayed due to low voter approval ratings.

Monday night deadline

State voter guides listing ballot measures are scheduled to go to the printer Monday night, making that the deadline to remove the water bond currently on the ballot, according to the secretary of state's office.

Lawmakers can extend the deadline for changing the water bond on the ballot if they approve printing a second voter guide at a cost of several million dollars.

But first, any new water bond would need to clear significant hurdles to win widespread support from legislators and Brown.

""We have got to get this done,"" said Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins, D-San Diego. ""We are going to do everything we can to get this done Monday.""

Brown's scaled-back version of the bond has been roundly criticized by a bipartisan chorus of lawmakers and special interest groups, who say more money is needed for projects like new dams, water conservation, and improving water quality and groundwater management. Brown said the state doesn't need to break the bank in order to invest in critical projects.

In a campaign e-mail, Brown said the $11 billion bond, which has never polled well with voters, would cost taxpayers $750 million a year for 30 years, a ""price tag beyond what's reasonable or affordable.""

Securing a supermajority

During an all-night session in 2009, lawmakers passed the $11 billion bond containing $1 billion in added spending that many said was needed to gather the necessary votes to pass the Legislature.

""At the time, that's what it took to get a two-thirds supermajority,"" said Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento.

Back then, Steinberg said, lawmakers didn't have to contend with a contentious water proposal in the Delta known as the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. Now, much of the discussion around the bond concerns whether the money can be used to fund parts of the controversial delta tunnels project, Steinberg said.

Lawmakers said their proposals would not fund the Delta tunnels project championed by the governor. Brown's water bond proposal also included a ""tunnel-neutral"" disclaimer, but opponents raised concerns that bond money set aside for the Delta ecosystem could be used to mitigate environmental issues with the tunnels.

""Failure to resolve those issues means that all of the things that Californians agree on - clean drinking water, groundwater storage and water recycling - all those things don't get funded,"" Steinberg said. ""We have to resolve those sticky wickets.""

Any new water bond will need to pass both houses of the Legislature with two-thirds support, which is not an easy task. Senate Democrats lost their supermajority control earlier this year after three senators were suspended while fighting criminal charges. The Assembly still has a supermajority of Democrats, but water issues tend to be divided among geographical areas as much as party affiliation.

Funding new reservoirs

Republicans said increasing surface storage with a $3 billion investment is critical to earning their support. Many of the current proposals, including Brown's, set aside $2 billion for surface storage.

""You can't build two facilities with less than $3 billion,"" said Senate Minority Leader Bob Huff , R-Diamond Bar (Los Angeles County). ""If you chop it to $2 billion, you are talking about one storage facility.""

Steinberg said there simply isn't enough money in current bond drafts to set aside $3 billion for new reservoirs.

""That would dwarf the other priorities in the bond, and that wouldn't be fair,"" Steinberg said.

As Steinberg hurried down the hall in the state Capitol on Thursday, he said he anticipated all sides working together at a fevered pace over the next several days to reach a consensus on the various water bond proposals. On Friday, Senate Republicans introduced a bill detailing their own $8.7 billion water bond proposal.

""Water is the most important issue facing California,"" said Sen. Tom Berryhill, R-Modesto. ""We need to get this done now.""

The major elements of the current $11 billion bond measure include:

-- $3 billion to increase storage through above- or below-ground reservoirs.

-- $2.25 billion for restoration projects in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.

-- $1.79 billion for statewide ecosystem and watershed protection and restoration projects.

-- $1.05 billion for projects to ensure water supply reliability.

-- $1 billion for groundwater cleanup projects.

-- $1 billion for water recycling projects.

-- Nearly $500 million for drought-relief projects.","2014-08-10 19:04:00","1","73.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","15.0","0.0","177.0","174.0","0.0","325.0","0.0","15.0","0","1079","97.27","62.03","11.85","49.95","21.58","26.88","70.62","37.16","4.73","1.67","0.00","0.46","0.28","0.37","0.56","3.06","8.34","14.37","5.75","1.76","3.15","0.83","10.75","3.80","1.85","0.56","6.77","2.32","3.61","2.41","1.11","0.19","0.37","0.56","5.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.37","5.93","0.46","0.83","1.58","1.20","0.83","1.85","3.24","1.11","1.85","0.19","2.97","0.00","0.19","0.00","2.78","7.23","1.20","1.30","3.99","0.93","0.46","3.71","6.77","0.74","13.53","1.02","7.41","5.00","4.08","0.37","0.28","2.13","0.00","0.00","0.65","0.00","0.19","0.37","0.09","0.00","20.39","4.82","5.47","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.43","2.41","1.39","0.19","2.32","5291","7.91","23.891304347826086","1619","1062","50","58.42","12.1","10.4","13.23","14.0","217","13.75","18.653258003766478","486","21.57","4","0.36","0","20","73","103","0","119","71","5","0","13","184","147","6","77","1","0","15","6","26","3","1","2","43","0","46","28","24","27","27","20","8","3","0","0"

Sacramento --

California would become the first state in the country to require ""kill switches"" on smartphones that prompt consumers to activate the antitheft technology under a bill passed by the state Legislature on Monday and sent to Gov. Jerry Brown.

The increasing number of smartphone thefts in California prompted the bill by state Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, who said consumers would have more control over their personal information if their device is lost or stolen. The antitheft technology, often referred to as a ""kill switch,"" allows the owner of a smartphone to remotely render it inoperable, which law enforcement officials said would deter thieves who target the devices.

SB962 has been one of the more high-profile and intensely lobbied bills in the Legislature this year, however, in recent months, many of the bill's opponents have quieted. Major cell phone manufacturers such as Apple and Microsoft removed their opposition.

""This is the first bill of its kind in the country,"" Leno said. ""I think as any number of issues here in California, when we act it becomes the de facto way business is done across the country. Minnesota passed a bill before ours, but it's opt-in. That will not make it a universal deterrent.""

Under Leno's bill, beginning in July 2015, consumers would be prompted during the initial set up of a new cell phone to enable the kill switch. If a consumer chooses to accept all default settings, the kill switch would automatically be enabled.

Industry opposition

The wireless industry trade group CTIA fought the kill-switch bill, at first saying the proposal was technically unfeasible, prohibitively expensive and rife for abuse by hackers. After Leno's bill gained traction, the industry group announced a who's who of smartphone makers and wireless carriers that had decided to offer the antitheft technology as an optional tool beginning in July 2015. Leno said the industry's approach didn't go far enough to put the technology in front of customers and continued to push for his bill.

""We urge the Governor to not sign this bill since uniformity in the wireless industry created tremendous benefits for wireless consumers, including lower costs and phenomenal innovation,"" said Jamie Hastings, the group's vice president of external and state affairs in a statement. ""State by state technology mandates, such as this one, stifle those benefits and are detrimental to wireless consumers.""

Leno said requiring cell phone users to actively choose not to turn on the antitheft technology would result in significantly more devices having the kill switch activated. Smartphone thefts have grown increasingly violent as the price for devices has risen to several hundred dollars on the black market.

More than 3.1 million Americans had smartphones stolen in 2013, up from 1.6 million in 2012, according to a Consumer Reports survey. The Federal Communications Commission pegged mobile-device theft as the leading property crime in America.

""The manufacturers have indicated that they will implement this technology nationwide with passage of this bill, and with organized crime rings shipping smartphones stolen in the U.S. overseas, passage of this legislation will have implications for public safety around the globe,"" said San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón, who sponsored the bill.

Gascón's office said more than 65 percent of all robberies in San Francisco involve the theft of a mobile device, while Los Angeles has reported a 30 percent increase since 2011 in smartphone thefts.

Reducing armed robbery

Oakland leaders praised Leno's bill, saying it offers an innovative strategy to reduce crime. More than 80 percent of armed robberies in Oakland in the first five months of this year involved a cell phone, according to police data.

""This has been a top priority for me and I look forward to Gov. Brown signing this into law so we can deter and reduce the violent armed and strong-arm robberies that have afflicted Oakland and our entire state,"" said Oakland City Councilman Dan Kalb, who himself was robbed at gunpoint for his iPhone outside his North Oakland home in 2012.

Leno's bill would prohibit local governments from enacting their own requirements on cell phone manufacturers, similar to the one San Francisco Supervisor London Breed proposed earlier this year. Breed proposed local legislation requiring kill switches on phones sold in the city after the Senate initially rejected a statewide mandate.

The Senate reconsidered Leno's bill and narrowly passed it to the Assembly after the senator promised to exclude tablets from the provisions and extend the effective date for smartphones by six months to July 1, 2015.

The bill returned to the Senate on Monday for approval of the amendments. The Senate passed the bill in a bipartisan 27-8 vote. Sen. Ted Gaines, R-Roseville, urged lawmakers to pass the bill, saying he hoped it would free up district attorneys and other law enforcement officials to ""focus on more important crime.""","2014-08-11 18:18:00","1","57.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","169.0","164.0","0.0","240.0","0.0","13.0","0","834","97.81","69.70","19.44","20.34","22.54","27.82","69.90","38.61","6.12","2.16","0.36","0.60","0.00","0.60","0.60","3.96","9.11","14.87","4.80","0.96","3.84","0.48","8.99","4.44","3.12","0.96","3.24","2.28","3.84","1.68","2.04","0.00","1.56","0.36","7.07","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.60","6.83","1.44","1.92","1.32","0.84","0.48","1.68","3.00","0.60","2.40","0.00","0.24","0.12","0.12","0.00","0.00","7.31","1.08","1.80","4.32","0.60","0.12","3.72","3.48","0.36","14.27","2.52","7.67","4.44","5.28","0.00","0.12","4.44","0.00","1.08","0.12","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.75","4.92","4.68","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.20","2.16","1.68","0.00","0.00","4213","8.56","25.727272727272727","1290","826","38","49.45","13.6","11.8","13.52","14.5","201","10.8","20.413656174334143","405","23.52","8","0.39","0","19","25","92","2","100","52","6","0","12","160","92","2","57","0","0","16","9","20","3","0","1","26","0","36","39","17","24","14","14","4","6","0","1"

Tucked away in a nondescript shopping center near a Highway 101 on-ramp is a unique art shop.

One won't find paint, sculptors' clay, canvas or pencils here but rather a jumble of buckets, tubing, stainless steel equipment and grains. The media are very different, but for many devotees of this growing hobby the experience is the same.

Instead of art on a canvass, J&M Brewing in Novato provides the material and ingredients for making art in a bottle. The shop is Marin County's only store selling ingredients and equipment for making beer and wine at home.

Marin County, and the rest of the North Coast, has become a launch pad for leaders in the craft beer revival. Brewers such as Lagunitas and Russian River Brewing Co. have grown from local favorites to national brands and more people are trying their hand at making beer themselves to replicate the flavorful brews they can buy at local breweries or stores.

To help meet that growing demand, Joe Capone and Marty Wall opened J&M Brewing Supplies in 2012. The two are natives of the East Coast who always knew they wanted to own a business together.

The shop not only sells brewing supplies but also offers classes to help beer aficionados learn about the hobby. The next two-part class will explain the entire brewing process and let participants bottle their own beer. It starts on Jan. 25 and runs through May.

While sales for the big-name brands like Budweiser and Coors have been gradually slipping in recent years, craft beer sales have grown by about 10 percent annually, according to Nielsen Company. And in 2012, there were more than 2,300 craft breweries making beer.

The growth in craft beer has been mirrored, or perhaps led, by a growth in the number of home brewers. According to a report by the American Homebrewers Association, the group had 750 members in 1980, but had grown to more than 30,000 in 2012. The association also estimated that in 2012 there were 1 million active home brewers in the U.S.

Most people new to home brewing seem to have been inspired by local craft beer, Wall said, and want to replicate that at home. That was more of a challenge when Wall and Capone first started brewing in the '90s and the industry did not have the same quality and range of products. Today it's much easier for a home brew novice to be successful, Wall said.

""They can go home and make beer as good or better than their favorite beer,"" he said.

Wall and Capone have been brew buddies for a long time and realized they had an opportunity because there was no shop in Marin County. After opening the store in May 2012, they quickly garnered local support.

""It's been successful since day one,"" Wall said.

The store caters to all skill levels. Wall said they sell beginner brew kits for making five gallons of beer for $150 to $180. They also sell starter winemaking kits that will produce about 6 gallons of wine for around $200.

A basic home brewing kit includes malt extract - a viscous fluid or dry powder derived from grain that provides the fermentable sugars - hops, yeast and a food-grade plastic bucket for fermentation. The most expensive piece of equipment for brewers just starting out is typically a stainless steel pot, which needs to be large enough to boil the malt extract and several gallons of water.

Wall said it's not uncommon for professional brewers in the area to stop by the store for supplies or a piece of equipment.

The shop also hosts regular classes where students can watch the brewing process first hand, initiate fermentation and come back in about two weeks to bottle up some beer. Wall said he's also trying to differentiate the shop by offering the best selection of hops in the region. Hops, which are the buds of a hop plant, are what gives beer its signature bitter flavor and also act as a natural preservative.

Sean Cochran, who has worked at the store since it opened, said the home brew process goes perfectly with the trend of people looking for local products as well as food and beverages that have more unique and interesting flavors. ""I think people have a better appreciation for food and wine and beer,"" he said. ""Home brewing just fits into that whole lifestyle.""

And he said it's pretty easy for someone to make a decent beer themselves. ""Making totally drinkable, awesome beer is not hard at all,"" Cochran said.

Novato resident Jason Burdge is an accomplished home brewer who credits the shop with helping to foster a home brewing community in Marin County.

A little more than three years ago, Burdge moved to Marin County from San Francisco and became interested first in making wine. But when he realized the diversity of hops and brewing in the area, he decided to craft his own beer. ""I really loved the creative process,"" he said.

Home brewers today have a wide range of options when creating their beers.

They can choose specific base grains for the right color and texture, then pick hops and other adjuncts to add just the right aroma, bitterness and flavors, and finally pitch a yeast to provide the additional body, taste and aroma characteristics.

Burdge has a five-gallon ""all grain"" system that is pretty much the same as what professional brewers use but at a far smaller scale. He said he enjoys making strong Belgian ales and English ""barley wines"" that one sips like wine and that can even age for a few years.

The shop became a regular hangout for brewers who eventually coalesced to form the MaSH, or the Marin Society of Homebrewers. Burdge became president and said the group has a contact list of about 40 people.

""It was great to get together with some like-minded folks,"" he said. ""We have a wealth of knowledge; some of the guys have been brewing for 30 years.""

Members hold meetings the third Wednesday of every month at J&M to discuss recipes, swap samples and generally share a passion for brewing their own beer.

""That's kind of the ultimate,"" he said.","2014-01-24 15:47:00","1","64.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","151.0","148.0","0.0","218.0","0.0","14.0","0","1050","92.64","68.97","19.36","82.16","19.81","19.81","78.29","42.67","5.81","2.86","0.19","0.10","0.00","1.14","1.43","2.95","8.76","13.81","6.00","3.71","6.67","0.57","11.81","5.62","3.14","1.14","3.33","2.86","3.52","3.33","0.19","0.00","0.19","0.00","8.19","0.10","0.29","0.00","1.24","9.14","1.62","2.19","0.38","2.38","0.86","2.57","3.24","0.29","1.52","0.38","3.71","0.29","0.00","0.10","3.14","5.43","1.71","1.90","1.62","1.05","0.19","4.48","7.05","0.67","12.95","1.62","7.71","3.81","2.67","4.10","1.33","2.48","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.10","0.00","14.00","5.24","4.29","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.76","2.10","0.95","0.00","0.57","4756","7.54","20.403846153846153","1439","1041","54","68.81","10.2","8.5","10.33","10.6","194","10.8","17.17437079731028","479","19.13","12","0.43","0","52","32","101","0","121","77","9","2","7","183","78","2","74","0","0","31","7","53","1","1","2","28","0","37","46","26","15","23","32","8","6","0","4"

Californians have a right to learn the names of police officers involved in shootings, unless there is evidence that public disclosure would endanger the officer, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday.

""The public's substantial interest in the conduct of its peace officers outweighs, in most cases, the officer's personal privacy interest,"" the court said in a 6-1 ruling. Names could be withheld only if there was specific evidence of danger or the need to protect an undercover officer.

The ruling means the names of UC Davis police who pepper-sprayed student protesters in 2011 are likely to be made public, said news media attorney Kelli Sager. A state appeals court ordered the university to release those names last year, but the state's high court put the case on hold until it ruled on disclosures in police shootings.

Thursday's case comes from Long Beach, where two officers fatally shot 35-year-old Douglas Zerby in December 2010, when he pointed an object at them that looked like a gun but proved to be a garden hose nozzle.

Not a personnel record

The Los Angeles Times asked the city for the officers' names and the names of all Long Beach police involved in shootings since January 2005. The two officers' names were later disclosed in a civil suit, in which a jury found excessive force and awarded Zerby's family $6.5 million. Long Beach has appealed that verdict and has refused to identify any other officers.

Other news organizations, including Hearst Corp., which owns The Chronicle, argued for disclosure in court filings.

Police unions sided with the city, arguing that revealing the names would subject officers and their families to retaliation. They also noted that police ""personnel records"" are confidential under California law.

But the court said Thursday that the name of an officer who shoots someone is not a personnel record and can be disclosed without revealing any disciplinary proceedings.

A state law requiring uniformed officers to wear a badge with their name or identification number ""reflects a legislative policy that, generally, the public has a right to know the identity of an officer involved in an on-duty shooting,"" Justice Joyce Kennard said in the majority opinion.

'Huge safety risk'

In dissent, Justice Ming Chin said the majority was requiring law enforcement agencies to disclose ""potentially incendiary information.""

The ruling creates a ""huge safety risk,"" said James Trott, lawyer for the Long Beach Police Officers Association. While previous records requests have come from news media, he said, the ruling means officers' names can also be sought by ""a Crips or a Blood member,"" and ""a city would have no way of knowing.""

But Sager, the Times' lawyer in the case, said courts already make officers' names available to family members of victims who sue the police, or to a shooting victim who survives and is charged with a crime. Only the public is kept in the dark, she said.","2014-05-29 13:30:00","1","54.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","157.0","152.0","0.0","219.0","0.0","12.0","0","498","96.88","79.48","28.94","29.12","26.21","25.10","77.71","40.16","5.22","1.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.60","0.80","3.82","11.85","11.65","5.42","2.01","4.42","0.80","10.64","1.00","0.60","1.61","2.01","1.20","3.61","1.81","1.61","0.40","0.40","0.00","12.05","0.60","0.00","0.20","0.40","11.65","4.62","1.00","1.20","2.61","0.60","3.01","3.01","1.00","2.01","0.00","0.60","0.40","0.20","0.00","0.00","12.85","1.41","0.80","9.44","0.20","1.20","4.02","6.02","0.20","11.85","0.60","7.23","4.02","5.02","1.61","0.80","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.27","4.02","5.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.00","2.81","2.61","0.00","0.20","2422","8.58","26.526315789473685","746","493","20","54.86","14.1","11.7","12.83","15.1","116","11.0","21.291764705882354","260","24.26","3","0.38","0","15","11","63","0","53","25","0","1","6","96","48","1","48","0","0","6","3","11","0","0","0","12","0","17","29","9","13","11","15","3","4","0","2"

California lawmakers voted Monday to direct the secretary of state's office to delay printing voter guides listing ballot measures in order to give themselves two more days to reach a deal to revise an unpopular $11 billion water bond currently on the November statewide ballot.

Lawmakers said a deal was coming together, with the latest framework being worked on by Democratic legislators and Gov. Jerry Brown calling for a $7.2 billion water bond that includes $2.5 billion for new reservoirs,$500 million to improve water quality and $700 million for water recycling projects.

""We need these couple days to hopefully complete these negotiations,"" Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, said.

Republicans said the water bond negotiations are moving in the right direction, but that $3 billion for new reservoirs remains a top priority.

The water bond is seen as critical to improving California's water delivery system and combatting the effects of the current drought. Brown initially proposed a $6 billion bond, while state lawmakers proposed other amounts ranging from $7 billion to $10 billion.

In addition to extending the deadline for a water bond deal, lawmakers voted Monday to rename any revised water bond that appears on the ballot as Proposition 1, a move that will increase its visibility and viability with voters.

The $11 billion bond currently on the ballot as Proposition 43 was approved by the Legislature in 2009, but was pulled from the 2010 and 2012 ballots due to low voter approval ratings. The proposal has been called ""pork-filled"" with billions for nonessential programs.

The revised water bond would need to pass both houses of the Legislature with a two-thirds majority vote and earn Brown's signature to be placed on the ballot.

Republicans and Central Valley Democrats have made surface storage a top priority, saying a $3 billion investment is critical to earning their support for the bond. Last week, many of the Democratic proposals set aside $2 billion for new reservoirs. Monday's negotiations added $500 million for reservoirs, making the latest pitch more palatable to Republicans.

""I see progress,"" Senate Minority Leader Bob Huff, R-Diamond Bar, said. ""We aren't there yet.""

Lawmakers plan to meet Wednesday to potentially vote on a deal if it comes together.

Some environmental groups have raised concerns that bond money would fund the contentious delta tunnel proposal known as the Bay Delta Conservation Plan.

Lawmakers have said their proposals are ""tunnel neutral"" in order to gain support from opponents of the delta tunnels project championed by the governor. Brown's water bond proposal also included a ""tunnel-neutral"" disclaimer, but opponents raised concerns that bond money set aside for the delta ecosystem could be used to mitigate environmental issues with the tunnels.","2014-08-11 18:13:00","1","50.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","153.0","148.0","0.0","216.0","0.0","12.0","0","462","98.28","63.55","9.09","45.66","23.10","30.52","68.61","33.55","3.68","1.30","0.22","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.65","2.38","8.66","13.42","4.33","0.87","3.68","0.22","10.82","3.25","2.16","0.00","7.36","2.38","2.60","1.73","0.65","0.00","0.43","0.22","4.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.76","0.43","0.87","1.52","1.30","0.22","1.30","2.60","1.08","1.30","0.00","3.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.03","7.79","1.30","3.03","4.11","0.87","0.00","4.33","5.63","1.30","12.55","1.73","5.63","4.76","6.28","0.22","0.22","0.87","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.80","4.33","3.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.08","2.60","1.30","0.00","2.81","2369","8.68","23.5","738","456","22","50.46","13.2","11.4","14.16","14.5","116","9.0","20.45543859649123","243","21.55","3","0.34","0","10","35","45","0","48","34","1","2","4","87","43","4","34","0","0","5","3","10","1","0","0","20","0","19","17","14","14","8","8","3","0","0","0"

Sacramento --

California lawmakers voted Wednesday night to swap out an unpopular $11 billion water bond with one they hope voters will find more palatable: a scaled-back $7 billion version that earned widespread bipartisan support.

It was promptly signed by Gov. Jerry Brown.

The smaller water bond will appear on the November statewide ballot as Proposition 1. Included in the deal is $2.7 billion for water storage projects, $900 million for groundwater cleanup and monitoring, $725 million for water recycling and $1.5 billion for watershed restoration programs.

The water bond is seen as critical to improving California's water delivery system and combatting the effects of the current drought and those that follow.

""This bond has a great deal of good for everyone and harms no one,"" said Sen. Lois Wolk, D-Davis.

In addition to asking voters to approve $7.12 billion in new bond debt, the deal struck Wednesday redirects $425 million in existing unspent bond funds to bring the total spending plan to $7.5 billion. The new water bond replaces the $11 billion one from 2009, which was twice pulled from the ballot due to low voter approval ratings.

The vote Wednesday night came against a tight deadline. Lawmakers voted Monday to direct the secretary of state's office to delay printing voter guides listing ballot measures in order to give themselves two more days to reach a deal. Lawmakers also voted to rename the water bond from Proposition 43 to Prop. 1 to increase its visibility and viability with voters.

Republicans and Central Valley Democrats made surface storage a top priority, saying $3 billion was needed to finance two reservoirs by building dams on the Upper San Joaquin River at Temperance Flat and near the town of Maxwell in Colusa County. Democratic leaders initially offered $2 billion for surface storage before reaching a compromise.

Sen. Anthony Cannella, R-Ceres (Stanislaus County), said the overwhelming bipartisan support for the revised water bond shows lawmakers didn't settle. The bond passed the Assembly 77-1, with Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks (San Bernardi no County), casting the lone no vote. The Senate unanimously passed it 37-0.

""I would argue this is a superior bond,"" Cannella said.

Brown said Tuesday that having bipartisan support in getting the bond to the ballot would go a long way with voters.

""That builds confidence in a very important way,"" Brown said.

Some environmental groups raised concerns that bond money would fund the contentious Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta tunnel proposal known as the Bay Delta Conservation Plan.

The State Lands Commission filed suit Tuesday to overturn San Francisco's voter-approved limits on high-rise buildings along the city's waterfront, arguing that the lands belong to the state and are managed by the Port Commission, not the city and its voters.

Proposition B, which requires voter approval for any shoreline development that exceeds current height limits, ""targets state-owned tide and submerged lands over which the Legislature has expressly precluded the right of local initiative,"" state lawyers said in papers filed in San Francisco Superior Court.

They also said Prop. B's curbs on development would drain the Port Commission of badly needed revenue.

Prop. B, sponsored by the Sierra Club's San Francisco chapter and other supporters of limited growth, passed with a 59 percent majority on June 3.

Developers sought to remove the measure from the ballot in a suit filed in February with arguments similar to those in Tuesday's state lawsuit.

Superior Court Judge Marla Miller allowed the vote to proceed, ruling in March that the developers had not clearly shown that Prop. B was invalid. She cited numerous past local ballot measures, some developer-sponsored, that sought to regulate San Francisco waterfront lands.

The developers' suit is still alive and may be consolidated with the new state lawsuit. The San Francisco Giants, who plan a high-rise neighborhood in an area that is now the main parking lot for AT&T Park, helped to bankroll the February suit but have now withdrawn their support.

City Attorney Dennis Herrera said Tuesday that he would strongly defend Prop. B in court. The Lands Commission suit is ""a radical departure in law and practice from land-use decision-making in San Francisco and elsewhere,"" which for decades has involved city voters and elected leaders, he said.

The Lands Commission consists of Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, state Controller John Chiang and state Finance Director Michael Cohen.

Jon Golinger, who ran the Prop. B campaign, referred to the commission Tuesday as a ""rogue state agency trying to make a power play.""

According to the Lands Commission suit, the shoreline consists of tidelands that California obtained as state property when it became a state in 1850. The state transferred the land to the city in a 1968 law that specified it would be managed by the autonomous Port Commission and not by city officials or voters, the suit said.

Prop. B's supporters, however, say the land has been managed much differently since at least 1990, when voters banned hotels on the city's piers and placed a moratorium on waterfront construction until the city adopted a comprehensive development plan.

That plan, later adopted by both the Board of Supervisors and the Port Commission, contained the height limits that vary from one site to another. Prop. B holds those limits in place unless voters approve an exception for a specific project.

Backers of a proposed residential and commercial development on Pier 70 have already submitted signatures for a November measure to raise the limit on their site from 40 to 90 feet.","2014-07-15 16:34:00","1","54.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","19.0","0.0","197.0","198.0","0.0","375.0","0.0","13.0","0","793","99.00","61.91","34.06","64.03","19.83","25.60","64.82","33.17","3.66","0.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.38","2.90","8.95","14.63","2.40","1.26","3.40","0.38","6.18","2.52","1.39","0.88","5.42","1.26","3.03","2.52","0.50","0.00","0.25","0.00","4.67","0.00","0.13","0.13","0.25","4.54","0.76","1.01","0.50","0.88","0.25","1.26","3.15","1.77","1.39","0.00","1.77","0.13","0.76","0.00","0.88","8.32","1.51","2.02","4.67","0.63","0.25","3.28","3.28","0.50","17.40","1.01","10.47","6.18","4.16","2.14","0.25","0.38","0.00","0.13","2.02","0.00","1.77","0.25","0.00","0.00","17.40","5.80","6.68","0.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.88","0.76","2.02","0.00","0.63","3735","7.51","19.658536585365855","1174","781","38","59.03","12.6","10.1","11.78","12.4","141","5.571428571428571","17.461510883482713","309","18.12","28","0.33","0","15","43","78","6","104","20","1","1","4","118","225","3","32","0","0","6","3","17","0","0","0","17","1","14","33","3","17","12","22","7","2","0","2"

Commissioners of the Pac-12 and Big Ten conferences believe it is time to bring college sports in line with the century in which its student-athletes are competing.

Change is coming to major college sports and the two conferences figure to be leading the charge.

""The scholarship model has not evolved since the 1970s,"" Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said. ""We want to make sure our scholarships provide full cost of attendance. We want to make sure we're doing everything we can for student-athletes within the collegiate model.""

Pac-12 university presidents sent a letter to their counterparts in the other four major football conferences (Big Ten, SEC, Big 12 and ACC) advocating major changes to what many see as outdated practices by the NCAA regarding student-athletes.

""It's not rocket science but it is complex and is worth preserving,"" Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany said. ""In the last 25, 30 years, we have not been able to evolve to a 21st century response to our problems.""

Scott and Delany were in San Francisco on Wednesday to announce a six-year agreement by their conferences to meet in a bowl game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. The as-yet unnamed game will be played Tuesday, Dec. 30, between the fourth Pac-12 team selected for a bowl and a team in the top half of the Big Ten.

This year's will be the 13th Bay Area bowl game, the first 12 of which were played at AT&T Park under various title sponsors. Working with the 49ers on marketing the bowl, executive director Gary Cavalli said a sponsor should be in place soon.

The Dec. 30 game will be the last bowl before the inaugural playoff group of bowls on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day to decide the opponents for the championship game a week later.

""We think we're in a great position to grow the game,"" Delany said, ""and do it with an old partner. ... Beneath that championship level, I think there's still room for bowls. That's always been important to the Big Ten.""

The commissioners later appeared at the Commonwealth Club for a discussion titled ""Inside College Football: Ask the Commissioners.""

There's plenty to ask these days, whether it's prudent for Northwestern football players to unionize as employees of the university or if athletic scholarships should be guaranteed for a ""reasonable"" length of time to allow students to graduate.

Though Delany said the Big Ten's position is that the Northwestern players are students and not employees of the university, ""On the substantive matters raised ... I think there's a lot of merit. Students spend too much time on sports. Athletic scholarships can be enhanced to cover the cost of attendance.""","2014-05-21 22:02:00","1","49.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","153.0","148.0","0.0","216.0","0.0","12.0","0","459","96.91","72.17","39.41","62.94","19.12","22.44","79.08","44.01","6.32","2.83","0.44","1.96","0.00","0.00","0.44","3.49","10.24","15.69","7.63","1.74","3.70","0.87","13.73","4.79","1.74","0.87","4.58","1.31","2.40","2.18","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.41","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","8.28","1.74","1.96","1.31","0.87","1.09","2.18","1.53","0.44","1.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.76","4.79","2.40","5.66","0.22","0.22","2.83","9.80","1.09","16.34","1.53","8.93","5.88","8.06","4.79","0.22","1.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.17","6.32","3.27","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.96","3.92","2.83","0.44","0.22","2128","7.63","20.52173913043478","651","449","23","68.6","12.4","8.5","11.66","11.8","86","7.5","17.461469933184855","240","18.74","7","0.43","0","11","19","50","0","51","33","0","0","7","72","59","1","32","0","0","14","5","13","0","0","0","20","0","20","11","9","9","19","11","2","1","0","0"

A Berkeley police officer and the officers' union have sued the city and its Police Review Commission alleging that confidential information about the officer's actions in connection with an in-custody death of a transgender woman were improperly leaked to the Daily Californian, UC Berkeley's student newspaper.

The controversy centers on the Feb. 12, 2013, death of Kayla Moore, 41. Moore lost consciousness and died after a struggle with officers at the Gaia apartment complex at 2116 Allston Way.

Moore's death sparked outcry among critics of police, who asserted that officers had acted improperly in dealing with Moore because she was transgender and African American.

The Alameda County coroner determined that the cause of her death was ""acute combined drug intoxication"" and that conditions that contributed to her death included morbid obesity and an enlarged heart.

In a report in May, the Daily Californian, citing ""leaked documents,"" said the Berkeley Police Review Commission had found that Officer Gwendolyn Brown ""did not constantly monitor (Moore's) vital signs.""

The commission investigates citizen complaints of police misconduct.

In a suit filed Monday in Alameda County Superior Court, attorneys for the Berkeley Police Association said Brown ""has suffered severe emotional stress as well as damage to her professional reputation as a police officer as a result of the deliberate and unauthorized disclosure of confidential and private (commission) information.""

The police union previously demanded an investigation into the leak, and officers refused to participate in commission proceedings pending the probe, which looked into whether commission staff - but not commissioners themselves - had disclosed the information, the suit said.

The city only asked commissioners to sign an affidavit stating that they did not provide the Daily Californian with any confidential information, the complaint said.

""This is absurd - signing a piece of paper after the fact saying they didn't do anything wrong is not an investigation,"" Berkeley police Sgt. Chris Stines, president of the union, said Tuesday. ""Berkeley police are accountable to the law and the (commission) must be, too. Anything less is hypocrisy.""

The suit alleges invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence, and seeks a court injunction barring the city from mandating that officers appear or testify before the commission. The injunction would last until either the source of the leak is found and removed from the commission or ""all current commissioners are replaced.""

The defendants have not responded to the suit in court.

The suit said all the officers involved in the incident were cleared of wrongdoing by the department, the district attorney's office and the coroner's office. Police have said the officers involved in the incident used an appropriate amount of force to control a combative person.

Officers came to the apartment complex to investigate a reported disturbance between Moore and at least one roommate, authorities said. Police have said Moore became ""increasingly agitated and uncooperative to the officers' commands and began to scream and violently resist.""

Police placed her in restraints, but Moore continued to kick and scream, prompting officers to request a gurney from the Fire Department, authorities said. At one point, officers discovered she was not breathing and began CPR, but Moore died at a hospital.

Moore's father, Arthur Moore, has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Berkeley that is pending.","2014-08-05 17:20:00","1","53.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","153.0","148.0","0.0","217.0","0.0","13.0","0","554","97.57","62.07","14.38","2.29","22.16","32.31","75.99","40.97","4.33","1.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.08","0.54","2.71","11.91","12.82","5.23","0.90","5.78","1.26","10.11","3.79","1.81","0.54","1.08","1.44","4.15","0.72","3.43","0.72","0.36","0.36","7.04","0.18","0.18","1.26","0.18","8.48","2.53","1.44","0.36","1.26","0.72","2.71","3.43","0.90","2.35","0.18","1.26","0.36","0.90","0.00","0.18","10.11","0.90","0.72","8.48","0.00","0.36","6.68","3.43","0.18","10.83","0.90","6.50","3.43","5.96","0.00","0.54","0.90","0.00","1.81","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","16.25","4.51","5.05","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.72","2.89","1.99","1.08","0.00","2980","9.13","23.458333333333332","933","553","25","40.58","15.3","13.1","15.26","16.1","154","8.8","21.979240506329116","281","21.21","3","0.41","0","26","6","68","0","65","33","1","1","2","109","67","0","34","2","0","5","5","17","0","0","0","14","0","12","42","12","18","9","11","3","1","0","0"

Sacramento --

A cottage industry that profits from posting mug shots - then charging embarrassed people fees to remove them - is facing increasing scrutiny as California could become the latest state to make the practice illegal.

The state Legislature approved a bill Monday that would fine commercial websites $1,000 if they charge fees to remove arrest photos. The bill now heads to Gov. Jerry Brown.

""It's clearly extortion,"" said Sen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, who authored the bill.

Hill said websites like Just Mugshots and MugshotsOnline.com represent a growing practice of shaking down people who were arrested by posting their mug shots online. Dozens of websites across the country charge hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars to remove the mug shots, with no guarantees that the photos won't then pop up on another site. The websites often include mug shots of people who were arrested but never charged or convicted of a crime, which is especially concerning, Hill said.

Eight states have passed legislation in the past two years to curb what has been called a mug shot racket, including Texas, Utah, Colorado and Georgia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Some groups have questioned whether restricting the use of arrest information would negatively impact public or media access. Hill said his bill doesn't change what information is available. Under SB1027, websites charging people to remove mug shots would face a $1,000 fine for each solicited payment and be subject to a civil lawsuit by the person whose mug shot was used.

""We want to end the for-profit dissemination of mug shots,"" Hill said. ""This sullies reputations and hinders employment.""

Bob DeBrino, a film producer and former New York City police officer, advocated for the bill after he was arrested in Los Angeles County last year on suspicion of driving under the influence of methadone and the prescription drug Adderall. Doctors prescribed DeBrino the medication for an impending surgery and the charges were later dropped. However, he said his mug shot was put on a website that demanded thousands of dollars to remove it.

""It's about time to stand up to these con men who are ruining lives,"" DeBrino said, according to legislative analysis of the bill.","2014-08-05 09:21:00","1","47.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","153.0","148.0","0.0","216.0","0.0","12.0","0","381","93.09","70.03","7.45","30.19","20.05","26.77","70.60","40.16","6.82","2.10","0.00","0.26","0.00","1.05","0.79","4.72","7.87","13.39","6.56","2.10","4.20","1.31","11.02","2.62","1.57","2.36","2.62","1.05","2.36","1.31","1.05","0.79","0.00","0.26","7.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.31","8.14","1.57","1.57","1.84","1.84","1.05","1.57","2.89","1.05","1.84","0.00","2.36","0.52","1.84","0.00","0.00","5.51","0.52","0.52","3.15","0.79","0.52","5.25","5.25","1.05","12.07","3.15","4.20","4.72","3.94","0.26","0.00","3.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.75","5.25","5.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.57","2.10","1.05","0.00","0.52","1889","8.36","21.38888888888889","574","376","19","59.84","12.8","9.8","13.11","13.1","89","6.0","19.38808510638298","230","20.22","3","0.37","0","10","5","35","0","37","18","0","1","5","58","44","0","38","0","0","8","3","12","0","0","3","14","0","16","21","15","13","9","9","4","6","1","0"
"https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Time-to-pass-Laura-s-Law-in-San-Francisco-5603124.php","Time to pass Laura's Law in San Francisco","Time to pass Laura's Law in San Francisco

Millions of individuals across our country are slipping through the cracks of our mental health system and many are right here in San Francisco.

In our city, there are hundreds of individuals who are suffering from severe mental illnesses. Too many are falling through the cracks of our mental health services system. The proof is right before our eyes on our streets every day. We have too many people dealing with serious mental health issues, such as schizophrenia, often self-medicating with drugs and alcohol.

We need to do more. We need to change how we help those who are clearly suffering, and who cannot help themselves. We owe it to those individuals, their families and city residents to provide the best care possible.

Here in the city of St. Francis, we need more effective tools to help those in our community who are suffering. Laura's Law, a state law that requires local adoption, helps those with a clinically identified severe mental illness, and gets them into our high-quality, compassionate, community-based mental health treatment services.

According to numerous research studies, approximately half of those with severe mental illness are unable to recognize their own diagnosis. This same research finds a clear link between lack of insight regarding one's own mental illness and the ability to seek treatment - which results in poorer clinical outcomes, illness relapse, hospitalization, incarceration and, at times, violence.

Laura's Law is not a panacea for mental health treatment, but rather a strong tool in our toolbox. Laura's Law gives our city the ability to get people into treatment before they are in crisis.

Laura's Law is the compassionate option family members need to ensure their loved ones do not fail to get the treatment they need and deserve. As it is now, families have no option when a loved one decides to no longer seek treatment.

Amanda Wilcox, the mother of Laura Wilcox, a college student who was killed by a psychiatric patient in 2001 and for whom the law is named, believes there is a way to engage people with mental illness who desperately need mental health services while at the same time respecting their civil rights. We couldn't agree more.

Laura's Law is a less restrictive, less expensive alternative to involuntary hospitalization, and similar laws enacted and implemented across the country have produced dramatically positive results. Laura's Law helps local jurisdictions realize significant cost-savings through the reduction of hospitalizations and incarcerations. These cost-savings will help our city use financial resources more efficiently, allowing us to invest more in existing mental health programs and our social safety net that have proven to produce the best outcomes.

These are hard-to-reach individuals who oftentimes do not steadily access treatment until they are compelled to do so through the criminal justice system. Laws in other states similar to Laura's Law have shown drastic reductions in arrests and incarcerations, which in turn help alleviate the burden of our city's first-responders, emergency services and County Jail.

In order to make a difference at the local level, we must continue to challenge ourselves to do better.

After getting beat up at the ballot box in the last two election cycles, San Francisco real estate interests made a comeback Tuesday as voters widely approved the rezoning of a huge waterfront property for development and rejected a new property transfer tax meant to curtail speculation and evictions.

With nearly all the votes counted, the Pier 70 measure, Prop. F, was up 72.3 percent to 27.6 percent. Prop. G, the anti-speculation transfer tax, narrowed the gap as the night progressed, but still lost 53.96 percent to 46.04 percent.

In a city where waterfront development proposals invariably become political brawls, developer Forest City took a different tack at Pier 70, spending three years meeting with neighbors before coming up with a project that had what most residents were looking for: ample affordable housing, plenty of open space, and heights that would not block views or cast shadows in the adjacent Dogpatch.

The project won the endorsement of every elected official in town, environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, and neighborhood coalitions including the Dogpatch Neighborhood Association.

In the end it paid off. The measure was on a way to a rout.

Proposition F would increase height limits from 40 feet to 90 feet on 28 acres of land at Pier 70, a 65-acre waterfront property that once was home to the largest shipbuilding operation on the West Coast. Under the plan, Forest City would build 90-foot structures on about 30 percent of the property, a combination of offices and housing. About nine acres of the property would be parkland, and the rest would be a mix of restored historic buildings and five- to six-story apartment buildings. “We are excited for the neighborhood and the city and ready to take the next step toward revitalizing Pier 70,” said Alexa Arena, senior vice president for Forest City.

About 600 of the project’s 2,000 housing units — about 30 percent — would rent for below market rate.

Much more controversial was Prop. G, an antispeculation ballot measure that would impose a gradual real estate transfer tax on any short-term flip. Prop. G was an effort to create an economic disincentive to investors who buy rental buildings, and evict renters before converting them to condos.

But in the end, concerns that real estate speculation is wrecking San Francisco’s neighborhoods was not enough to overcome homeowners’ fears of a major new real estate tax.

The antispeculation ballot measure would have imposed a gradual real estate transfer tax on any short-term flip — defined as a property between two and 30 units that is bought and sold in fewer than five years. If the resale had fallen within one year of the purchase, the tax would have been 24 percent of the resale price; at two years, 22 percent; at three years, 20 percent; at four years, 18 percent; and finally, at five years, 14 percent.

Right now, the city’s residential transfer tax rages from 0.5 percent to 2.5 percent, depending on the price of the transaction.

Local and national real estate groups spent heavily to defeat the proposition, led by an $800,000 donation from the National Association of Realtors, $170,000 from the San Francisco Association of Realtors, $425,000 from the California Association of Realtors Issues Mobilization PAC, and $200,000 from a committee set up by Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

Proponents of the tax say it would have kept speculators from flipping apartment buildings, especially rent-controlled units that are part of the shrinking affordable housing supply in San Francisco. The No on G forces say the measure would have punished ordinary homeowners who need to sell their properties in a hurry because of illness, job relocation or other reasons.

For pro-G forces, it was a campaign wrought with emotion. On Oct. 14, San Francisco Tenants Union leader Ted Gullicksen, one of the main architects of Proposition G, passed away unexpectedly. His death left supporters reeling but as determined as ever to “leave it all on the table,” said Quintin Mecke, who ran the Yes On G campaign. Prop. G volunteers spoke of “turnout for Ted” and “G For Gullicksen.”

A third real estate measure on the ballot also won handily, although it will have little meaningful impact. Prop. K, a policy statement meant to deal with the housing crunch, is a watered-down compromise of a much more aggressive and controversial proposal by Supervisor Jane Kim and some affordable housing advocates that ran into staunch opposition from Mayor Ed Lee and developers. It won 65 percent to 34 percent.

Prop. K will make it official city policy to construct or rehabilitate 30,000 new housing units by 2020, with at least one-third of those permanently affordable to low- and moderate-income households, and half within reach of middle-class San Franciscans.

A car owner who uses a motor vehicle, their own or someone else's, is covered by insurance under California law for any resulting injuries. But what about a passerby who comes across a car accident, carries an injured passenger out of the vehicle, and in doing so, makes the injuries worse?

The passerby is covered for damages, a divided federal appeals court said Wednesday, because the law says ""unloading"" a car, with the driver's permission, is the same as using it.

The definition is ""counterintuitive,"" the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged, since ""unloading an injured passenger is not the way most people use a car."" But that's what the law says, the court concluded in a 2-1 ruling.

The case stems from a Los Angeles-area accident in October 2003, when Anthony Watson lost control of his car and hit a light pole, injuring Watson and his passenger, Alexandra Van Horn. Friends of theirs were following in a second car, and one of them, Lisa Torti, went to Watson's car and pulled Van Horn out, saying afterward she saw the vehicle smoking and feared it would explode.

In a lawsuit, Van Horn alleged Torti had grabbed her roughly in pulling her free, contributing to spinal injuries that left her permanently paralyzed.

One of Torti's insurers agreed to cover her and settled Van Horn's suit for $4 million, but Torti's and Watson's auto insurers both denied coverage, saying Torti was not ""using"" Watson's car when she removed Van Horn. The dispute among the insurance companies wound up in federal court.

In Wednesday's ruling, Judge Harry Pregerson said a 1984 California insurance law defines ""use"" of a motor vehicle as ""operating, maintaining, loading or unloading"" the vehicle.

The law applies to nonowners who use an insured vehicle with the owner's permission, Pregerson said - so it would not apply to a burglar who broke into a car, but would apply to Torti, whose actions had drawn no objection from Watson, the car's owner.

In dissent, Timothy Murphy, a visiting judge from the federal appeals court in Denver, said the law should be reasonably interpreted to apply only to someone who was actually using the vehicle, by traveling in it or unloading cargo.","2014-08-13 16:48:00","1","46.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","153.0","148.0","0.0","215.0","0.0","12.0","0","379","95.07","68.25","13.97","18.03","29.15","27.70","70.71","41.95","7.12","2.90","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.11","0.79","4.22","11.08","12.40","4.49","2.11","6.07","1.06","12.93","1.85","1.32","2.90","2.37","0.79","2.11","0.79","1.32","0.26","0.00","0.53","8.71","0.00","0.26","1.58","0.53","10.03","1.58","3.69","1.06","1.85","0.00","2.90","2.90","0.53","2.11","0.26","2.90","1.85","2.37","0.00","0.26","6.86","0.26","0.26","5.54","0.26","0.53","3.96","4.75","0.00","13.19","5.28","6.07","1.85","2.37","0.26","0.00","1.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.32","3.69","8.97","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.79","3.17","3.17","0.00","0.26","1788","8.87","28.0","575","377","14","52.63","14.6","12.6","11.96","15.5","93","8.4","22.627374005305043","196","24.71","3","0.43","0","15","8","45","0","40","19","0","0","4","76","46","0","16","0","0","8","6","10","0","1","2","8","0","7","25","18","7","5","14","1","7","1","3"

San Francisco voters, keenly aware of the rising cost of living in one of the most expensive cities in the nation, voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

Nearly complete returns showed San Francisco’s Proposition J cruising to victory with more than two-thirds support. With almost 98 percent of precincts reporting, the measure had more than 76 percent support.

The consensus measure faced no mobilized opposition or spending against it. It would make San Francisco the second city in the nation after Seattle to raise its minimum wage to $15 amid a national conversation about the widening gulf between the rich and poor.

A similar ballot measure in Oakland had an even wider lead with almost half of the votes counted. It had 80 percent support with 44 percent of precincts reporting.Measure FF would raise Oakland’s minimum wage from $9 to $12.25 starting in March. Both measures need only a simple majority to pass.

Labor leaders hope to use momentum from the two Bay Area elections and other progress in the region and around the country to generate support for raising the minimum wage in other cities, statewide and then other states, like Oregon, Nevada and Massachusetts.

“Think of it as 'The California Model,’” said Shum Preston, a spokesman for the Service Employees International Union Local 1021, which was a driving force behind both wage measures before voters.

“These ballot initiatives are the right issue at the right time,” Preston said. “This is a strong example of the traditional progressive left in the Bay Area not only being relevant, but driving a national agenda.”

The issue was also championed by San Francisco’s more moderate and business-friendly mayor, Ed Lee. In nearly four years in office, Lee has embraced technology companies and relentlessly pushed a job creation agenda but now presides over a city that a Brookings Institution report in March found has the fastest-growing gap between the rich and poor.

“To me, it’s a bit personal,” said Lee, who washed dishes in his family's Seattle restaurant growing up. “I know what (low-wage workers) are going through. I’ve washed those dishes. ... We are now going to be the light for the rest of the country to lead the way on a real, true minimum wage.”

Prop. J would gradually raise the minimum wage from the current $10.74 an hour to $15 by July 2018, boosting the paychecks of at least 60,000 restaurant, retail and other minimum-wage workers by $75 to $197 a week, according to an analysis by the San Francisco controller’s office.

Prop. J gets to $15 faster than Seattle’s law, which phases it in over seven years for small businesses. It also does not have an exemption like Seattle’s law to count tips toward the minimum wage. Prop J. covers nearly all workers in the city, exempting only youths under 18 in government-subsidized training programs or people over 55 at some government-subsidized nonprofits. That makes it more comprehensive than a requirement the Los Angeles City Council approved in September to pay workers at large hotels $15.37 an hour.

The measure is a compromise that Lee brokered between business interests, nonprofits, the SEIU and others. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to place Prop. J on the ballot. Oakland’s Measure FF was put on the ballot by the SEIU and its allies through a petition drive.

Despite misgivings, the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, the restaurant industry advocacy group, is officially neutral on Prop. J, as is the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. The San Francisco Council of District Merchants Associations opposed the measure but didn’t spend any money or campaign against it.

Despite the lack of opposition, plenty of cash flowed to at least four campaign committees supporting Prop. J, which some analysts said was being used as a promotional vehicle for other political goals.

Wealthy tech investor Ron Conway, one of Lee’s biggest political backers, chipped in $124,000, campaign finance records show. Conway is an investor in short-term rental site Airbnb and ride service Uber, companies that have benefited from Lee’s embrace of tech firms.

The San Francisco Police Officers Association kicked in $143,500. Embattled utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co. contributed $105,000 to a campaign committee backing all five of Lee’s ballot priorities, including Prop. J. Early Facebook investor Sean Parker donated $50,000 to support Prop. J.

Lee is up for re-election next year. He was featured in four different photos in a recent Prop. J mailer that was headlined: “Take it from a former dishwasher: Yes on J.”

Supervisor Jane Kim, who was up for re-election Tuesday and is believed to have her eye on higher office, had no competitive challenger but paid for a cable TV commercial to extol Prop J.

A state appeals court upheld a Hayward man's second-degree murder conviction but overturned his life-without-parole sentence Wednesday for a crash that killed a San Francisco police officer after a string of robberies and a high-speed chase.

Steven Petrilli was the driver of a stolen minivan that police spotted at a McDonald's restaurant in the Bayview neighborhood after four robberies in July 2006. He drove off, was chased on highways and city streets, and crashed into a police cruiser, killing 39-year-old Officer Nick-Tomasito Birco.

A jury convicted Petrilli of the robberies as well as second-degree murder, and of murder during the course of a robbery, punishable by life without parole. But the First District Court of Appeal said Wednesday that he was entitled to a new trial on the latter charge because of a state Supreme Court ruling in another case last year.

Under standard instructions at the time, Petrilli's trial judge told jurors they could convict him of murder in the course of a robbery if he was fleeing from police who suspected him of the robbery. Under last year's ruling, the appeals court said, jurors should have been allowed to decide whether Petrilli had reached a place of temporary safety at the McDonald's. That would mean the fatal crash, though still murder, would not be punishable by life without parole.

The court also overturned three of Petrilli's four robbery convictions, saying his wife, who was in the car, should have been allowed to refuse to testify against him.","2014-05-28 17:25:00","1","43.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","157.0","152.0","0.0","218.0","0.0","11.0","0","264","97.72","58.97","18.09","2.45","29.33","24.24","71.97","45.08","6.06","3.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.03","0.38","2.65","10.98","16.67","6.06","1.52","4.92","1.52","9.09","2.65","1.52","1.14","3.03","0.38","4.92","1.14","3.79","0.00","3.41","0.00","7.58","0.38","0.38","0.38","3.79","8.33","1.14","1.14","2.27","0.76","0.00","3.79","1.14","0.00","1.14","0.00","1.52","0.00","1.14","0.00","0.38","8.71","0.76","0.38","6.82","0.00","0.76","4.55","1.89","0.00","15.91","1.52","7.95","6.44","2.65","0.76","0.38","0.00","0.00","3.41","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.00","14.39","3.41","4.92","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.03","0.00","3.03","0.00","0.00","1272","8.19","30.22222222222222","373","256","9","51.11","12.3","13.2","12.94","17.1","51","12.625","21.32875","147","26.44","2","0.42","0","6","5","28","1","44","14","0","0","5","61","28","0","13","0","0","7","2","5","0","0","1","4","0","8","21","4","8","0","2","3","2","0","0"

(05-23) 13:20 PDT SAN FRANCISCO -- A Marin County man who was originally sentenced to death for murdering his girlfriend's parents in 1975 has gained maturity and insight during his decades in prison, poses little risk of violence and should be paroled, says a state appeals court.

Charles Riley was 20 when he and his 16-year-old girlfriend, Marlene Olive, planned and carried out the murder of her parents, James and Naomi Olive, who had objected to their relationship, the First District Court of Appeal said Thursday. Riley hit Naomi Olive in her head with a hammer while she was asleep in their Terra Linda home, shot her husband in the back, and, with his girlfriend, burned their bodies in a fire pit, the court said.

Riley's death sentence was overturned after the state Supreme Court ruled California's former death penalty law unconstitutional in 1976, and he was resentenced to life with the possibility of parole, the maximum prison term under the law. Marlene Olive served a short term in a juvenile facility but has been convicted of numerous crimes as an adult.

In interviews with prison staff and parole officials, Riley described himself as a shy, overweight, drug-using teenager who had never had a girlfriend until he met Marlene Olive, a dominant personality who hated her parents and wanted them dead. Now 59, he has taken part in drug therapy and vocational training, has earned a college degree in prison and has been assessed by psychologists since the early 1990s as a low risk for violence.

Police and prosecutors have opposed Riley's release, and he has been denied parole more than a dozen times, most recently in 2011. The Board of Parole Hearings acknowledged his remorse and his achievements in prison but said he might relapse if released because he lacked insight into the reasons for his past drug use and the anger that fueled the murders.

But the appeals court said the board had shown no evidence that Riley was dangerous.

The murders, while ""horrific,"" were a ""one-time occurrence"" by someone who has committed no other acts of violence before or since, said Presiding Justice J. Anthony Kline in the 3-0 ruling.

He said Riley has a ""network of support"" from family and friends, suffers from physical disabilities, and has done everything within his power to show he is suitable for release. Kline also cited a Stanford study that found paroled life-term prisoners are far less likely to commit new crimes than others released from prison.

The court told the parole board to hold a hearing within 60 days to set a release date for Riley.","2014-05-23 13:21:00","1","47.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","158.0","152.0","0.0","220.0","0.0","12.0","0","455","89.60","86.41","2.96","1.00","30.33","21.54","74.95","44.40","8.57","5.93","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.05","0.88","2.64","8.13","13.41","7.03","1.32","6.81","0.66","11.87","4.84","2.64","1.32","3.96","0.88","4.62","0.44","4.18","0.66","1.98","0.66","13.63","1.10","1.32","1.10","4.40","7.25","1.32","1.32","1.10","1.54","0.88","1.98","2.64","0.22","1.98","0.44","2.42","0.66","1.76","0.00","0.22","9.45","2.64","1.32","4.62","0.88","0.88","7.25","4.62","0.22","12.53","0.22","5.93","6.59","2.42","0.22","0.44","0.22","0.00","1.98","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.07","3.30","5.93","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.98","1.32","0.88","0.44","0.00","2122","8.65","32.785714285714285","642","447","15","58.15","12.6","12.6","11.91","16.7","100","17.333333333333332","22.86854586129754","254","28.93","5","0.42","0","21","17","38","0","61","23","1","0","3","87","49","0","26","0","0","12","15","8","1","1","0","7","0","8","36","2","21","2","12","2","5","0","1"

A tearful, bleary-eyed Libby Schaaf declared victory in the Oakland mayor's race at 2:15 a.m. Wednesday after Alameda County elections officials released preliminary instant runoff results that showed her finishing far ahead of second-place candidate Rebecca Kaplan.

“I can't wait to run Oakland the way that we ran this campaign,” the councilwoman told a dozen jubilant supporters gathered at her campaign headquarters. “Never let anyone tell you you can't do something. Not even yourself.”

Schaaf started out in the lead and climbed to apparent victory with 63 percent of the vote by defeating 14 other candidates gunning for the seat. Kaplan, also a councilwoman, finished with 37 percent of the vote after incumbent Mayor Jean Quan was eliminated and her votes redistributed to Schaaf and Kaplan.

A spokesman for Kaplan called Schaaf’s announcement “premature” and said the results would not be final until every single vote was counted.

“I don’t think any campaign should declare anything until all the ballots have been counted,” said Jason Overman, the spokeman.

A spokesman for Quan did not return a call seeking comment, but said earlier in the night that wouldn’t consider the race settled until all the votes had been counted.

Indeed, Tim Dupuis, Alameda County’s registrar of voters said there were still 100,000 provisional and vote-by-mail ballots that had been submitted on election day that still had to be counted. Ballots turned in the day of the election, however, are generally considered to match the trends seen on election day.

Addisu Demissie, an Oakland-based political consultant, said that he would be shocked if either Kaplan or Quan collected enough votes to overtake Schaaf.

“This is not the same as the 2010 race,” Demissie said. “It is very rare for a candidate who is leading to get passed up.”

On Tuesday night, Schaaf stood amid an ecstatic standing-room only crowd at her campaign headquarters on Grand Avenue celebrating as results poured in.

“We in Oakland have watched the Bay Area prosper for so long and we always seem to be left out,” she said to her supporters, many of whom were once classmates of hers at Skyline High School. “Doesn't this feel like it is finally Oakland's time? Well, it is.”

The crowd erupted and began chanting “Libby, Libby, Libby.”

Earlier in the night, Quan had predicted that she would ultimately win in much the same fashion as she did in 2010, when she came from behind to beat the favorite, Don Perata.

“I'd put my record up against any mayor,” Quan told cheering supporters at her bustling campaign party at Scott's Seafood at Jack London Square. “I've been one of the best mayors we've had in the last decade.”

Late Tuesday, there were almost as many balloons as people at Kaplan's election party in Jack London Square, which took on a gloomy air. Kaplan left long before all the first place votes were counted.

“We've run a real strong campaign and we don't know the outcome,” said her campaign spokesman, Jason Overman on Tuesday night.

Under ranked-choice voting, if none of the candidates gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes, then the last-place candidate is eliminated and his or her second-and-third place votes are distributed. This process continues until one candidate receives more than 50 percent of the votes.

The 15 candidates vying for mayor this year included a port commissioner, city auditor, an Army combat veteran and an anti-drug crusader who once shot a teenage assailant. The three with the fewest votes were Saied Karamooz, Nancy Sidebotham and Pat McCullough. Assuming things don’t change by the time the last precinct is counted, their votes will be the first to be redistributed.

If Schaaf is officially confirmed as the winner, she will take over a city going though broad transformation. Housing prices are soaring as young, mostly white couples fleeing the high rents in San Francisco discover the warm weather and plucky Oakland charm. The police force is growing and homicides are at their lowest rate in years. Developers are opening grocery stores, clothing shops and banks even in historically crime-ridden East Oakland.

But the migration east, for all the wealth and stability it brings into Oakland, also risks pushing many longtime, less wealthy residents out to the suburbs where housing is more affordable.

“Oakland has no place but up to go from here and I think with the economy the way it is and the movement of more and more people into Oakland, the mayor is going to be in a very good position,” said Benjamin Bowser, a professor of sociology at Cal State East Bay who has studied Oakland since 1986. “This is a good time to be mayor because you can take the kudos and the credit for a lot of things that are happening on a more regional trend.”

Quan could be remembered as the mayor who, like Jerry Brown before her, dressed Oakland for success, Bowser said.

“It shouldn’t be as hard a job (for the next mayor) because the rough stuff has already been done,” Bowser said. “I think in the long run, whether she gets in or not, Quan is going to get the credit for a lot of the things that she did.”

The mud fest between ""Mug Shot"" Mary Hayashi and Bob ""the Bully"" Wieckowski for an East Bay state Senate seat ratcheted up a notch with the release of the in-store surveillance tape of Hayashi's 2011 shoplifting incident at San Francisco's Neiman Marcus.

The video - which runs over an hour and was taken by cameras throughout the store - shows Hayashi picking out nearly $2,500 worth of clothing, going into a dressing room with shopping bags, then paying for some of the clothing and being confronted by two security guards after walking out the door and down the street.

The tape was obtained from San Francisco police under a Freedom of Information Act request by Margarita Lacabe, who runs a blog called San Leandro Talk. Lacabe posted the video, selected highlights and choice-moment stills on the site.

""At the time of her arrest, (Hayashi) was the assemblywoman for our district,"" Lacabe said Tuesday. ""I just wanted to see what was going on.""

Lacabe is active in Democratic politics and is supporting Assemblyman Wieckowski in the race for the state Senate District 10 seat, which includes San Leandro, Fremont, Union City and Hayward.

Lacabe said police released the video to her last week. The full-color footage was edited down by the Wieckowski campaign to less than two minutes and put up on YouTube - complete with storyboard narration.

""It clearly disputes Hayashi's claim that she was hurried and distracted at the time,"" said Wieckowski campaign spokeswoman Lisa Tucker. ""It also shows that she was immediately put under surveillance and that they were on the lookout for her.""

We reported after the Castro Valley Democrat's arrest that a week before the shoplifting incident, a Neiman saleswoman noticed that a dress was missing after a woman matching Hayashi's description tried it on. When Hayashi walked into the Union Square store Oct. 25, 2011, the clerk alerted store security, and they began tracking her with surveillance cameras.

Hayashi's people shot back at Wieckowski's YouTube posting, saying he was tacitly endorsing Big Brother surveillance tactics.

""As someone who seems to be big on consumer rights, Bob Wieckowski should be investigating the concerns about privacy that arise out of the video,"" said Hayashi's campaign manager, Josh Pulliam. ""Instead, he is clearly getting his jollies with this video peeping on Mary Hayashi.""

Hayashi pleaded no contest to misdemeanor grand theft in January 2012 and was sentenced to three years' probation. She will be on probation through the November general election.

Hayashi has long maintained that she was distracted and inadvertently walked out of the store with a white blouse, black skirt and leather pants in a shopping bag without paying for them.

The video release comes just after Hayashi sent out a mailer to 10th District voters accusing Wieckowski of spending more than $500,000 on attack ads exploiting the incident.

""Bob the Bully knows that the only way he can win this election is by mudslinging and attacking Mary,"" the mailer says.

Wieckowski, who earlier put up a Mug Shot Mary website, makes no apologies for spotlighting the shoplifting conviction.

""She put out all these feel-good ads about herself, but when people here see that she is still on probation, it's like her support steps into an empty elevator shaft,"" Wieckowski said.

The ugliness is cutting both ways: Hayashi supporters outside the campaign have hit back with a website and TV ad saying Wieckowski ""protected rapists"" by voting against a measure in an Assembly committee preventing people convicted of sexually assaulting a spouse from receiving alimony after a divorce.

As usual, there is a tactical side to all the mudslinging.

The June 3 primary is shaping up as a three-way race between the labor-backed Wieckowski, the business-backed Hayashi and Republican Peter Kuo.

Given that 26 percent of the district is registered Republican, there's a good chance that Kuo will advance to the November runoff. That would mean either Wieckowski or Hayashi will be out in the cold.

So for both sides, it's all-or-nothing time.","2014-05-20 16:27:00","1","67.0","7.0","7.0","2.0","21.0","0.0","209.0","210.0","0.0","405.0","0.0","14.0","0","982","98.00","72.25","19.71","34.61","21.82","28.72","67.11","38.09","5.60","2.65","0.10","0.20","0.00","2.04","0.31","2.95","7.94","15.89","3.77","2.55","2.85","0.81","9.16","3.77","2.24","0.81","4.18","1.22","2.55","1.43","0.92","0.00","0.71","0.20","7.54","0.31","0.20","1.73","0.51","3.87","0.92","0.20","0.31","0.92","0.92","0.92","4.89","3.26","1.12","0.51","0.92","0.41","0.10","0.20","0.20","6.42","0.81","0.51","4.28","0.71","0.51","3.56","3.77","0.61","16.29","1.73","9.67","5.30","2.04","1.93","0.20","2.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.35","4.99","7.03","0.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.24","2.24","1.22","0.20","0.61","4913","7.8","24.21951219512195","1466","959","45","58.32","12.7","10.4","13.98","14.6","189","25.0","18.40321167883212","406","22.34","12","0.38","0","21","42","93","1","137","23","3","1","6","151","231","1","36","2","0","20","11","25","2","0","13","17","0","13","48","35","17","3","29","4","4","0","2"

California's 120 charter cities are covered by statewide voting-rights laws and must elect their city councils by districts, rather than citywide, if they have a history of racially polarized voting that reduces minority representation, a state appeals court has ruled.

Wednesday's decision involved the Los Angeles County community of Palmdale, where nearly two-thirds of the residents are Latino or African American but no member of either group has been elected to the council since 2001. Unless overturned on appeal, the ruling would apply equally to all cities with self-governing municipal charters.

There are more than 20 charter cities in the Bay Area. The largest - San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland - and some smaller cities, like Berkeley, Alameda and San Leandro, elect their councils by geographic districts. But most of them, including Richmond, Hayward, Albany, San Mateo, San Rafael and Vallejo, conduct at-large, citywide elections.

""If you've got a sizable Latino, Asian or African American population and no (council) representatives of color, you'd better convert your system"" to district elections, said Robert Rubin, a lawyer for minority voters in the Palmdale suit. Candidates elected by district, he said, are not only more likely to look like their constituents, but they're also more likely to be in touch with neighborhood grievances.

Rubin has taken part in suits successfully challenging at-large elections for supervisors in California counties, most recently San Mateo County. He said he and his colleagues plan to file similar suits against local water district boards, whose powers increase as rainfall declines.

In the Palmdale case, the Second District Court of Appeal upheld a judge's refusal to certify the results of a November election in which candidates ran citywide for council seats. The court said studies of past Palmdale elections showed racial polarization, in which bloc voting diluted the votes of Latinos and African Americans who turned out in lesser numbers.

Dilution of minority voting is prohibited by the California Voting Rights Act. The city argued that it was exempt from the state law because of its charter status, which entitles it to manage all municipal affairs, including local elections. But the court said voting rights are a statewide concern that overrides local control.

""Electoral results lack integrity where a protected (minority) class is denied equal participation in the electoral process because of vote dilution,"" said Presiding Justice Paul Turner in the court's ruling.

The Palmdale city attorney's office was unavailable for comment. The city could appeal to the state Supreme Court.","2014-05-29 17:09:00","1","48.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","158.0","152.0","0.0","220.0","0.0","12.0","0","423","95.37","70.68","6.82","38.37","23.50","31.21","64.07","37.35","5.44","2.84","0.00","0.00","0.71","0.95","1.18","2.60","6.86","13.95","4.96","1.65","4.96","0.71","9.93","4.26","4.26","1.65","1.18","3.07","1.65","1.18","0.47","0.00","0.24","0.24","8.98","0.00","0.47","0.00","0.95","8.04","0.24","1.42","1.65","2.36","0.71","3.55","2.36","0.71","1.42","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.24","7.80","1.18","0.95","4.49","0.95","0.71","4.02","3.55","0.24","10.87","0.71","8.75","1.42","4.26","0.00","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.26","4.26","7.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.89","0.95","2.13","0.95","0.00","2233","9.82","24.0","670","417","18","47.93","12.9","12.3","15.32","16.4","133","13.375","24.03779376498801","251","22.22","0","0.38","0","14","4","35","0","52","32","4","2","3","66","61","1","42","0","0","10","6","9","2","1","1","9","0","10","20","7","9","13","9","5","1","1","2"
"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Momentum-to-legalize-marijuana-in-California-is-5880897.php","Momentum to legalize marijuana in California is growing","Momentum to legalize marijuana in California is growing

After this month’s election, just one piece of the West Coast remained unwelcoming to recreational pot: California.

But with voters in Oregon and Alaska legalizing the use and sale of marijuana — joining Washington and Colorado in inviting retail spreads of cannabis-infused teas and brownies and joints — advocates see fresh momentum behind the slow shift in how the public regards the green stuff and those who enjoy it.

California residents rejected legalization in 2010, with a 54 percent vote against it, but supporters of recreational marijuana are growing more confident about reversing that result in the 2016 election.

“I see a parallel — not a perfect parallel, but a parallel — with marriage equality,” said Ben Tulchin, a San Francisco-based pollster who has watched sympathy for both same-sex unions and marijuana climb. “The first battle you may lose, like in California, but you start a conversation and get the dialogue going. … And you eventually see a very big shift.”

California, alongside Arizona and Nevada, have legalization measures in the works for the 2016 election, when the presidential race is expected to deliver younger voters to the polls who tend to be more supportive of pot. Proponents are considering other states as well.

“I got to believe that the wins this week, coupled with the wins in 2012, will provide momentum,” Tulchin said.

The increasing support for the drug is the result of a number of factors, say marijuana supporters, who for decades made little progress.

Electorate has changed

“The bottom line is that people are no longer fooled by the anti-marijuana propaganda,” said Chris Lindsey, legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, which filed paperwork this fall to raise money for California’s legalization measure.

Echoing what has been seen as a winning talking point for cannabis proponents in recent years, Lindsey said, “Voters are increasingly savvy to the fact that marijuana is far less harmful than alcohol and really should be treated that way.”

The electorate has fundamentally changed to include more Millennials who are tolerant of the drug, alongside Baby Boomers who grew up with it in the ’60s.

Another factor is that more than 20 states as well as the District of Colombia now permit marijuana to be prescribed for the sick, meaning many communities have grown accustomed to the drug.

Even without legalization, many law enforcement agencies have made busting pot users a low priority — as a trip to most any outdoor concert venue will prove. Critics have long said that most medical pot users obtain their “medicine” for recreational purposes.

“The sky didn’t fall. Usage rates and abuse didn’t change. All the doom-and-gloom scenarios that we were told would happen didn’t come to fruition, and people are seeing that,” Lindsey said.

Voters in Washington, D.C., who on Tuesday approved a measure allowing adults to grow and possess marijuana but didn’t lay out a framework for enabling retail sales, had another impetus for going forward: racial injustice.

More blacks arrested

A report by the American Civil Liberties Union said black people in San Francisco were 4.3 times more likely than white people to be arrested for pot possession in 2010 — even though black and white people use pot with similar frequency. In Washington, D.C., the number spikes to eight times.

“Here you have a city where the majority is black and the majority of them are poor, and they don’t use marijuana any more than the hipsters or yuppies who live in the northwest, yet they’re the ones more likely to be arrested,” said UC Santa Cruz sociology Professor Craig Reinarman, who has written about drug policy for 30 years.

Supporters of decriminalization note that because more than half of the nation’s drug arrests are for marijuana, a shift would cut prison costs and free up police to pursue other crimes.

Also Tuesday, voters in a handful of cities and counties, from Maine to New Mexico, passed measures similar to Washington, D.C.’s, reducing or eliminating penalties for marijuana possession. In California, Proposition 47 downgraded the possession of most drugs to a misdemeanor.

For Washington, D.C.’s, measure, one hurdle remains. It has to be approved by Congress, because U.S. lawmakers hold constitutional powers over the capital.

Whatever decision the legislature makes, the debate draws the federal government into an issue that it’s tried to stay clear of. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, even for medical use.

If there is momentum for legalization, there is also a continuing deep concern about the shift from broad segments of the population.

Opponents argue that legalization will increase marijuana use among adults and children, and that the social costs, including addiction treatment, will run high.

Kevin Sabat, president of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, doesn’t think the momentum will carry. Advances made in the election last week, he said, came because marijuana supporters outspent their opponents.

“This wasn’t about voters being turned off. It was about voters hearing only the legalizers’ message because they were the only ones with real money,” Sabat said. “We’re certainly going to put our best effort forth to defeat the initiatives in 2016. We already won once in California, and I think we can win again.”

Backers in California acknowledge that victory won’t come easy. Although polls show a majority now supports the idea, selling voters on a specific plan gets tricky.

Concerns about how the drug will be taxed, and who can sell it, helped sink Proposition 19 four years ago. Even leaders in the medical marijuana community decided they didn’t like the details of the rollout and came out against the initiative. A lack of funding for the 2010 campaign was also an obstacle.

Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a supporter of the 2016 push for legalization, is chairing a task force to study the issue in a bid to head off problems.

“A lot of things weren’t thought through with Proposition 19,” said Newsom, who will be termed out of his office in 2018 and doesn’t see support of pot as hindering his political future. “We want to make sure we have the answers to the tough questions.”

Many Californians are waiting for those answers, including Kevin Reed, the founder and president of The Green Cross, a medical marijuana dispensary in San Francisco’s Excelsior. He said he’s not sure if his customers and his business will benefit from legalization.

Just a matter of time

Since opening 10 years ago, he said, he’s taken pride in serving patients who need his product — and he doesn’t want the value of that mission diluted.

“The context disappears with legalization,” he said. “It just becomes getting high.”

Reed, though, also understands why people want to use the drug recreationally, and thinks it’s just a matter of time before the laws change.

“It’s going to be a different world,” he said. “It’s not really the world I signed up for. But I’m gonna take the ride.”

"https://www.theage.com.au/business/alcoa-announces-closure-of-point-henry-aluminium-smelter-20140218-32wzq.html","Alcoa announces closure of Point Henry aluminium smelter","Alcoa has announced it is closing its aluminium smelter in Port Henry. Photo: Joe Armao The 50-year-old smelter had no prospect of becoming economically viable, the company said in a statement. The announcement is the latest in a series of job losses in the manufacturing sector, following on from decisions by Toyota and Holden to pull out of their manufacturing operations in Australia. ""We recognise how deeply this decision impacts employees at the affected facilities and are committed to supporting them through this transition,"" Alcoa chief executive officer Klaus Kleinfeld said. ""Despite the hard more of the local teams, these assets are no longer competitive and are not financially sustainable today or into the future.""

The Point Henry smelter faced global issues that could not be influenced by state government support, Victorian Premier Dr Denis Napthine said. Dr Napthine told Fairfax Radio, 3AW he had spoken to Alcoa of Australia’s managing director Alan Cransberg and had been told the state government could not influence the decision to close the Point Henry smelter and the rolling mills in Geelong. ‘‘I was told that there was nothing further the state government could do,’’ Dr Napthine said. ‘‘That these are world issues that are beyond the capacity of state governments,’’ he said. Dr Napthine said the government through its Geelong Industry Fund was promoting employment in the region but it was primarily Alcoa’s responsibility to assist its own workers. He said the company had a ‘‘good record’’ for ‘‘looking’’ after its workers.

Geelong Mayor Darryn Lyons said it was an horrific day and ''another kick in the teeth'' for the city. He said he held concerns about redundancy entitlements and opportunities for workers to retrain, and called on the federal government to help. ''It's not only about the 600 or 700 jobs that are going here, there's a lot of supply chain jobs going as well ... we need emergency funding and we need it now,'' he said. ''This is a devastating day.'' Mr Cransberg told media a final decision was made at a board meeting Tuesday morning.

He said the smelter was no longer competitive because of the high Australian dollar, low commodity prices and lack of reinvestment in the facility. ""It's tough. People were sort of expecting the announcement but there's still a shock when the announcement comes,"" Mr Cransberg said. ""This is a horrible day. ""These are big decisions to make and I and the company understand how difficult it is for our employees, their families, our contractors and our many community partners."" The Alcoa managing director said the company ""remains very committed to Australia"".

""Our operations in Western Australia are amongst the best in the world anid we will do all we can to ensure our remaining facilities... remain sustainable in the future."" The Gillard Labor government gave the smelter financial assistance to ensure it continued to operate beyond the last federal election and its closure, once that assistance finished, was widely expected. It follows the closure earlier of the Kurri Kurri smelter which was located in the Hunter valley, in NSW. Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews said Victoria was in the grip of a job crisis. ""Our biggest companies are closing their doors while Denis Napthine stands by and does nothing,'' Mr Andrews said.

""Ford, Holden, Toyota and now Alcoa. How many thousands of jobs will have to go before Denis Napthine realises he needs to get a jobs plan? Alcoa’s smelter in Portland, Victoria, and its bauxite and alumina refining operations in Western Australia, will continue to operate. The closure would result in a $250 million post tax charge being booked, of which the ASX-listed Alumina's share would be 40 per cent, in line with its shareholding in the smelter. The smelter will cut Alcoa's aluminium output by 190,000 tonnes. Australian Workers Union state secretary Ben Davis said the situation in Geelong, with 800 job losses at Alcoa, was now as bad as the Latrobe Valley when the State Electricity Commission was privatised and Newcastle when BHP pulled out, given there already significant job losses at Ford, Boral, Target and Qantas at Avalon.

He warned there would be social dislocation with people set to lose their houses and relationships breaking down because of the stress of unemployment. ‘‘These people will not be able to find manufacturing jobs in Geelong, or any job for that matter,’’ Mr Davis said. ‘‘We don’t want Geelong to end up like the Latrobe Valley and Newcastle were,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s hard to over egg the omelette, it’s that bad, it’s quite possible Geelong will go into recession.’’ Liberal MP for Corangamite Sarah Henderson said the company should have given workers more notice.

''Frankly to close the smelter in August is not good enough,'' she said. AMWU New South Wales Secretary Tim Ayres said: ""This is the next wave of blue-collar job losses in western Sydney. There have been jobs flowing out of the Toyota and Holden decisions and a series of closures over the last few months,"" Mr Ayres said. He said the firm is the only aluminium recycler in NSW, churning through 55,000 tonnes of scrap metal each year. ""What this means about NSW is it puts a question mark over whether we can recycle aluminium,"" Mr Ayres said. ""Recycling uses 5 per cent of the energy needed to produce aluminium. All of our scrap aluminimun will have to be exported."" Loading

Mr Ayres said the Abbott and O'Farrell governments had shown ""hostile indifference"" to the plight of manufacturing workers, which was creating a ""jobs crisis in NSW and particularly in Western Sydney"". with Anna Patty","2014-02-17 22:08:17","1","65.0","6.0","27.0","3.0","30.0","3.0","199.0","198.0","0.0","135.0","0.0","11.0","0","940","87.39","79.37","12.31","16.62","19.18","24.89","76.91","44.26","8.09","3.51","0.21","1.49","0.00","1.28","0.53","4.57","8.19","12.87","8.40","3.09","4.68","1.28","15.21","2.77","1.60","1.17","1.49","1.49","2.87","1.06","1.70","0.21","0.11","0.74","9.57","0.11","0.11","0.11","1.91","7.66","1.81","1.49","1.60","0.96","0.85","1.38","3.51","0.32","2.87","0.32","1.17","0.11","0.96","0.00","0.11","10.21","2.45","2.55","5.74","0.96","1.28","6.70","7.13","1.60","13.51","1.60","7.98","3.83","7.66","0.74","0.32","1.17","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.11","0.00","19.89","5.43","4.57","0.21","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.43","4.15","4.89","0.00","0.11","4521","8.14","20.717391304347824","1412","933","48","60.24","12.6","9.7","12.07","12.1","209","9.0","18.720342979635586","432","18.96","12","0.44","0","31","13","95","0","102","53","2","3","16","141","139","0","53","1","0","36","18","31","2","0","2","23","0","36","56","20","19","18","26","6","1","0","5"
"https://www.theage.com.au/world/we-will-degrade-and-ultimately-destroy-isil-barack-obamas-speech-in-full-20140911-10fdp9.html","'We will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIL': Barack Obama's speech in full","In a region that has known so much bloodshed, these terrorists are unique in their brutality. They execute captured prisoners. They kill children. They enslave, rape and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. In acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists - Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff. So ISIL poses a threat to the people of Iraq and Syria, and the broader Middle East, including American citizens, personnel and facilities. If left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region - including to the United States. While we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland, ISIL leaders have threatened America and our allies. Our intelligence community believes that thousands of foreigners - including Europeans and some Americans - have joined them in Syria and Iraq. Trained and battle-hardened, these fighters could try to return to their home countries and carry out deadly attacks. I know many Americans are concerned about these threats. Tonight, I want you to know that the United States of America is meeting them with strength and resolve. Last month, I ordered our military to take targeted action against ISIL to stop its advances. Since then, we have conducted more than 150 successful airstrikes in Iraq. These strikes have protected American personnel and facilities, killed ISIL fighters, destroyed weapons, and given space for Iraqi and Kurdish forces to reclaim key territory. These strikes have helped save the lives of thousands of innocent men, women and children. But this is not our fight alone. American power can make a decisive difference, but we cannot do for Iraqis what they must do for themselves, nor can we take the place of Arab partners in securing their region. That's why I've insisted that additional US action depended upon Iraqis forming an inclusive government, which they have now done in recent days. So tonight, with a new Iraqi government in place and following consultations with allies abroad and Congress at home, I can announce that America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat. US President Barack Obama leaves the podium after his speech.

Our objective is clear: We will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy. First, we will conduct a systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists. Working with the Iraqi government, we will expand our efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions, so that we're hitting ISIL targets as Iraqi forces go on offence. Moreover, I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are. That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. Second, we will increase our support to forces fighting these terrorists on the ground. In June, I deployed several hundred American service members to Iraq to assess how we can best support Iraqi Security Forces. Now that those teams have completed their work - and Iraq has formed a government - we will send an additional 475 service members to Iraq. As I have said before, these American forces will not have a combat mission - we will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq. But they are needed to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training, intelligence and equipment. We will also support Iraq's efforts to stand up National Guard Units to help Sunni communities secure their own freedom from ISIL control. Across the border, in Syria, we have ramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition. Tonight, I again call on Congress to give us additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters. In the fight against ISIL, we cannot rely on an Assad regime that terrorises its people; a regime that will never regain the legitimacy it has lost. Instead, we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight to extremists like ISIL, while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve Syria's crisis once and for all. Third, we will continue to draw on our substantial counterterrorism capabilities to prevent ISIL attacks. Working with our partners, we will redouble our efforts to cut off its funding; improve our intelligence; strengthen our defences; counter its warped ideology; and stem the flow of foreign fighters into - and out of - the Middle East. And in two weeks, I will chair a meeting of the UN Security Council to further mobilise the international community around this effort.

Fourth, we will continue providing humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who have been displaced by this terrorist organisation. This includes Sunni and Shia Muslims who are at grave risk, as well as tens of thousands of Christians and other religious minorities. We cannot allow these communities to be driven from their ancient homelands. This is our strategy. And in each of these four parts of our strategy, America will be joined by a broad coalition of partners. Already, allies are flying planes with us over Iraq; sending arms and assistance to Iraqi Security Forces and the Syrian opposition; sharing intelligence; and providing billions of dollars in humanitarian aid. Secretary Kerry was in Iraq today meeting with the new government and supporting their efforts to promote unity, and in the coming days he will travel across the Middle East and Europe to enlist more partners in this fight, especially Arab nations who can help mobilise Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria to drive these terrorists from their lands. This is American leadership at its best: we stand with people who fight for their own freedom; and we rally other nations on behalf of our common security and common humanity. My administration has also secured bipartisan support for this approach here at home. I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL. But I believe we are strongest as a nation when the president and Congress work together. So I welcome congressional support for this effort in order to show the world that Americans are united in confronting this danger. Now, it will take time to eradicate a cancer like ISIL. And any time we take military action, there are risks involved - especially to the servicemen and women who carry out these missions. But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground. This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years. And it is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year: to use force against anyone who threatens America's core interests, but to mobilise partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order. My fellow Americans, we live in a time of great change. Tomorrow marks 13 years since our country was attacked. Next week marks six years since our economy suffered its worst setback since the Great Depression. Yet despite these shocks, through the pain we have felt and the gruelling work required to bounce back - America is better positioned today to seize the future than any other nation on Earth.

Our technology companies and universities are unmatched; our manufacturing and auto industries are thriving. Energy independence is closer than it's been in decades. For all the work that remains, our businesses are in the longest uninterrupted stretch of job creation in our history. Despite all the divisions and discord within our democracy, I see the grit and determination and common goodness of the American people every single day - and that makes me more confident than ever about our country's future. Abroad, American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world. It is America that has the capacity and the will to mobilise the world against terrorists. It is America that has rallied the world against Russian aggression, and in support of the Ukrainian peoples' right to determine their own destiny. It is America - our scientists, our doctors, our know-how - that can help contain and cure the outbreak of Ebola. It is America that helped remove and destroy Syria's declared chemical weapons so they cannot pose a threat to the Syrian people - or the world - again. And it is America that is helping Muslim communities around the world not just in the fight against terrorism, but in the fight for opportunity, tolerance and a more hopeful future. America, our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden. But as Americans, we welcome our responsibility to lead. From Europe to Asia - from the far reaches of Africa to war-torn capitals of the Middle East - we stand for freedom, for justice, for dignity. These are values that have guided our nation since its founding. Tonight, I ask for your support in carrying that leadership forward. I do so as a commander in chief who could not be prouder of our men and women in uniform - pilots who bravely fly in the face of danger above the Middle East, and service members who support our partners on the ground. When we helped prevent the massacre of civilians trapped on a distant mountain, here's what one of them said. ""We owe our American friends our lives. Our children will always remember that there was someone who felt our struggle and made a long journey to protect innocent people."" That is the difference we make in the world. And our own safety - our own security - depends upon our willingness to do what it takes to defend this nation, and uphold the values that we stand for - timeless ideals that will endure long after those who offer only hate and destruction have been vanquished from the Earth.

May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America.","2014-09-11 04:41:18","1","46.0","5.0","27.0","3.0","34.0","5.0","197.0","195.0","0.0","127.0","0.0","11.0","0","1683","73.65","90.33","38.14","19.56","19.57","27.04","83.90","49.32","14.44","8.20","1.37","4.99","0.24","0.12","1.49","6.24","5.70","14.38","6.95","2.85","6.60","0.89","11.59","4.22","2.73","1.54","1.25","1.01","8.91","4.22","4.63","1.78","2.67","0.30","12.77","0.06","0.59","0.24","0.30","8.14","1.13","2.20","0.71","1.07","1.01","2.73","0.59","0.24","0.18","0.18","0.59","0.12","0.42","0.06","0.00","18.24","7.01","3.09","6.71","1.49","2.20","1.78","8.56","2.38","14.80","1.90","8.73","4.10","3.86","0.12","0.30","0.30","0.77","0.48","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.00","12.72","5.11","4.46","0.24","0.59","0.00","0.00","1.54","0.12","0.65","0.00","0.00","8271","7.8","19.686046511627907","2579","1679","86","60.14","12.3","9.7","12.07","12.2","340","5.0","17.900059559261468","665","18.14","36","0.47","0","78","10","142","0","199","107","5","4","38","225","132","9","138","2","0","88","65","53","5","0","8","53","0","90","21","30","39","74","41","13","16","0","6"
"https://www.theage.com.au/world/silence-of-the-sheikhs-puts-washingtons-iraq-strategy-in-doubt-20141219-12ajq4.html","Silence of the sheikhs puts Washington's Iraq strategy in doubt","Citing Jurf al-Sakhar, a small but strategic town south of Baghdad which forces loyal to the government recently captured from IS control, Whiteside says that 46 Awakening members were reported killed between 2009 and 2013 in 27 different attacks – ""most were shot singly or in pairs in the first three years of the campaign; four were sheikhs from the local Janabi tribe"". He explains: ""In the Sunni areas where the Iraqi government had little control, it did not take long for the Islamic State to slowly and methodically eliminate resistance, one person at a time."" Although the Awakening in 2007-8, which was bolstered by American money and weapons, was a military success, it also marked a belated US recognition of the role of the tribes in Iraqi society. With the US military's departure, the new Baghdad government short-changed the Sunni fighters, messing with their pay, jailing hundreds of them and reneging on a US-negotiated deal under which they were to be incorporated into the national security apparatus. Instead, then prime minister Nouri al-Maliki perceived the Sunni fighters as a sectarian cell that would work against him. Then as now, the western province of Anbar was a critical battlefield – but this time around is different. It's not that Sunni tribes are not fighting – some are. The flaw in Washington's strategic thinking is that not enough are. And in the new Iraq it turns out that just as many of the Sunni tribes refuse to fight for the central government, the central government is reluctant to arm and supply the tribes.

For every area where US military trainers are deployed and weapons and other supplies have been delivered - to Kurdish fighters trying to hold the Syrian border town of Kobane, foir example, and minority Yazidis marooned on Sinjar Mountain in Iraq - there are many Sunni communities in which resentment is rising because there has been no response from Baghdad or Washington to their desperate pleas for help. The al-Bu Nimr tribe, based in the Hit region of Anbar, believed it would be resupplied as it kept IS at bay, but in October its fighters ran out of ammunition and surrendered – after which IS punished the tribe with a series of massacres in which more than 700 people were murdered in less than three weeks. Washington can take some solace from the fact that the al-Bu Nimr are undeterred – they remain in the fight despite their losses. But the years of assassinations by IS and the unrelenting brutality of this year's fighting are taking a heavy toll. In a series ofinterviews, tribal chiefs in Anbar complained that fear had driven many from the region, including their fellow chiefs; and that pleas by those who remained, to both Baghdad and Washington, for weapons, ammunition and other supplies had elicited little or no response. Sheikh Naim al-Gaood, of the al-Bu Nimr, claimed the tribes were taking territory back from IS, but complained that they had neither the weapons nor the technology to match IS in battle – ""Baghdad keeps promising to supply us, but their promises are not sincere"".

""Maybe 96 per cent of our tribe is with Baghdad; but overall, about 20 per cent of the tribes are with IS and another 10 to 15 per cent are standing back, refusing to take a side,"" Sheikh Naim said. A major problem for Sheikh Rafa Abdul Karim, of the al-Bu Alwan tribe in Ramadi, is in the mass exodus from the region by tribesmen and their leaders. He told Fairfax Media: ""The majority of those remaining are with the government, but we're not winning this fight because we have no weapons and no money. ""The government worries only about itself and its own people, so there's a deliberate delay in supplying us – even the police don't have the weapons they need."" Citing the deaths of 739 members of his tribe in mass killings by IS, he said: ""The main reason we have been attacked is because in 2003-04, we were seen as friends of the US. We refused to let the insurgents put roadside bombs in our area, so we were blacklisted from the start – and we have had no one to protect us since the US fled."" Another al-Bu Alwan chief in Ramadi, Arif Mukhaibar, complained that the war in the west of Iraq was a stalemate. ""We are winning and losing in an even game,"" he said. ""I have no idea why the US is so gentle in its air strikes – it's a puzzle for me.""

Complaining about IS' elimination of the veterans of the 2007-08 Awakening campaign, he said: ""The sheikhs are the highest figures in the tribes – it's a huge deal when they are murdered. But there is another problem for those who stay because those who are in exile don't fully understand what is happening here, but they're the ones the Americans talk to. They're always talking to the wrong people."" Asked if they war could be won without dramatic improvements to aid from Baghdad and Washington, he went on: ""It's going to be very difficult – we have the fighters and the spirit, but we don't have the weapons and we don't understand why the Americans can't see that. ""They have the slogan 'war on terror,' but they won't fight it with us."" Speaking from Fallujah, closer to Baghdad, Sheikh Mohammad Ramadi of the al-Bajari tribe argued that Baghdad was not winning the war because there was little sympathy among Sunnis for the Shiite-controlled government. ""We have rights that Baghdad could fulfill in 24 hours, but it refuses,"" he said. ""We're so sick of this government and of the Iraqi Army, that people are ready to fight with IS because of the loss of their family members and because of damage to their property.""

Explaining the current lack of tribal resolve compared with 2007-08, he explained: ""It was very much an American agenda during the Awakening – they gave the tribes money. It was all about politics and money, but the people don't believe that any more. ""Why would they fight for a government that refuses to respect them? [New Prime Minister Haider] Abadi is just another face on the same Shiite agenda – and the Sunni anger will continue until there is meaningful change in Baghdad."" Apart from the absence of the assassinated tribal fighters, an analysis by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace warns that other changes in the years since the Awakening have altered the terrain – the US does not have the on-the-ground presence it had in 2007 to cut unilateral deals with the tribes, and the Baghdad government on which it relies is deeply sectarian and has insufficient reach into the provinces, say analysts Frederic Wehrey and Ala Alrababah. At the same time, they write, IS has proved more entrenched and adaptable than its predecessor, as it unleashes a ""potent mix of extreme violence and soft power to both coerce and co-opt the tribes"". Despite the election of a new parliament and the appointment of Mr Abadi, they argue that little has changed in Baghdad apart from the rhetoric: ""[Mr Abadi] took several steps to accommodate the tribes and to temper the IS' heavy-handed military campaign in Sunni areas [but] on balance, the Iraqi government's support for the tribes has fallen far short of what would be required to turn the tide against the IS in [Anbar].""

Some key tribal figures also refuse to believe that Mr Maliki, who stood aside at Washington and Tehran's insistence so Mr Abadi could take over, has really been neutralised politically – or that Mr Abadi can emerge from his predecessor's long shadow. Mr Maliki continues to have formal influence both as a vice-president of the country and as head of the Dawa Party, of which Mr Abadi is a member. Mr Maliki also has a powerful personal network – when Mr Abadi sacked 85 former Maliki employees from the Green Zone, including Mr Maliki's son, the former prime minister immediately recruited them to the payroll at the Office of the Presidency. In the crude politics of the desert, tribal support for the so-called Islamic State is a negotiation with Baghdad – an opening bid that effectively states ""give us a better deal and we'll consider switching sides"". ""It's important to note that in the historical memory of Sunni tribes, the recent violence by the Islamic State is simply the lesser of two evils,"" the Carnegie Endowment analysts write. ""The brutality meted upon the tribes by the Iraqi government is no better and often perceived as worse because of its sectarian character."" Or as Sheikh Zaydan al-Juburi told the two researchers: ""We choose [IS] for one reason – [IS] only kills you; the Iraqi government kills you and rapes your women.""","2014-12-19 01:49:09","1","51.0","7.0","25.0","3.0","24.0","2.0","193.0","195.0","0.0","115.0","0.0","11.0","0","1477","86.68","77.58","17.69","1.31","32.11","21.06","82.13","51.25","9.68","4.67","0.14","2.03","0.20","0.74","1.56","5.01","10.09","14.49","8.60","3.11","6.43","1.69","12.66","4.20","2.30","1.42","2.10","1.90","6.23","1.49","4.67","0.34","3.05","0.20","10.56","0.14","0.20","0.07","1.56","8.80","1.83","1.96","0.81","1.15","0.41","3.39","1.15","0.27","0.54","0.20","0.34","0.20","0.07","0.07","0.00","12.53","4.67","1.42","5.62","1.02","0.95","3.52","8.46","0.47","11.65","1.29","7.85","2.78","2.71","0.27","0.07","0.61","1.56","0.95","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.78","3.05","4.60","0.54","0.27","0.07","0.00","1.69","2.78","1.96","0.00","0.81","6761","8.12","32.65217391304348","2132","1472","46","55.92","14.0","13.4","10.98","17.0","270","15.666666666666666","22.136956521739133","593","28.24","25","0.5","0","62","28","179","0","206","95","6","2","11","192","166","2","83","0","0","68","18","54","1","0","4","32","0","41","64","29","32","52","44","12","6","0","7"
"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/rugby-union/george-ford-steers-england-to-victory-over-samoa-20141123-11s2yf.html","George Ford steers England to victory over Samoa","Samoa had called off a threatened strike in protest at the conduct of the Samoa Rugby Union, which would have seen them boycott this match, only after being told they risked losing their place at next year's World Cup. The Pacific Islanders, still yet to beat England, scored all their points courtesy of three penalties from fly-half Tusi Pisi. England coach Stuart Lancaster made five changes and a positional switch to the team beaten 31-28 by South Africa last weekend, calling up Ford, whose previous four caps had come from off the bench, and moving the No 10's old school friend and former youth rugby colleague Owen Farrell from fly-half to inside centre. Pisi kicked Samoa into an early lead but missed a routine penalty before Ford equalised for England, playing in unfamiliar red shirts, in the 16th minute. Four minutes later Ford demonstrated the running and handling skill England have often lacked among their backs by setting up the only try of the first half.

Ford's 'loop' move with May saw England make ground before fullback Mike Brown joined the line to send May, who slid in on a rainswept pitch, for a score by the posts. It took several minutes for South African referee Jaco Peyper to confirm the try as he consulted with the television match official before deciding Brown's pass to May had not gone forward. Ford converted and England led 10-3 before Pisi reduced the deficit. England, however, were dominant at the scrum and a set-piece penalty saw them extend their lead to 13-6. More good work from Ford almost led to a second England try in the 32nd minute but, as happened in their defeat by the All Blacks a fortnight ago, Brown was unable to hold what might have been a scoring pass.

An otherwise unblemished kicking record for Ford ended on the stroke of half-time when he missed a long-range penalty. But he made no mistake in the opening minute of the second period as he edged England further in front. Ford then produced a sublime piece of skill with his cross-kick out to the right wing regathered by Bath team-mate Anthony Watson, who passed inside to Brown for a fine try. England's new stand-off converted and the hosts led 23-6 before another Pisi penalty narrowed the gap. Ford was involved again when tackled high by Johnny Leota in the 51st minute, with the Samoa centre sent to the sin-bin as a result by Peyper.

No sooner had Samoa been reduced to 14 men then England had their third try and May his second. England won a line-out and good handling by skipper Chris Robshaw and fellow forwards Joe Marler and David Attwood led to Brown sending May in on the overlap out wide.

"https://www.theage.com.au/world/islamic-state-treads-lightly-in-embattled-fallujah-20141024-11b5fy.html","Islamic State treads lightly in embattled Fallujah","They want to put Iraq behind them and so have applied for visas to resettle in Turkey. But she has family and relatives still in towns across Anbar – Falluja, Ramadi and Amiriyat Falluja , all on the green-fringed banks of the Euphrates River as it snakes over the desert flats, desultorily finding its way to the Persian Gulf. In January, while her family tended to funeral rituals for her late grandmother, life in Falluja, about 50 kilometres west of the capital, was upended, the teacher says, ""when we woke up one morning and people said IS is here – we had never heard of them, but they took over in a night."" Where Iraqi Army checkpoints had been, townspeople found charred military vehicles and the black-clad fighters of IS planting their black and white banner – all Iraqi Army troops had disappeared. ""Their dress, their hygiene and the look in their eyes made me think of the Stone Age and many of them were foreigners – I heard Arabic in Saudi accents and foreign languages too,"" she said of the new force in town. Her family fled, but only to Amiriyat Falluja, a small farming town 45 kilometres to the south-east, and soon the fighting followed them and the town came under IS siege. As IDPs - internally displaced people - they lived 30 and 40 to an apartment and rationed food as spirits rose and fell with the intensity of a tug-of-war fight for the town. When a missile landed 20 metres in front of her in April, the teacher decided she had to get out – ""it cut one man in half; it took the head off another and it killed a third"".

She fled again – this time alone. Her fiance was in Baghdad and the only access to the capital was over a bridge on a small tributary to the Euphrates – as she crossed, Iraqi Army troops were attempting to retrieve the bodies of their dead comrades floating downstream. Still determined to have the wedding of her dreams, she found herself checkmated by the contradictory urgencies of her life – if she was to be with her fiance they needed to marry fast, but how was a girl to marry without her parents, siblings and their whole extended family gathering for a great noisy celebration? Living with her sister in Baghdad, she set about salvaging what she could of the dream. Even as word came that her brothers were on the frontline, fighting against IS at Amiriyat Falluja, and her father was pinned down at Ramadi, the teacher sent instructions to her mother. She was to get herself to Baghdad and there were two items she must bring with her – the white teddy bear that had been a first gift from the IT specialist; and the fishtail design wedding dress that she could not find in Anbar and which had taken two months to be delivered from Europe, after she had ordered it on amazon.com.

Falluja today: A strange kind of normal Today Falluja is listed as an IS stronghold – its proximity to Baghdad sends shivers down the spine of Iraqi national security chiefs, especially as a series of battles are waged for control of nearby centres – like Amiriyat Falluja which, this week, has been the focus of unrelenting IS efforts to dislodge the Iraqi Army and tribal fighters who still occupy the town, backed by airstrikes from the US-led coalition and the Iraqi Air Force; and Hit, further up the Euphrates and about 185 kilometres west of Baghdad, which reportedly fell to IS forces on Wednesday. But Falluja has a special history in Iraq's recent wars and IS seems to fully appreciate this – for which reason the city is not being subjected to the horrendous treatment meted out by IS fighters to communities it controls in the north of Iraq and the east of Syria. Instead of human heads on stakes and baying for infidel blood, the Islamist hardliners in Falluja had work crews in the streets this week, painting the edges of median strips and footpaths in alternating black and white. Instead of complaints of shortages, I was told that the markets are better stocked than before the arrival of IS. And instead of the Islamic State's horrendous treatment of women in the north of the country and across the border in Syria, including forced marriages to IS fighters and them being sold as sex slaves at public auctions, a professional man in Falluja told me by phone that after early mutterings about needing to do something about women, the Islamist hardliners did nothing to enforce their decree on women covering their faces, not going out without a male escort and not attending school and college unchaperoned.

Similarly for men, talk about closing their barbershops and making them all grow jihadist-style beards has remained just that – no enforcement, it seemed. None of this is to suggest that IS is making nice in Falluja. A hospital administrator who recently fled Falluja, explained to a reporter why he could no longer remain in the city: ""Every day, I saw children watching parents die and parents watching children die - I couldn't raise my children there any longer ... we all have targets on our head."" The man I spoke to in the city, who cannot be identified for security reasons, said that 10 days ago there had been a public hanging – the victim was a Baghdad government policeman who had remained in Fallujah but who was accused of spying for the Baghdad authorities. Because of its recent and volatile history of protest and war, and of fragile fundamentalist and tribal alliances, the word ""normal"" doesn't often appear in the same sentence as ""Falluja"". But when I asked the professional what life was like in the city, he responded: ""Falluja is pretty normal.""

He was a member of a Sunni family, some of the males in which were fighting pitched battles against IS forces. But he insisted that water and power supplies were just like when Baghdad had control over the city – ""and even the garbage is being collected"". As he understood it, IS was able to organise trucked deliveries of propane, diesel and petrol from Mosul and Samarra, cities it controlled, which were selling in Falluja at ""only"" two or three times the prices available on the Baghdad black market. The IS social crackdown which upset the professional was a ban on smoking tobacco and smoking shisha pipe – ""so I can never support them,"" he said, as though the hanging of the policeman was of no moment. IS made regular collections of ""illicit"" tobacco in the town, then making a spectacle of torching it in a public place. Leaflets are handed out, telling the people they should conduct themselves in line with IS' tortured view of social and gender behaviour, but the man observed of his fellow townspeople: ""People here understand that our lifestyle is different to what IS wants it to be."" On first taking military control of Fallujah, and agreeing to share power with the tribes on a local council, IS demanded public repentance from the remaining members of the Baghdad security apparatus – ""most of the police came and repented and handed in their weapons,"" I was told.

However, the Falluja teacher recounted how her policeman cousin was detained and beaten up until he had ""repented"" - the young man cracked in two days. ""Those who didn't repent left and their homes and personal possessions were sold at a big public auction. Some of their homes were demolished, but most are used by the IS fighters who have come to town. But have we had beheading – no. Rounding up women to marry or sell them off – no."" Neither were locals rounded up to fight. But IS conducted regular rallies at which it invited townspeople to pledge allegiance – but the only response tended to come from prisoners who had been released from prison by IS. ""IS knows what the locals are capable of,"" the man said, touching on the key question about IS' conduct in Falluja - why does IS treat this city so differently to Mosul in the north, which it overran in June, and Raqqa, its seat of caliphate power across the border in Syria? And what might that reveal about what IS actually believes – does all of Iraq and Syria really have to be bludgeoned back to a 7th century existence or does it cynically execute its agenda in select areas, as a different kind of ""shock and awe"" to that last visited on the region. In a previous incarnation, IS was al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), and Anbar province was its main base of operations. But it could survive only in alliances with local Sunni tribes who were disenchanted with the US-led coalition forces in Iraq as much as with the new Shiite-dominated Baghdad governments.

But when the US peeled the tribes away from AQI, paying and arming them to fight as ""the Sons of Iraq"", al-Qaeda faded from view until it regrouped among the various rebel groups that took up the fight against the dictator Bashar al-Assad in Syria. So IS is acutely aware of the consequences of offending the Anbar tribes. Additionally, as the Falluja professional pointed out to me, IS is also aware of the fight that Falluja put up in the face of costly bids by US forces to pacify the city in the years after the fall of Saddam Hussein. ""The people are anti-IS – they don't like them. Half of the population [of about 325,000] had fled, and even though they are returning by the thousands now, we still go our way and IS goes its own, and that way there's no confrontation."" It has yet to manifest itself in the ebb and flow of the conflict, but this man who has access to all parts of the town, argued that some of the tribes soon might start stepping back from their support for IS.

That likely will depend on local reaction to coalition airstrikes in and around Fallujah, which will be overlaid on deep resentment in the city at the efforts of former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki to dislodge IS militarily. They included Maliki's resort to copying the crude barrel bombs devised by Assad in Syria – photographic evidence of which was provided to Fairfax Media. ""The Iraqi government may be fighting a vicious insurgency, but that's no licence to kill civilians anywhere they think [IS] might be lurking,"" Human Rights Watch's Joe Stork said in a statement in July. ""The government's airstrikes are wreaking an awful toll on ordinary residents."" With Maliki gone, new prime minister Haider al-Abadi has ordered a halt to attacking civilian areas, but his government still has a great hill to climb and little time to do so, in winning the confidence and support of the Anbar tribes now aligned with IS. ""For now we're just suspending action,"" the man from Falluja told me. ""We're just watching."" Looking for their future

The teacher and the IT specialist did get married – in Baghdad minimalist fashion. The bridge on the road to Baghdad had been blown up by the time the mother could make the crossing – in a small home-made canoe. She could squeeze the teddy on board, but not the wedding dress from amazon.com. Instead of dozens of girl friends at her henna night, the Arabic equivalent of the Australian hen's night, there was just the teacher and her sister – and they couldn't bring themselves to do the ritual tattooing of the bride's hands and feet that that precedes an Islamic wedding. The next day, the only male available to collect the bride from the hairdressers was the groom. The bride had to wear a hired gown and because of a security spasm in Baghdad, they had just a handful of guests at the ceremony – no photographer, no DJ. And instead of the traditional horn-honking, and blaring-brass-band procession of dozens of family and friends' cars to escort them to a city hotel, just four cars quietly escorted them to their new home here on the western flank of the city. Their honeymoon was to be in Malaysia, but their flight was cancelled.

This was getting maudlin – it was time to change the subject. Stuck indoors, how did the women of Falluja and Amiriyat Falluja kill time? ""They keep reading the coffee grounds – maybe 30 times a day,"" said the teacher, who is now '2½ months pregnant;' and yes, the women discerned the usual litany of destinies that could be read as good or bad news for the subject. Loading Like a good woman of Falluja she then reached for the coffee cup before another woman in our small party.

""Ah yes,"" she said after upending it on a saucer. There was a woman kissing a baby, meaning motherhood. However, she also discerned a ""dark"" period as she peered into the thimble-sized cup. Then she became cheerful: ""But the sun will rise.""","2014-10-24 13:15:00","1","73.0","9.0","25.0","3.0","31.0","4.0","197.0","197.0","0.0","128.0","0.0","11.0","0","2176","87.87","79.84","21.96","13.36","29.81","21.23","81.80","52.44","9.56","5.42","0.60","0.69","0.00","2.16","1.98","4.14","9.10","16.45","8.13","4.00","6.76","1.24","13.28","3.72","2.11","1.79","1.24","1.06","3.35","1.19","2.11","0.05","1.65","0.05","11.99","1.61","0.32","2.67","1.24","7.67","1.38","1.65","0.74","1.38","0.64","2.48","2.07","1.06","0.74","0.23","1.24","0.55","0.37","0.09","0.28","8.73","3.17","0.78","3.91","0.83","0.46","5.97","6.25","0.74","14.80","1.88","8.78","4.32","1.75","0.78","0.55","0.60","0.64","0.51","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.05","0.00","13.65","3.40","4.78","0.23","0.18","0.14","0.00","1.15","2.48","1.01","0.09","0.18","9809","7.89","30.47222222222222","3095","2184","73","58.05","13.0","12.6","10.28","15.4","383","14.833333333333334","20.974652014652015","858","26.1","54","0.5","0","101","19","230","2","294","132","1","4","17","322","183","2","142","0","0","95","43","86","0","0","15","66","0","61","133","59","64","30","44","16","17","0","11"

On Thursday Iraqi Kurds took control of the northern oil city of Kirkuk after government forces abandoned their posts. Peshmerga fighters, the security forces of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish north, swept into bases in Kirkuk vacated by the army, a peshmerga spokesman said. ""The whole of Kirkuk has fallen into the hands of peshmerga,"" said Jabbar Yawar. ""No Iraqi army remains in Kirkuk now."" Kurds have long dreamed of taking Kirkuk and its huge oil reserves. They regard the city, just outside their autonomous region, as their historical capital, and peshmerga units were already present in an uneasy balance with government forces.

The swift move by their highly organised security forces to seize full control demonstrates how this week's sudden advance by fighters of the Al Qaeda offshoot has redrawn Iraq's map. Witnesses in Samarra, 110 kilometres north of Baghdad, were reporting that the militants, many of them aligned with the radical Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, were on the outskirts of the city. They said the militants demanded that forces loyal to the government leave the city or a sacred Shiite shrine there would be destroyed. Samarra is known for the shrine, the al-Askari Mosque, which was severely damaged in a 2006 bombing during the height of the US-led occupation. That event touched off sectarian mayhem between the country's Sunni Arab minority and its Shiite majority. Refugees fleeing Mosul head to the self-ruled northern Kurdish region in Irbil. Photo: AP Members of Shiite militias were on high alert in Baghdad, and many were reported to be heading north to Samarra, even though the central government declared a 10pm curfew in the capital and surrounding towns. ISIL spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani promised that the battle would ""rage"" on Baghdad and Karbala, a city south-west of the capital that is considered one of the holiest sites for Shi'ite Muslims, US-based monitoring group SITE Intelligence Group said.

Members of the Kurdish security forces pose take part in an intensive security deployment on the outskirts of Kirkuk.

Thirty-one of the Turkish hostages were truck drivers who had been transporting fuel to a power plant in Mosul. Amid the collapse of the Iraqi army in Mosul, Tikrit and other northern cities, questions were raised about the possibility of a conspiracy in the military to deliberately surrender. Witnesses reported some remarkable scenes in Tikrit, where soldiers handed over their weapons and uniforms peacefully to militants who ordinarily would have been expected to kill government soldiers on the spot. A burnt vehicle belonging to Iraqi security forces is pictured at a checkpoint in east Mosul. Photo: Reuters Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, suggested the possibility of disloyalty in the army when he exhorted Iraqi citizens on Tuesday to take up arms against the Sunni insurgents. He ordered a state of emergency for the entire country and called on friendly governments for assistance in a quickly deteriorating situation.

Citizens in Baiji, a city of 200,000 about 180 kilometres south of Mosul, awoke on Wednesday to find that government checkpoints had been abandoned and that insurgents, arriving in a column of 60 vehicles, were taking control of parts of the city without firing a shot, the security officials said. Yulmad Udturk, the head of Turkey's diplomatic mission in Mosul, is among 48 Turkish citizens captured by ISIL forces. Photo: AFP In Tikrit, the hometown of Saddam Hussein, residents said the militants attacked in the afternoon from three directions: east, west and north. Residents said there were brief exchanges of gunfire, and then police officers and soldiers shed their uniforms, put on civilian clothing and fled through residential areas to avoid the militants, while others gave up their weapons and uniforms willingly. On Wednesday, the insurgents claimed to have taken control of the entire province of Nineveh, Agence France-Presse reported, and there were reports of militants executing government soldiers in the Kirkuk region. Iraq's Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari was quoted as saying his country's Kurdish minority would ""work together"" with Baghdad's forces to ""flush out these foreign fighters.""

Iraqi Kurds are concentrated in the autonomous region of Kurdistan, where security is maintained by a disciplined and fiercely loyal fighting force, the peshmerga. Jabbar Yawer, a spokesman for ethnic Kurdish armed forces in Erbil, said peshmerga forces had been deployed to fortify defensive positions in Erbil. Loading Word of the latest militant advance came as a UN agency the International Organisation for Migration reported that 500,000 people had fled Mosul – Iraq's second-largest city, with a population of about 2 million – after the militants, spilling over the border from Syria, captured military bases, police stations, banks and provincial headquarters.

A number of high-profile airline hijackings in the years that followed were aimed at securing the release of the ""Kuwait 17"". In 2009, the US Treasury designated Mr Jaafar ""a threat to stability in Iraq"" who ""posed a significant risk of committing acts of violence against Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces"". Protests by the US embassy in Baghdad, reportedly in 2007, that a killer was sitting in the national parliament were met with indifference. The cleric Today, I was told, Mr Jaafar acts as the Shiite militias' liaison with Iraq's national security nerve centres, helped by two deputies – one of whom is Adnan al-Shahmani, a cleric who sits in Iraq's parliament and runs his own militia known as al-Risaliyoun (Upholders of the Message). 'We're pushing them back': Sheikh Adnan al-Shahmani, an Iraqi MP and commander of the Shiite militia known as al-Risaliyoun. Photo: Kate Geraghty

The militias insist that much of their weaponry is provided by the Baghdad government – ""supplied legitimately by Iran, in government-to-government contracts"", I was told. Sheikh Shahmani exuded a confident charm as we dined in the riverside mansion that serves as his Baghdad headquarters. Uncommonly in these parts, he spoke glowingly of his wife for standing by him during years in Saddam Hussein's prisons and later in exile in Syria. Describing the unfolding war, he explained: ""Now most of the offence is by the [Shiite] brigades and we pass liberated areas over to the Iraqi Army for them to hold. In this, we are destroying the image of IS as an unbeatable foe."" Reminded of assessments that the country's sprawling western province, Anbar, might yet fall to IS, he insisted: ""Yes, IS gained ground in its first strike, but now it's in retreat. There's a tug of war in Anbar, but we're pushing them back and we have moved them away from the Baghdad perimeter – there is ongoing activity to the south-west of Baghdad, but the south is secure."" He argued that support in local Sunni communities, not battlefield prowess, had been winning the fight for IS. And here he made a cryptic reference to the political errors of ousted prime minister Nouri al-Maliki in stirring Sunni resentment – ""that negative political preparation was the opening for IS to create incubators of support"".

""That's why Mosul fell in June. There were 38,000 policemen in the town – they didn't fire a shot. About 80 per cent of the Iraqi Army in town was Kurdish – the majority didn't fight. And so we got this story that IS is unbeatable. ""Amerli, a town of just 20,000 people, was surrounded 360 degrees by IS but it didn't fall – because there was no local nurturing of IS. This shows that IS cannot advance unless it has a local incubator."" The dentist

I met ""Dr Thafer"", a dentist who joined Iraq's Hezbollah Brigades, in a cafe in the inner city. Nursing a pomegranate juice, he scrolled through an album of combat photographs in his mobile phone – in full military kit with a home-built rocket launcher; then the impact of one of the rockets – 15 mangled bodies on the outskirts of Baghdad; the body of what he said was a dead Kuwaiti IS fighter at Falluja, west of Baghdad; a dead Saudi IS fighter - with his own identity card shoved in his mouth; a child who ""Dr Thafer"" said had died in his arms during Islamic State's 40-day siege of the town of Amerli. There's a shot of him with an IS flag and a story of how it was souvenired: ""My friend, a fan of the Real Madrid soccer team, swam through flood water to get to an IS post near Jurf al-Sakhar, south-west of Baghdad; he stole this flag and replaced it with a Real Madrid flag – three days later IS attacked our position to try to take back the flag.""

As he scrolled through these images, the dentist mocked the West – ""yes, I'm a terrorist"". Playing with a fat cigar, which he insisted was a gift for a friend, he went on: ""Maybe because I have medical training, people tease me as Iraq's Che – but these days Guevara is a hero; I'm just a terrorist."" Thafer relied on his medical training for metaphors to describe the war on IS: ""If you have an infection in the national body, you must treat it. ""We have a job to protect our country – we are not Dracula, we are not criminals. These are rapists who kill children and civilians. We are Shiite but we fight in Kurdish areas; we have a Sunni battalion in Mosul – and we'll fight in Australia, if you have a terrorist problem. But right now, the Americans don't move a muscle to help us.""","2014-10-23 01:05:39","0","41.0","11.0","25.0","3.0","32.0","6.0","201.0","195.0","0.0","115.0","0.0","11.0","0","827","90.31","82.41","16.33","5.31","26.68","21.16","77.51","49.70","11.12","6.89","0.97","2.30","0.36","2.54","0.73","4.23","9.92","15.36","7.86","2.66","4.72","1.21","13.30","2.54","1.57","1.33","2.30","0.36","5.56","1.81","3.75","0.60","3.02","0.00","11.25","0.12","0.24","0.12","2.90","4.96","0.60","0.97","0.48","0.73","0.36","2.42","1.45","0.85","0.48","0.12","2.66","0.97","1.33","0.12","0.73","10.28","3.63","1.21","4.59","0.97","0.97","5.68","7.01","0.48","14.15","2.06","9.79","2.54","1.09","0.48","0.12","0.24","1.09","1.21","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","19.95","3.75","5.44","0.85","0.85","0.00","0.00","1.93","3.87","2.78","0.24","0.24","3645","8.42","27.322580645161292","1170","826","31","61.4","12.4","11.3","9.93","13.7","181","12.75","21.405133171912837","409","23.45","25","0.49","0","21","18","92","1","120","49","0","3","2","132","111","1","37","0","0","49","12","25","0","0","1","15","0","12","48","14","20","26","18","6","7","0","2"

But while the removal of the $1 billion rig could help ease immediate threat of a military confrontation in the waters around the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by Vietnam and China, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the rig’s movement should not be interpreted as a retreat. Instead, it emphasised its position that the islands were part of Chinese territory and that the rig was operating in “undisputed coastal waters”.

The oil company operating the rig, the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, said it was pulling out because the rig had completed its exploration work and drilling operations around the Paracels. The company said it had found oil and gas during its drilling operations but was assessing the data gathered before deciding its next move.

It also cited the arrival of the typhoon season as a reason for moving the rig to operations closer to China’s Hainan Island, though Beijing had said at the time of its launch in May that it would withdraw the rig on August 15.","2014-07-16 05:12:09","0","33.0","7.0","26.0","3.0","37.0","5.0","199.0","197.0","0.0","126.0","0.0","11.0","0","213","95.19","53.76","53.97","13.14","35.50","27.23","75.12","48.83","7.98","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.98","13.62","13.62","7.98","2.35","5.63","0.47","12.21","3.29","1.88","0.94","1.41","0.47","1.88","0.47","1.41","0.94","0.94","0.00","3.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.98","2.35","1.41","1.41","0.47","0.47","2.35","2.82","0.00","1.88","0.00","3.29","0.00","2.82","0.00","0.47","2.35","0.94","0.47","1.41","0.00","0.47","7.51","2.35","0.47","18.31","3.76","10.33","4.23","5.16","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.86","2.82","3.29","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.94","0.94","0.94","0.00","0.47","1021","9.42","35.833333333333336","324","211","6","44.21","15.9","15.8","12.14","19.6","54","17.333333333333332","26.316966824644553","124","30.67","0","0.46","0","6","3","29","0","33","11","0","0","3","38","25","0","9","0","0","6","5","3","1","0","1","2","0","4","17","9","6","1","1","2","0","0","0"

Romania coach Lynn Howells made extensive changes following last week's 27-17 defeat by the United States but his side lacked the exciting cutting edge displayed by the rugby powerhouses.

Japan, who have reached an all-time high of ninth in the world rankings, started brightly and had the bulk of the possession but could not convert their overwhelming dominance into points.

Goromaru opened the scoring with a penalty after 16 minutes but The Oaks responded in style, taking a 10-3 advantage after flyhalf Florin Vlaicu scored a penalty, the only try in the game and an easy conversion during an impressive 10-minute spell.

The ""Brave Blossoms"" reduced the deficit to only one point at halftime after Goromaru slotted two more penalties and he confirmed his fine kicking form with three more penalties after the break.","2014-11-15 23:23:49","0","25.0","7.0","25.0","3.0","24.0","2.0","196.0","200.0","0.0","105.0","0.0","11.0","0","184","99.00","64.83","30.47","56.57","30.67","27.72","66.85","36.41","3.80","3.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.17","1.09","0.54","11.96","14.13","1.63","1.09","3.26","0.54","5.43","5.98","3.26","0.54","7.07","1.63","4.89","3.26","1.63","0.54","0.54","0.54","7.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.17","6.52","0.54","1.09","1.09","0.54","0.54","2.72","1.63","1.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.41","1.63","4.89","3.80","4.89","0.54","2.17","1.63","0.00","17.93","1.09","9.24","7.07","2.17","2.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.41","3.26","2.17","1.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.72","1.09","0.54","0.00","0.00","899","8.55","30.833333333333332","260","179","6","49.69","13.0","13.7","13.47","18.0","39","11.5","22.635083798882683","132","27.67","1","0.38","0","6","12","23","0","23","12","2","0","1","31","25","1","8","0","0","1","5","4","0","0","1","2","0","2","12","6","2","4","1","0","1","0","0"

The clock had ticked a minute past full-time with Manu Samoa clinging to an 18-15 lead when Tongan lock Josh Afu was pulled down in a lineout.

Referee Wayne Barnes had no hesitation awarding the penalty and Tongan replacement back Fangatapu Apikotoa calmly slotted the difficult 40-metre shot at goal.

Before a capacity crowd of more than 14,000, Samoa -- ranked ninth in the world, four places higher than Tonga -- were expected to produce a much improved performance from when they were humbled 33-14 by Japan last month.

But the injection of their senior professionals from Europe, who were absent in Tokyo, did little to lift their game and the crowd was silenced in the 21st minute when Tonga's right winger, Otulea Katoa scooted over to score the first try of the match.","2014-06-07 07:07:17","0","26.0","8.0","25.0","3.0","25.0","2.0","199.0","204.0","0.0","108.0","0.0","11.0","0","170","98.92","54.68","79.21","25.77","28.33","18.24","67.06","37.06","2.35","1.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.76","0.59","9.41","15.88","4.71","2.35","3.53","0.59","5.88","4.12","2.94","2.35","6.47","1.18","2.94","1.18","1.18","0.59","0.00","0.00","4.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.47","0.59","1.76","0.59","1.18","0.00","2.35","1.76","1.18","0.59","0.00","0.59","0.59","0.59","0.00","0.00","9.41","0.59","4.12","3.53","1.76","1.18","5.88","0.59","0.59","23.53","2.35","12.35","9.41","4.71","1.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.53","3.53","3.53","0.59","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.29","0.00","0.59","0.00","0.00","789","9.23","28.5","231","164","6","60.69","12.5","11.6","12.07","15.8","44","8.9","23.651707317073175","126","25.67","0","0.37","0","3","11","17","0","22","8","3","0","0","29","32","0","3","0","0","1","2","5","0","0","1","5","0","4","12","2","6","0","1","0","1","0","3"
"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/jacqui-lambie-resigns-from-palmer-united-party-20141124-11sidd.html","Jacqui Lambie resigns from Palmer United Party","Senator Jacqui Lambie announces her resignation from the Palmer United Party. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen Senator Lambie said she would ""never vote"" for the government's proposed changes to higher education fees or for a GP co-payment. Senator Lambie used her address to the Senate to call on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to reconsider a below-inflation pay rise for the Australian Defence Force. It was Senator Lambie's outspokenness on the subject in recent weeks that proved the catalyst for her split with the Palmer United Party. ""I also take this opportunity to plead with the PM to reconsider his unfair pay offer to the men and women of Australia's Defence Force,"" Senator Lambie said.

""He has made a terrible mistake which fundamentally undermined Australia's national security."" Senator Lambie said Australians would ""forgive"" Mr Abbott if he allocated an extra $121 million to increase the offer and restore Christmas leave and travel entitlements for defence personnel. Senator Lambie said being a member of the PUP had prevented her from voting in the Senate in a way that she felt was best for Tasmanians and used her closing remarks to address public criticism from Mr Palmer. ""I don't have the time or the energy to be drawn into a political mud-slinging contest,"" she said. ""I will not be drawn into the game of responding to hurtful and false personal attacks.""

Senator Lambie said that after the political dust had settled there would still be opportunities for the former PUP bloc to work together ""in the national interest"". Lambie won't achieve much as senator: Palmer Mr Palmer told Fairfax Media on Monday that Senator Lambie had pre-empted any action being taken by the party by resigning. ""There were certain procedures under way which Jacqui was aware of,"" Mr Palmer said. ""Rather than have that continue, we think she's preempted the party.""

Mr Palmer said Senator Lambie's departure was a ""welcome thing for us"" and the party could now focus on bringing ""forward our own policies for Australia"". ""I think you can understand that it's a good outcome for the party because her views are in conflict with what the people who elected her care about,"" he said. ""I don't think she'll achieve very much as a senator generally."" He attacked Senator Lambie's public persona as a champion for Tasmanians. ""She's not brought one proposal for veterans or Tasmania to the party room in the six months she's been here,"" Mr Palmer said.

Split has implications on government negotiations The split has significant implications for the government's ability to negotiate with the cross bench. Before Senator Lambie's announcement on Monday morning, independent senator Nick Xenophon said the government and opposition would have to work harder to gain the support of cross benchers. ""All that has happened now is that there's going to be a more fluid situation in the Senate,"" Senator Xenophon said. ""That means that the government and the opposition have to work that little bit harder to convince cross bench colleagues in terms of the merits or otherwise of legislation because instead of dealing with one bloc of four, they'll need to deal with the three groups of people.""

Despite the reduction in his voting bloc, Mr Palmer claimed he was still central to voting outcomes in the Senate and still had an agreement for support from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party. ""We're still within the balance of power,"" he said. ""We've got the biggest party within that group of eight.""

Photo: INF Witnesses said no pleasantries were exchanged when Packer saw Gyngell, but rather a flurry of profanities broke out before the pair were embroiled in a physical exchange as passers-by looked on in shock. Both Packer and Gyngell retreated to their respective homes following the bust-up, and a short time later a person who appeared to be a medical professional attended Packer's home. According to alleged witness claims, people were spotted looking for teeth outside Packer's home shortly following the exchange. A woman who lives in an apartment building opposite Packer's home said that, while she did not want to comment on the fight, she did find dentures on the street shortly afterwards.

While it is unclear which party is missing the teeth, PS has been informed that Packer is today sporting a black eye while Gyngell's face appears to have escaped unscathed. James Packer in a file picture. Photo: Rob Homer What the pictures show

There are more than 50 pictures in the set. They show the two men squaring off, tugging at each other's shirts and grappling before falling to the ground and wrestling. David Gyngell with Leila McKinnon and son Ted. Photo: INF Other men – possibly Packer's bodyguards – intervene while the fighters are upright as well as when they are on the ground. Packer towers over the smaller Gyngell. Packer is wearing a black baseball cap and sunglasses.

Gyngell is bearded, barefoot and wearing black tracksuit pants with a thick white stripe. Both men are wearing blue or grey T-shirts. A black car is in the background. On the ground, Packer is on top and has Gyngell’s head in a grip. Gyngell’s bare feet are flailing. One of the other men grabs Packer around the mouth.

Amid a scrum on the ground, Packer is eventually pulled off Gyngell and on to his feet. He has lost his sunglasses. Packer, looking defiant, walks away, his lips clenched . Gyngell looks shaken, his shoulders hunched. Then a man – possibly a doctor, wearing a suit and without a tie – arrives carrying a case.

Channel Nine news truck Sources have confirmed reports of a Channel Nine news truck being parked near Packer's home, with suggestions circulated that Packer had believed he was about to be greeted with a news crew. However, it was Gyngell who had assured Packer the truck was parked there by coincidence as one of his news staff lived close by and was on-call. Packer has long been wary of media scrutiny, and while the truck's presence could have been the ""trigger point"", associates confirmed the fight was really over long simmering tension between the men. Gyngell at Packer house today

Gyngell and Packer later released a joint statement on the fight: ""We have been friends for 35 years and still are. In that time we have had our fair share of ups and downs. We respect each other and neither of us will be commenting further."" About 10am today, Gyngell was seen leaving Packer's property, wearing a suit and looking less dishevelled than he did yesterday. His beard was gone, too. Gyngell was later seen arriving at Channel Nine's offices in Willoughby and was described as ""looking quite distressed, he certainly wasn't happy"". Nine chairman David Haslingden said in an email to Fairfax Media today: ""David Gyngell has had and continues to have the full support of the board in his role as CEO of Nine Entertainment Company."" John Alexander, deputy chairman of Packer's Crown Holdings, also arrived at Packer's house this morning.

Gyngell's wife Leila McKinnon is expected to give birth to their second child imminently. Friendship soured Sources close to both men told PS this morning that their life-long friendship soured soon after Packer and his second wife, Erica, announced their shock separation six months ago. It is understood Gyngell confronted Packer about his decision to walk away from his seven-year marriage that had produced three children, an approach to which Packer did not react kindly. Packer was seen in Los Angeles a fortnight ago greeting his ex-wife as he collected his children.

The exchange between the former spouses was described as ""perfunctory"" at best. A year ago, a spokesman representing Gyngell told Fairfax Media that reports of a rift between the old friends were incorrect. However, Sunday's images would suggest otherwise. Packer's rumoured new girlfriend, supermodel Miranda Kerr, flew back into Sydney on Friday. Kerr said in an interview published on Sunday that Packer was a ""friend"", but close associates have described the pair as being romantically involved for several months. A media bidding war broke out this morning for the rights to publish the images.

Justice Kirby, a former judge of the High Court of Australia, was chairman of a UN Commission of Inquiry into North Korean human rights abuses, which recommended the reclusive country’s leaders be prosecuted in the International Criminal Court.

He said the last week had demonstrated the UN Security Council’s capacity for agreement and action.

“The attention to MH17 was admirable … and I think we can all be proud of the way our ambassadors dealt with it. But in all truth, the case of North Korea is dealing with millions of people,” Justice Kirby told a university audience.

“The question is will the UN find a way to respond? In the last week, on a matter that had great sensitivity, through … strong political action, including by Australia, a consensus was found, and I’m hoping the same sort of spirit will operate in the case of North Korea when the matter comes to the Security Council.”","2014-08-03 01:58:29","0","33.0","5.0","25.0","3.0","28.0","2.0","195.0","198.0","0.0","114.0","0.0","11.0","0","207","99.00","79.42","61.20","90.01","25.88","21.74","79.23","43.48","4.35","2.42","0.97","0.97","0.00","0.48","0.00","1.93","12.56","16.43","7.73","0.48","3.38","0.00","12.08","3.86","1.93","0.97","0.48","0.97","5.80","4.83","0.97","0.00","0.97","0.00","8.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","7.73","4.35","0.00","0.97","1.45","1.93","0.48","1.45","0.97","0.48","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","8.21","0.97","1.45","4.83","0.48","0.97","5.31","5.31","1.45","18.36","3.38","12.08","2.90","3.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.01","4.35","4.83","0.97","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","1.93","1.45","0.00","0.00","955","8.86","26.25","311","209","8","53.44","12.8","12.3","10.62","14.1","52","13.875","22.39215311004785","120","23.62","9","0.45","0","5","0","28","0","27","16","0","0","4","32","37","1","8","0","0","6","1","0","0","0","1","5","0","6","10","4","4","5","7","2","0","0","1"
"https://www.theage.com.au/world/iraqi-militias-explain-why-they-fight-isil-its-not-to-please-the-west-20141021-11969y.html","Iraqi militias explain why they fight ISIL: it's not to please the West","""But in this war, we are defending the state, not our sect.""



The prism through which most of the half-dozen or more brigades - call them militias at your peril - view the world, the region and this conflict is that the West created al-Qaeda as a tool to defeat the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; and that the so-called Islamic State, which now controls swathes of Iraq and neighbouring Syria, is a US-Israeli invention to contain Iran – ""to clip Tehran's fingernails"", I was told. ""The governments of the US, Britain and Australia are hypocritical, selectively blind,"" a dentist turned fighter in the service of Iraq's Hezbollah Brigades argued. ""They created IS to serve as a bogyman to scare the countries of this region – they want to pressure Iran; and to return to Iraq, but this time they want to control the country without sending ground forces. ""They want us all to need the US as a superpower saviour."" Shairawi told me: ""The sum of all our fears is that the American agenda is not to protect the Iraqi people so much as to protect what it perceives to be its strategic interests in the country.""



Claiming he had approached a United Nations official for emergency supplies for civilians in Amerli, 175 kilometres north of Baghdad, while it was besieged by IS, the Hezbollah dentist, who goes by the name ""Dr Thafer"", said: ""I was told no, because Amerli was a hotspot, too dangerous; then I watch TV and I see the coalition dropping supplies to people under IS attack in the Sinjar Mountains.""



If Washington and its allies were genuine in their pursuit of IS, so the logic goes, they would work with the brigades – arm them and increase the intensity of their air strikes on IS. ""It's a very simple equation,"" Sheikh Adnan al-Shahmani, an MP who takes time away from the national parliament to lead his own fighters in battle, told me. ""All the US needs to do is to supply us and cut the IS supply lines. We have enough manpower to defeat IS.""



Hisham al-Hashimi, a Baghdad analyst, said that more than 100,000 militiamen had been put on the government payroll – being paid $US400 to $US600 a month. They were issued uniforms and small-calibre weapons; they had access to government-owned vehicles and most of their leadership was hooked into the country's military and intelligence apparatus.

Tens of thousands more in the Salam Brigade, previously known as the Mahdi Army, refused to accept a government salary, believing they had a religious duty to fight. But Hashimi said: ""The militias run their own race – refusing to obey orders if they disagree; their loyalty is to their political leadership, not the military command."" Don't call them militias: Haji Jaafar al-Bindawi (centre) with his men at the Imam Ali Brigade's headquarters in Baghdad. Photo: Kate Geraghty Last Saturday, the militias seemed to get even loftier access to the levers of Iraqi power when new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi appointed Mohammed Ghabban to run the sensitive Interior Ministry. Ghabban represents the Badr Organisation, for many years the military wing of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. There are fears this appointment could lead to a repeat of a 2005-06 surge in sectarian killings, when the Supreme Council's control of the same ministry opened the way for death squads to masquerade as policemen – with the preferred methods of killing allegedly including a power drill to the skull, according to a leaked US State Department cable.

'We have enough manpower': Sheikh Adnan al-Shahmani, MP and militia leader, at his home in Baghdad. Photo: Kate Geraghty The Badr Organisation and ISCI both have strong ties to Iran. In a recent interview, Badr's leader, Hadi al-Amiri, told The Washington Post : ""If it wasn't for Iran, Baghdad would have fallen [in the face of the IS surge into Iraq in June]. ""They gave us weapons, they gave us ammunition, they gave us their military experience. We are not ashamed of it – when our country is in danger, we'll go to any country that will help us. Do you want us to wait for the Americans?"" Volunteer fighter Ismail Abdul Hassan, 17, recovers in Baghdad's al-Wasiti hospital after being wounded by an improvised explosive device while patrolling Baghdad's hinterland. Photo: Kate Geraghty Hashimi described the militias as ""harsh and cruel"" but effective in battle. They had stopped or slowed IS advances on Baghdad's southern perimeter and their key role as a ground force in evicting IS forces from Amerli, in the first week of September, was celebrated as the first successful repulsion of IS forces when it seemed they were capable of closing on Baghdad.

Hashimi added: ""It is they who call the shots and influence political planning and military decision-making. Why? Because they can wage urban guerilla war and the Iraqi Army can't."" Uneasy partners: Ahmad Hatif (left) and Fadil al-Shairawi, spokesmen for the Imam Ali Brigade, view the United States with suspicion. Photo: Kate Geraghty By his account, the Iraqi Army moved in slow, heavy columns and could not challenge the swift IS forces – ""the army is like a circus in the desert"". Implied more than stated by some in the militias was a view that the Iraqi Army also failed because as an American creation, it was a godless entity. Explaining why he had opted to join one of the militias over the army, a fighter told me: ""We have a will to die; we are dogmatic – we have a creed, an ideology; and we are honoured to serve our nation.""

But it's a bit more complicated than that. In this conflict the atrocities of IS are well documented, less so the serial murderous abuses attributed to the Shiite brigades. There is evidence that they run their own brutal regime of extrajudicial killings in Baghdad and other centres, rounding up dozens of Sunnis and hauling them away for mass executions or snatching them in ones and twos – for their bodies to be recovered from wasteland days later, invariably with a bullet in the head. Most often the culprit, according to witnesses interviewed by the New York-based Human Rights Watch, was a Shiite militia called Asaib Ahl al-Haq, or the League of the Righteous. In a report released in July , Human Rights Watch documents the death of 61 Sunni men between June 1 and July 9, and the killing of at least 48 Sunni men in March and April

in villages and towns around Baghdad. Last week, Amnesty International released a harrowing 28-page document, Absolute Impunity: Militia Rule in Iraq , in which it chronicles murders and abductions which often included ransom demands for tens of thousands of dollars that even when paid still saw the victim executed. It reads: ""Since Iraqi central government forces lost control of much of northern Iraq to the Sunni Islamist armed group ... IS last June, sectarian attacks have spiralled to a level not seen since 2006-2007, the worst period of civil strife in the country's recent history.""

As the killings escalated in the weeks after the IS capture of the northern city of Mosul on June 10, a Health Ministry doctor told HRW: ""Sunnis are a minority in Baghdad, but they're the majority in our morgue."" Hashimi agreed that some in the brigades acted outside the law. But he opted to explain away these murders as traditional revenge for the loss of comrades in battle. Hatif, the 50-year-old scriptwriter, said: ""OK – the Shiite warriors are not angels – mistakes happen."" But he then sought refuge in an argument of equivalence: ""Let's get back to the notion of the bullet in the head – for years that's what al-Qaeda in Iraq did; that's how they executed people. Now people are out there wearing the uniforms of the brigades and doing these killings to destroy our image. How else do you explain that we have not

executed the families of the al-Qaeda fighters who are still among us? And when we take an area, we don't force women to wear hijab or make men grow beards – but IS gets its nose into everything."" At a safe house in Baghdad's Karrada district, Hatif and Shairawi introduced me to Haji Jaafar al-Bindawi, a founder of Asaib Ahl al-Haq. Bindawi was a military commander in AAH before splitting off with his Imam Ali Brigade, which reputedly has several thousand fighters.

With a SIG Sauer pistol on his desk and a US-issue M4 rifle propped against an airconditioning duct, Bindawi accused HRW and Amnesty of taking the side of ""terrorists"" by investigating the deaths and he suggested the killings were a good outcome because the custodial and judicial processing of those murdered would have cost about $US1500 each had they been formally charged.



Did they deserve to die? ""Dead bodies in civilian areas, they belong to terrorists. But I'm not saying we're killing civilians in cities.""



Were other militias eliminating these people? ""I can't answer on behalf of others."" The mayhem was acknowledged at prayers last Friday in the Shiite shrine city of Najaf, when the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, in a sermon read out on his behalf, rebuked the militias for what was translated as ""the activity of undisciplined individuals in their ranks"".

'We had more courage' The brigades do not disclose their battle losses, but Baghdad is decked in banners celebrating the lives of hundreds of ""martyrs"" – many of which incorporate an image of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. I asked why the Iranian leader, and the response came from a local suggesting even an idiot should know: ""Father of the revolution,"" he snorted. Seventeen-year-old Ismail Abdul Hassan was lucky not to be adorning one of the street banners. From Maysan province in the south, he was driven to sign up by a fatwa, issued by Ayatollah Sistani, urging fit young men to fight the Sunni extremists. But he had to try five recruiting centres - three run by militias and two by government forces - before the Badr Organisation signed him up, gave him rudimentary training and sent him off to battle.

On October 16, his unit was patrolling with the Iraqi Army near al-Karma, on Baghdad's western fringe. Ismail detected a poorly concealed IED [improvised explosive device] under some rocks. He thought he could skirt the device, but inadvertently activated a concealed trigger. ""I felt nothing,"" he said on Monday, as he was being prepared for surgery to severe shrapnel wounds over most of his body at Baghdad's al-Wasiti hospital. ""But my face and eyes were bleeding. My guys dragged me by the shoulders for two hours before they could put me on a stretcher."" Again I hear an account of reluctance by the Iraqi Army to throw itself into this fight. ""They wouldn't advance – it was just us volunteers,"" he said. ""We had more courage – the army should have joined us, but they refused. We always have to take the lead; they always follow at a distance.""



Ironically, many in the militias' ranks cheerfully acknowledge cutting their teeth while opposing coalition forces in Iraq for nearly a decade after the fall of Saddam Hussein. ""I used to plant IEDs to get the American troops when they were in Iraq. I think we did about $US3 billion in damage to one of the US bases that we blasted with about nine tonnes of rockets. The land we launched the rockets from is now a camp for IDPs [internally displaced people],"" the Iraqi Hezbollah dentist Thafer bragged. The poet and actor Shairawi confessed that he too fought against the Americans, adding: ""The training the Americans 'gave' us as we fought their occupation was more genuine than the training and resourcing they provided when they claimed to be rebuilding the Iraqi Army – they deliberately made it weak as part of their US-Israeli strategy to keep Iraq weak.""

Shairawi explained the militias' parallel existence with the national security apparatus thus: ""The Iraqi Army is corrupted and ineffective, but we have experience in guerilla and urban combat. The danger to our country was so imminent that if we had attempted to place our volunteers into the structures of the Iraqi Army, IS would have been in Baghdad by the time we had figured it all out – the enemy was at the door. ""We needed radical decisions and the [Ayatollah] Sistani fatwa provided the religious framework for our operations, and now that we are being formalised alongside the Iraqi Army, we have a legal framework."" A helpful local resorted to the idea of Russian dolls in an effort to make sense of it all: ""There's a government inside a government inside a government. And there's a military inside a military inside a military.""

Loading Shairawi refused to disclose the Imam Ali Brigade's fighting numbers, but boasted: ""We're an effective ground force and we have cleared a lot of cities - wherever we are, people are being liberated. And now we have the initiative – but if the US continues to ignore us and refuses to co-operate, then bad things will happen.""

His commander, Haji Jaafar Abu Kawthar, was more explicit in a video response to local reports that US military advisers would be based at two bases north of Baghdad. Claiming that he had lost many fighters repulsing IS efforts to take the bases, he said: ""We don't need foreign forces. We will see them the same as IS ... and we'll treat them like that ... we shall fight any project that aims to split or divide Iraq under any cover, national or international, until the last drop of blood.""



Abu Kawthar signed off: ""Today we have warned and tomorrow we'll act.""

The board of the Biennale of Sydney also announced on Friday that Luca Belgiorno-Nettis had resigned as chairman, less than two weeks before the event is scheduled to begin.

Mr Belgiorno-Nettis's resignation after 14 years and the severing of ties with Transfield represents a huge win for artists and refugee advocates and an embarrassing backdown for the Biennale board, which claimed the Biennale could not exist without Transfield and pledged its loyalty to the Belgiorno-Nettis family two weeks ago.

""The Biennale's ability to effectively contribute to the cessation of bipartisan government policy is far from black and white. The only certainty is that without our founding partner, the Biennale will no longer exist,"" the board said on February 21.

"https://www.theage.com.au/world/what-is-going-on-in-iraq-and-why-20140613-zs69l.html","What is going on in Iraq and why?","An al-Qaeda breakaway group, apparently backed by other Sunni groups and fighters, has seized a large section of northern Iraq after previously taking much of north-eastern Syria with an eye toward establishing an Islamic state straddling the two countries. The situation on the ground is changing rapidly, but some patterns and explanations are now emerging:

Why is this happening now?

The group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, is taking advantage of two trends: growing discontent among Iraq's minority Sunnis toward Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Shiite-led government, which they accuse of discrimination; and the increasingly sectarian dimension of the Syrian civil war, as mostly Sunni rebels fight to oust a regime supported by Shiite Iran and dominated by members of the Alawite sect. Taking advantage of the breakdown of state authority, militant fighters easily cross the border.

The Iraqi territory recently seized by militants is populated overwhelmingly by Sunnis, many of whom, at least for now, may see Maliki as more of a threat than ISIL. Signs are also emerging that ISIL is backed in its current campaign by former military officers and other members of ousted dictator Saddam Hussein's regime.","2014-06-12 19:32:24","0","38.0","14.0","27.0","3.0","34.0","5.0","199.0","198.0","0.0","130.0","0.0","11.0","0","197","97.74","61.98","29.49","4.81","32.83","26.40","75.63","40.61","4.06","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.51","3.55","9.14","15.74","4.57","3.55","5.08","0.00","8.12","4.57","4.06","1.52","1.02","4.57","6.09","2.03","4.06","1.02","3.55","0.51","5.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.11","1.02","1.52","0.00","2.54","0.00","2.03","1.02","1.02","0.00","0.00","0.51","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.69","2.54","2.03","6.60","3.55","0.51","2.03","6.60","0.51","14.72","2.03","8.12","4.57","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.58","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.71","2.54","5.58","1.02","0.51","0.51","0.00","2.03","0.00","1.52","0.00","0.00","1007","10.63","33.333333333333336","320","193","6","30.33","16.9","17.0","14.57","20.0","66","18.166666666666668","28.55875647668394","134","29.67","2","0.39","0","7","2","20","0","31","15","1","1","1","31","29","0","12","0","0","1","1","12","0","0","0","1","0","2","2","9","7","5","7","1","1","0","1"

Sony defended its decision, made after anonymous hackers invoked the 9/11 attacks in threatening cinemas screening the film, prompting theatre chains to say they would not risk showing it.

An envoy for Pyongyang denied the secretive state was behind the hacking, which led to the release of a trove of embarrassing emails, scripts and other internal communications, including information about salaries and employee health records.

Addressing reporters after the FBI said Pyongyang was to blame, Obama said Washington would never bow to ""some dictator.""","2014-12-20 09:46:14","1","37.0","7.0","25.0","3.0","24.0","2.0","192.0","195.0","0.0","110.0","0.0","11.0","0","154","98.05","81.84","7.45","1.00","25.67","28.57","72.73","37.66","5.84","1.95","0.00","1.30","0.00","0.00","0.65","3.90","10.39","13.64","5.19","1.95","1.30","1.30","10.39","2.60","1.30","0.65","1.30","0.65","7.79","1.30","6.49","1.95","3.25","0.00","10.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.44","1.95","1.95","1.95","0.65","0.65","1.30","4.55","1.95","2.60","0.00","1.30","0.65","0.65","0.00","0.00","9.74","1.95","0.65","5.84","0.00","2.60","6.49","1.30","1.30","11.04","0.65","6.49","3.90","3.90","5.84","0.00","0.65","0.65","0.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.94","3.90","4.55","1.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.65","3.90","0.00","0.00","0.65","790","9.67","25.666666666666668","242","152","6","45.8","14.1","13.2","14.39","16.7","46","12.375","24.22526315789474","113","24.0","3","0.34","0","2","2","17","0","15","8","0","0","4","24","28","0","9","0","0","4","1","2","0","0","0","5","0","7","11","9","3","0","1","2","0","0","0"

“We call on Australian politicians to support an immediate cessation of hostilities and a ceasefire deal which includes an end to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories and to the blockade of Gaza.”

The politicians said the rockets fired by Hamas into Israel were unjustified and threatened Israeli civilians, but argued the Israeli Defence Force’s response had been disproportionate.

Following a brief High Court hearing Monday - in which a scheduled August 5 hearing before the High Court was shelved - George Newhouse, acting on behalf of the asylum seekers, said the case had not changed, but the concern the asylum seekers would be summarily returned to Sri Lanka or India had eased.

The 157 were flown to the Australian mainland from the Cocos Islands Sunday.

""There's nothing in this decision today that changes the importance of this case,"" Mr Newhouse said. ""All that's going to happen is that it will proceed in a more orderly way ... the urgency has gone out of the case because they're no longer being held virtual prisoner on the high seas.

Those who survived are now homeless, spread through the northern towns and villages of Iraqi Kurdistan, living around the temple in Lalish, in unfinished houses in the nearby town of Baadra, in tents on the side of nearby hills and in halls and other shelters in the Kurdish city of Dohuk. Drawing on elements of Sufi Islam and Christianity as well as the Zoroastrian faith, Yazidis, a minority Kurdish group, worship all the elements, in particular the sun. A closed society that does not allow marriage outside the faith, Yazidis believe in reincarnation and have a deep, enduring connection to nature and their land.

Lalish is considered so sacred that every visitor must remove their shoes and walk barefoot through the grounds and the temples. It is as holy as Mecca is for Muslims, says Yazidi leader Ismet Mir Tahsin, and it is now home to at least 450 families who have sought sanctuary there. Yazidis believe God created the world under the care of seven angels, led by the Peacock Angel, or Melek Taus. Like the devil, Melek Taus fell from grace, but in Yazidi teachings, he was forgiven and his divinity restored, leading the group to be mislabelled as ""devil-worshippers"" and driving extremists such as Islamic State to demand they either convert to Islam or die.

Photo: AP There are now only an estimated 600,000 Yazidis left in Iraq, with another 100,000 mostly living in Syria, Georgia and in a large immigrant community in Germany. This latest brutal assault, in which hundreds died and thousands are still missing, kidnapped by Islamic State, their fate unknown, has left some Yazidis questioning whether it will ever be safe for them to return to their villages or whether they should leave Iraq for good.

Photo: Ruth Pollard ""We lived side by side with Arabs in our village – they were our neighbours, but now the trust has gone,"" says 40-year-old Farouk Pacho. When Islamic State militants came to his village of Tal Qasab, they killed 19 members of his family and kidnapped 60, he says, sitting on the dirt floor of a half-finished building in a northern Kurdish town near Lalish. His surviving family sit around him, dull-eyed with exhaustion, blanketed in despair. Two young boys use plastic spoons to dig up the dirt floor, while a little girl, just over a year old, tries to take her first steps in the semi-darkness of what is, for now, their home. ""We do not know what will happen in the future, we do not know any more if we will ever be safe in our homes – we are tired, we have already been through so much.""

At just 18, Geni Abdullah is the oldest surviving member of her large, extended family. Standing in the ancient stone walkways of Lalish, she is surrounded by younger children. Eleven of them - brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, cousins - are now in her care. ""When the [militants] came to our village of Tal Banat, they took 57 people from my family, and since then we have had no news of them,"" she says. She breaks down when I ask what she thinks happened to her family, including her parents. ""I know what happened to them, but I cannot bear to say it,"" she sobs, drawing the children closer to her. Others interviewed by Fairfax Media relate harrowing stories of being contacted by family members held by Islamic State, who say they are being pressured to convert to Islam. ""My daughter, who is five months pregnant and has her three-year-old daughter with her, says all the women have been separated from the men and made to stay in empty houses in Tal Afar,"" says 48-year-old Mohabat Ghadar. ""When she contacts me, she is just crying, she cannot say very much.""

By now a crowd has gathered and everyone, young and old, has a story of IS attacks on their village, a near-death experience on the mountain, an impossible journey through difficult terrain past the bodies of those who did not survive the journey. One old man lifts his robe to reveal a prosthetic leg: ""I walked up and down the mountain with this,"" he says, his sun-lined face grimacing at the memory. The forced displacement of Iraq's ethnic and religious minorities, including some of the region's oldest communities, is ""a tragedy of historic proportions"", a recent Amnesty International report warned. Amnesty has documented two massacres of large groups of men, and the killing of many smaller groups in the first half of August, in the villages of Kocho and Qiniyeh. ""IS is systematically and deliberately carrying out a program of ethnic cleansing in the areas under its control. This is not only destroying lives, but also causing irreparable damage to the fabric of Iraq's society, and fuelling inter-ethnic, sectarian and inter-religious tensions in the region and beyond.""

Baba Chawesh, a tall holy man who is one of only a handful allowed to live at the sacred site of Lalish, says he fears the Sunni militants of Islamic State will not stop until the Yazidis have been wiped out. The targeting of the Yazidis prompted the US to act by air-dropping food and water to those trapped on the mountain – a humanitarian intervention that soon grew into a military one, with its fighter jets carrying out more than 130 airstrikes on Islamic State positions to date. But for now, the fate of the Yazidi community remains uncertain and the lives of thousands kidnapped by the Islamic State hangs in the balance. ""We are tired of [Islamic State militants] asking us to convert,"" Baba Chawesh says. ""We will not convert, but unless there is real help from the US and Europe we will not survive, they will kill us all.""","2014-09-08 03:01:02","1","56.0","9.0","26.0","3.0","45.0","9.0","201.0","197.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","11.0","0","1052","90.67","86.08","37.02","13.02","27.68","21.10","80.70","48.38","9.60","6.65","0.67","1.71","0.00","2.57","1.71","2.95","7.89","16.35","5.99","3.71","5.89","1.05","12.17","4.09","2.09","1.71","2.85","2.00","3.99","1.52","2.47","0.38","0.76","0.67","13.50","1.62","0.29","2.09","1.81","6.84","1.33","1.05","0.48","1.14","0.95","2.66","2.19","0.67","1.33","0.10","1.71","0.57","0.95","0.10","0.19","8.56","3.99","1.14","2.85","0.29","0.57","2.85","8.56","1.14","17.40","1.81","10.46","5.23","0.57","0.67","1.24","0.00","3.61","0.76","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.00","17.21","3.61","8.17","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.90","2.28","0.48","0.00","0.38","4741","8.04","27.81578947368421","1467","1035","38","60.79","12.2","11.5","10.68","14.7","200","17.166666666666668","20.609468599033818","502","24.42","11","0.46","0","40","22","97","0","141","72","4","5","10","142","115","0","69","2","0","45","28","43","1","0","4","26","0","28","24","23","32","25","38","3","10","0","5"

A few weeks ago, the construction industry software provider took the unusual step of abandoning a plan to raise $230 million at $2.20 a share, following advice the stock was unlikely to receive enough support to perform well at listing.

But joint lead managers Macquarie and UBS have now completed the institutional book-build for the re-engineered Aconex IPO, raising $140 million at $1.90 per share.

""We had covered the book for a $230 million raising, but then the market came off, risk aversion was on the rise, investors were displaying a bit of IPO fatigue, and we wanted to make sure it traded well,"" Macquarie head of equity capital markets origination Mark Warburton said.

""The pipeline of technology companies coming to market is stronger than it has ever been. We are developing a really good local tech sector, but for that to work out this deal has to trade up.""

Macquarie and UBS returned to Australian and Asian institutional investors that had supported the original Aconex IPO deal to cornerstone the new smaller, more competitively priced raise.","2014-11-16 06:12:17","0","35.0","4.0","25.0","3.0","20.0","0.0","193.0","195.0","0.0","109.0","0.0","11.0","0","198","96.57","65.71","18.66","86.82","28.29","27.27","77.27","40.40","4.55","1.52","0.00","1.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.03","8.59","14.14","6.06","3.03","4.04","0.00","10.10","4.04","2.53","0.00","5.05","1.52","7.58","5.56","2.02","1.01","0.00","1.01","5.05","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.07","0.00","1.52","1.01","0.51","1.52","2.53","1.01","0.51","0.51","0.00","1.01","0.51","0.51","0.00","0.00","9.09","2.53","2.02","3.03","1.01","1.52","6.57","6.06","1.52","14.14","3.54","6.57","5.56","12.12","1.01","0.00","5.05","0.00","0.00","1.01","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","0.00","14.65","3.54","5.05","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","2.02","0.00","0.00","3.03","962","8.5","28.571428571428573","295","196","9","57.81","13.0","10.6","12.42","13.6","47","6.833333333333333","20.31183673469388","136","26.43","6","0.39","0","7","12","18","0","17","15","2","0","0","36","16","0","7","0","0","5","1","8","1","0","3","10","0","8","13","8","5","3","4","1","0","0","0"

More than a quarter of Gaza's population – at least 475,000 people – are displaced and the destruction is so widespread that development experts say it could take up to 10 years to rebuild some of Gaza's critical infrastructure.

The terms of the Egyptian-negotiated ceasefire – the eighth ceasefire since hostilities broke out on July 8 – mostly mirror those in the agreement that brought to an end to the November 2012 Gaza war, in which 167 Palestinians and six Israelis died.

Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza will halt all rocket and mortar fire into Israel, and Israel will stop all military action, including air strikes and ground operations, in Gaza.","2014-08-27 07:06:41","1","45.0","10.0","26.0","3.0","53.0","13.0","203.0","197.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","11.0","0","162","97.14","52.47","54.03","1.49","40.50","21.60","79.01","42.59","5.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.56","8.02","16.67","5.56","1.85","5.56","0.00","9.88","3.70","3.09","1.23","8.02","4.32","5.56","1.23","4.32","0.62","3.09","0.62","3.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.41","0.00","1.23","0.62","1.85","1.23","2.47","5.56","3.70","0.62","1.23","0.62","0.00","0.62","0.00","0.00","9.26","0.62","0.00","5.56","0.62","2.47","2.47","4.94","1.23","19.75","1.85","9.88","8.02","1.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.64","2.47","3.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","0.00","1.85","0.00","0.00","771","8.56","41.25","232","165","4","46.48","14.2","17.0","11.62","21.9","30","18.166666666666668","25.792727272727276","113","35.0","0","0.44","0","8","10","17","0","20","12","2","1","3","23","14","3","12","0","0","1","0","4","0","0","2","6","0","5","5","1","4","3","5","4","0","0","0"
"https://www.theage.com.au/world/iraqi-woman-tells-of-gang-rape-ordeal-at-hands-of-isil-20140917-10i8ce.html","Iraqi woman tells of gang rape ordeal at hands of ISIL","Across the room from us sit three of those women. One is weeping quietly – her daughter is still missing and she is moving between relief over Zeitoun's survival and grief that her daughter is not with her.



Zeitoun gestures to them. ""They were the ones doused in petrol and Da'esh [IS] were going to set them alight. It is only that there was an air strike that made them run away, so they lived.""



A woman enters the classroom to visit, her face erupting in relief and joy as she sees Zeitoun, one more who survived what everyone feared was certain death. If she kisses her once, she kisses her dozens of times, holding her face in disbelief and crying as she drinks in the idea that she is safe.



Zeitoun continues her story.



""They put us in three cars – 22 girls and women – and took us to the village of Baaj, then on to Mosul [a city that has been under the control of the Islamic State since June 10].



""Many things happened to us in the 11 days we were in Mosul,"" she says quietly. ""You know why they had us – they were giving us to each other, passing us between themselves for sex.""



Suddenly they were on the move again – Zeitoun was taken back to Baaj and her sister-in-law to Tal Afar. After two days she was moved again via minibus to another village called Tal Banat.



Along with the sexual violence there was also the beatings. Her wrists were tied together and she pulls down her bottom lip to reveal a deep cut that has yet to heal – the last time she was punched in the face for trying to resist an IS militant.



""Sometimes two men were hitting me at once and even though I was badly injured they would have sex with me every night, handing me from one man to the next.



""We were desperate to wash our faces, to clean the blood, but they would pour gasoline into the water and force us to use that,"" she says.



Everyone in the room is silent, frozen with the horror of her story.



""For one month and eight days I was in the hands of ISIL,"" she says. ""I was their servant, I cooked for them, I did everything for them, but every day I tried to stop them hurting us.""



On the day Zeitoun fled there was an air strike – she is not sure if it was US or Iraqi – and it gave her a moment to make her escape. ""Before then we had decided to either kill ourselves or flee – these were our only options.""



With a 13-year-old girl she managed to grab in the chaos after the air strike, Zeitoun walked for four days, with no food, water or shelter, hiding every time a car passed in case it was IS.



""We walked until we arrived at Sinjar Mountain,"" she says. ""I saw some Yazidi fighters and we found the uncle of the girl I was with and left her with him.""



An Amnesty International report released earlier this month echoes Zeitoun's testimony, as does a statement released by the United Nations Special Representative on sexual violence in conflict.



""There are allegations that many of the women and girls who have been abducted by IS fighters, notably girls in their teens and early 20s, have been subjected to rape or sexual abuse, forced to marry fighters, or sold into sexual slavery,"" the Amnesty report says.



Zainab Hawa Bangura, the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, said: ""Atrocious accounts on the abduction and detention of Yazidi, Christian, as well as Turkomen and Shabak women, girls and boys, and reports of savage rapes, are reaching us in an alarming manner.""



Zeitoun and her family await news of their 21 female relatives still trapped in this cycle of violence.



Every day there is hope that - as Zeitoun did - they will walk through the door of this overcrowded school now sheltering hundreds of Yazidi families.

But with each passing day, that hope dims.","2014-09-17 05:35:31","1","67.0","7.0","24.0","3.0","31.0","4.0","195.0","197.0","0.0","115.0","0.0","11.0","0","688","72.31","94.33","16.94","10.92","22.19","15.41","86.77","53.78","16.13","12.06","1.60","2.91","0.15","4.65","2.76","4.07","6.25","15.26","7.70","3.05","6.40","0.44","15.41","3.20","1.89","0.58","2.76","1.74","5.52","2.18","3.34","0.58","1.16","0.73","17.01","1.31","0.00","6.69","0.73","6.69","0.87","1.16","0.87","1.89","1.31","2.18","2.33","0.44","1.31","0.58","3.78","1.31","0.58","1.31","0.73","7.70","4.07","0.58","1.74","0.29","1.02","7.41","5.96","0.87","16.13","3.05","6.98","6.25","1.02","0.58","0.73","0.29","0.29","0.44","0.29","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.15","0.00","15.41","4.51","5.23","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.02","3.49","0.44","0.00","0.58","2909","6.96","22.29032258064516","892","692","31","74.22","9.7","8.4","9.0","10.8","97","7.333333333333334","16.52693641618497","350","19.84","16","0.5","0","31","16","56","0","90","24","1","0","3","93","58","0","36","0","0","68","18","27","1","0","1","23","0","20","45","16","19","7","26","3","3","0","1"

""The Saudis … are waiting to see how much pain the other major oil producers can take before they are willing to make meaningful [production] cuts. ""If Brent [the global oil benchmark price] sinks below $US60, I think you'll see OPEC hit the panic button pretty fast."" Seen through the Sunni prism with which Riyadh observes the Middle East, Tehran must be punished for its nuclear ambitions and for its support for both the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and for the new Shiite ascendancy in Iraq. Moscow, where the budget relies on an oil price of $US100, must cop it for its support for Damascus and Tehran. The Saudis are happily whacking the Iranians and the Russians. But beyond such obvious enemies, some analyses also conclude that Riyadh is calculatedly lashing out at Washington over a laundry list of American failures in the region. And how better to do that than to unnerve the US by dropping oil prices into the range at which America's newfound energy self-sufficiency becomes marginal? Ditto the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which relies on smuggled oil for revenue. An analysis by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in mid-October argued that Riyadh wanted the oil price to fall to rob the militants of funds – if the world price tumbles, the logic goes, then IS can no longer afford the discount that makes its oil sufficiently attractive for buyers to risk the whole messy business of dealing with smugglers.

Meeting in Vienna at the end of November, the Saudi-dominated Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] rejected calls by several cash-strapped members for a production cut, which they figured would serve as a brake on oil prices – and thereby avert the budget crises they face. The Saudis are not in the habit of explaining themselves. But perhaps the best measure of their policy determination in all this is Riyadh's willingness to wear the cost of the lower prices – if they were to simply close a few spigots, there would be less oil to sell and so prices would rise. Riyadh has the cushion of massive financial reserves. But even before this latest price tumble, the International Monetary Fund warned that at its current rate of spending - which includes billions as a pay-off for its people to suppress any Arab Spring-type yearnings - Riyadh risked a fiscal deficit as early as next year. The Saudis are worried that the US has joined the ranks of the world's leading energy producers. But they are apoplectic at the threat they perceive in the combined production of the Shiite-dominated regimes of Iran and Iraq e levating the Tehran-Baghdad axis to an industry status enjoyed only by Saudi Arabia – that's the role of ""swing"" producer, one that is not so utterly dependent on its oil revenue that it must produce at maximum capacity at all times and hence is not in a position to influence prices. As prices go through the floor - now 40 per cent off their June peak - the producer countries that take the biggest budget hit are Iran, Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria, Russia, Ecuador, Iraq and Angola.

The Saudis' ""break-even"" price point, which it needs to sell oil and to make a businesslike profit after recovering production costs, this week reportedly was $US98 per barrel. In an enigmatic moment in 2013, Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters: ""In 1997, I thought $20 was reasonable. In 2006, I thought $27 was reasonable. Now it's around $100 …and I say again 'it's reasonable'."" But spare a thought for other producers – Yemen, $US160; Algeria, $US132; Iran, $131; Iraq, $US111, Russia, $105. And the US too. Washington no doubt is pleased with the budget crises in Tehran and Moscow, but it too will feel the pain as its energy producers see their profit margins shrink. The International Energy Agency estimates a break-even price of $US42 for the US which, by 2016, is expected to be a net exporter of oil, driven by a ""shale revolution"" which has seen oil production rise by 80 per cent since 2008. But news reports this week put the US break-even point much higher – as high as $US70. There is a self-serving point in this for Riyadh. The Saudis well remember the 1980s when they cut production and lost market share. Fast-forward to the present, they absorbed sales lost by Iran and Syria and don't want that market share snaffled by others – and so they prefer to sell more for less, rather than less for more.

But the Saudis are not alone in the trenches of oil warfare. Weeks before OPEC's November decision focused attention on Riyadh's wielding of the oil weapon, the US academic and analyst Michael Klare observed that almost without scrutiny, the US had resorted to oil as its weapon of choice. Recalling condemnation of the 1973 Arab oil embargo – ""it was heinous. It was underhand. It was beyond the bounds of international morality,"" he writes – Klare observes that the tactic has been upended. Instead of producers refusing to sell, the US now used sanctions to prevent them from selling, ""so depriving hostile producing powers of operating revenue"". Think Tehran and Moscow, and the sanctions in which both have been straitjacketed in a bid to bend them to the will of Washington and its allies – the former over its nuclear program; the latter over its interference in Ukraine. The upshot is that they get less oil to market because of the Americans; and they are obliged to take a lesser price for what they can sell because of the Saudis. Their punishment invariably is reported simply as ""sanctions"", but as Klare says: ""To control oil flows across the planet and deny market access to recalcitrant producers increasingly is a major objective of American foreign policy.""

Arguably this oil war is different from its predecessors, unfolding against a global and technological landscape in which old verities become less certain – like OPEC's capacity to make us quake in our boots; like the Middle East as an essential sphere of American influence. Some analyses now speculate that burgeoning non-OPEC production, driven in part by the shale oil revolution in North America and solar and other technological advances that will reduce or eliminate the role of oil as a transport fuel, are rendering OPEC a dinosaur. Also, as observed by Michael Lynch, who heads the consulting group Strategic Energy and Economic Research: ""[OPEC members] don't have the same power they once did because so many of the members are in bad financial condition and so it's harder for them to cut production and lose revenue in the short term to raise prices."" Heralding a new post-OPEC era, the energy historian Daniel Yergin told reporters: ""This is an historic turning point – the defining force now in world oil is the growth of US production. The outcome of the OPEC meeting [in Vienna] is a clear indication that the oil exporters now recognise that this is a new market."" The rise of unconventional oil production processes, like the shale and tar sand processes, puts a question mark over the Middle East as a dominant global energy source. Analyst Robert Kaplan of Stratfor Global Intelligence cites a decades-long history of the Persian Gulf as a primary US interest – crucial for America's economic success. At the same time he writes: ""But increasingly the Persian Gulf represents only a secondary interest to the US – a region important to the wellbeing of American allies, to be sure, and to world trade and to the world economic system in general, but not specifically crucial to America itself.""

Kaplan's point is that as the US edges closer to energy self-sufficiency and the Middle East becomes more chaotic, America's relevance in the region would decline and the region would become a problem for China and India, whose economies are becoming increasingly reliant on Middle Eastern energy – just as a more energy-sufficient US economy becomes less so.","2014-12-06 00:07:32","1","49.0","10.0","24.0","3.0","31.0","4.0","196.0","197.0","0.0","120.0","0.0","11.0","0","1359","92.69","62.97","27.24","19.20","28.31","22.59","79.76","46.21","8.31","3.24","0.29","1.18","0.07","0.15","1.55","5.08","9.86","14.72","5.89","3.38","6.40","0.74","10.01","5.37","4.12","1.32","1.18","1.84","5.52","2.50","2.94","0.44","1.03","0.66","5.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.15","10.08","2.65","3.09","1.40","0.96","0.88","2.28","3.02","0.44","0.15","0.37","0.52","0.22","0.29","0.00","0.00","7.28","1.91","1.40","3.16","0.88","1.03","1.84","7.73","0.44","13.69","1.77","8.39","3.75","5.00","0.07","0.07","4.34","0.44","0.29","0.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.07","0.00","15.75","3.61","4.19","0.37","0.44","0.07","0.00","1.99","1.99","1.40","0.00","1.69","6370","8.5","28.645833333333332","2013","1352","48","51.31","14.1","13.1","11.38","15.7","297","11.75","22.066982248520713","611","25.06","35","0.44","0","49","15","151","0","186","98","11","3","14","225","165","4","62","0","0","38","17","57","5","0","2","37","0","50","32","24","19","36","50","15","3","1","4"

But their deaths were not enough. Their families must continue to pay for their crimes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered. Reviving a policy that was shelved almost a decade ago, Mr Netanyahu issued instructions to security forces to demolish the Abu Jamal family home in Jabal al-Mukabbir and revoke the residency of Nadia Abu Jamal, Ghassan Abu Jamal's widow. At least five other homes not associated with this attack are listed for demolition, and although the Israeli Supreme Court on Thursday issued temporary orders preventing their destruction following family legal action, not a single human rights organisation contacted by Fairfax Media believes any of the houses will be spared. Three homes owned by the families of other men accused of unrelated crimes have already been demolished since August, human rights groups say.

The night before Fairfax Media visited 70-year-old Mr Abu Jamal, ""dozens of soldiers came to our house to measure it in order to work out how they will destroy it"". His son's actions came out of nowhere, he says, with no hint of any kind of impending violence. A mourner sits beside the body of Aryeh Kopinsky, one of the five victims of the Har Nof synagogue attack, during his funeral in Jerusalem on November 18. Photo: Reuters ""My son was not religious, he did not go to the mosque to pray – I cannot believe my child would do such a thing,"" Mr Abu Jamal says. But after days of agonising over how someone so loved could commit such an act, he says this: ""When an external force exerts such pressure on a person and makes it impossible for him to live, to earn his daily bread, when you increase the psychological pressure on people, when you add the Gaza war and all those who we saw die, you can feel such despair.

""They"" is the Netanyahu government, which Mr Abu Jamal says intentionally pushed Palestinians to the edge with increased land grabs, settlement construction and overwhelming military force.



""Even now they are still pushing, they have yet to return the bodies of my son or his cousin. They cannot commit a crime when they are already dead, so why is the government choosing to punish us?"" he asks, crying quietly, his hand covering his face.

On the other side of the Green Line, in the Jewish neighbourhood of Har Nof, the signs of grief following the attack by Ghassan and Uday Abu Jamal are everywhere.

The family of Rabbi Twersky did not want to comment on the ongoing violence in Jerusalem or the government's attempts to deter future attacks. Instead, Rabbi Twersky's son, who did not want to provide his name, told Fairfax Media his family was overwhelmed by his death. ""When we heard he had died our grief was so strong, so deep, that words cannot describe,"" he says. But because he died in prayer, ""we were comforted that he died a saint in his holiest moment"".

His younger brother David, 40, who is also a rabbi, says it was only after Aryeh died that the family learned the scope of the kindness he had extended to his community. ""He was so loving, so kind and he made himself available to anyone . . . but he also had a fierceness in him and when the terrorists attacked the synagogue witnesses told us he fought against one of them, so we were not surprised to hear that at the end of his life he fought to save others.""

Collective punishment was de rigueur before the wide-scale atrocities of the two world wars prompted the development of the Geneva Conventions, aimed at protecting those caught up in conflict. British Collective Punishment Orders were in place in colonies from Kenya, Nigeria, Northern Rhodesia, Somaliland, Cyprus and Malaya, says academicShane Darcy, from the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland, Galway. There are also examples of collective punishment, including punitive home demolitions, in Northern Ireland in the 1920s and in Germany during World War II, Dr Darcy told Fairfax Media. The history of Israel's home demolition policy goes back to the British Mandate in Palestine, during which it was introduced in 1945. But unlike other countries formerly under British control, he says, Israel has not only chosen to keep the draconian law on its books but to publicly defend its active implementation despite its contravention of international law.



""Israel is the only country relying on legislation to enforce it, that gets the judicial seal of approval to enact it and openly says it is doing this kind of collective punishment.



""In the only contemporaneous example I am aware of, the Pakistani military were detaining relatives of suspected Taliban members and destroying their houses . . . but nowhere have I seen the Pakistan government claiming this is legal.""

Israel makes no apology for reintroducing its much-criticised policy.



""Our security services firmly believe . . . that this does act as a deterrent,"" says Mr Netanyahu's spokesman, Mark Regev.



""This tool could not be used arbitrarily by the Israel police or military, it has to go through the correct process of checks and balances, often all the way up to the Israeli Supreme Court."" Israel has demolished hundreds of Palestinian homes since they began applying the policy in 1978, says Bill van Ensveld, the Israel and Palestine researcher for Human Rights Watch.



""They do not do this in the UK, or the US, or any of the other countries that Israeli likes to point to as its democratic peers,"" Mr van Ensveld says. ""When they do this in occupied territory, it counts as a war crime.



""The idea that the family unit is very important in Palestinian society, [and] so pressure on the family will prevent potential attackers from carrying out attacks as it will result in harm to their loved ones, has no justification in international law.""



Israel's judicial system offers no protection, he warns. In the long series of cases that have gone to the Supreme Court, the court has always accepted the advice of the security authorities that this extreme measure is needed.



Violence of a broken city



Enas al-Shalodi stands amid the rubble of what was once her home, describing where her family used to sit in the evenings, where her children studied, where she cooked their meals and planted herbs for their garden.



Now she and her husband Idriss and their five surviving children are homeless, their belongings scattered through several relatives' apartments, their existence fragile and lived day-by-day.



Their lives, and that of several other families, were torn apart when their 21-year-old son Abdel Rahman drove his car onto a crowded tram platform in Jerusalem, killing a three-month-old baby, Chaya Zissel Braun, a US citizen, and 22-year-old Ecuadorian woman Karen Yemima Muscara, and injuring eight others.



Shalodi was shot several times at the scene and died later in hospital. In the aftermath of the attack and his death, activists posted images of Shalodi and linked his picture with that of five-year-old Enas Khalil, a Palestinian girl who was killed by a resident of the Yitzhar settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in a hit and run.



Car attacks such as these – but only those on Israelis – encouraged Mr Netanyahu to reintroduce the colonial-era policy the government had abandoned in 2005.



Back then, a military committee headed by Major-General Udi Shani found punitive home demolitions to be of ""questionable effectiveness"" that could result in the opposite of deterrence , describing the measure as existing only on ""the verge of legality"".



Not so, says Mr Regev.



""I think the truth is the policy was phased out as violence left us as we saw the end of the second intifada . . . now that violence has returned.



""We are concerned that this is not specifically an Israel-Palestinian problem, this is a regional phenomenon, where we have got this . . . Islamic extremism, we see it in ISIS in Iraq and Syria, we see it in Libya, we see it in Yemen, we see it in Nigeria and in other countries in Africa.""



As tensions escalated across Jerusalem and the West Bank in the lead-up to the recent 50-day war in Gaza, the first homes to be ""punitively demolished"" were those of the two Palestinian men suspected of kidnapping and killing three Israeli teenagers in June.



In a horrifying act of retaliation against a teenager who had no connection to the Israeli teens' deaths, three Israeli extremists abducted 16-year-old Palestinian Mohamed Abu Khdeir from an East Jerusalem street and burned him alive.



When Fairfax Media interviewed Mohamed Abu Khdeir's grieving parents in July, they wondered if their son's killers would ever be brought to justice and asked the question they already knew the answer to: ""Will Israel order the demolition of their homes? No.""



The divided city of Jerusalem is tense, nowhere more so than East Jerusalem – occupied by the Israeli military, illegally annexed by Israel in 1980, overcrowded and poorly maintained.



Palestinian families are scared to let their children play on the streets lest they meet the same fate as Mohamed Abu Khdeir.



Concrete blocks have been deployed to stop cars being driven into tram stops. Israelis are fearful of another attack and many Palestinians have given up using the tram, such is the verbal and physical abuse they endure.



In the Old City, scene of a renewed push by right-wing Jews to access the al-Aqsa compound and pray at the Temple Mount despite a long-held status quo agreement, prayer time has become a flashpoint for clashes between Palestinian worshippers and Israeli security forces.



The head of the Shin Bet intelligence service, Yoram Cohen, warned last week that the Israeli government was fuelling the fires of religious disharmony by encouraging Jews to pray at the contested site despite rabbinical objections.



But while prominent Israeli commentators and senior government officials are keen to paint this as part of a region-wide religious war, Palestinians say the cause of the upsurge in violence is far closer to home: Israel's decades-long military occupation and the fact that its ever-expanding settlement program has killed all hope of a two-state solution.

No matter what phrase is used, six Democrats hoping to replace retiring Republican Congressman Charlie Dent all agreed at a forum that health care should be guaranteed for all and not be driven by employer-based health insurance coverage.

The House requires representatives to find their own office space and negotiate leases with assistance, if needed from, the caucus or House attorneys.

Representatives get $27,600 to cover office rents, utilities and insurance and those expenses are listed on reimbursement records. They also get a $20,000 allocation for such things as meals, cell phones, flags, mileage and consultants and more. Postage costs come out of a separate $4,000 account. That comes to an annual allocation of $51,600 for each representative. House members can dip into any of the accounts to cover overages or ask caucus leaders for more money.

In the Senate, all money goes through the chief clerk's office, which handles financial transactions for individual lawmakers and caucuses. Unlike in the House, Senate caucus leaders do not cut their own checks. The chief clerk's office also negotiates office leases for senators and the leases are held in the name of the chief clerk's office as are insurance and utility accounts. But unlike in the House, costs associated with offices and insurance as well as consultants' fees are not on senator's expense records. Instead, those records are on the state Treasury's website and accessing them requires a separate Right to Know request.

Senators get annual $25,000 expense account for reimbursable items and $26,500 for postage. As in the House, those accounts become one $51,500 pot and records do not indicate which account specific expenses were withdrawn from.

The House's one-stop expense system can appear more transparent but it actually is more unwieldy than the Senate's, partly because the House has more expense categories for purchases.

For its analysis of 2013 spending records, The Morning Call created a set of standards for the entire Legislature. It added senators' office expenses and consultants' fees to to their individual expense records to get overall taxpayer costs. The Morning Call also combined the House's many cost categories into more general items.","2014-12-30 08:23:00","0","13.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","30.0","13.0","0.0","65.0","4.0","14.0","0","335","94.89","52.39","9.51","36.25","18.61","27.76","80.30","40.00","4.48","1.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.49","2.99","7.76","14.63","4.18","2.09","8.36","0.90","8.06","4.48","3.88","0.60","5.07","3.88","1.19","0.90","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.55","1.79","0.60","0.60","2.09","0.90","4.78","0.60","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.30","10.15","0.30","0.90","4.78","1.79","2.99","1.49","7.16","0.00","7.16","0.90","4.78","1.49","6.87","0.00","3.58","11.34","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","17.31","5.37","6.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","3.28","0.00","2.09","1685","8.21","19.055555555555557","517","327","18","53.0","12.8","10.4","13.57","12.9","76","6.571428571428571","18.576636085626912","176","17.67","0","0.42","0","18","17","32","0","41","26","4","0","2","51","22","2","49","0","0","4","4","11","2","0","0","8","0","9","8","2","4","15","9","3","0","0","0"
"http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/mc-eric-frein-strike-again-hearings-20141014-story.html","State police commissioner: Frein would strike again","State police Commissioner Frank Noonan said Tuesday that the price tag on the hunt for Eric Frein is worth bringing to justice and capturing a dangerous man who would strike again if given the chance.

Noonan, responding to questions about the manhunt's cost after a closed-door briefing with lawmakers in Harrisburg, said a review by behavioral scientists indicates Frein would commit another, similar crime.

""What is the cost if we don't catch him?"" Noonan asked. ""What is the cost if he commits another crime?""

Noonan's briefing came as a state senator called for a hearing on state and local emergency response after the Frein dragnet draws to a close.

The hearing, which Sen. Lisa Baker has requested be held in Pike County, is not meant to be a forum for finger-pointing, she said, but to assess Pennsylvania's readiness to respond to an emergency.

""The intent is not to find fault, but instead to offer a realistic assessment of what we know, and what we might take into account in the future,"" the Luzerne County Republican said in a letter to various committee chairmen. ""Such a forum provides a path to positive action in response to lessons learned.""

The round-the-clock manhunt has affected innocent residents, businesses and hundreds of law enforcement agents, Baker said. And as the search for Frein in the dense forests of the Pocono Mountains stretches into its fifth week, a review is fitting.

""Naturally, because of the money, manpower and time involved, questions are surfacing about how technology or laws could assist in future searches,"" she said.

The hunt for Frein, an unemployed 31-year-old survivalist and war re-enactor accused of ambushing two troopers Sept. 12 outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove Township, Pike County, is costing law enforcement agencies more than $1 million per week.

Officers from three states have joined the search. There are roughly 300 troopers on the manhunt daily, working 12-hour shifts of 150 troopers each, seven days per week, according to state police. The search also includes an unspecified number of plainclothes officers.

The FBI also has 140 to 200 employees in the field each day, including agents, analysts, technicians, three full SWAT teams and members of a hostage rescue team.

There are 50 to 60 staff members from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, including special agents, special tactical response teams, explosives specialists, intelligence specialists, and dog handlers.

State police haven't tallied the exact cost to the department, Lt. Col. George Bivens said last week, but it's in the range of ""several million dollars."" The Morning Call reported Sunday an estimated cost to the state and federal law enforcement agencies of $1.4 million a week.

A spokesman from Gov. Tom Corbett's office said state budget officials are monitoring the costs, which so far can be absorbed by the state police's $221 million annual budget.

Noonan said Tuesday the manhunt is not suffering from a lack of resources and he didn't need to request any additional funding at this time.

Cost to state and local governments are among the topics Baker suggested lawmakers review. A hearing would also open a review of officer safety needs and barracks assessments, effectiveness of technology, communications policies and impact on businesses, institutions and the public.

State police spokeswoman Maria A. Finn said Tuesday that the state police would be happy to participate in such a hearing.

Early on in the search, residents complained of confusion and patchy communication.

Nicole Parker, 40, of Canadensis, Monroe County, said she was stuck outside her neighborhood for several days and police waved her off with little explanation when she tried to return home.

""I was finding out more from friends in New York and from the Internet than police here,"" she told reporters.

The owner of Martinville Streamside Cottages in Canadensis, Tom Marro, said his family-owned business was at risk of losing reservations because of fear, and the lack of communication fed the spread of false information and rumors.

"http://www.mcall.com/opinion/yourview/mc-climate-change-conferenceperu-husic-yv--20141125-story.html","Diane W. Husic: Progress expected at climate change conference in Peru","On Monday, the 20th Conference of the Parties (COP20) will commence in Lima, Peru, to continue attempts to draft a global treaty on climate change.

It has been 25 years since the international community called for action on greenhouse gases. When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted in 1992, the treaty indicated that member states would ""act in the interests of human safety even in the face of scientific uncertainty.""

Since then, the scientific uncertainty about climate change and its causes has been greatly diminished. Thousands of peer-reviewed papers are published each year, and in the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, experts expressed high confidence level (more than 95 percent) that climate change is indeed human-caused.

A number of factors and events from the past year will make COP20 not only important but also interesting.

•COP21 in Paris in 2015 is the target for adopting a legally binding treaty that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to limit the global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius and make major progress on issues related to managing risks of extreme weather events and assisting developing countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change already being experienced. Thus, the final targets and language will have to be developed in Lima.

•To ""galvanize and catalyze climate action"" in advance of COP20, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon invited world leaders to a climate summit in September; more than 100 showed up. Two days before the summit, the largest climate march in history took place with 2,646 events in 162 countries. More than 300,000 people marched in the streets of New York City alone.

•The United Nations hosted 13 sessions to develop the post-2015 sustainable development goals. Combating global climate change was at the forefront of these discussions.

•According to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the average global temperatures over land and ocean surfaces for June, September and October were the highest since record keeping began in 1880. October marked the 356th consecutive month (almost 30 years) with a global temperature above the 20th century average. The last below-average global temperature for any month was in February 1985. 2014 is on track to be the warmest year on record globally. Welcome to our new normal.

•Slower to warm because of the physical and chemical properties of water, our oceans are now demonstrating the anticipated changes. The September global sea surface temperature was the highest on record for any month. Did these warming waters have any impact on Typhoon Nuri, the recent storm that hit Alaska? Perhaps. Meteorologists believe that Nuri may have been one of the deepest extra-tropical, low-pressure systems on record in the North Pacific. There have been many of these ""strongest storms ever"" around the globe recently.

•Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels surpassed the 400 parts per million mark this past spring. Unlike the stock market, rising values are not what we are hoping for with greenhouse gases. According to an October 2009 paper in the highly respected journal Science, you have to go back 15 million years to find atmospheric conditions like that in our atmosphere — long before Homo sapiens were around. According to UCLA professor Aradhna Tripati, the lead author on that paper, ""The last time carbon dioxide levels were apparently as high as they are today … global temperatures were 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than they are today, the sea level was approximately 75 to 120 feet higher than today, there was no permanent sea ice cap in the Arctic and very little ice on Antarctica and Greenland.""

•The November election results will bring to Washington a Republican-controlled House and Senate. Party leaders have already vowed to revoke regulations aimed at tackling carbon pollution and spent the past two weeks trying to push through approval of the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline project. But seemingly out of the blue came the announcement of a historic climate-related agreement between the U.S. and China. While the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions of these two countries are not sufficient to fix the problem of global climate change, this is a crucial first step. These two nations with the largest carbon footprints have been among the most recalcitrant parties at the conferences of the parties. No doubt this agreement will lead to a showdown in Washington, but it could really provide the spark needed to ignite progress at the international negotiation table.

Stay tuned! 2014 still has several more weeks to add even more interesting chapters into the climate history book.

Husic, chair and professor in the department of biological sciences at Moravian College, is part of a delegation of faculty and students from the college that will attend the 20th Conference of the Parties next week in Lima, Peru.","2014-11-25 17:40:00","0","19.0","2.0","0.0","0.0","25.0","2.0","41.0","21.0","0.0","76.0","4.0","14.0","0","813","98.13","57.33","69.05","58.35","20.85","27.68","73.31","41.08","3.44","0.98","0.00","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.25","2.46","8.98","16.36","6.27","2.83","3.44","0.62","8.61","5.90","3.69","0.25","4.18","2.58","3.69","2.71","0.98","0.62","0.00","0.25","3.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.75","0.62","2.83","0.62","1.97","0.37","1.60","0.74","0.25","0.00","0.37","0.86","0.25","0.12","0.12","0.25","7.13","1.48","1.60","3.94","0.74","0.49","3.44","4.80","1.35","22.39","2.95","11.81","7.75","5.17","0.86","0.12","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.37","0.12","0.12","0.12","0.00","0.00","12.67","5.04","3.44","0.00","0.12","0.12","0.12","1.23","0.98","0.00","0.74","0.86","4096","8.92","22.0","1269","802","36","48.84","12.9","12.0","13.58","14.5","212","11.0","21.493566084788032","443","19.97","12","0.39","0","21","33","88","0","108","62","7","7","10","136","85","0","64","0","0","6","4","34","1","2","0","27","0","27","25","19","19","13","9","3","1","0","1"
"http://www.mcall.com/opinion/yourview/mc-why-tom-corbett-lost-governors-election-yv-1107-20141106-story.html","Madonna and Young: Why Corbett's re-election chances were doomed","The historic scope of Tom Corbett's loss on Tuesday must be understood to place it in any meaningful perspective. In losing to Democrat Tom Wolf, he became the first Pennsylvania governor in 40 years to fail to win re-election, and his party became the first party in 60 years to fail to win two consecutive gubernatorial terms.

Even worse — except Dick Thornburgh (1979-87) who won re-election narrowly during a deep recession — Corbett's predecessors were re-elected by an average of 23 percentage points. Corbett lost by 10 points — an astounding 33-point difference between Corbett and his predecessors.

Against this historically massive rejection of Corbett, the titular leader of the Republican Party, there is little evidence that the GOP itself was affected. State Republicans increased their control of the House as well as the Senate, and every one of 12 Republican congressional incumbents running for re-election was re-elected.

In short Corbett's loss was mostly his own, but his defeat was aided by a Republican-controlled Legislature that gave him few of his major policy priorities. The larger failure was Corbett's. He failed to grasp the challenges confronting him or to tackle them effectively, making his re-election virtually impossible.

Arguably these five were the worst:

•Failure to recover from his first year. Every governor to seek re-election but one since 1968 had a bad first year, and all won re-election. Milton Shapp, Bob Casey, Tom Ridge and Ed Rendell all had tough first years and low job approval ratings. But each recovered by the end of his second year. Corbett never did. Corbett's major first-year challenge was the education budget that dominated the press coverage and the polls, ultimately becoming fodder for campaign commercials, and framed subsequent political discussions. Corbett lost control of the narrative that he needlessly cut education spending, resulting in property tax hikes, faculty layoffs and program curtailments.

•A failed agenda. The major factor in the re-election of any first-term incumbent governor is success in enacting major parts of his agenda. Corbett achieved less of his professed agenda than any governor in modern times. His inability to secure his major agenda, including pension relief and liquor privatization together with his unwillingness to exploit his one big legislative achievement — $2.4 billion yearly in road, bridges and mass transit funding — left him with little to convince voters that he deserved another term.

•Modest level of political skills. Corbett seemed to eschew the political style cultivated by most major politicians. Notable was his failure to develop a working relationship with legislative leaders of his own party, thereby limiting their enthusiasm for his agenda. He was further hobbled by division in his party between a conservative House and a more moderate Senate. He failed to communicate very well objectives or accomplishments of his administration. His political opponent was able to define him and did. Perhaps the quintessential example of Corbett's communication problems was his failure to ever give the electorate a compelling reason to re-elect him.

•An ideological bent and inflexible style. Corbett took office faced with daunting problems, not the least of which was a large budget shortfall and looming structural deficit. But he tackled these and other problems shackled with a promise to not raise taxes, accompanied by a propensity to be inflexible. He failed adequately to address the need for more school district spending. He pushed obsessively to privatize operations of state government, long after it became obvious that voter priorities lay elsewhere. He failed to adapt when expectations of the electorate shifted. Voters, for example, overwhelmingly favored raising more revenues through an extraction tax while expanding other state services. Corbett ignored this while he and the Legislature simultaneously failed to deal with the state's $2 billion deficit. All of this weighed heavily upon a governor who had pledged to put the fiscal affairs of the state in good order.

•Penn State. Corbett suffered a loss of popularity from the Jerry Sandusky prosecution, his acceptance of the Freeh report, and NCAA sanctions against the university. The fallout cost Corbett badly needed support from many Penn State alums, especially among the university's midstate alumni and loyal support base, many of whom typically vote Republican. The governor could have let the process play out by not participating openly and actively on the Penn State board as his predecessors had. He did none of that. Instead he stepped in personally, endorsed the now-controversial Freeh report and supported the firing of Joe Paterno and the subsequent sanctions against the university. A more seasoned politician would have avoided any direct involvement.

Finally, Corbett lost because he could not recover from the judgment too many voters made from the outset. Too late did his campaign become focused or did he show the energy and persistence that might have saved him. But it was a case of much too little, much too late. Corbett ultimately was the wrong man at the wrong time in the wrong office.

"http://www.mcall.com/opinion/yourview/mc-yv-madonna-young-us-senate-1026-20141024-story.html","Madonna and Young: A tie in the U.S. Senate could happen","Think things can't get any worse with the approval rating of Congress polling as low as a 7 percent while national problems pile up and an increasingly dysfunctional House and Senate continue to set new records for sheer futility?

If so, you would be wrong. They can get a lot worse. And they just might after Election Day, Nov. 4.

The problem is the Senate, and the issue is whether either party will win the 51 votes minimally needed to organize and operate that body for the next two years. The prospect for a tied Senate at 50 to 50 after Nov. 4 is very real as we enter the final days of campaigning.

Right now, 45 seats are probably safe for Democrats, 47 for Republicans. Another eight seats are competitive meaning either party could win. So Republicans have to win four of them to win the Senate, while fewer could give the body to Democrats or even produce a 50-50 tie.

The GOP is well positioned. In fact, most assessments by independent analysts forecast Republicans will pick up between four and eight Senate seats.

The fly in the Republican ointment, however, is that there are two ""Independents"" with a prospect for victory — Kansas and South Dakota. If at least one of them is victorious, it becomes dicey — enough so that a 50 to 50 split might occur, producing chaos across Congress.

If a tie should exist after Election Day, Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution would be invoked, giving the vice president, one Joseph Biden, the power to vote and break ties that exist. In normal times the vice president constitutionally presides over the Senate but does not vote on matters before the Senate unless a tie exists.

A constitutional tie in the Senate would be profoundly troubling, given the disarray in national politics. It would either intensify the extreme polarization already stultifying our politics — or as bad, bring government to even more of a standstill than already exists. As a country, the prospects of a Senate tie makes us similar to an already ill patient suddenly faced with an even more calamitous sickness.

The worst precedent in Senate history of a divided chamber occurred after the election of 1880. The possible parallels to 2014 are chilling. Then the Senate was split 37 Republicans, 37 Democrats, with two Independents. With the new session in 1881, reorganization of the Senate took place. The two Independents went their separate ways. Illinois Sen. David A. Davis joined the Democrats, while Virginian William Mahone caucused with the Republicans.

The tiebreaker was newly elected Vice President Republican Chester Arthur, but Republicans, lacking sufficient members in the chamber, were not able to organize properly. Consequently, Democrats maintained control of the committee chairmanships they had held previously, as the operations of the U.S. Senate descended into a farce.

Ultimately, it took the Senate two years to finally resolve its leadership crisis, blessedly ending one of the stranger moments in Senate history.

The most recent 50 to 50 Senate split occurred in the tumult of January 2001, in the aftermath of the disputed Bush-Gore presidential election. Al Gore, as Clinton' outgoing vice president, was the tiebreaker for the first 17 days of the new Congress. When Dick Cheney became vice president on Jan. 20, he became the tiebreaker. Cheney broke several ties during his years in office, but only two in the period when the Senate party composition was equally divided.

Awkward as that was, some amity still existed in Congress, and both sides worked out arrangements to make it all work.

If you think a similar tie would work in 2014, then you might be interested in buying a slightly used bridge in Brooklyn.

Let's be clear: Given the extreme polarization and excessive partisanship in Washington today, nothing good at all is going to happen with a 50-50 Senate split. Challenges the Senate will likely confront in the new Congress — immigration, energy, foreign policy, amendments to the Affordable Care Act, deciding executive appointments and Supreme Court confirmations — are simply not going to be met with an evenly split Senate.

The wild card in what is otherwise a horrific scenario is Vice President Biden. Biden is a creature of the Senate, long a part of the Senate establishment and someone with close relationships with Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Biden might make a tie work if anyone can.

We should all hope he doesn't need to do it — and we don't need to find out if he can.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/la-ed-sony-hack-20141216-story.html","The strangely muted response to Sony's hack","The last year has been marked by headline-grabbing cybercrimes, including the theft of stunning amounts of personal information from Target, Home Depot and online photo-storage sites. Now, the hackers who targeted Sony Pictures' computer network have opened a new front in cyberwar: thefts motivated not by money, but by malice. The severity and sophistication of the attack are alarming, yet aside from launching the obligatory FBI investigation, the response from government officials and from Hollywood's other studios has been strangely muted.

A group that calls itself Guardians of Peace struck a devastating blow to Sony Pictures' network in late November, extracting copies of a huge number of internal documents and then erasing them from Sony's computers. It caused enough damage to shut down the network for days, forcing employees to revert to working on paper and whiteboards. Since then the hackers have leaked emails and other material online, revealing secrets about the company's salaries, business model and executives' deliberations. Unlike conventional industrial espionage, the point wasn't to give a company's secrets to its competitors. It was to make them public on a grand scale, embarrassing the victim and crippling its ability to do business.

The damage is ongoing, with the hackers leaking documents incrementally and reporters mining them for news. Regardless of whether you think the news media are amplifying the attack or just documenting it, one important lesson the coverage has conveyed is the need for companies to take better care of the sensitive information they've collected. It's not just banks and retailers that have to worry about the credit card numbers they have on file. Corporations have to assume they'll be targets, and never leave such things as passwords and Social Security numbers unencrypted.

Few, if any, companies could defend themselves successfully against assaults of the scale and destructiveness as that on Sony, which rivaled the Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear program and other government-sponsored malware. (There's some evidence suggesting that the hackers were backed by North Korea, although the government there denies it.) Had it been a physical attack instead of an electronic one, local officials and Hollywood studios would have rallied around Sony. They haven't, reflecting the intangible nature of the damage and the other studios' desire not to attract their own hacks. And it's all the more reason for Congress to allow companies and government agencies to share what they're learning about the nature of cyberattacks and how to defend against them. Sadly, while Sony was scrambling to contain the damage from the hack, Congress was punting — again — on a bill to permit that sort of information sharing, which has been held up by privacy concerns. Such a law might not have protected Sony against the Guardians of Peace, but it could help the next victim.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/music/mc-gavin-degraw-billy-joel-philadelphia-20140731-story.html","Gavin DeGraw in a collaborative spirit","Don't count Gavin DeGraw as one of the singer-songwriters who balks at co-writing with other artists.

He dipped his toes into the co-writing water on his previous album, ""Sweeter,"" collaborating on four songs.

For his recently released album, ""Make a Move,"" he teamed up with other songwriters on all 11 songs.

""When I put out 'Sweeter,' that was my first attempt at really doing some co-writing for my own album,"" DeGraw says in a phone interview. ""I felt like the co-writing thing went so well on 'Sweeter,' I enjoyed it. It shed new light on songwriting for me and brought new elements to the songs I get to perform that I wouldn't have been able to touch if I was doing it on my own. And not just the songwriting, but also the production and working with different producers really brings new sounds and new rhythmic structures. It really adds a lot more interesting elements to the album that wouldn't be there if it was me just diving into my own brain and trying get creative. It also alleviated a lot of that strain of feeling the pressure of doing it all on your own, and it freed me.""

Having artists co-write, of course, has become a favorite strategy, especially for major labels and their artists that are trying to build their success through mainstream radio airplay. The idea is that pairing an artist with a songwriter — ideally one with a track record of writing hits for other artists — gives the artist his or her best chance at coming up with hits.

Some artists, though, resist co-writing, interpreting it as a suggestion that the artist needs to change to come up with something more conducive to radio play.

DeGraw, 37, says commercial success is a consideration, but he has made sure his collaborations have produced songs that are true to the type of music he wants to make and what he wants to say.

""You know what, you always want to have a hit, first of all,"" he says. ""All artists want a hit. It doesn't matter how avant garde the artist is or as far out as they may possibly think or say they think, everybody wants to have something that people recognize. So obviously, of course, you're always hoping that something's going to catch on.

""But at the same time, you always want to make sure the quality is there. So you really want to make sure your subject matter is there and that you're really bringing it when you release it, that it's something you can still get behind.""

DeGraw says he found that co-writing brings far more advantages than drawbacks. On ""Make a Move,"" he teamed up with leading tunesmiths Ryan Tedder (of OneDirection), Martin Johnson (Taylor Swift, Daughtry), Chris DeStefano (Luke Bryan, Rascal Flatts) and David Hodges (Evanescence, Kelly Clarkson). He says the collaborations have enhanced creativity. He pointed to Tedder as an example.

""He's a wonderful writer. He's a great guy. When he writes alone, I'm sure that as a writer, it [co-writing] still helps his mind, helps his brain, his creative process. He does so much writing and so much co-writing as well, that there's always something new to draw from. So even when you're not co-writing a song, if you come out of a session and you were co-writing with somebody, and the next day you start writing something on your own, you feel inspired because you've been taking in all of this new information. It's a special process, and staying inspired is so important in pursuing those new options, those new ideas.""

DeGraw is seeing a difference in his music because of the collaborations.

""I think it has made me a little bit more bold as far as what I could or should say, as far as what my material was,"" he says. ""Sometimes it takes you out of that lonesome introspective thing and turns you into a little bit more, you can take on a persona a little bit differently if you're in a room with somebody else. You think OK, cool, well, let's experiment here. I like that element of it.""

With ""Make a Move,"" DeGraw has gotten a bit more uptempo, with deeper grooves and beats that are more danceable — qualities that are in step with much of the music played on top 40 and pop radio.

Earlier in his career, DeGraw fell firmly in the singer-songwriter camp, gaining comparisons to the likes of John Mayer and Elton John, with a rootsy pop sound that rocked on occasion, but was mostly easy-going. But his biggest successes were with some of his friskier tunes.

DeGraw's 2004 debut CD, ""Chariot,"" was a million-selling hit that included the singles ""I Don't Want to Be"" (an edgy, hooky rocker that topped the Billboard magazine Pop chart) and ""Chariot"" (a pop-rocker that was a top 5 Adult Pop single). ""In Love with a Girl,"" a punchy track from his 2008 self-titled second CD, also reached number five on the Adult Pop chart. But his 2009 third album, ""Free,"" failed to click.

Going into ""Sweeter,"" DeGraw felt an urgency to be on the charts again. The album produced a number one hit on Billboard's Adult Pop chart in ""Not Over You"" (a mid-tempo tune with an insistent beat) and a top 20 hit on the same chart with the potent and grooving title song. A stint in 2012 on the hit television show ""Dancing with the Stars"" helped his visibility, as well.

""Make a Move"" is DeGraw's most assertive and modern sounding album yet, with programmed rhythms and synths used more prominently than on the previous CDs. He pushes more toward a dance-pop sound on ""Best I Ever Had,"" the first single (a disco-ish tune which reached number 14 at Adult Pop). ""Leading Man"" is a sassy rocker with some fuzzed out tones. Meanwhile, ""Every Little Bit"" (one of the best songs) is earthier, as DeGraw sounds a bit like a poppier Ben Harper. Even the ballads, including ""Eveything Will Change"" and ""Finest Hour,"" have rhythmic heft and radio-friendly synthetic touches.","2014-07-31 23:22:57","0","39.0","13.0","0.0","0.0","24.0","2.0","46.0","21.0","0.0","85.0","4.0","16.0","0","1038","75.83","70.87","15.97","93.53","21.62","16.76","82.47","48.94","13.97","7.80","2.02","0.10","2.22","3.08","0.39","6.17","7.80","13.49","6.45","4.05","6.74","0.77","16.09","7.03","4.53","1.06","2.31","3.37","5.20","4.72","0.39","0.19","0.00","0.19","9.06","0.00","0.19","0.19","3.18","13.01","1.83","2.50","1.83","3.18","1.83","3.08","5.20","0.29","3.76","0.77","0.87","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.48","5.49","0.87","2.79","2.02","1.73","0.10","2.79","9.44","0.96","13.01","2.70","6.55","3.85","3.66","3.95","0.10","0.19","0.10","0.00","0.58","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.39","0.00","22.54","4.62","6.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.02","4.91","2.41","1.73","0.19","4497","7.23","22.0625","1381","1020","48","66.78","10.3","9.2","9.81","11.2","164","7.25","16.951372549019606","445","19.81","16","0.48","0","35","17","95","0","122","85","2","3","5","151","83","1","48","0","0","72","26","63","9","1","7","22","0","26","36","36","15","35","41","12","5","0","5"
"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/music/mc-tom-petty-allentown-ppl-center-hypnotic-eye-20140913-story.html","Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers continue to continue to strike a chord with hypnotic rock tunes","Before easing into a conversation about his new album with the Heartbreakers, ""Hypnotic Eye,"" the longtime Malibu beach-dweller Tom Petty has a score to settle. It's in response to an old Los Angeles Times survey of Los Angeles' most enduring rock bands.

Specifically: He and the Heartbreakers shouldn't have been disqualified because of his north Florida roots.

""We're an L.A. band,"" says Petty, 63, with a good-natured but emphatic tone, puffing on a vapor pen while lounging in his home studio. The Heartbreakers were birthed in this city, he adds.

""We're certainly as L.A. as the Springfield were or the Byrds,"" he says, then geekily lists Buffalo Springfield players and their hometowns before focusing on the Doors. His voice rises: ""Jim Morrison was from Florida!"" Petty's beard is hermit scraggly, as if he's been cooking his meals beneath the trees out back. He's wearing blue jeans and a black western shirt over a tee.

The slight bugged him for years, he says, mostly because of the ribbing he got from his accomplished peers. ""I got the finger shaken at me by so many people. 'Hey, you're not an L.A. band!'""

Add in that Petty and the Heartbreakers have never recorded outside of Southern California — early years at Shelter in East Hollywood and Sound City in Van Nuys — and his frequent lyrical nods to his home. ""Free Fallin',"" his solo ode to cruising the San Fernando Valley, cemented his residency years ago, as did the Roger McGuinn-suggestive Rickenbacker strum of ""The Waiting"" before that.

Let the record show that Petty and his Heartbreakers, with 13 studio albums, thousands of concerts, three solo records and hundreds of hours in area studios, should be deemed an L.A. band — backdated to the mid-1970s.

It doesn't hurt that his Malibu compound, one of a pair in the area, looks every bit the property of a successful entertainer. Expansively spread behind two levels of security, his beachfront property has a shiny Tesla sedan in the garage and a team of landscapers working the foliage.

""Hypnotic Eye,"" only the second Heartbreakers album in 12 years, closes the argument. Opening with a basic statement of purpose — ""I'm gonna make my way through this world some day/ I don't care what nobody say"" — Petty and band roll through a collection whose emotions range from profound love to bitter cynicism. Petty tackles optimism on ""American Dream Plan B"" and recalls midnight interludes on the lovely midtempo love song ""Red River.""

The tangled guitar line that opens ""Power Drunk,"" courtesy of Mike Campbell, mixes with keyboard player Benmont Tench's organ chords on a song about the intoxicating allure of power. Closer ""Shadow People"" is a lovely meditation on isolation and communion. ""Fault Lines"" is the best Petty song in years.

Time and timelessness

It doesn't get any easier to make them. Petty says that as the years have passed it's gotten tougher for him and Campbell to pen a passable composition. ""The two of us together turns into a recipe for procrastination,"" admits Petty. The pause is in part because of the pressure of his catalog as well as to the aging process itself, which he says makes it harder to focus.

For generations, Petty and band have been the no-nonsense voice of a brand of rock that cut through pretense, haircuts and studio trickery to craft songs that resonated without being dumb, cloying, gratuitous or commercially designed trend hoppers.

His classics since his rise in the mid-1970s have transcended subgenre, part of a philosophy that avoided scenes and synthesizers. The Heartbreakers first broke in England, where they found kindred spirits in bands such as the Clash and the Sex Pistols, but were outsiders by design. They were more interested in the sound coming from Los Angeles in the mid-1960s than the punk tropes of a decade later.

""I didn't want to put on the outfit. I really felt an allegiance to their trip, and I loved the spirit of it,"" he says, ""but our identity was too well formed to go that way. I remember one of them saying, 'You guys need to cut your hair.' And I was like, 'Mm, no.' Then I would be joining a club. I just want to be our own thing.""

Boogie rock, disco, metal, synth-pop, grunge, rap rock, indie rock, blog rock and dance rock have come and gone, but the Heartbreakers endure through a focus nearly identical in 2014 as in their first Los Angeles gigs. As they've remained true, though, the band has ceded its role at the center of the rock conversation. Petty's a reclusive guy by nature, part of his allure. (The only mention of straying from Malibu comes when he speaks of visiting one of his two adult daughters in New York.)

The band's body of work weighs on Petty. ""After you've written 300, 400 [songs], you've got to really concentrate so you can get something that feels fresh and is worth the money to someone who has a whole bunch of Tom Petty records. 'Why would I buy another one?' Well, because it's worth it, you know?""

Adds guitarist Mike Campbell later: ""The bar is high.""

Faults but never default

Less bluesy by design than 2010's ""Mojo,"" his most recent Heartbreakers record, the 11 new songs on ""Hypnotic Eye"" draw on riff-heavy rock, gentle swagger, coolly recollected moments, blues (always blues), much masterful guitar work from founding Heartbreakers Campbell and Tench's typically light and efficient touch on piano and keyboards.

""I wanted it to be a pretty rock 'n' roll album from top to bottom,"" says Petty. They started work on it three years ago between tours and were inspired anew, he says, by young rock bands and ""the wild abandon of the sounds and energy. I wanted to do some of that — but in the way that we would do it."" Cue ""Faultlines,"" a riveting, surprising song about the fractures and tectonic shifts that occur within ourselves and our lives. A work that couldn't have been penned anywhere but Southern California or by anyone but Petty and Campbell, it confirms not only the group's stature but its continued inventiveness.

""I love that song,"" Petty says, his eyes shining as he talks about the spark that generated the lyrical theme. ""It's so strange how that stuff works, how it pops in your head.""","2014-09-13 21:16:09","0","48.0","13.0","0.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","36.0","18.0","0.0","89.0","4.0","16.0","0","1070","86.08","74.96","10.17","7.45","18.45","18.69","79.63","46.54","11.50","7.01","1.50","0.75","0.75","3.18","0.84","4.49","8.69","13.93","5.61","2.99","6.54","1.31","11.40","6.36","3.08","0.84","2.06","1.96","6.73","2.52","4.11","0.37","1.78","1.31","10.28","0.09","0.19","0.09","3.36","7.38","1.03","1.40","1.12","1.59","0.65","2.06","4.49","1.21","2.52","0.65","2.06","0.93","0.19","0.09","0.47","5.70","2.06","1.59","0.75","1.31","0.47","3.18","7.20","0.47","13.08","1.78","7.10","4.49","1.87","4.39","0.84","0.47","0.28","0.00","0.84","0.19","0.28","0.00","0.37","0.00","22.71","5.42","6.73","0.28","0.00","0.19","0.19","0.84","4.86","3.55","0.37","0.28","4845","7.68","19.90909090909091","1483","1062","57","69.52","10.4","8.2","10.79","10.7","210","5.0625","17.34960451977401","555","18.42","24","0.45","0","45","20","103","0","142","70","3","2","5","177","114","3","65","0","0","61","31","36","1","1","2","21","0","22","34","22","21","34","44","8","2","1","5"

The start of U.K. boy-band One Direction's rise to the top, its first hit ""What Makes You Beautiful,"" seemed standard for the genre: a big, hooky pop song that was pleasant enough. Its subsequent hits ""Live While You're Young"" and ""Best Song Ever"" didn't do much to change that viewpoint.

The game-changer came with the group's hit ""The Story of My Life,"" released in October. With its alternative-folk influences and mood of loss and lament, it was something quite different from the standard boy-band fare.

Does it mean One Direction will have a long life? Who knows? But it means the group will be big for a while yet.

Opening act 5 Seconds of Summer already is selling tickets to shows in 2015. Looks like it will be around awhile, too.

•7 p.m. Aug. 13 and 14, with 5 Seconds of Summer, Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia. Tickets: $39.50-$99.50. http://www.ticketmaster.com, 800-745-3000.

KEITH URBAN

Keith Urban is among those special country music artists who talents seem to improve with longevity. And it's not because of his role as an ""American Idol"" judge, it's in spite of it.

Yes, Urban should get attention as the first artist to really marry rock and country (Alabama did it earlier, but Urban was more thorough). But Urban's biggest achievement is that he's continued to improve not only his own talents, but also the genre's.

""We Were Us,"" ""Cop Car"" and ""Somewhere in My Car"" from his year-old album ""Fuse"" are some of his best songs. The big surprise is that they've come more than 20 years into his career.

6:30 p.m. Aug. 10, Sands Steel Stage, Musikfest, Bethlehem. Sold out, but tickets available from secondary markets. http://www.artsquest.org, 610-332-3378.

THE AVETT BROTHERS

Whether it was the times or the music industry, it took The Avett Brothers a decade and five albums, to finally get notice. Thank goodness it did. The Avetts are among the best of the new Americana-folk movement.

The spotlight finally came with its 2009 major-label debut, ""I and Love and You,"" and getting chosen one of Rolling Stone's ""Artists to Watch."" After The Avetts performed with Bob Dylan and Mumford and Sons at the 2011 Grammy Awards, ""I and Love and You"" shot to No. 4 on iTunes, and its next album, ""The Carpenter,"" went to No. 4.

In 2012, the group released ""The Carpenter,"" which debuted at No. 4 on Billboard's albums chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Americana Album. Its latest disc, October's ""Magpie and the Dandelion,"" hit the Top 5.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/sc-unbroken-review-20141222-column.html","The Morning Call","Laura Hillenbrand's 2010 nonfiction account ""Unbroken"" introduced millions to Louis Zamperini, the Italian-American who competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and, in World War II, became an Army Air Corps bombardier flying missions over the South Pacific. In 1943 Zamperini was aboard a rickety B-24 aircraft, the ""Green Hornet,"" when it crashed in the water. He and two other survivors, ""Phil"" Phillips and ""Mac"" McNamara, survived 33 days on a life raft, contending with Japanese bomber strafings and killer sharks.

McNamara didn't make it to day 34, but Zamperini and Phillips eked out two more weeks at sea, only to be captured by the enemy. Then, until the end of the war, Zamperini was tortured by his captors, chiefly the Japanese prison commander known as ""The Bird"" (played by Japanese singer-songwriter Miyavi).

Hillenbrand's title, which is also the title of director Angelina Jolie's film version, indicates a hard-won triumph. Zamperini survived these ordeals and lived to age 97. Jolie's version of the story, solidly crafted if slightly hollow, comes from a script by Joel and Ethan Coen based on earlier drafts by Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. Jack O'Connell gives his all as Zamperini. (In the forthcoming, and excellent, Belfast, Ireland-set film ""'71,"" O'Connell plays another military man in a life-and-death nightmare.)

""Unbroken"" makes for a grueling experience, which is not quite the same as a memorable one. Jolie's previous directorial effort, the Bosnian War drama ""In the Land of Blood and Honey,"" announced a filmmaker of moral seriousness as well as technical prowess. Both are fully on view in ""Unbroken,"" but there's something aggressively Hollywood-y about it. For better or worse, Jolie — who worked with Clint Eastwood as his leading actress in ""Changeling"" — favors director Eastwood's style of square, on-the-nose and visually uncomplicated storytelling. The courage and swagger under fire in ""Unbroken"" seems more like the movies than real life.

Cinematographer Roger Deakins, among the best in the world, treats each new shot as an improbably pretty picture, the lighting just so, the shadows and silhouettes beautiful, even when the circumstances are grim beyond measure. It's the same with the music: Composer Alexandre Desplat's orchestral flourishes have a way of distancing and falsifying Zamperini's ordeal. When Mac (Finn Wittrock) receives his burial at sea, it's strange to be thinking about other matters, such as how much more effective the scene might be without mood music behind it.

I wonder if Jolie's formidable, often fearsomely intense work as an actress has affected her way of seeing and framing other people's stories. Often in ""Unbroken,"" the camera glides in slowly, in mythic mode, while O'Connell holds a pose, unblinking, stalwart, unbroken. Zamperini is less a dimensional character in the film than he is a superhuman lesson in affirmation against all odds. Zamperini's postwar ordeal, his struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder, his relationship to religion: All that messy, complex business is handled abruptly in a few quick title cards just before the end credits. Rightly, Jolie didn't want to tell the man's entire life story. But as is, at too-convenient dramatic junctures, the screenplay darts back into flashbacks of Zamperini's childhood or young adulthood, when we should really be sticking with the crisis at hand.

""Unbroken"" - 2 1/2 stars

MPAA rating: PG-13 (for war violence, including intense sequences of brutality, and for brief language)

A ROLLICK OF REVELERS ... A rooftop of reindeer ... A gobble of turkey dinners ... a deja gout of leftovers ... A banquet of wines ... A caper of kids ... A descent of relatives ... A rainbow of ribbons ... An excelsis of carols.""

Thus reads the annual card from the fabulous Jimmy Lipton and his wife Kedakai. And before he was famous as the host of ""Inside the Actors Studio's"" incredible interviews, Mr. Lipton was already well known for his formula of quaint descriptions of the holidays.

You can see him on Bravo doing his one-and-only probing, piercing, appreciating interviews with every kind of acting star. These luminaries grant Mr. Lipton time, even when they say NO, NO, A THOUSAND TIMES NO to other celebrity Q-and-As. And who can blame them for feeling a little ""used"" by the networks, the Internet and social media, which has changed our lives. Celebrities have fabulous money, but they have no privacy and are overanalyzed to death.

So when you want the real thing, keep turning to Jimmy Lipton and ""Inside the Actors Studio"" on Bravo! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to our friends, the Liptons!

TONIGHT, one of the most brilliant TV characters in history says goodbye when Stephen Colbert ends his ""conservative fool"" impersonation after nine years at Comedy Central. He is a great actor. I don't quite know how he did it, but I will miss him greatly.

I've never met this genius, but I look forward to experiencing his real-life personality, replacing David Letterman on CBS soon.

Lately, Letterman himself has become compelling again. He has nothing to prove and nothing to lose in his self-chosen bow-out.

One John Willenbecher sends me this regarding the new movie ""Exodus,"" saying: ""I am reminded of an old Milton Berle joke:

After the great struggle across the desert, Moses and his people finally reached the Red Sea. But standing on the shore, looking right and looking left, Moses said to Manny, his agent, ""So where are the boats? I distinctly remember saying we'd need boats."" And Manny, looking horrified, said ""Oy! I forgot to order them!"" So Moses said, ""Manny, how do you think we're going to get across the Red Sea if we don't have any boats? Do you expect me to just command the waters to part so we can walk across?""

""Listen, Moses,"" Manny said, ""if you can do that, I can get you two pages in the Old Testament.""

PAULA Mutzel of New Jersey comments about the now super-controversial Sony ""comedy"" ""The Interview,"" which is about assassinating North Korea's Kim Jong-un.

""You are so right about this ridiculous movie ... people wonder why there is so much violence and mayhem in the world ... they need look no further than Hollywood. ... It's promoted, encouraged, glorified and revered all for money and the producers should be ashamed of themselves. This movie should never have been made. Thanks for all of your wonderful commentary ... past, present and future.""

Now that at least one movie theater chain has declined to run the film, now that the NYC premiere has been canceled, now that Sony says it won't argue with other chains that might pull out of showing it, the question becomes -- whose incredibly stupid idea was it to make this movie in the first place, and whose even dumber concept to release it at Christmastime?

The hackers who have wrought so much damage to Sony are believed to be offended North Koreans, but nobody knows for sure. The North Koreans aren't much of a danger to the U.S. militarily -- they can barely get a rocket off the ground -- but nowadays all countries are threats to each other, in terms of cyber-terrorism.

And despite a lot of people screaming about what a terrible precedent this sets -- giving in to hackers who make threats -- those screamers and defenders of the First Amendment aren't the ones who will be held accountable should some form of violence occur during a screening of ""The Interview."" And it wouldn't have to be anybody sympathetic to North Korea -- just some deranged individual encouraged by the idea of committing carnage.

Seth Rogen, who co-directed and co-wrote ""The Interview,"" will no doubt eventually attempt to make himself the victim of a weak studio that wouldn't stand up to some silly hackers. But in truth, it was an idiot concept from beginning to end -- what if North Korea still held American captives right now?

The movie had to have been conceived and filmed while Americans were still in the hands of the North Koreans. Brilliant, Seth. So funny.

Not.

AND THE bad news just keeps on coming. It appears that Madonna's entire album, not scheduled for release until well into next year, has been leaked online -- all 11 tracks, in fairly rough form. Madonna has been working extremely hard on this CD, which was titled ""Iconic."" (Or it was before this leak!)

This is not only unfortunate for Madonna, but continues the obviously unstoppable trend of material of any kind getting into the wrong hands and being disseminated willy-nilly. What kind of basement trolls out there, sitting at their computers, think this is funny?

The leak won't have much of an effect on Madonna financially -- that is, her livelihood is not threatened, or her already massive fortune. But a year's worth of work, suddenly compromised? Frustrating!

Especially with the music industry as we once knew it, fading fast.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/tv-watchers/mc-jimmy-hoffa-killer-pbs-20140723-story.html","Former Morning Call reporter to appear on PBS' ""Who Killed Jimmy Hoffa?""","A former Morning Call reporter who wrote a book about one of the prime suspects in the death of Teamsters boss killed Jimmy Hoffa, will be featured on tonight's episode of ""History Detectives Special Investigation"" at 9 p.m. on PBS.

Matt Birkbeck who wrote about Russell Bufalino, an Irish hitman and the head of a Scranton Mafia for the Morning Call in 2008, is interviewed by show host Kaiama Glover about sources he developed while reporting on the gambling industry for the Call. Bufalino was identified in a 1975 ""TIME"" magazine article as being a recruit for the CIA, reportedly putting a target on Hoffa’s back.

In the episode ""Who Killed Jimmy Hoffa?"" history detectives Glover, Wesley Cowan and Tukufu Zuberi explore Hoffa's final days and hours with recently declassified FBI files and interviews with experts close to the story.

In one of history’s most fascinating unsolved mysteries, former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa went missing on July 30, 1975, never to be found. Hoffa, a hero to many working Americans, played a major role in the growth and development of the trucking union. But he fell afoul of the law, with allegations that the powerful pension fund was under mob control and used, among other things, to finance Vegas casinos. What exactly happened to Hoffa that day, and why? The investigation is an exploration of Hoffa’s final days and hours and a revelatory window on power and corruption in the post-war era labor movement.

Glover met with Birkbeck, who left the Mroning Call in 2010 to investigate Bufalino and his relation to Jimmy Hoffa.

Birkbeck also wrote a book ""The Quiet Don"" that chronicles the rise to power of one of America's least-known and purportedly most powerful Mafia figures and his role in the death of Jimmy Hoffa. Drawing on nearly a decade of reporting and research, Birkbeck writes about the storied 1957 meeting of Mafia leaders at Apalachin, N.Y. and the mob's take over of the Teamsters union from its one-time president Hoffa and the shaky birth of Pennsylvania's gambling business and the effort by state police and prosecutors to expose corruption in the licensing process.

He also build son the claim put forth in the memoir of Mafia hit man Frank Sheeran, ""I Heard You Paint Houses,"" that it was Bufalino who ordered the murder of Hoffa.

The show also include an interview with Charles Brandt , Frank Sheeran’s former lawyer, at the Warwick Hotel in downtown Philly where Sheeran would meet Hoffa when he was in town. Brandt sheds light on the relationship between Sheeran and Hoffa leading up to Hoffa’s disappearance. Hoffa first hired Sheeran as his hit man when he took over the Teamsters in 1957.

Tukufu talks to Arthur Sloane, the Hoffa biographer, who in the early 1960’s as a graduate student, spent three months with Hoffa and saw how the labor leader connected to working men and women. He says that when Hoffa was released from prison, he remained a favorite with many union members. Sloane told Tukufu that a poll of a major truck driver magazine showed that 83% of the respondents would vote for Jimmy Hoffa immediately if he were able to run for the Presidency.","2014-07-22 00:33:00","0","15.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","23.0","2.0","41.0","21.0","0.0","78.0","4.0","15.0","0","540","98.02","79.76","15.86","20.19","24.55","22.04","74.26","41.48","5.74","2.41","0.19","0.00","0.19","2.04","0.00","3.33","10.19","16.11","2.59","3.15","6.30","0.19","8.33","3.15","1.85","2.41","2.96","0.93","1.85","0.74","1.11","0.19","0.74","0.19","9.07","0.19","0.00","0.19","2.78","5.00","1.67","1.11","0.56","1.11","0.37","0.56","1.48","0.93","0.56","0.00","0.37","0.19","0.19","0.00","0.00","7.96","2.22","2.59","4.44","0.37","0.00","5.19","2.04","0.37","15.19","2.04","7.04","6.30","8.70","2.04","0.37","2.04","0.00","1.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.70","4.07","4.63","0.00","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.56","1.85","2.04","0.00","0.19","2533","8.3","27.5","796","534","21","54.15","12.5","12.0","11.49","14.4","115","15.666666666666666","20.774232209737832","285","24.8","8","0.42","0","22","15","55","2","79","23","0","1","3","97","97","1","25","0","0","11","4","18","0","2","2","13","0","10","30","7","9","4","7","1","6","0","6"

But he and President Obama continued to call on Congress to address the issue either through a broad overhaul of corporate taxes or targeted legislation, which would be more effective in curtailing a maneuver that has become more popular among corporations seeking to avoid the high U.S. tax rate.

""We’ve recently seen a few large corporations announce plans to exploit this loophole, undercutting businesses that act responsibly and leaving the middle class to pay the bill, and I’m glad that Secretary Lew is exploring additional actions to help reverse this trend,"" Obama said.

Some multinational corporations including pharmaceutical firm AbbVie Inc. and Burger King Worldwide Inc. have agreed to buy smaller companies in foreign countries with much lower tax rates and move their headquarters there, sheltering billions of dollars from U.S. taxes.

The Obama administration has questioned the ""economic patriotism"" of those companies, saying the moves were not done for economic reasons but simply to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes for scientific research, roads and other publicly-funded items.

“These first, targeted steps make substantial progress in constraining the creative techniques used to avoid U.S. taxes, both in terms of meaningfully reducing the economic benefits of inversions after the fact, and when possible, stopping them altogether,” Lew said.

“While comprehensive business tax reform that includes specific anti-inversion provisions is the best way to address the recent surge of inversions, we cannot wait to address this problem,"" he said.

Democrats and some Republicans have criticized the tax-shifting moves by companies. But Republicans want to address the issue through a broad overhaul of the corporate tax code, an effort that has become stalled in Congress.

The Obama administration had threatened that it would take executive action if Congress did not act. And with lawmakers recessing last week until after the November elections, Lew announced the steps Monday.

The actions would apply only to companies that invert after Monday.

Treasury said it would make it would eliminate some techniques, such as so-called ""hopscotch loans"" that foreign-headquartered companies use ""to gain tax-free access"" to some earnings.

Treasury also will strengthen a requirement that the foreign company must be at least 20% foreign owned by making it more difficult for a U.S. firm to reduce its size before such a transaction by, for example, issuing large dividends to shareholders.

The Obama administration has asked Congress to take even tougher steps, such as requiring a company to have at least 50% foreign ownership for it to be considered a foreign firm for tax purposes.

The administration and some top Congressional Democrats want those restrictions to be retroactive to the spring, when lawmakers first started talking about addressing the issue and might have helped trigger some of the recent inversions.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, cheered the administration's executive steps.

“As more companies use inversions as a strategy to avoid paying U.S. taxes, it is clear that Congress must act to protect remaining U.S. businesses, workers and families from having to pay higher taxes,"" he said.

""Today’s action by the Treasury Department reinforces the urgency for action before this growing wave of inversions erodes our nation’s tax base,"" he said. ""But only Congress has the full range of tools to address both the immediate problem and ensure U.S. businesses continue to be competitive in the global economy.""

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the committee's top Republican, has said inversions need to be addressed but opposed retroactive action and believes the issue should be dealt with as part of an overhaul that reduces the high U.S. corporate tax rate.

""America’s tax system is broken to the point that it’s putting our nation at a competitive disadvantage around the globe,"" Hatch said. ""In the end, any solution that permanently addresses inversions must be legislated by Congress.""

"http://www.mcall.com/business/la-fi-employer-health-costs-20140910-story.html","Employer health rates rise 3%, worker deductibles top $1,200","The price of employer health insurance rose a modest 3% this year, a major survey shows, but workers will be paying more when they get sick as deductibles soar.

Annual insurance premiums for families increased 3%, on average, to $16,834, according to the survey released Wednesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust.

Those results reflect a recent trend of slower growth in healthcare costs. But many employers and health-policy experts predict bigger increases for 2015 and beyond as the economy recovers.

""Large employers are skeptical the current low trends will continue for a variety of reasons,"" said Bill Kramer, executive director for national health policy at the Pacific Business Group on Health, which represents large employers such as Boeing Co. and Walt Disney Co.

""Historically, periods of slow growth have always been followed by rapid increases,"" Kramer said.

Insurance offered by employers is the primary source of health coverage for Americans, providing benefits to about 150 million people. Most employers will begin open enrollment for 2015 plans in the coming weeks.

Even modest changes in medical costs have been difficult to absorb for many businesses and workers hurt by the Great Recession. Many employers have cut their financial exposure by foisting more costs on to workers.

The average employee deductible has increased 47% since 2009 to $1,217 annually. Eighteen percent of workers face a deductible of at least $2,000. Workers typically must pay that amount before most medical services are covered by their health plan.

Some health-policy experts credit higher deductibles with helping hold down medical costs by discouraging people from getting care or motivating them to be savvier shoppers. But throwing up barriers to cost-saving preventive care is a potential downside.

""Higher deductibles may be good if you're relatively young and healthy,"" said Drew Altman, chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park, Calif. ""But they may be a bad thing if you are lower or moderate income or chronically ill. This can be a real burden on the family budget.""

For a change this year, the growth in employer health premiums was close to the annual increase in workers' wages at 2.3% and inflation of 2%.

However, the longer-term trend hasn't been encouraging for U.S. workers.

Since 1999, workers' share of health premiums has shot up 212%, nearly four times as fast as wage growth nationwide, the survey found.

In 2014, the average worker paid $4,823, or 29%, toward the $16,834 family premium. Workers contribute $1,081, or 18%, for the average employee-only premium of $6,025.

The survey found that 55% of U.S. firms offered health benefits to their workers, down from a recent high of 69% in 2010.

The offer rate is far higher among larger firms. The survey shows that 92% of employers with at least 50 workers already offer health coverage to at least some of their workers.

Starting next year, some larger businesses could face penalties under the Affordable Care Act if they don't offer health benefits. Those health-law requirements don't apply to small businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees.

Employers are trying a number of strategies to keep medical costs in check.

Some businesses give workers financial incentives to use a select group of hospitals and doctors for common surgeries such as knee and hip replacements. Firms want to reward medical centers that offer quality care at a reasonable price.

Other employers will only pay up to a certain amount for a surgery at recommended hospitals, called reference pricing, and require workers to pick up the difference if they seek more expensive treatment elsewhere.

There are also numerous efforts underway to better coordinate care and give patients facing high deductibles more cost information upfront so they can find the lowest price for an imaging test or routine procedure.

""We are pleased the recent cost trends are lower,"" Kramer said. ""But we know there is as much as 30% overuse and waste in the current healthcare system. Overall costs are still way too high.""

The national survey published Wednesday included responses from 3,139 public and private firms with three or more employees.

In other findings, more employee health plans are subject to provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as preventive care at no cost. The survey found that 26% of workers have ""grandfathered"" plans exempt from some aspects of the health law compared to 48% two years ago.

PPO, or preferred-provider organization, plans remain the most popular option among employees nationwide. Nearly 60% of covered workers select those broad network plans while 13% opt for an HMO, often at a cheaper price.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/goguidestreet/mc-gavin-web-degraw-matt-nathanson-20140814-12-story.html","Gavin DeGraw is in the collaborative spirit","Don't count Gavin DeGraw as one of the singer-songwriters who balks at co-writing with other artists.

He dipped his toes into the co-writing water on his previous album, ""Sweeter,"" collaborating on four songs.

For his recently released album, ""Make a Move,"" he teamed up with other songwriters on all 11 songs.

""When I put out 'Sweeter,' that was my first attempt at really doing some co-writing for my own album,"" DeGraw says in a phone interview. ""I felt like the co-writing thing went so well on 'Sweeter,' I enjoyed it. It shed new light on songwriting for me and brought new elements to the songs I get to perform that I wouldn't have been able to touch if I was doing it on my own. And not just the songwriting, but also the production and working with different producers really brings new sounds and new rhythmic structures. It really adds a lot more interesting elements to the album that wouldn't be there if it was me just diving into my own brain and trying get creative. It also alleviated a lot of that strain of feeling the pressure of doing it all on your own, and it freed me.""

Having artists co-write, of course, has become a favorite strategy, especially for major labels and their artists that are trying to build their success through mainstream radio airplay. The idea is that pairing an artist with a songwriter — ideally one with a track record of writing hits for other artists — gives the artist his or her best chance at coming up with hits.

Some artists, though, resist co-writing, interpreting it as a suggestion that the artist needs to change to come up with something more conducive to radio play.

DeGraw, 37, says commercial success is a consideration, but he has made sure his collaborations have produced songs that are true to the type of music he wants to make and what he wants to say.

""You know what, you always want to have a hit, first of all,"" he says. ""All artists want a hit. It doesn't matter how avant garde the artist is or as far out as they may possibly think or say they think, everybody wants to have something that people recognize. So obviously, of course, you're always hoping that something's going to catch on.

""But at the same time, you always want to make sure the quality is there. So you really want to make sure your subject matter is there and that you're really bringing it when you release it, that it's something you can still get behind.""

DeGraw says he found that co-writing brings far more advantages than drawbacks. On ""Make a Move,"" he teamed up with leading tunesmiths Ryan Tedder (of OneDirection), Martin Johnson (Taylor Swift, Daughtry), Chris DeStefano (Luke Bryan, Rascal Flatts) and David Hodges (Evanescence, Kelly Clarkson). He says the collaborations have enhanced creativity. He pointed to Tedder as an example.

""He's a wonderful writer. He's a great guy. When he writes alone, I'm sure that as a writer, it [co-writing] still helps his mind, helps his brain, his creative process. He does so much writing and so much co-writing as well, that there's always something new to draw from. So even when you're not co-writing a song, if you come out of a session and you were co-writing with somebody, and the next day you start writing something on your own, you feel inspired because you've been taking in all of this new information. It's a special process, and staying inspired is so important in pursuing those new options, those new ideas.""

DeGraw is seeing a difference in his music because of the collaborations.

""I think it has made me a little bit more bold as far as what I could or should say, as far as what my material was,"" he says. ""Sometimes it takes you out of that lonesome introspective thing and turns you into a little bit more, you can take on a persona a little bit differently if you're in a room with somebody else. You think OK, cool, well, let's experiment here. I like that element of it.""

With ""Make a Move,"" DeGraw has gotten a bit more uptempo, with deeper grooves and beats that are more danceable — qualities that are in step with much of the music played on top 40 and pop radio.

Earlier in his career, DeGraw fell firmly in the singer-songwriter camp, gaining comparisons to the likes of John Mayer and Elton John, with a rootsy pop sound that rocked on occasion, but was mostly easy-going. But his biggest successes were with some of his friskier tunes.

DeGraw's 2004 debut CD, ""Chariot,"" was a million-selling hit that included the singles ""I Don't Want to Be"" (an edgy, hooky rocker that topped the Billboard magazine Pop chart) and ""Chariot"" (a pop-rocker that was a top 5 Adult Pop single). ""In Love with a Girl,"" a punchy track from his 2008 self-titled second CD, also reached No. 5 on the Adult Pop chart. But his 2009 third album, ""Free,"" failed to click.

Going into ""Sweeter,"" DeGraw felt an urgency to be on the charts again. The album produced a No. 1 hit on Billboard's Adult Pop chart in ""Not Over You"" (a mid-tempo tune with an insistent beat) and a top 20 hit on the same chart with the potent and grooving title song. A stint in 2012 on the hit television show ""Dancing with the Stars"" helped his visibility, as well.

""Make a Move"" is DeGraw's most assertive and modern sounding album yet, with programmed rhythms and synths used more prominently than on the previous CDs. He pushes more toward a dance-pop sound on ""Best I Ever Had,"" the first single (a disco-ish tune which reached number 14 at Adult Pop). ""Leading Man"" is a sassy rocker with some fuzzed out tones. Meanwhile, ""Every Little Bit"" (one of the best songs) is earthier, as DeGraw sounds a bit like a poppier Ben Harper. Even the ballads, including ""Eveything Will Change"" and ""Finest Hour,"" have rhythmic heft and radio-friendly synthetic touches.","2014-08-14 09:26:00","0","30.0","5.0","0.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","44.0","21.0","0.0","75.0","4.0","15.0","0","1038","75.40","70.20","15.97","93.53","20.76","16.76","82.47","49.13","13.97","7.80","2.02","0.10","2.22","3.08","0.39","6.17","7.80","13.49","6.45","4.05","6.74","0.96","16.09","7.03","4.53","1.06","2.31","3.37","5.20","4.72","0.39","0.19","0.00","0.19","9.06","0.00","0.19","0.19","3.18","13.01","1.83","2.50","1.83","3.18","1.83","3.08","5.20","0.29","3.76","0.77","0.87","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.48","5.49","0.87","2.79","2.02","1.73","0.10","2.79","9.44","0.96","13.01","2.70","6.55","3.85","3.66","3.95","0.10","0.19","0.10","0.00","0.58","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.39","0.00","22.74","4.82","6.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.02","4.91","2.41","1.73","0.19","4484","7.19","21.18","1379","1020","50","67.69","10.2","8.9","9.75","10.7","164","7.25","16.591372549019606","446","19.04","16","0.49","0","35","17","96","0","122","85","2","3","5","148","83","1","48","0","0","72","26","63","9","1","7","22","0","26","36","36","16","35","41","12","5","0","5"
"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/chi-pope-congress-20140313-story.html","Speaker Boehner invites Pope Francis to address Congress","WASHINGTON -- Speaker John A. Boehner has invited Pope Francis to deliver a joint address to Congress, in what would be the first such session by the head of the Catholic Church.

The invitation was made on the first anniversary of popular pope's election, and meshes with efforts by Republicans to portray the party as more engaged on the issues of poverty and inequality that have been priorities for Pope Francis.

""Pope Francis has inspired millions of Americans with his pastoral manners and servant leadership,"" wrote Boehner, a Roman Catholic, in the invitation letter, noting ""his tireless call for the protection of the most vulnerable among us.""

Boehner noted that ""these principles are among the fundamentals of the American idea. And though our nation sometimes fails to live up to these principles, at our best we give them new life as we seek the common good.""

The pope has not yet accepted the invitation, but the visit would not likely be until next year. This month President Obama is traveling to Italy and will meet with the pope at the Vatican.

Congress occasionally convenes for joint meetings with the president and heads of state in the House chamber, but officials said a pope has never delivered such an address. Pope Benedict visited Washington in 2008.

Catholics remain an important voting bloc for both parties, coveted as a bellwether of the national mood.

In Congress, an estimated 160 lawmakers are Catholic, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the minority leader, while more than half identify with a Protestant denomination, according to the Pew Research Religion and Public Life Project.

"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/chi-supreme-court-affirmative-action-michigan-20140422-story.html","High Court upholds affirmative action ban in Michigan","The U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday dealt a blow to affirmative action, upholding a voter-approved ban on racial preferences at Michigan's state-run universities in a decision that may spur similar initiatives elsewhere.

On a 6-2 vote, the court rejected a challenge to the ban, although the justices were divided as to the legal rationale. The court made it clear it was not deciding the larger and divisive question of whether affirmative action admission policies can be lawful.

Tuesday's ruling involved different legal issues from those in past affirmative action disputes. Rather than deciding whether universities violate the rights of white students by using affirmative action programs, the court considered whether state bans on racial preferences amount to discrimination against minorities.

The majority opinion rejected the argument made by civil right groups that the 2006 Michigan constitutional amendment that passed as a ballot initiative to ban the practice had imposed burdens on racial minorities in violation of the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.

In November 2012, a divided 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ruled Michigan's ban unconstitutional, prompting the state to appeal to the Supreme Court.

Affirmative action programs, first advocated in the 1960s to combat discrimination against racial minorities, have faced a backlash from conservatives in recent decades. Court rulings and action by states have chipped away at the practice.

A federal appeals court said the Michigan measure put racial minorities at a unique disadvantage. The 8-7 decision said minorities are barred from asking universities for special preferences — something athletes, band members and children of alumni could still do.

Proposal 2, as the initiative was known, bars preferences on the basis of gender or race in public education, contracting and employment. The university admissions aspect of the law was the only part before the Supreme Court.

Proposal 2 was spearheaded by Jennifer Gratz, whose reverse-discrimination lawsuit against Michigan became one of the two 2003 Supreme Court cases. Michigan voters approved the constitutional amendment, 58% to 42%. That measure stated public colleges and universities ""shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.""

The Supreme Court, however, has grown more skeptical of affirmative action since upholding it in 2003. That's largely because of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's 2006 retirement and the appointment of Justice Samuel Alito to fill her seat.

Michigan is one of 10 states where race-conscious admissions are barred at public institutions, by ballot initiative or other government action.

Black enrollment is down about 30 percent at the University of Michigan's undergraduate and law schools since the measure took effect, according to the university's figures.

The case is Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-682.

Three-way split on the court

On Tuesday, the justices in the majority were divided three ways.

Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote an opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Alito, saying that the appeals court that threw out the law did not have the authority to do so.

""This case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved,"" Kennedy wrote. ""It is about who may resolve it. There is no authority in the Constitution of the United States or in this court’s precedents for the judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination to the voters.""

The dissenting votes came from two of the liberal members of the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Sotomayor read parts of the dissent from the bench. She wrote that the decision was a blow to ""historically marginalized groups, which rely on the federal courts to protect their constitutional rights.""

The court had undermined its own precedents, which state that the majority cannot suppress minorities' right to participate in the political process, Sotomayor said.

Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a separate opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, in which he said that challenges to laws that rest on equal protection claims must show that the law reflects a discriminatory purpose. The Michigan law did not, he said.

Justice Stephen Breyer was the only member of the liberal wing of the court to join the majority. He wrote that the ban was constitutional because the prohibition moved the decision on whether to adopt race-conscious admissions policies from university officials to the voters.

Justice Elena Kagan did not take part, presumably because she worked on the case while in her previous position as United States solicitor general.

'The same playing field'

Supporters of affirmative action condemned the ruling.

Mark Rosenbaum, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued before the Supreme Court, said the ban ""unfairly keeps students from asking universities to consider race as one factor in admissions, but allows consideration of factors like legacy status, athletic achievement and geography.""

""This case is ultimately about whether students of color in Michigan are allowed to compete on the same playing field as all other students. Today, the Supreme Court said they are not,"" Rosenbaum said.

University policies that took race into account could be more vulnerable to legal challenges in the future. But the court did not strike the policy down and instead sent the case back to a lower court for reconsideration.

"http://www.mcall.com/business/ct-minimum-wage-carpenter-0622-biz-20140622-story.html","Outside Opinion: $15 minimum wage would hurt mom-and-pop businesses","Chicago aldermen have proposed gradually raising the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, and then later increasing it according to the cost of living. And in November, Illinois voters may be asked in an advisory referendum whether they support raising the state minimum wage to $10. Here's one side of the issue:

Twenty-one Chicago aldermen have banded together to push a citywide mandatory minimum wage. If passed, Chicago's wage would increase by more than 80 percent. The city would be tied with Seattle for the highest minimum wage in the country, which would be $6.75 higher than the rest of Illinois (including bordering suburbs).

We hear a lot of noise in this debate, but the voice of business is getting lost. We are not referring to big business. We are talking about the more than 97 percent of Illinois businesses that have 20 employees or fewer. These local ""mom and pops"" are crucial to our regional economy, employing more than 800,000 workers and nearly one-fifth of the state's private workforce.

The proposed ordinance states that the City Council ""finds that it is fair to ask employers in the city to do their part by phasing the minimum wage up to $15."" Perhaps the City Council has already forgotten other recent hits on local business owners:

•An imminent increase in Chicago property tax rates.

•A 15 percent increase in city water rates in 2014.

•A 56 percent increase in the city's emergency 911 telephone surcharge in 2015.

•Potentially increased commercial lease tax in 2015.

Many neighborhood business owners cannot afford these additional burdens, let alone an 80 percent hike in the minimum wage. These small businesses will be forced to cut staff hours or raise prices to noncompetitive levels. Jobs will be lost. For some, doors will permanently close. Neighborhoods will change.

A recent study by the Kauffman Foundation and Thumbtack, an online jobs marketplace, found that Illinois rates as one of the least friendly states in the nation toward small business. It also found that Illinois small-business owners were the most pessimistic in the nation about the prospects for the state economy. We need to develop policies that support our city's businesses and incentivize our neighborhood business owners to stay local and hire local.

At $8.25 an hour, Illinois already has the highest minimum wage in the Midwest and the fourth highest in the nation.

We need to remove emotion from this issue. If the City Council proposed an 80 percent increase in the local sales tax, the city would rally together in opposition. We need to do the right thing for our neighborhood businesses — by creating a welcoming climate for all businesses.

"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/la-pn-analysis-obama-va-competence-20140523-story.html","VA crisis echoes Obamacare's stumbles: 'Drip, drip, drip'","If it sounded familiar when President Obama vowed to fix the problems plaguing the Veterans Affairs medical system, that’s because it was.

The drumbeat of his response this week — defending the administration’s record, declaring his anger at the mess-ups, pledging to straighten things out — almost completely echoed Obama’s reaction to the fouled-up beginnings of his signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act.

A simple quiz illustrates the point. Guess which — Obamacare or the VA — the president was talking about when he said each of the following things:

1. “Nobody is madder than me about the fact that [it] isn’t working as well as it should.”

2. ”We have to be honest that there are and will continue to be areas where we’ve got to do a lot better.”

3. “It is something that we intend to fix.”

4. “Listen, if somebody has mismanaged or engaged in misconduct, not only do I not want them getting bonuses, I want them punished.”

The answers: 1. Obamacare. 2. The VA. 3. Obamacare. 4. The VA.

Add to that the baying desire for instant solutions that attends the nation’s political controversies, and almost every crisis seems to roll into the last.

This week, calls rumbled for the firing of the secretary of Veterans Affairs, Vietnam veteran and career Army man Eric Shinseki, just as six months ago there were demands for the head of Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services who oversaw the healthcare rollout. (Sebelius eventually announced her resignation in early April, after months of sign-ups brought a more successful sheen to Obamacare.)

Nothing goes perfectly in government, to be sure; shrunken after a recession that drove public employees to the unemployment lines long after private employment began to surge, government bureaucracies can be both overworked and inefficient, as practically any trip to the DMV will reinforce.

Then too, private companies have their own problems, as auto giant GM’s spate of recalls attests.

Just as GM’s delayed reaction to problems with its cars has posed an existential threat to its brand, so too do Obama’s slow responses to crises on his watch — and the crises themselves — threaten to define Democrats as the party that can win the White House but can’t run things once it does.

More than two decades ago, trying to prevent a third successive Republican presidential victory, Democratic nominee and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis argued that the 1988 election wasn’t about ideology but about competence.

That argument didn’t work out for him; Republicans skewered Dukakis so thoroughly that what he described as the “Massachusetts miracle” became the Massachusetts morass.

But there has to be at least a veneer of competence that can bear up against the vitriolically partisan environment of today’s politics. And the danger for Obama is that while he can claim government successes — millions of people insured who were not before Obamacare, better programs for veterans now than when he took office — what can stick in Americans’ minds is the image of one mess after another.

The Democrats who try to succeed him in 2016 will not bear personal responsibility for either of the two recent crises but may get tarred with them anyway. And they will surely remain part of Obama’s legacy.

“It is, unfortunately, a sort of steady drip, drip, drip of not being able to run the federal government competently and efficiently,” Democratic strategist Garry South said. “None of it may be Obama's personal fault, but as Truman said, the buck always stops at the president's desk.”","2014-05-24 10:00:00","0","24.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","33.0","0.0","48.0","20.0","0.0","103.0","1.0","16.0","0","588","81.74","56.76","9.40","23.12","17.29","25.17","80.44","48.64","10.37","3.91","0.51","0.51","0.00","1.87","1.02","6.46","7.99","14.46","7.31","4.42","6.12","2.04","11.22","6.80","4.25","1.70","2.89","2.21","5.95","2.72","2.89","0.34","1.19","0.17","7.65","0.00","0.00","0.17","1.87","10.71","1.02","1.19","1.53","3.06","1.36","3.91","1.36","0.51","0.85","0.00","0.51","0.17","0.34","0.00","0.00","11.22","0.68","3.57","4.76","2.72","2.38","3.06","8.16","1.36","11.05","1.70","3.74","5.78","6.46","0.17","0.17","0.68","0.00","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.17","17.86","5.78","4.93","0.34","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.51","2.38","2.89","0.34","0.34","2867","8.88","21.571428571428573","890","593","24","54.86","13.6","11.7","12.48","14.9","151","8.0","22.06549747048904","346","19.18","9","0.48","0","17","14","55","1","71","34","2","2","13","93","52","6","35","0","0","26","7","34","3","0","3","22","0","29","23","8","9","11","17","6","5","0","4"
"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/la-pn-obama-delay-healthcare-mandate-20140210-story.html","Obama administration to further delay healthcare employer mandate","WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration will phase in a requirement that large employers provide their workers with health benefits in 2015 and 2016, offering businesses more relief from the so-called employer mandate in the president’s healthcare law.

Under regulations issued Monday, only employers with more than 100 full-time workers will be subject to fines in 2015 unless they offer coverage.

The requirement that all employers with more than 50 full-time employees provide health benefits or pay fines -- which was supposed to begin this year under the Affordable Care Act -- will not take effect until 2016.

The phase-in follows the administration’s decision last year not to impose the penalty on employers at all in 2014, a move that drew widespread criticism from political opponents of the healthcare law.

But administration officials said Monday that the additional phase-in period for a crucial part of the law was necessary to help businesses adapt to the new requirement.

“While about 96% of employers are not subject to the employer responsibility provision, for those employers that are, we will continue to make the compliance process simpler and easier to navigate,” said Assistant Treasury Secretary for Tax Policy Mark J. Mazur. “Today’s final regulations phase in the standards to ensure that larger employers either offer quality, affordable coverage or make an employer responsibility payment starting in 2015 to help offset the cost to taxpayers of coverage or subsidies to their employees.”

The new regulations also allow employers to offer coverage to only 70% of their workers in 2015. They will have to provide coverage to 95% of full-time workers in 2016.

The requirement that companies with more than 50 full-time workers provide insurance or pay a fine is designed to prevent firms from dropping health benefits once the government offers subsidies to help individuals buy coverage.

The law's authors worried that firms would be tempted to stop offering coverage, shifting the cost of healthcare to the government.

Under the law, large employers that do not provide insurance will be fined $2,000 per employee beyond the first 30 employees.

The new regulations are almost certain to provide new fuel to Republican critics of the law, who have charged repeatedly that the administration has exceeded its authority in selectively implementing parts of the law.

But administration officials said Monday that the law allows such adjustments.

“The secretary has very broad authority to implement the tax law in a way that benefits tax administration, and we think the phase-in approach really is a way to administer the law better and enhance overall compliance,” a senior Treasury Department official said.

"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-allentown-parkland-apartment-zoning-2-20140915-story.html","Apartments proposed for Allentown-South Whitehall border struck down","A proposal to build a more-than-40-unit apartment complex on two properties at the Allentown-South Whitehall Township border was struck down Monday by the Allentown Zoning Hearing Board.

The plan, which called for the apartments to be built in a four-building complex straddling the border at 3531 Broadway, would have required several variances from the Allentown board, most notably to build high-density residential buildings on land zoned only for low-density residential use.

At an August hearing, attorney Joe Piperato argued on behalf of developer OM Quality Life LLC that there is no feasible way to divide the land into lots for single-family homes.

The property is on a finger of land affixed to Allentown only to the northwest. The area is bounded on the remaining three sides by the Cetronia section of South Whitehall and accessible via only township roads.

Surrounding properties in South Whitehall house mixed-use development including commercial and residential uses as well as a Parkland School District elementary school.

More than a dozen area residents attended the August meeting to speak out against the proposed apartments. Many said the plan would increase traffic in the neighborhood. Parkland Superintendent Richard Sniscak also attended the meeting to express concerns about the safety of his students walking in the area if the apartments were to be built.

On Monday, zoning officials said developers did not make the case that the unique conditions on the land constituted a hardship, a legal requirement for the city to grant variances to the zoning ordinance.

Board member Scott Unger said it may be difficult to develop single-family homes on the property, but developers did little research into what the existing zoning law would allow on the property, he said.

Michael Engle, also a board member, said the developer knew the property was zoned for low-density residential when he bought it.

""The hardship is created by the buyer, not the property,"" he said.

Unger also argued that the developers were asking for so many variances to the zoning ordinance that allowing them would almost constitute a change of zoning on the property. Only City Council can make that decision, he said.

Chairman Dan McCarthy agreed. He said a project the size of what was proposed would require a joint analysis between Allentown and South Whitehall to determine what would be an appropriate use of land in the area.

The future of the Broadway property remains up in the air. Since 2002, developers have tried and failed to get approval to build in the area.

Past plans called for the rezoning of the property and also expansion of a nearby assisted-living facility. Both proposals were defeated, the zoning change with a veto by then-Mayor Roy Afflerbach.

"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-allentown-landmark-tower-tenant-extension-20140827-story.html","Developer: Allentown tower plan will move forward, with or without tenants","A little more than a year after pitching plans for a 33-story tower that would eclipse the iconic PPL tower, Allentown developer Bruce Loch was back Wednesday, pledging to move forward despite the fact that no tenants have signed on.

""We are serious about this,"" Loch told the Allentown Parking Authority, which has an agreement to sell the lot at Ninth and Walnut streets where Loch wants to build his high rise. ""This is not some pipe dream.""

Loch, a Lehigh Valley developer best known for his residential work, has been trying to market his ambitious 221,000-square foot mixed-use building for several months to no avail. Talks are ongoing with two tenants who together could fill the entire space, Loch said, but no deals have been signed.

Malcolm Gross, Loch's attorney, said development will move forward to the next phases, regardless of whether tenants are on board.

Difficulties marketing the pencil-thin skyscraper that Loch wants to build on a mere 4,000-square-foot plot were not unexpected because of the limited amount of space on each floor.

The project still must receive zoning and planning approvals from the city, and Loch has not yet applied for financing through the Neighborhood Improvement Zone, the one-of-a-kind taxing district that encompasses the proposed tower property.

Loch appeared before the Parking Authority with a handful of colorful new renderings that have been used to market the building. Mock-ups of residential units show open floor plans accented with marble pillars and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Allentown and beyond. Board rooms in the office portion of the building would offer the same panoramic views.

Loch assured Parking Authority members that he has not been sitting on his hands for the past year. A ""serious amount of money"" has been spent on marketing, engineering and architectural work, he said.

Parking Authority members voted unanimously to give Loch an extension until Nov. 6 to find tenants. Zoning and planning approvals are to be filed by Feb. 6. Loch will have 30 days to close on the property after that date.

By that schedule, construction could begin as early as March 2015, Loch said, but construction won't begin until at least one major tenant is on board, he said.

Loch's plans call for a building adjacent to one of the authority's parking garages that would offer retail space on the ground floor, topped with 20 stories of office space. Above that, Loch plans nine floors of condominiums. Penthouse suites would occupy the top three floors.

Upper floors would be cantilevered, expanding each story to 7,000 square feet. Loch said he was able to increase the area of the upper floors after learning that he could cantilever the building over surrounding sidewalks on Walnut and Ninth streets.

But even with that amount of space, the building is a difficult sell, said Lisa Pektor, president of PennCap Properties. In any office building, you can expect to lose 15 to 20 percent of the space on each floor for the ""core factor,"" the space needed for utilities, stairs, elevators and other necessities, she said.

Loch's building requires a tenant with a specific kind of work flow because employees would be divided among several floors, Pektor said. Employees could feel they are low-ranking because their offices are six floors below upper management, she said.

Still, the building is not wholly unmarketable, Pektor said. Modern workplaces focus on interaction in smaller groups, and communication is often done via computer.

""There might be some tech company that has different departments and would want that kind of space,"" she said. ""There might be a financial institution with brokers who want to work directly with clients. That spot may be ideal.""

John Crampsie, business manager at commercial real estate firm NAI Summit in Allentown, said there are challenges with the building that has been proposed, but if anyone can pull it off, it's Loch. Loch has many years of real estate experience and he knows the market, Crampsie said.

""My mother used to say 'There's a lid for every pot,' "" Crampsie said. ""It would just have to be the right concept and the right type of user. Not to say that would be the easiest thing, but it's in the realm of possibility.""

"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-andre-reed-field-special-meeting-20141028-story.html","Andre Reed Field gets approval from Allentown School Board","Since no one knows what William Allen would have posted on Facebook and nearly everyone has used the F-word, the Allentown School Board has given its blessing to name a football field after Andre Reed.

School directors voted 6-1 at a special meeting Tuesday to look past the Pro Football Hall of Famer's use of the F-word in a recent Facebook ""scrap"" and name Andre Reed Field at J. Birney Crum Stadium in his honor.

But that doesn't mean Reed will come home this weekend to celebrate. Dion Reed, speaking on behalf of the Reed family, said his brother Andre will not visit Allentown for festivities planned for Saturday's Dieruff-Allen football game.

""Whatever the school board decided tonight, he respected their decision,"" Dion Reed said. ""He just felt the timing wasn't right because of all the negativity surrounding what was said the other night and the uproar it has caused. He never thought he'd receive all the negative press in his hometown because he was attacked by someone looking for 15 minutes of fame.""

Though Reed won't be here on Saturday, he's deeply proud of the honor and wants to be an example to young people that if they work hard and seize opportunities, great things can happen, his agent Jimmy Goldsmith said.

""The situation is just too raw for him to participate in a ceremony at this time,"" Goldsmith said. ""At some point, he will, but not under these circumstances.""

The school district hopes to hold an official celebration at a later date, according to its news release.

Tuesday's meeting was called after the board tabled a vote last Thursday so school directors had more time to learn about what was said in the Facebook fight.

The naming of the field appeared a foregone conclusion until School Director Elizabeth Martinez said she couldn't support it because of an argument on Facebook between Reed and another Dieruff High graduate, whose name she wouldn't reveal. Martinez cast the lone no vote on Tuesday.

Martinez, who was told about the argument but had never seen it, said it started because the other Dieruff graduate opposed the naming of the field. Martinez called Reed's language ""strong, very strong.""

Several other school directors said Thursday they had no knowledge of the argument, and the board tabled a vote. Reed issued a statement Friday apologizing for using social media during the argument but not for his language.

""You can't be a professional football player without a mountain of talent, a strong personality, a very hard edge and a big ego,"" he said. ""I am a football player and a damn good one. I am not a politician and I am not running for office.""

He added that ""Allentown folks"" are fighters and working class, real people.

""Yeah I drop the F bomb,"" Reed said, ""but who doesn't?""

On Tuesday, board Vice President Debra Lamb said she respects Martinez's opinion but supports the proposal for naming the field after Reed.

Lamb pointed out that the district has schools named after George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who owned slaves. The district also has schools named after local dignitaries like William Allen, who may have used inappropriate language themselves in the pre-Facebook age, she said.

""Any human being we choose to honor will have his failings as well as his triumphs,"" Lamb said.

Board President Robert E. Smith also defended Reed, saying his success story makes him a role model for Allentown's students.

""If everyone who ever said the F-word disappeared right now, this room would be empty, the city may be empty, the whole country may be empty, if not the planet,"" Smith said. ""Andre Reed is a football player. We are not voting for his sainthood. We're voting for him for the field — Andre Reed Field.""

Dieruff's alumni association President John Hughes Jr. claimed last week Reed was baited into the fight by another former Dieruff football player who graduated after Reed and played semi-professional football. Hughes would not identify that individual by name.

The argument transpired through private Facebook messages that the other individual posted publicly, Hughes said.

Reed will also have a park and a portion of a street near Dieruff High School named for him by the city. Kutztown University, where Reed attended college, named its stadium after him earlier this month.

Reed previously said he never lobbied for the field in Allentown to be named after him. The proposal to name the field after Reed came from a group of Allentown School District alumni, faculty and students, according to the district.

Dion Reed said some have questioned his brother's community involvement but Andre Reed has given time and money to kids in the Lehigh Valley and across the country. During his NFL career, Reed held annual Christmas parties in the Lehigh Valley and raised money for the Boys and Girls Club and the Salvation Army, Dion Reed said.

An announcement will be made about the field's new name during Saturday's Allen-Dieruff game, Smith said. Reed's name will not yet be placed onto the field's artificial surface.

""When we put his name on that field, he'll be back,"" Smith said. ""I'm sure of it, and we'll welcome him back.""

"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/bs-md-white-house-20141022-story.html","Bel Air man previously threatened to jump White House fence, records show","The Bel Air man who jumped over the White House fence on Wednesday had threatened to do so in a July incident where he scaled a nearby security barrier, according to court records.

Secret Service officials said 23-year-old Dominic Adesanya climbed the White House's north fence about 7:15 p.m. Wednesday. He was apprehended shortly thereafter and was unarmed. Adesanya was taken to a hospital for evaluation, spokesman Brian Leary said.

Court records show Adesanya had threatened to jump the fence of the president's residence on July 27 when he was charged with unlawful entry, after jumping over a security barrier marked ""restricted area do not enter"" near the intersection of East Executive Avenue and E Street in Washington.

He told authorities at the time that ""the first barrier he had jumped over was easy and that the next fence to the south grounds of the White House would not be a problem as well,"" according to charging documents.

Adesanya told officers that he was there because he was ""being targeted due to his race by the Rothchild family who owned the federal reserve bank,"" and said that he ""wanted the cameras that were placed in his house removed,"" according to the documents.

Three days later, Adesanya was charged again on July 30 with assaulting police officers. Charging documents said he was standing outside the entry post to the U.S. Treasury Building where he was yelling, ""I want my check and stop watching me,"" according to charging documents.

When officers told him that he did not have a pass or an appointment and tried to get him to leave, he ""took up a fighting stance with raised hands, clinched fists and began yelling 'I'm not leaving until I get my check'"" and began swinging his arms.

During the scuffle, several officers suffered several scraps and cuts. Adesanya was taken to a local hospital for a medical evaluation for his injuries.

Secret Service officials said 23-year-old Dominic Adesanya climbed White House's north fence about 7:15 p.m. Wednesday. He was apprehended shortly thereafter and was unarmed. Adesanya was taken to a hospital for evaluation, spokesman Brian Leary said.

In the July 27 incident, Adesanya was charged with unlawful entry, and on July 30, he was charged with four counts of assaulting a police officer and unlawful entry. He failed to show up for his September court date, online records show.

In Wednesday's security breach, Adesanya is charged with two felony counts of assault on a K-9 police officer, one felony count of making threats and four misdemeanor counts of resisting and unlawful entry, a Secret Service spokesman said. K-9 refers to the team using specially trained dogs.

Surveillance video showed agents surrounding him on the north lawn of the White House, which was put on lockdown for about 90 minutes. It also showed him punch a Secret Service dog as it came at him. Two Secret Service dogs were taken to a veterinarian for treatment after the incident, said Leary, the Secret Service spokesman.

A Harford County schools spokeswoman said Adesanya is a 2009 Fallston High School graduate.

Adesanya was a transfer student at Stevenson University, which he attended for less than a year before leaving in December 2013, a school spokesman said. He is listed as a freshman sprinter on the university's 2012-2013 men's track and field roster, and an item on the school's athletics department website said he placed fourth in a 400-meter race and competed in a 4x400 relay at the May 2013 MAC Outdoor Track & Field Championships.

The incident comes about a month after an intruder armed with a knife scaled the White House fence and made it inside the executive mansion, raising questions about security levels at the heavily guarded complex and spurring the resignation of Julia Pierson, then the director of the Secret Service.

The latest White House security breach happened the same day that a gunman attacked Canada's parliament in Ottawa.

No one could be reached for comment at a number listed for Adesanya's Bel Air home.

"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-charlie-dent-penn-state-sanctions-story.html","Dent says NCAA's 'arrogant' responses prompt latest effort to end Penn State football sanctions","CHICAGO — NCAA President Mark Emmert provided “arrogant” and “completely unacceptable” responses to Pennsylvania lawmakers’ questions about the Penn State football sanctions, prompting a renewed call to rescind them, Lehigh Valley Congressman Charlie Dent said Monday.

Dent and four other Pennsylvania congressmen wrote a letter to Emmert last week, asking him again to restore the team’s scholarships and drop the remainder of the $60 million fine that was part of the 2012 sanctions. Dent said he released the letter because Emmert gave “simply inadequate and at times appalling” answers regarding previous concerns, primarily the fine’s distribution.

Dent also said that he has “heard rumors” that the NCAA, which reduced the scholarship sanctions last September, will revisit the bowl ban, which could make Penn State eligible for postseason play this year. Though Dent called the four-year bowl ban “excessive,” he said his primary focus remained on the scholarship reductions and fine.

“I wanted to put further pressure on the NCAA to reconsider the remaining scholarships being denied to students who, through no fault of their own, are being punished because of the heinous crimes of Jerry Sandusky,” Dent said.

An NCAA spokesperson said Monday that the organization had not received the letter and would not comment further on it. Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany said at the conference’s football media days that he wanted to see the letter as well. Delany also praised former Penn State coach Bill O’Brien, former athletic director Dave Joyner and former President Rodney Erickson, saying they “met the challenge” of implementing the consent decree’s recommendations.

Penn State football coach James Franklin said he would not address a possible end to the bowl ban with his team because “I don’t want to be disappointed, and I don’t want our players to be disappointed.” Linebacker Mike Hull said the team, especially its seniors, would welcome being eligible for a bowl game this season.

“We all felt kind of slighted by everything that happened,” the senior said. “We really had no control of the situation, got some pretty harsh penalties, but we’re putting it behind us. … I’ve been to two bowl games, I’ve been very fortunate, and those were two of the best experiences of my life. It would be great to go back and end my career on a high note.”

Congressmen Glenn Thompson, Jim Gerlach, Michael Doyle and Mike Kelly also signed the letter, which was dated July 24. In it, the Pennsylvania lawmakers said that the NCAA’s consent decree, which Penn State signed in 2012, represented a “false choice” between the “heavy-handed and unwarranted sanctions” and the proposed football “death penalty.”

The congressmen also referenced a Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruling in April that suggested the NCAA overstepped its authority in sanctioning Penn State after the Sandusky child sex-abuse scandal. Judge Anne E. Covey wrote that the NCAA, the governing body of college sports, may not have had the legal authority to force Penn State to sign the consent decree.

The decree, which followed Louis Freeh’s independent report that was critical of Penn State officials’ role in the Sandusky scandal, resulted in three major sanctions: a four-year bowl ban, scholarship reductions and the fine.

The NCAA last September announced a gradual reduction of the scholarships, citing Mitchell’s positive report concerning Penn State’s implementation of the Freeh Report’s recommendations. Mitchell said last fall that he could recommend further sanction reductions in the future. His next annual report is due in September.

Dent, a Penn State graduate, has been vocal in opposing the sanctions. The letter is the fifth he and other lawmakers have written to Emmert since 2012 regarding the scholarship reductions and the fine.

Last year, when the NCAA announced its scholarship-restoration plan, Dent and Thompson called for an immediate and full restoration. Dent also was critical of Emmert’s responses regarding the fine’s distribution.

In late 2012, Emmert wrote a letter to Dent saying that “at least” 25 percent of the Child Abuse Endowment, established to distribute the fine to organizations that prevent child sexual abuse, would be allocated to programs in Pennsylvania.

“That was a completely unacceptable, arrogant response to lawmakers who have the responsibility to appropriate money to education,” Dent said. “To simply be so cavalier regarding the distribution of those funds by an interstate trade organization was galling beyond belief to me.”

State Sen. Jake Corman has sued the NCAA to keep the endowment fund in Pennsylvania. In its April ruling, the Commonwealth Court dismissed the NCAA’s challenge to the Endowment Act, a 2013 state law designed to keep the sanction money in state. The lawsuit could go to trial in January.","2014-07-28 21:59:00","0","22.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","48.0","21.0","0.0","84.0","1.0","16.0","0","772","92.44","74.15","4.20","23.73","22.06","26.55","72.80","40.93","8.16","3.50","1.04","0.65","0.00","1.42","0.39","4.66","10.23","11.01","5.70","2.72","4.02","1.04","11.27","3.24","1.30","1.04","2.20","0.78","4.27","2.07","2.20","0.26","0.78","0.39","9.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.42","6.99","1.17","1.55","1.68","0.78","0.78","1.17","2.85","0.13","2.20","0.39","0.52","0.13","0.13","0.26","0.00","7.77","1.55","1.42","4.92","0.52","0.26","6.22","3.50","0.52","10.36","1.04","4.02","5.57","6.61","1.81","0.13","1.81","0.13","0.13","0.26","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.13","0.00","18.01","4.66","5.70","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.65","4.15","2.59","0.00","0.13","3941","8.53","27.24137931034483","1204","769","35","49.15","13.7","11.9","13.75","14.8","185","13.5","20.42288686605982","367","24.1","19","0.39","0","19","15","87","0","64","60","0","2","10","127","127","0","42","0","0","24","11","25","0","0","0","29","0","27","55","21","15","11","6","10","2","0","1"
"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-eric-frein-manhunt-costs-20141114-story.html","It cost PSP $11 million to hunt down Eric Frein","The capture of Eric Frein put the alleged cop killer behind bars and put an entire region at ease, but the 48-day manhunt to find him did not come cheap.

According to figures released today by Pennsylvania State Police, more than $11 million was spent on the round-the-clock manhunt that included as many as 1,000 officers searching through the dense Pocono Mountain wilderness, using such equipment as search dog, helicopters, armored trucks and infrared sensors.

An itemized list of costs obtained through a Right to Know Request filed by the Morning Call, shows that the search cost $10.5 million in personnel expenses for salary and benefits for Pennsylvania State Police uniformed and non-uniformed officers, and the rest was for travel, equipment and other expenses.

Those figures include $6.9 million for overtime pay and another $2.8 million for benefits — both amounts paid above what the officers would have been paid over the course of their normal shifts.

That total only includes money paid to Pennsylvania State Police officers, and does not include the costs incurred by other federal, local and out-of-state agencies that helped in the search.

""As the circumstances of the search evolved, PSP identified various mission assignments or deployments that needed to be carried out by operational, tactical and command staff during various inervals (or waves),"" said William A. Rozier, Agency Open Records Officer for PSP.

Frein allegedly ambushed two troopers Sept. 12 outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove Township, Pike County. Lying in the woods outside the barracks with his .308 caliber rifle, the reportedly skilled sharp-shooter, allegedly killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson and critically wounded Trooper Alex Douglass. Police say Frein spent months -- perhaps years -- planning the crime and fled into the deep woods around his parents' Canadensis home after the shooting.

The multimillion-dollar price tag does not come as a surprise. A Morning Call analysis last month showed that overtime costs alone for federal, state and local officers on the hunt likely exceeded $1.4 million per week.

Until Friday, state police did not release exact figures on how much the hunt was costing, explaining that the full tally would be tabulated after his capture.

It'd easy to see how the costs added up so quickly. State Police officials said in the days after the shooting as many as 1,000 officers formed a dragnet, creating a 5-square-mile noose they worked to tighten around the self-styled survivalist. As Frein left behind evidence such as supplies, cigarettes and ammunitions, several sightings prompted police to move their search to other areas as far as 10 miles away.

At its peak, the search include roughly 300 state troopers on 12-hour shifts each day, up to 200 FBI employees, more than 50 staff members from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, in addition to U.S. Marshals, local police and troopers from other states.

Ultimately, Frein was captured by federal marshals Oct. 30. He surrendered outside an abandoned airplane hangar at the Birchwood Resort in Monroe County, where he had established a hiding place stocked with food, clothing, religious items, camping equipment and scores of other items. Police said he likely kept tabs on the manhunt by monitoring media reports on a Wi-Fi equipped laptop powered with a solar charger.

Frein is being held without bail in Pike County Prison, awaiting a preliminary hearing Dec. 9. Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin said he seek the death penalty.

But Frein, one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, remained at large.

State troopers, federal agents and others in the manhunt contended with an occasional light rain as they spoke to homeowners and searched vacant homes and cabins along the perimeter of the search area in northern Monroe County.

Late Thursday, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Frein last week tried to call his parents by cellphone. The Sept. 18 call was detected by investigators and allowed them to narrow their search, the newspaper said.

(THE MORNING CALL)

The Inquirer cited sources with knowledge of the investigation in disclosing the attempted phone call, which reportedly lasted only seconds.

The phone dial-up may help explain why state police late last week suddenly shifted their resources to Barrett and Price townships, near Frein's Canadensis home.

Throughout Thursday, much of the police vehicle traffic was centered on Snow Hill Road off Route 447, near the Barrett-Price border.

Officers could be seen entering the woods with their weapons while traveling in groups of three to five.

Armored vehicles went up Snow Hill Road to an area that apparently has been set up as a headquarters. Dozens of police and civilian vehicles, as well as tents and the armored vehicles, were visible on the expansive property.

A number of the roads that had been closed by police at one time or another were open, and homeowners were traveling freely in and out of their homes. But asked if the media could go beyond a certain point of Snow Hill Road, one officer advised against it.

""There's a killer on the loose,"" he said.

Police did not hold media briefings Thursday, an apparent sign that there had been few developments since Wednesday. That's when police revealed that Frein had been spotted several times from a significant distance and had left behind soiled diapers and Serbian cigarette wrappers. Police did issue a release saying rain had not affected the search.

""As for Frein, it depends on his preparedness,"" Trooper Thomas Kelly said in the release.

He said police dogs are picking up a scent, but that the trail is being lost due to water crossings and conditions of the terrain.

""The wooded/rugged area in the vicinity of the search is very difficult terrain to traverse,"" Kelly said. ""It provides many obstacles to the search — rocky outcrops, thick underbrush, dense canopy hindering aerial operation.""

Authorities were reminding the public to use their tip line — 1-866-326-7256 — that is staffed at their command post in Pike County.

Support for law enforcement officers who have worked around the clock was evident. In addition to ribbons placed on homes and fences, a homeowner along Route 447 hung a sign that read, ""PSP Strong, Here Frein, you're gonna need this when PSP gets you."" A diaper dangled from the sign.

Residents were warned of a scam in which callers claim they are from the Pennsylvania State Police and are raising money to continue the search for Frein.

""The Pennsylvania State Police do not and will not solicit money from residents, so please do not provide any personal information or offer to send money to the caller if you are contacted,"" police said in a statement.

Frein, 31, has been sought since he was identified as the suspect in the Sept. 12 slaying of state police Cpl. Bryon Dickson and the wounding of Trooper Alex Douglass outside the state police barracks at Blooming Grove in Pike County.

Dickson, 38, was hit by at least one bullet from a .308-caliber rifle and died at the scene. Douglass, 31, has undergone several surgeries at Geisinger Community Medical Center in Scranton. State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Douglass is making steady improvement.

Investigators believe the shooting and Frein's subsequent escape into woods near his home in Barrett's Canadensis section were planned for months and maybe years, and included surveilling the station where the troopers were shot.

Authorities haven't said whether they believe Frein deliberately targeted the troopers or knew either of them. Public records show that Frein's older brother, Michael, lives about three blocks from Douglass in the same subdivision in Olyphant, Lackawanna County.

Frein was linked to the ambush when police examined evidence from his parents' Jeep, which a man walking his dog found Sept. 15 in a pond about three miles north of the shooting scene.

Police said they believe Frein crashed into the pond because he was driving with his lights off and didn't notice he had reached the T-intersection with Route 6 at the north end of Route 402.

Frein's home is 15 miles south of where the troopers were shot and 18 miles south of where police say he abandoned the Jeep. Police say they believe he hiked that 18 miles back south within a week after the shooting.

He has taken part in battle re-enactments and expressed hostility toward law enforcement officers. He is considered a skilled marksman.

In his flight, Frein left behind an AK-47-style rifle, magazines and a small bag of ammo that were ""partially concealed"" or ""hidden for possible future use,"" police said. They said the rifle was found closer to the abandoned Jeep in Pike County than to his home.

"https://www.chron.com/neighborhood/katy/opinion/article/Where-is-the-Republican-Party-9800685.php","Where is the Republican Party?","Where is the Republican Party?

Dan Bongino is the ideal candidate for Congress.

Bongino has the pedigree as a former Secret Service agent that provides an automatic stamp of approval from everyone who learns this one fact about him.

He has built-in name identification through his regular guest radio hosting gigs on both Washington, D.C. local and nationally syndicated radio shows, as well as a best-selling book ""Inside the Bubble"" that puts him on the credibility map.

Bongino even has demonstrated expertise in social media with more than 21,000 personal followers on twitter.

Young, smart, handsome, savvy, and quick with a sharp sound bite, Dan Bongino is everything the Republican Party purports to look for in a candidate, yet the National Republican Congressional Committee has not lifted a finger to support his election effort. As of this writing, they haven't even called him.

Part of the reason could be that early in the race Bongino was considered a long-shot, running in the blue state of Maryland in a district that was gerrymandered to give a Democrat a good chance of winning. However, even with the most creative drawing of the district lines, the District is only a D+4, meaning that it leans Democrat but can be won by a Republican in an election cycle that favors the GOP.

And that is exactly what we have. 2014 is the ideal election cycle for mobilized voters in the highly conservative western Maryland part of the district to overwhelm the disenchanted and demoralized Democrats in the D.C. suburban part of the District.

Bongino for his part has nationalized the election having both Senator Rand Paul and Mike Lee into the District to rally the base, along with other conservative superstars like Col. Allen West.

On the fundraising front, Bongino continues to raise more money than his Democrat incumbent opponent, another touchstone for legitimacy.

Yet, even though Bongino's district is in the Washington, D.C. media market, the political masterminds at the NRCC remain deaf to the possible pick-up.

It makes one wonder if the lack of enthusiasm for Dan Bongino is because he is a constitutional conservative who has a libertarian streak. A man accustomed to saying what he believes and not backing down from a fight, it is fair to ask if House Republican leadership would prefer to have Bongino on the outside looking in to their cozy little club. After all, who needs another Louie Gohmert constitutional conservative holding them accountable to limited government principles.

No matter their motivation, the ugly truth is that the Republican National Committee is currently soliciting volunteers from the DC area (including Bongino's district) to volunteer in northern Virginia for their dead in the water Senate nominee and a likely winning congressional candidate. In most election years, this might make sense, but in 2014, the state of Maryland has a competitive governor's race featuring a very attractive African American Republican Lt. Governor candidate, important state house and state senate races (Virginia has no state races on the ballot), and the chance to win a congressional seat with a candidate who will be a Party leader for the next twenty years.

The upshot is that Bongino can win (polling is too close to call), but it will be in spite of the national Republican leadership. The question is will conservative leaders step up to the plate in the next two weeks, replacing the Party, and make the ground game happen in Bongino's and other ignored conservative candidate's districts?

Our nation is at a crossroads, and America needs Members of Congress like Dan Bongino. With November 4 a mere two weeks away, it is time for conservatives across the nation to go all-in, and use their networks to replace the indifferent Republican Party efforts to turn out the vote. Whether you live in the D.C. area, Utah or Florida, your vote and that of your family, friends and neighbors matter. Find the best candidate who will stand up for America and spend at least one weekend along with election day helping that candidate win.

It is now up to you. You can sit at home and complain, or you can take a stand. With our nation adrift, failure is simply not an option.

From our community

Reps. Pete Olson and Gene Green participated in a round table discussion with top physicians and research experts from the Texas Medical Center last week as part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s bipartisan initiative called 21st Century Cures.

The goal of this initiative is to accelerate the pace at which lifesaving medical treatments are discovered, developed, and delivered in the United States. The Texas Medical Center is the largest medical center in the world with one of the highest densities of clinical facilities for patient care, basic science, and translational research. Several panelists provided important updates on what they are working on and how the federal government can play a role in enhancing their efforts.

“America has long been a leader in medical breakthroughs,” Rep. Pete Olson said. “Our laws need to keep up so we can help get these innovations to those who need them. Government should be an ally in the quest to find the cure for diseases that plague our world. From Ebola to cancer, the experts can help us figure out where the gaps are so that the government and our laws can help speed up cures rather than hinder them. I applaud the hard work being done by the folks at the Texas Medical Center and across the country who are all working to find a pathway to cures.”

“It was excellent to hear from some of Houston’s leading scientists and health officials,” Rep. Gene Green said. “Our distinguished panelists and the institutions they represent are leading the world in research, innovation, and care. Through the 21st Century Cures Initiative, we can take full advantage of advances that have been made and improve the discovery, development and delivery of care.”

TMC Panelists included: Bobby Robbins, M.D. — President, Texas Medical Center, Paul Klotman, M.D. — President, Baylor College of Medicine, Mauro Ferrari, Ph.D. — Houston Methodist Research Institute, Richard Gibbs, Ph.D. — Baylor College of Medicine, Thomas Kent, M.D. — DeBakey VA Hospital, Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D. — Baylor College of Medicine, Malcolm Brenner, M.D., Ph.D. — Baylor College of Medicine, Kirstin Matthews, Ph.D. — Rice University, Bill McKeon — Texas Medical Center, Jeffrey P.

Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital has been recertified as an Advanced Primary Stroke Center by The Joint Commission, recognizing the hospital’s exceptional efforts to foster better outcomes in stroke care.

“At Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital, we are committed to providing the communities we serve with the best possible stroke care,” said Khan Nguyen, M.D., medical director of the Memorial Hermann Northeast Stroke Program. “Our staff is committed to continually improving, and this achievement demonstrates the results of that dedication.”

A stroke occurs when one of the blood vessels that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot (ischemic stroke) or bursts (hemorrhagic stroke), causing parts of the brain to start to die. A third type of stroke — transient ischemic attack — is caused by a temporary blood clot and is often called a “warning” stroke.

In addition to being certified as a Advanced Primary Stroke Center, Memorial Hermann Northeast also is accredited as an acute care hospital by The Joint Commission, and recently received the Press Ganey Guardian of Excellence Award for maintaining a 95th percentile patient satisfaction rating last year.

“This Joint Commission accreditation has given us the opportunity to highlight the exceptional stroke care we provide our patients and our community,” said Nguyen, who is also a board certified neurologist.

The Primary Stroke Center Certification program was developed by The Joint Commission in collaboration with the American Stroke Association and is based on the Brain Attack Coalition’s “Recommendations for the Establishment of Primary Stroke Centers.”

Memorial Hermann Northeast is recognized by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association as a Gold Plus Stroke Facility, designated as a Primary Stroke Center by the Southwest Texas Regional Advisory Council, and recognized as a Top Performer on key quality measures by The Joint Commission.

According to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, stroke is one of the leading causes of death and serious, long-term disability in the United States. On average, someone suffers a stroke every 40 seconds; someone dies of a stroke every four minutes; and 795,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke each year.","2014-04-18 06:00:00","1","71.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","230.0","208.0","10.0","302.0","0.0","25.0","0","463","98.55","76.86","12.30","54.23","35.62","34.56","74.95","34.13","3.02","1.51","0.00","1.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.51","10.58","13.17","3.24","1.30","5.83","0.00","7.78","4.75","4.10","0.43","2.81","1.73","4.10","2.81","1.30","0.00","0.43","0.43","6.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.75","0.65","1.51","0.00","1.51","0.86","0.65","7.13","0.43","0.43","6.26","9.94","1.51","8.42","0.00","0.00","9.72","4.54","4.54","1.94","2.59","0.43","2.16","5.40","0.00","12.74","1.94","7.34","3.89","5.62","0.86","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.59","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.20","4.10","3.89","0.43","1.73","0.00","0.00","0.65","2.16","0.86","1.73","0.65","2499","8.86","42.63636363636363","796","462","15","31.75","17.8","16.5","15.85","20.4","108","11.125","23.670649350649352","216","32.45","6","0.34","0","13","13","55","0","50","26","1","1","0","58","140","2","14","0","0","4","3","7","1","0","0","12","0","6","16","7","17","5","16","0","1","0","1"

In 2006, he ran as a pro-business and economic development, fiscal conservative candidate and was unopposed for his second term in 2009.

He served as Mayor Pro-Tem during Hurricane Ike and helped secure $8 million in grants to rebuild the city and business tax base.

During his tenure, property values increased, new roads were built, infrastructure issues were addressed, permitting became more business friendly, economic opportunities and no-interest impact fee loans remain commonplace, and property values and sales tax revenues are at an all-time high. The city has substantial reserves, an AAA bond rating and there were no tax increases during his time in office.

“I am accepting the challenge to run for United States Congress, District 36, which encompasses Harris, Chambers, Orange, Liberty, Polk, Hardin, Tyler, Jasper and Newton counties,” said Morrell. “This district is a mix of business professionals and blue collar workers. The area supports NASA, corporate and small business, as well as labor and industry. I am running as a hands-on conservative, made-in-America candidate. I support personal freedom, security, job fulfillment and education, deficit reduction and balancing the budget.

“In regards to personal freedom, I support the right to choose our own healthcare, the right to choose where our children go to school, the right to choose how our personal lives and property are monitored and the freedom to exercise Christian family values.

“In regards to security, I support the increase of the monitoring of our borders and our border security, documentation of all current immigrants and deportation of those who are undocumented, reclaiming our status as the world’s military superpower and more states’ rights, less federal interference.

“In regards to education and job fulfillment, I support graduating more high school students with technical or vocational associates’ degrees to contribute directly into the workforce, securing funding for state-controlled college campus expansions and forming coalitions with educators and the private sector to qualify students and direct them toward jobs best suited to their abilities.

“In regards to debt reduction and balancing the budget, I support stopping the spending of money to rebuild other countries and instead concentrate on the United States, stopping the lending of money to countries that can’t take care of themselves, creating more jobs in America and quitting sending industry overseas, cutting spending on federally sponsored programs such as welfare, free healthcare and food stamps, not extending unemployment benefits past the normal cycle and eliminating unneeded departments within the federal government.

“I am a Pro-Life, Second Amendment candidate. I also support the building of the Keystone pipeline, easing EPA regulations, states’ rights, using the National Guard and military equipment to patrol our borders, and using practical politics in Washington.”

Many of us think about the tragedy in Dallas 51 years ago this month. Last May I visited the Texas School Book Depository on the corner of Houston and Elm Streets in Dallas, Texas and read the government’s inscription on the wall of the building, “On November 22, 1963, The building gained national notoriety when Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly shot and killed President John F. Kennedy from a sixth story window as the Presidential motorcade passed.”

The word ""allegedly"" grabbed me, as it was an admission that even the government was not certain, without some level of doubt, that Oswald did the deed or acted alone.

Most serious scholars on the assassination view the Warren Commissions review of the data with great skepticism (some with contempt) especially in light of its numerous omissions, as for example the testimony of Dr. Charles Crenshaw who placed Kennedy in the coffin at Parkland Hospital and testified years latter that the neck wound had been tampered with to look like an exit rather than an entry wound. An entry wound would have proved more than a single assassin and provoked more investigation. Also, why did they seal the unpublished portion of their findings for 75 years?

Finally, 13 years later The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1976 concluded that “President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.” They, like the Warren Commission, did their investigation mostly in secret. Unbelievably they too sealed their evidence for 50 years under Congressional rules. Withholding evidence feeds conspiracy theories. As the years fly by, and new data surfaces from the hundreds of books on the subject, it is increasingly more difficult to dismiss, as an accomplice, Lyndon Baines Johnson and his CIA/FBI friends.

My journalist friend, Don Clark, has personally read most of the 2,000 books on the subject and is a noted speaker on the assassination. He told an audience in San Francisco that while the government has not, or will not, pursue the subject, private investigators have done so and we do not have to wait for the sealed records. He has a recommend list of “must reads” on the subject and they follow.

First, get the directors cut of the motion picture JFK by Oliver Stone. Despite the profanity the “movie contains more spoken words, more script, than any film in history.”

Second, On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison (a former FBI agent) treats Oswald’s time in New Orleans and four government agents identified as “handlers” that seemed to “shadow” him.

Third, read JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters. A stunning piece of original research published in 2008, by James Douglass.

Fourth, read MARY’S MOSAIC: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace, by Peter Janney. The work published in 2012 found that the author’s own “CIA father, was among the conspirators orchestrating the deaths of Kennedy and his friend Mary Pinchot Meyer. The latter’s death is also “in a veiled way” in the recent movie, An American Affair.

Fifth, read JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy, by Air Force Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty, who served at the time of Kennedy’s death, as the key liaison between the Pentagon and the CIA.

Sixth, tying together many loose ends the following three books will help. Revealing the secret links between the most powerful law firm in Texas and the criminal rise to power of Lyndon Johnson is Blood, Money, & Power: How LBJ Killed JFK by Barr McClellan. LBJ: Mastermind of the JFK Assassination by Phillip Nelson. Texas in the Morning by Lyndon Johnson’s long-time mistress, Madeline Duncan Brown “takes you to the meeting the night before the assassination. She reveals the identities of the men in that room. She shares the story of Lyndon Johnson coming late to the meeting, then emerging in a fury, grabbing her by the arms so hard it hurt, and swearing in a rage, ‘After tomorrow, those goddamn Kennedy’s will never embarrass me again -- and that’s not a threat, that’s a promise!’ ”

In light of decades of intensive reading, Clark poses the question, “Was it devious, desperate Lyndon Johnson, the viper in the nest, the Brutus to Kennedy’s Caesar, who with the help of J. Edgar Hoover had blackmailed his way onto the 1960 presidential ticket, who knew he was about to be dumped from the 1964 ticket, who knew he was about to be indicted and probably go to prison for his probable role in the Bobby Baker and Billy Sol Estes scandals, whose lifelong lust and endless scheming for the presidency would stop at nothing to get to that office, least of all murder?” Perhaps it is time to speak the unspeakable and be more inclusive of the new data in our history tests.

Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 TEXAS HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION: Health Insurance Marketplace enrollment accelerating in Texas 1 / 1 Back to Gallery

AUSTIN — Texas has the second highest health insurance enrollment among the 26 states relying on the federal government to administer the health insurance marketplace, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As of Dec. 28, 2013, enrollment in Texas was 118,532, reflecting a surge in December activity as the enrollment website’s functionality improved and consumers sought coverage effective Jan. 1.

Unfortunately, the positive impact for Texas hospitals is diminished. The state’s failure to extend Medicaid coverage to the working poor or devise its own solution to reduce the number of uninsured leaves more than one million Texans with no access to affordable coverage options.

In addition, ongoing and new federal funding cuts result in significantly fewer resources for Texas hospitals to provide care for the uninsured.

• Hospitals already provide more than $5 billion annually in uncompensated care because of Texas’ high rate of uninsured.

• Reductions in Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments began in FY 2012 and for FY 2014 alone are between $16 million and $19 million.

• The recent congressional budget deal will extend federal cuts to the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital program that were intended as “pay-fors” for Medicaid expansion for an additional year through 2023.

• The budget deal also extends the two percent sequester reduction in reimbursement rates for Medicare providers (including hospitals) for two additional years from 2021 to 2023.

• The three-month SGR or “doc fix” will avert deep cuts to physician reimbursement but contains substantially lower payments for long-term care hospitals that serve patients with clinically complex conditions.

“Increased private insurance enrollment through the Marketplace is certainly good news, but with a million Texans remaining uninsured and reduced federal resources, Texas hospitals will shoulder a heavy financial burden,” said John Hawkins, THA senior vice president for government relations. “The state’s inaction on coverage for the working poor and new and continued funding cuts at the federal level are a real threat to Texas hospitals’ continued ability to provide the highest quality care to all who need it.”","2014-01-14 08:16:00","1","75.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","52.0","0.0","230.0","210.0","10.0","308.0","0.0","25.0","0","373","99.00","52.14","14.85","35.11","26.64","37.27","69.97","31.37","1.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.34","6.97","15.82","2.68","0.80","4.56","0.27","5.09","6.70","3.22","0.27","8.04","1.61","4.83","2.68","2.14","0.27","0.27","0.80","2.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.36","1.61","1.34","0.27","0.80","0.80","1.61","1.34","0.80","0.27","0.27","6.43","0.27","6.17","0.00","0.00","7.24","1.34","1.61","3.49","0.80","0.80","1.61","4.02","0.80","11.80","0.54","7.51","4.02","6.43","0.00","0.00","6.17","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.28","4.29","2.95","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.80","2.14","1.34","0.54","2.68","2047","9.26","31.416666666666668","652","375","14","35.81","17.5","14.9","15.9","18.7","102","11.875","23.6","212","27.0","13","0.32","0","12","29","28","0","45","41","4","2","3","64","54","5","25","0","0","1","1","9","0","0","0","14","0","9","7","8","3","5","5","2","1","0","0"

Not everyone loved Abraham Lincoln.

In fact, John M. Barr has discovered that the iconic president had more than his fair share of critics - on all sides of the debate.

The professor of history at Lone Star College-Kingwood is the author of a new book on the subject, entitled ""Loathing Lincoln: An American Tradition from the Civil War to the Present.""

Published on April 7 by LSU Press, the book is now available online and at select bookstores.

""Loathing Lincoln"" examines the negative attitudes about the president that emerged during the president's lifetime and that have persisted to this day - from the Confederates who called him a despot to abolitionists who complained about the slow pace of emancipation.

Barr said whether his readers loathe Lincoln or love Lincoln, there is a lot to learn about the president and his legacy - by understanding how he has been perceived throughout time and how he was characterized by his enemies.

A historian's journey

Barr has been an educator for most of his life - and history has been his lifelong passion.

He taught history in Clear Lake before moving to Kingwood in 1990 and joining the staff at Kingwood High School. He worked there for 18 years before becoming a faculty member at Lone Star College in 2008.

Barr was still teaching fulltime when he decided to pursue his doctoral degree at the University of Houston.

While searching for a topic for his dissertation, Barr decided to revisit a subject he explored while earning his master's degree - and a president who had interested him since childhood.

""You want to write about something that people haven't really written about before,"" he said.

Barr's master's thesis was on the response to Lincoln's assassination in Texas.

He believed that historians and scholars had written about the topic - but had not delved into it as completely as he would have liked.

""A lot of people don't realize there is a tradition of hatred for this president - that alone surprises people,"" Barr said. ""But even Lincoln's critics would say he was really important.""

Barr began years of in-depth research into exactly what Lincoln's critics had to say.

""By looking at these criticisms, you can get a window into current anxieties in different political arenas,"" Barr said.

Looking at Lincoln

Barr grew up in Lexington, Kentucky - the hometown of Mary Todd Lincoln.

""You can't grow up there and not develop some interest in the history of the Civil War and the Lincolns,"" Barr said.

His curiosity about Lincoln and his legacy only grew more with time.

""When you teach American history, you find some topics are more interesting to you and more interesting to your students,"" he said. ""I found that to be true with Lincoln.""

At Lone Star College, Barr teaches a class called ""The Emancipators: Abraham Lincoln, Charles Darwin and the Making of the Modern World.""

""They were both born on the same day in 1809,"" Barr said. ""It's one of those odd coincidences in history. The course is about them and how they changed the 19th century.""

Marie Sesay, the college's dean of social sciences and humanities, said Barr's energy is contagious.

""He does a lot to enhance the learning experience for our students,"" she said. ""He really is an asset to the college, and he really loves teaching history.""

Sesay said Barr makes time in the classroom worthwhile for his students.

""He is extremely knowledgeable about his topic, and he brings it to life,"" she said. ""He really draws you in.""

While working on his dissertation, Barr spent hours at the library searching the archives at the University of Houston, Lone Star College and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas. He also traveled to collections and met with historical societies to learn as much as possible.

Barr said that he had to contact other libraries online and by phone - since his full-time teaching assignment kept him close to home.

""I was simply amazed at how cooperative librarians across the country were with me,"" he said. ""It was inspiring really. Librarians are really the heroes for me.""

While he was searching through articles and old letters, Barr began to write his dissertation - with the feeling that it would one day become a book.

In 2011, Barr's dissertation, ""The Anti-Lincoln Tradition in American Life,"" won the Hay-Nicolay Dissertation Prize from the Abraham Lincoln Association and the Abraham Lincoln Institute.

Barr's advisor Eric Walther encouraged him to pursue publication.

""As soon as I was finished, I began looking for a publisher,"" Barr said. ""LSU Press was immediately interested. Still, there were several stages to go through. I've been editing for the last couple of years.""

Twelve Spring Branch Independent School District seniors were recently named 2014 Jones Scholars by the Houston Endowment.

The students now qualify for annual scholarships during their college years, according to the district website. They can receive up to $16,000 in scholarship funds toward their bachelor's degrees.

Jones Scholars are nominated by their high schools. A Rotary Club of Houston committee then makes the final student selections based on academic achievement, economic need, leadership skills, community service and personal character.

Houston Endowment is the philanthropic foundation established by Jesse H. and Mary Gibbs Jones to improve the lives of all greater Houston residents through endowment contributions to local charitable groups and educational institutions. Since the Jones Scholars Program began in 1958, Houston Endowment has given almost $97 million to help send more than 11,000 area students to college.



The 2014 Jones Scholars from SBISD are:



Memorial High School: Runhan Mao, Angel Su and Xinyl Zhang



Northbrook High School: Lauren N. Iozzio and My T. Pham



Spring Woods High School: Nicole D. Jackson, Anjanee R. Munidasa and Maximiliano Rombado

The city of Conroe has agreed to use two property acquisition groups to help the city acquire rights of way for upcoming projects.

While the request for proposals was issued before Scott Taylor assumed the responsibilities as Public Works director, he recommended using such a service.

“Currently, we have about 60 projects that we need to acquire right of way for,” Taylor said during the council’s workshop Wednesday.

Taylor said the committee to select a firm for the acquisition work was split between Conroe-based Halff Associates Inc. and Sugar Land-based PAS Property Acquisition Services LLC. Taylor recommended the city work with both firms for the “on-call” services.

“When I say on-call services, each time we select them, we would bring to the council the contract or agreement to have them do the services,” Taylor said. “There is no obligation until we request the services.”

The council approved using the firms as needed.","2014-03-02 16:50:00","1","74.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","43.0","0.0","221.0","207.0","0.0","240.0","0.0","23.0","0","164","98.07","93.61","8.61","60.45","18.22","23.78","83.54","42.07","6.10","5.49","0.61","3.05","0.00","0.61","1.22","0.61","10.37","16.46","4.88","2.44","4.27","0.61","12.80","1.83","1.83","0.61","1.22","1.83","1.83","1.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.61","6.71","0.61","3.05","1.83","1.22","0.00","1.22","3.05","0.00","2.44","0.00","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.61","12.80","4.88","5.49","3.05","1.22","0.00","3.66","7.93","0.61","12.80","0.61","7.32","4.88","12.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.07","5.49","3.66","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.44","4.88","0.61","0.00","0.00","799","8.57","23.571428571428573","243","160","9","61.87","11.2","9.1","12.82","12.1","41","10.5","19.37","100","21.14","4","0.43","0","2","2","20","0","22","2","0","0","1","28","21","2","14","0","0","9","0","1","0","0","0","7","0","8","9","2","6","5","2","0","0","0","1"

To help meet a high demand in the Houston area for nurses, the San Jacinto College North Campus will offer Associate Degree Nursing (ADN) as an extension of the College’s existing ADN program, which operates at the Central Campus. The North Campus ADN program will start in the Fall 2014 semester, and the application period is now open through May 1.

Students will be able to graduate from the ADN program in five semesters, which will qualify them to take the National Council Licensure Exam for Registered Nurses. The North Campus will continue to offer a three-semester Vocational Nursing (VN) program in addition to the new ADN program. Registered Nurses (graduates of the ADN program) receive more advanced training and typically can qualify for higher skilled nursing positions that generally offer greater earning capacity.

There will be an information session on Tuesday, April 15 from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m., in room 1081 of the North Campus allied health and natural science building. Those attending the session can learn about program prerequisites.

The North Campus program will operate as an extension of Central Campus ADN program, using the same curriculum and clinical training procedures. Dr. Veronica Jammer, associate degree nursing department chair at the San Jacinto College Central Campus, will serve as department chair at the North Campus also. Rhonda Bell, North Campus VN program director, will serve as ADN-RN program coordinator at the North Campus.

Bell says extending the ADN program to the North Campus is good news for students and the community. “We have been working on launching an associate degree registered nursing program at the North Campus for several years in order to better serve our diverse community,” she commented. “Students in this geographical area need to have the opportunity to advance their education and be prepared to care for the diverse population of our area.”

Bell adds that it’s helpful to offer training options for students who want to become either Vocational Nurses or Registered Nurses. “Our VN program is a one-year program leading to a technical certificate,” she said. “Many choose the VN route due to family obligations, or perhaps because they want quick earning power, or perhaps as a way of finding out if nursing is the right choice for a career path. The ADN program, on the other hand, is a five-semester associate degree program that leads to RN positions for those typically who want to advance in the nursing profession.”

RNs can obtain positions in acute care settings, long-term acute care settings, rehabilitation care settings, clinics (private and community), schools, and many other medical care environments. “The pay for RNs is generally higher, due to the autonomous role of an RN and increased educational preparedness,” Bell commented.

San Jacinto College student Telicia Allen was certainly glad to learn that the Central Campus’ ADN program would be extended to the North Campus. “I was just about to apply to attend the ADN program at Central when I found out that it would soon be available at the North Campus,” said Allen, who lives in Sterling Green, which is close to the North Campus. Allen now plans to earn an associate nursing degree at the North Campus in 2016 en route to possibly earning a bachelor’s degree in nursing at Texas Woman’s University.

Allen owned and operated a daycare center for several years after graduating from North Shore High School, but wants to resume her education in order to better provide for her family.

“It was time for a career change, and I am really interested in nursing and understand there is high demand for nurses in the area,” she commented. “My dream job would be to work as a nurse at Texas Children’s Hospital.”

There is indeed a critical need for nurses in the greater Houston area. According to a recent report from nursingjobs.org, “Houston is struggling with an ongoing nursing shortage of 4,000 to 5,000 full-time Registered Nursing positions.” A recent report from the Texas Board of Nursing stated that approximately 5,000 hospital beds will be added to the Houston market in the near future.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average hourly pay for Registered Nurses is $31.48, and the average annual salary is $65,470. The average hourly pay for Vocational Nurses is $19.97, and the average annual salary is $41,540.

Graduates of the San Jacinto College nursing program have two options to continue their education through partnerships with the University of Houston-Clear Lake and Western Governor’s University. Both institutions offer a pathway to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN).","2014-04-03 06:49:00","1","75.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","230.0","208.0","10.0","302.0","0.0","25.0","0","906","97.83","67.45","25.22","54.87","23.84","29.69","78.59","37.31","4.08","1.88","0.44","0.44","0.00","0.55","0.44","2.21","9.05","14.13","5.52","2.21","3.53","0.00","8.83","4.19","2.21","0.77","3.31","1.77","1.99","1.77","0.22","0.11","0.11","0.00","5.52","0.22","0.11","0.66","0.22","5.41","1.10","0.66","1.10","1.77","0.33","0.99","0.99","0.55","0.33","0.11","2.54","0.11","2.43","0.00","0.00","8.28","2.65","1.99","3.53","1.66","0.00","1.10","6.73","2.10","16.11","1.32","10.93","3.86","16.78","0.33","0.44","0.88","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.00","16.00","4.97","5.19","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.77","1.99","0.77","1.55","0.66","4445","7.82","28.5625","1430","891","42","49.96","13.4","11.6","12.82","13.6","177","11.75","18.426127946127945","360","24.5","24","0.36","0","22","32","85","0","94","60","8","0","18","154","186","3","35","0","0","12","7","18","2","0","2","38","0","40","20","22","7","10","27","5","3","0","1"

WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today spoke on the Senate floor to honor the brave service of America’s fallen police officers and oppose President Obama’s nomination of Debo Adegbile to head the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.

“It is out of respect for our nation's police officers that I rise to oppose the nomination of Debo Adegbile to be the head of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division,” Sen. Cruz said. “We must remember our nation’s fallen police officers who have bravely given their lives to serve our nation and to protect us. They form the backbone of our country that supports the rule of law and they risk their lives every day to keep law-abiding Americans safe.”

In his remarks, the Senator noted that although every criminal defendant is entitled to an attorney, Adegbile’s representation of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a man convicted of murdering Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981, was pure political advocacy. Abu-Jamal's guilt was not in doubt - four eyewitnesses saw the shooting and Abu-Jamal confessed and stated in front of three witnesses that he hoped that Officer Faulkner died. And although Abu-Jamal already had a team of high-priced volunteer lawyers that had filed dozens of petitions and appeals, Adegbile and his team joined the case in 2009, 27 years after Faulkner’s death, and then began politicizing it. Under Adegbile's supervision, rallies, protests, and media campaigns instead dishonestly portrayed Abu-Jamal as a political prisoner and victim of racial injustice.

“This is not a matter of left wing or right wing politics,” Sen. Cruz continued. “We all should agree that violent criminals should be punished. We should all agree that those who advocate for, celebrate, lionize convicted cop killers are not suitable for major leadership roles at the United States Department of Justice. I urge every member of this body to oppose this nomination.”

In addition to his voluntary defense of a convicted cop-killer, Adegbile has a record of opposing common-sense voter ID laws, attacking religious liberties, advocating federal interference in religious institutions, and opposing Americans’ constitutional right to keep and bear arms.","2014-03-05 02:31:00","1","65.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","49.0","0.0","219.0","194.0","10.0","230.0","0.0","24.0","0","380","90.22","73.62","3.03","9.56","22.35","28.68","72.37","38.68","9.74","5.00","0.79","2.11","0.00","1.05","1.05","4.74","5.26","13.16","4.74","0.53","4.74","1.05","8.95","2.63","0.53","0.79","1.58","1.32","6.05","2.37","3.68","0.79","2.11","0.00","8.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.32","6.05","0.79","0.00","1.32","0.79","1.84","2.11","1.58","0.53","0.79","0.00","1.84","1.32","0.53","0.00","0.00","17.63","3.42","1.58","12.63","0.00","1.58","4.47","3.95","0.26","8.42","0.79","5.53","2.11","6.32","0.79","0.00","0.26","0.79","1.58","0.79","0.00","0.26","0.53","0.00","0.00","19.74","5.79","5.53","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.16","2.11","2.89","0.00","0.00","1904","8.96","35.63636363636363","607","369","15","46.51","15.7","12.9","14.28","16.3","96","8.2","22.246504065040654","215","30.55","11","0.4","0","14","5","30","1","47","25","0","0","4","60","64","4","26","0","0","11","9","9","0","0","0","11","0","14","18","7","12","9","7","2","3","0","0"

One of my favorite movies - despite the fact my wife has yet to make it all the way through awake - is Good Night and Good Luck, which celebrates Edward R. Murrow’s fight against Senator Joseph McCarthy during the height of Red Scare America.

In the movie (based on true events), McCarthy accuses Murrow of being a Communist sympathizer because a book written by a Soviet author was dedicated to Murrow.

I love Murrow’s defense.

He admitted yes, it was true that a Soviet author dedicated a book to him in honor of Murrow’s coverage of the siege of London in World War II. But, in the dedication written in the foreword of the book, the Soviet writes that in his observation, what made America so unique was that in America, similarity in ideology was not a prerequisite for friendship.

An American and a Soviet could shake hands at the end of the day and acknowledge the other as a friend, despite political differences.

This page is usually filled with the opinions of Democrats, Republicans, the left, the right, Christians, non-Christians, reds, blues, ups, downs and everything in between.

Occasionally opinions turn into attacks. Unfortunately, we don’t always consider the value of a different opinion.

Consider this: in countries where only one opinion is allowed, it is often called tyranny and rarely called freedom.

This country is great because of its freedom. It is great because as Murrow and his author alluded to, in America, similarity in ideology is not (or shouldn’t be) a prerequisite for friendship.

So as you write your letters to the editor, remember when you disagree with someone, instead of attacking them for having a different opinion, reach across those party lines and shake a hand instead of a fist.

After all, when you just sling mud, all you do is get your hands dirty and lose a bunch of ground.

Goodnight and good luck.","2014-04-05 11:37:00","1","78.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","52.0","0.0","230.0","210.0","10.0","308.0","0.0","25.0","0","352","90.68","61.20","22.55","52.41","22.00","25.85","81.25","50.00","9.09","4.26","0.85","0.28","1.70","1.14","0.28","4.83","9.66","15.91","6.82","3.98","5.97","1.70","11.65","6.82","3.41","1.42","2.27","1.14","7.67","4.55","3.12","0.85","1.14","0.28","7.10","0.28","0.57","0.28","1.14","13.07","1.42","1.99","1.14","2.84","2.27","3.69","2.27","1.42","0.00","0.85","1.14","0.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.10","2.27","0.85","1.99","2.27","0.57","3.41","6.25","0.00","12.78","0.85","8.24","3.98","3.69","1.99","0.00","0.00","0.57","0.28","0.57","0.00","0.28","0.28","0.00","0.00","16.76","4.55","7.39","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.85","0.00","1.99","1.14","0.57","1637","7.38","23.933333333333334","529","351","16","57.71","13.0","10.7","11.2","12.7","59","17.333333333333332","17.483646723646725","197","20.0","5","0.48","0","11","8","40","0","57","26","1","0","1","62","36","5","15","1","0","13","7","12","0","0","1","6","0","11","11","4","7","8","11","1","1","0","3"

On Monday, November 10, 2014 the Leadership Pearland Class of 2014-2015 participated in the third event that is part of the Pearland Chamber of Commerce nine-month program designed to enhance and motivate their potential for civic leadership and commitment to the Pearland community.

This month’s session, entitled “How Pearland Works,” began with a visit to the Pearland Fire Department to meet with Chief Vance Riley, Fire Marshal Roland Garcia and Deputy Fire Chief Daniel Baum where the class learned about the challenges of providing fire and safety service to a fast expanding area.

The Leadership Pearland Class then visited with Mark Wahlstrom at the JHEC Wastewater Treatment Plant to learn about his role as Wastewater treatment superintendent. Following this meeting the class took the short trip next door to tour the Stella Roberts Recycling Center. Henry Donley, Technician, explained what materials are accepted and processed for recycling. Class member Fay Watson of Keep Pearland Beautiful contributed in discussing KPB’s involvement and connection with the recycling center.

Michelle Graham, Director of Parks and Recreation, next welcomed the Leadership Class at the Recreation Center and Natatorium. The Parks and Recreation Department is developing a master plan and currently soliciting input from the community on priorities in facilities and services.

The next stop was with Eric Wilson, Director of Public Works. This department keeps the streets paved, the city car and truck fleet on those streets and the water and sewer construction and maintenance meeting the needs of Pearland.

Shari Coleman, Supervisor for Animal Control, guided the class through the operations of Pearland Animal Services. In addition to the services most think of Animal control performing such as catching straying animals and returning to owners or adoption services, Pearland Animal Services, also works with law enforcement to address cases of animal cruelty. Many of the class members decided that their next pet would be adopted from Pearland Animal Services.

The day ended with a tour of city hall which included a meeting with City Secretary Young Lorfing, who discussed elections, setting the agenda and keeping the minutes for the City Council meetings. Trent Epperson, Assistant City Manager, met with the class to discuss the expanding infrastructure in this fast growing city. The City of Pearland Engineering and Capital Projects department has an excellent GIS (Geographic Information Systems online map) program to provide efficient easy to use access to up to date geographic information about the city.

On Saturday, November 15, the Pearland Chamber of Commerce is presenting an in-depth and informative workshop for individuals looking to run for local political offices. The broad overview will be educational for any City, School, County, State or Federal position.

The inaugural Candidate School will provide prospective candidates with the tools to make a good and solid decision to run for office. A summary of the legal rules and regulations on running a good campaign, ethics, interaction with political consultants, elected officials past and present, and vendors of campaign services will be offered.

“The Pearland Chamber feels very strongly about providing the opportunity for individuals who are considering a run for office to learn how the process works and give them some ideas on how to run their campaign. Several elected positions have been sought and are held by past board members of the Chamber, but we have never offered this type of specific education. The Candidate School will provide an in-depth orientation on what to expect” said Carol Artz-Bucek, President /CEO of the Pearland Chamber of Commerce.

The cost for the Candidate School is $75 per participant. The full-day workshop is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m. with registration, a casual meet-and-greet session, qualified presenters, a working lunch, a thorough question and answer session with a 3:00 p.m. planned adjournment.

“We expect to give potential candidates a lot of information on applying to run for office, how to run an effective campaign, and an introduction to polling and the statistics of elections,” said Jim Johnson, Pearland Chamber Vice President of Member Relations. “We invite anyone interested in running for public office to attend.”

The Chamber encourages all potential candidates, family and friends assisting the candidates to register for the event. People affected would include anyone wanting to run for city, school, county, state and federal offices.

“We are designing the school to apply to all local offices, whether for city council, county judge, or MUD commissioner,” said Artz-Bucek. “The information will be invaluable to all those individuals who are looking toward dipping their toes into political waters.”

From our community

Reps. Pete Olson and Gene Green participated in a round table discussion with top physicians and research experts from the Texas Medical Center last week as part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s bipartisan initiative called 21st Century Cures.

The goal of this initiative is to accelerate the pace at which lifesaving medical treatments are discovered, developed, and delivered in the United States. The Texas Medical Center is the largest medical center in the world with one of the highest densities of clinical facilities for patient care, basic science, and translational research. Several panelists provided important updates on what they are working on and how the federal government can play a role in enhancing their efforts.

“America has long been a leader in medical breakthroughs,” Rep. Pete Olson said. “Our laws need to keep up so we can help get these innovations to those who need them. Government should be an ally in the quest to find the cure for diseases that plague our world. From Ebola to cancer, the experts can help us figure out where the gaps are so that the government and our laws can help speed up cures rather than hinder them. I applaud the hard work being done by the folks at the Texas Medical Center and across the country who are all working to find a pathway to cures.”

“It was excellent to hear from some of Houston’s leading scientists and health officials,” Rep. Gene Green said. “Our distinguished panelists and the institutions they represent are leading the world in research, innovation, and care. Through the 21st Century Cures Initiative, we can take full advantage of advances that have been made and improve the discovery, development and delivery of care.”

TMC Panelists included: Bobby Robbins, M.D. — President, Texas Medical Center, Paul Klotman, M.D. — President, Baylor College of Medicine, Mauro Ferrari, Ph.D. — Houston Methodist Research Institute, Richard Gibbs, Ph.D. — Baylor College of Medicine, Thomas Kent, M.D. — DeBakey VA Hospital, Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D. — Baylor College of Medicine, Malcolm Brenner, M.D., Ph.D. — Baylor College of Medicine, Kirstin Matthews, Ph.D. — Rice University, Bill McKeon — Texas Medical Center, Jeffrey P.

PRESS RELEASE

Coastal Conservation Association Texas deepened its commitment to marine resource science with a $250,000 grant to the Center for Sportfish Science and Conservation (CSSC) that will fund ongoing research into many of the key scientific issues facing the ecosystems that support Gulf of Mexico sportfishing. The CSSC is housed within the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi and was founded in 2012, in part with a $500,000 commitment from CCA Texas.

""In the few short years that the Center has been operating, marine researchers there have developed incredible insights into the needs and behaviors of key species that anglers cherish,"" said Mark Ray, chairman of CCA Texas. ""We are learning things that can immediately be applied to better the management of those species. The work to date has been extremely impressive and we want to ensure that the Center has everything it needs to continue to be a force for healthy marine resources.""

Since 2012, CSSC has done extensive work on the impact that passes like Cedar Bayou have on bay ecosystems and on the effect of diminishing Gulf habitat. It is also helping to pioneer development of an extensive array of sensors and tracking technology to gain critical insight into the migratory patterns of fish throughout the Gulf of Mexico. The latest $250,000 grant from CCA Texas will be applied over five years to continue these and other research efforts.

""Recreational anglers are our natural partners in the conservation of marine resources, and the Center is uniquely positioned to develop science that supports the multi-billion dollar recreational fishing industry on the Texas coast and the Gulf of Mexico,"" said Dr. Greg Stunz, director of CSSC and Endowed Chair for Fisheries and Ocean Health at the Harte Research Institute. ""This is a unique partnership that is focused solely on improving the marine environment, and we are excited to have additional resources to fulfill that mission.""

""Both inshore and offshore sportfish face many challenges - natural and man-made - and it is critical that the science is available to properly manage those fisheries,"" said Robby Byers, CCA Texas executive director. ""Recreational anglers have already recognized that the work being done by CSSC is vital to the health and availability of those resources in the future. We are proud to be a partner in their efforts and look forward to building this unique relationship.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today spoke on the Senate floor to honor the brave service of America’s fallen police officers and oppose President Obama’s nomination of Debo Adegbile to head the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.

“It is out of respect for our nation's police officers that I rise to oppose the nomination of Debo Adegbile to be the head of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division,” Sen. Cruz said. “We must remember our nation’s fallen police officers who have bravely given their lives to serve our nation and to protect us. They form the backbone of our country that supports the rule of law and they risk their lives every day to keep law-abiding Americans safe.”

In his remarks, the Senator noted that although every criminal defendant is entitled to an attorney, Adegbile’s representation of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a man convicted of murdering Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981, was pure political advocacy. Abu-Jamal's guilt was not in doubt - four eyewitnesses saw the shooting and Abu-Jamal confessed and stated in front of three witnesses that he hoped that Officer Faulkner died. And although Abu-Jamal already had a team of high-priced volunteer lawyers that had filed dozens of petitions and appeals, Adegbile and his team joined the case in 2009, 27 years after Faulkner’s death, and then began politicizing it. Under Adegbile's supervision, rallies, protests, and media campaigns instead dishonestly portrayed Abu-Jamal as a political prisoner and victim of racial injustice.

“This is not a matter of left wing or right wing politics,” Sen. Cruz continued. “We all should agree that violent criminals should be punished. We should all agree that those who advocate for, celebrate, lionize convicted cop killers are not suitable for major leadership roles at the United States Department of Justice. I urge every member of this body to oppose this nomination.”

In addition to his voluntary defense of a convicted cop-killer, Adegbile has a record of opposing common-sense voter ID laws, attacking religious liberties, advocating federal interference in religious institutions, and opposing Americans’ constitutional right to keep and bear arms.","2014-03-05 02:32:00","1","65.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","49.0","0.0","219.0","194.0","10.0","230.0","0.0","24.0","0","380","90.22","73.62","3.03","9.56","22.35","28.68","72.37","38.68","9.74","5.00","0.79","2.11","0.00","1.05","1.05","4.74","5.26","13.16","4.74","0.53","4.74","1.05","8.95","2.63","0.53","0.79","1.58","1.32","6.05","2.37","3.68","0.79","2.11","0.00","8.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.32","6.05","0.79","0.00","1.32","0.79","1.84","2.11","1.58","0.53","0.79","0.00","1.84","1.32","0.53","0.00","0.00","17.63","3.42","1.58","12.63","0.00","1.58","4.47","3.95","0.26","8.42","0.79","5.53","2.11","6.32","0.79","0.00","0.26","0.79","1.58","0.79","0.00","0.26","0.53","0.00","0.00","19.74","5.79","5.53","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.16","2.11","2.89","0.00","0.00","1904","8.96","35.63636363636363","607","369","15","46.51","15.7","12.9","14.28","16.3","96","8.2","22.246504065040654","215","30.55","11","0.4","0","14","5","30","1","47","25","0","0","4","60","64","4","26","0","0","11","9","9","0","0","0","11","0","14","18","7","12","9","7","2","3","0","0"
"https://www.chron.com/neighborhood/pearland/opinion/article/PEASE-A-shift-in-who-is-responsible-for-the-9848098.php","PEASE: A shift in who is responsible for the killing of John F. Kennedy","PEASE: A shift in who is responsible for the killing of John F. Kennedy

Many of us think about the tragedy in Dallas 51 years ago this month. Last May I visited the Texas School Book Depository on the corner of Houston and Elm Streets in Dallas, Texas and read the government’s inscription on the wall of the building, “On November 22, 1963, The building gained national notoriety when Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly shot and killed President John F. Kennedy from a sixth story window as the Presidential motorcade passed.” The word allegedly grabbed me, as it was an admission that even the government was not certain, without some level of doubt, that Oswald did the deed or acted alone.

Most serious scholars on the assassination view the Warren Commissions review of the data with great skepticism (some with contempt) especially in light of its numerous omissions, as for example the testimony of Dr. Charles Crenshaw who placed Kennedy in the coffin at Parkland Hospital and testified years latter that the neck wound had been tampered with to look like an exit rather than an entry wound. An entry wound would have proved more than a single assassin and provoked more investigation. Also, why did they seal the unpublished portion of their findings for 75 years?

Finally, thirteen years later The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1976 concluded that “President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.” They, like the Warren Commission, did their investigation mostly in secret. Unbelievably they too sealed their evidence for 50 years under Congressional rules. Withholding evidence feeds conspiracy theories. As the years fly by, and new data surfaces from the hundreds of books on the subject, it is increasingly more difficult to dismiss, as an accomplice, Lyndon Baines Johnson and his CIA/FBI friends.

My journalist friend, Don Clark, has personally read most of the 2,000 books on the subject and is a noted speaker on the assassination. He told an audience in San Francisco that while the government has not, or will not, pursue the subject, private investigators have done so and we do not have to wait for the sealed records. He has a recommend list of “must reads” on the subject and they follow.

First, get the directors cut of the motion picture JFK by Oliver Stone. Despite the profanity the “movie contains more spoken words, more script, than any film in history.”

Second, On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison (a former FBI agent) treats Oswald’s time in New Orleans and four government agents identified as “handlers” that seemed to “shadow” him.

Third, read JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters. A stunning piece of original research published in 2008, by James Douglass.

Fourth, read MARY’S MOSAIC: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace, by Peter Janney. The work published in 2012 found that the author’s own “CIA father, was among the conspirators orchestrating the deaths of Kennedy and his friend Mary Pinchot Meyer. The latter’s death is also “in a veiled way” in the recent movie, An American Affair.

Fifth, read JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy, by Air Force Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty, who served at the time of Kennedy’s death, as the key liaison between the Pentagon and the CIA.

Sixth, tying together many loose ends the following three books will help. Revealing the secret links between the most powerful law firm in Texas and the criminal rise to power of Lyndon Johnson is Blood, Money, & Power: How LBJ Killed JFK by Barr McClellan. LBJ: Mastermind of the JFK Assassination by Phillip Nelson. Texas in the Morning by Lyndon Johnson’s long-time mistress, Madeline Duncan Brown “takes you to the meeting the night before the assassination. She reveals the identities of the men in that room. She shares the story of Lyndon Johnson coming late to the meeting, then emerging in a fury, grabbing her by the arms so hard it hurt, and swearing in a rage, ‘After tomorrow, those goddamn Kennedy’s will never embarrass me again---and that’s not a threat, that’s a promise!’ ”

In light of decades of intensive reading, Clark poses the question, “Was it devious, desperate Lyndon Johnson, the viper in the nest, the Brutus to Kennedy’s Caesar, who with the help of J. Edgar Hoover had blackmailed his way onto the 1960 presidential ticket, who knew he was about to be dumped from the 1964 ticket, who knew he was about to be indicted and probably go to prison for his probable role in the Bobby Baker and Billy Sol Estes scandals, whose lifelong lust and endless scheming for the presidency would stop at nothing to get to that office, least of all murder?” Perhaps it is time to speak the unspeakable and be more inclusive of the new data in our history tests.

The Harris County Flood Control District has completed construction on a maintenance project to repair erosion and restore the stormwater-carrying capacity of a 3,350-foot section of Seals Gully between Cypresswood Drive and Haude Road in north Harris County. Seals Gully is a tributary of Cypress Creek.

Harris County Commissioners Court awarded an $886,751 construction contract to low bidder Lindsey Construction Inc. in October 2013. Work on Seals Gully, also known as Bonds Gully and formally identified as HCFCD Unit K124-00-00, began in early January and was completed in September.

The project included repairs to the gully's eroded side slopes, which were stabilized with buried concrete rip rap. Erosion is caused by a combination of poor soils and the movement of stormwater in a bayou or other channel. It can cause a channel’s side slopes to degrade and eventually to fail. Riprap is chunks of concrete or stone that may be buried along the bayou slopes to armor them against further erosion.

The work also included removing an outdated and failed drop structure located upstream of Cypresswood Drive. Drop structures are sometimes used to control the energy and velocity of passing stormwater, especially when the channel bottom changes elevation. The completed project area will be replanted with turf grass.

If the public has questions or comments about the project, they may call the Flood Control District's Project and Study Information Line, which is monitored daily, at 713-684-4040, or email ProjectCommunications@hcfcd.org.","2014-10-20 23:00:00","1","70.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","52.0","0.0","230.0","210.0","10.0","310.0","0.0","26.0","0","286","95.65","48.60","47.53","12.01","22.00","30.77","65.38","34.97","2.45","0.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.70","1.75","7.34","12.94","5.24","2.45","6.64","0.00","6.29","2.45","1.40","1.05","5.59","0.35","2.45","0.70","1.75","0.00","0.00","1.05","2.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.14","1.40","3.15","0.35","3.15","2.10","2.45","1.05","0.70","0.35","0.00","0.35","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.90","0.00","1.75","3.85","0.35","0.70","4.20","4.20","1.40","17.13","3.15","10.84","3.50","5.59","1.40","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.94","4.90","3.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.10","0.00","1.05","0.00","1.40","1460","8.64","24.083333333333332","436","276","13","49.96","12.9","11.6","14.45","14.9","69","16.0","20.480000000000004","168","20.42","2","0.33","0","13","16","21","0","30","16","0","0","4","41","67","1","11","0","0","3","0","8","0","0","0","8","0","11","10","3","12","3","7","3","0","0","1"

Airman Dale Adams, a 2011 Oakridge High School graduate from Spring, is serving in the U.S. Navy aboard one of the world’s largest warships, the San Diego-based aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).

USS Ronald Reagan is a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and one of only ten operational aircraft carriers in the Navy today, protecting and defending America on the world’s oceans. Tens of thousands of America’s finest young men and women are deployed around the world doing just that, and they are there around the clock, far from our shores, defending America at all times.

Approximately 3,000 men and women make up the ship’s company, which keeps all parts of the aircraft carrier running smoothly — this includes everything from washing dishes and preparing meals to handling weaponry and maintaining the nuclear reactors. Another 2,500 or so form the air wing, the people who actually fly and maintain the aircraft.

“I never cease to be impressed with the type and quality of work that goes on aboard the carrier each day,” said Capt. Christopher E. Bolt, the carrier’s commanding officer. “Our team is filled with highly qualified young adults — in many cases, 19 and 20 years old — and they’re out here launching and recovering aircraft, running a complex propulsion system safely, serving as air traffic controllers, operating sophisticated electronics, and keeping this floating city alive and functioning. Their work ethic, enthusiasm, and esprit de corps are second to none.

“If you pick up a newspaper in any city and examine what other 19- and 20-year-olds are doing, there is no comparison to the level of responsibility our Sailors hold. That caliber of Sailor is what has earned us the title of AMERICA’S FLAGSHIP.”

Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 HAROLD PEASE: A shift in who is responsible for the killing of John F. Kennedy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery

Many of us think about the tragedy in Dallas 51 years ago this month. Last May I visited the Texas School Book Depository on the corner of Houston and Elm Streets in Dallas, Texas and read the government’s inscription on the wall of the building, “On November 22, 1963, The building gained national notoriety when Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly shot and killed President John F. Kennedy from a sixth story window as the Presidential motorcade passed.”

The word ""allegedly"" grabbed me, as it was an admission that even the government was not certain, without some level of doubt, that Oswald did the deed or acted alone.

Most serious scholars on the assassination view the Warren Commissions review of the data with great skepticism (some with contempt) especially in light of its numerous omissions, as for example the testimony of Dr. Charles Crenshaw who placed Kennedy in the coffin at Parkland Hospital and testified years latter that the neck wound had been tampered with to look like an exit rather than an entry wound. An entry wound would have proved more than a single assassin and provoked more investigation. Also, why did they seal the unpublished portion of their findings for 75 years?

Finally, 13 years later The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1976 concluded that “President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.” They, like the Warren Commission, did their investigation mostly in secret. Unbelievably they too sealed their evidence for 50 years under Congressional rules. Withholding evidence feeds conspiracy theories. As the years fly by, and new data surfaces from the hundreds of books on the subject, it is increasingly more difficult to dismiss, as an accomplice, Lyndon Baines Johnson and his CIA/FBI friends.

My journalist friend, Don Clark, has personally read most of the 2,000 books on the subject and is a noted speaker on the assassination. He told an audience in San Francisco that while the government has not, or will not, pursue the subject, private investigators have done so and we do not have to wait for the sealed records. He has a recommend list of “must reads” on the subject and they follow.

First, get the directors cut of the motion picture JFK by Oliver Stone. Despite the profanity the “movie contains more spoken words, more script, than any film in history.”

Second, On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison (a former FBI agent) treats Oswald’s time in New Orleans and four government agents identified as “handlers” that seemed to “shadow” him.

Third, read JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters. A stunning piece of original research published in 2008, by James Douglass.

Fourth, read MARY’S MOSAIC: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace, by Peter Janney. The work published in 2012 found that the author’s own “CIA father, was among the conspirators orchestrating the deaths of Kennedy and his friend Mary Pinchot Meyer. The latter’s death is also “in a veiled way” in the recent movie, An American Affair.

Fifth, read JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy, by Air Force Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty, who served at the time of Kennedy’s death, as the key liaison between the Pentagon and the CIA.

Sixth, tying together many loose ends the following three books will help. Revealing the secret links between the most powerful law firm in Texas and the criminal rise to power of Lyndon Johnson is Blood, Money, & Power: How LBJ Killed JFK by Barr McClellan. LBJ: Mastermind of the JFK Assassination by Phillip Nelson. Texas in the Morning by Lyndon Johnson’s long-time mistress, Madeline Duncan Brown “takes you to the meeting the night before the assassination. She reveals the identities of the men in that room. She shares the story of Lyndon Johnson coming late to the meeting, then emerging in a fury, grabbing her by the arms so hard it hurt, and swearing in a rage, ‘After tomorrow, those goddamn Kennedy’s will never embarrass me again -- and that’s not a threat, that’s a promise!’ ”

In light of decades of intensive reading, Clark poses the question, “Was it devious, desperate Lyndon Johnson, the viper in the nest, the Brutus to Kennedy’s Caesar, who with the help of J. Edgar Hoover had blackmailed his way onto the 1960 presidential ticket, who knew he was about to be dumped from the 1964 ticket, who knew he was about to be indicted and probably go to prison for his probable role in the Bobby Baker and Billy Sol Estes scandals, whose lifelong lust and endless scheming for the presidency would stop at nothing to get to that office, least of all murder?” Perhaps it is time to speak the unspeakable and be more inclusive of the new data in our history tests.

AUSTIN — Texas has the second highest health insurance enrollment among the 26 states relying on the federal government to administer the health insurance marketplace, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As of Dec. 28, 2013, enrollment in Texas was 118,532, reflecting a surge in December activity as the enrollment website’s functionality improved and consumers sought coverage effective Jan. 1.

Unfortunately, the positive impact for Texas hospitals is diminished. The state’s failure to extend Medicaid coverage to the working poor or devise its own solution to reduce the number of uninsured leaves more than one million Texans with no access to affordable coverage options.

In addition, ongoing and new federal funding cuts result in significantly fewer resources for Texas hospitals to provide care for the uninsured.

• Hospitals already provide more than $5 billion annually in uncompensated care because of Texas’ high rate of uninsured.

• Reductions in Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments began in FY 2012 and for FY 2014 alone are between $16 million and $19 million.

• The recent congressional budget deal will extend federal cuts to the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital program that were intended as “pay-fors” for Medicaid expansion for an additional year through 2023.

• The budget deal also extends the two percent sequester reduction in reimbursement rates for Medicare providers (including hospitals) for two additional years from 2021 to 2023.

• The three-month SGR or “doc fix” will avert deep cuts to physician reimbursement but contains substantially lower payments for long-term care hospitals that serve patients with clinically complex conditions.

“Increased private insurance enrollment through the Marketplace is certainly good news, but with a million Texans remaining uninsured and reduced federal resources, Texas hospitals will shoulder a heavy financial burden,” said John Hawkins, THA senior vice president for government relations. “The state’s inaction on coverage for the working poor and new and continued funding cuts at the federal level are a real threat to Texas hospitals’ continued ability to provide the highest quality care to all who need it.”","2014-01-14 08:16:00","1","75.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","52.0","0.0","230.0","210.0","10.0","311.0","0.0","26.0","0","373","99.00","52.14","14.85","35.11","26.64","37.27","69.97","31.37","1.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.34","6.97","15.82","2.68","0.80","4.56","0.27","5.09","6.70","3.22","0.27","8.04","1.61","4.83","2.68","2.14","0.27","0.27","0.80","2.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.36","1.61","1.34","0.27","0.80","0.80","1.61","1.34","0.80","0.27","0.27","6.43","0.27","6.17","0.00","0.00","7.24","1.34","1.61","3.49","0.80","0.80","1.61","4.02","0.80","11.80","0.54","7.51","4.02","6.43","0.00","0.00","6.17","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.28","4.29","2.95","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.80","2.14","1.34","0.54","2.68","2047","9.26","31.416666666666668","652","375","14","35.81","17.5","14.9","15.9","18.7","102","11.875","23.6","212","27.0","13","0.32","0","12","29","28","0","45","41","4","2","3","64","54","5","25","0","0","1","1","9","0","0","0","14","0","9","7","8","3","5","5","2","1","0","0"

The U.S. House of Representatives voted today on legislation introduced by Rep. Jeff Miller (R-FL) which will simplify the process of removing Veterans Affairs employees who fail to adequately perform their duties. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will be able to by-pass the current cumbersome, multi-step process and would also be required to report to Congress the reason for the removal.

“I know there are dedicated workers at the Veterans Administration because I see them caring for our local veterans. But there are some bad apples, too, who have been negligent and derelict in their duty to protect veterans,” said Texas Republican Congressman Kevin Brady, who co-sponsored the measure. “To make sure these bad apples are held accountable and removed without delay, this law allows the VA Secretary to circumvent months of red tape and fix this unconscionable behavior of some workers who have jeopardized the lives of veterans who served our nation.”","2014-05-21 18:25:00","1","65.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","228.0","208.0","10.0","300.0","0.0","25.0","0","216","92.37","72.63","6.77","18.91","18.00","27.78","73.61","37.50","8.33","4.17","0.93","0.93","0.93","0.00","1.39","4.17","5.09","13.89","5.09","2.31","3.24","0.46","8.80","1.39","0.00","2.78","2.78","0.93","2.31","0.93","1.39","0.00","0.00","0.46","6.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.09","0.93","1.85","0.46","0.93","0.46","0.93","2.31","1.85","0.46","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.00","13.89","0.93","3.24","10.65","0.00","1.85","1.85","6.48","0.93","9.72","3.70","4.17","2.31","9.72","0.00","1.39","0.93","0.00","0.00","2.31","0.00","2.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.91","8.33","3.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.78","1.85","0.00","2.78","0.93","1051","8.44","43.8","338","210","10","50.16","14.3","11.5","13.11","13.8","50","6.071428571428571","19.923809523809524","124","32.6","19","0.37","0","5","6","16","0","20","14","0","0","3","16","54","5","13","0","0","3","4","3","0","0","0","11","0","13","5","3","5","9","3","1","5","0","0"

U.S. Congressman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) has operated his congressional office so frugally that he has returned more than $1 million to the federal treasury over the past five years.

This week Brady returned another $108,289 to the treasury from his office budget for 2013, bringing his five year total returned to $1,010,050. Under his leadership, his office has reduced spending every year since 2009.

“These are the taxpayer’s hard-earned dollars and we try to watch every penny. Most years we operate our offices on only 85 percent of the budget, returning the rest to the treasury where it is used for deficit reduction,” said Brady, a former chamber of commerce executive. “We try to operate our office like a business - efficiently, with strong customer service. We want to show other Washington agencies that they can live below their budgets, too.”

Brady credits his staff in Texas and the Capitol for the tight spending practices, saying, “Every one of our staff watches the budget carefully. They are fully committed to spending wisely, and I appreciate their efforts.”

Brady, a senior member of the House Ways & Means Committee, has never moved to Washington. He lives in Texas with his wife and children and commutes to work in Congress.","2014-02-11 16:30:00","1","66.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","49.0","0.0","219.0","194.0","10.0","229.0","0.0","24.0","0","219","90.88","90.72","4.01","88.03","19.91","25.11","84.02","42.01","12.79","9.59","0.46","3.20","0.00","4.11","1.83","3.20","6.39","14.16","3.65","2.74","2.74","0.46","10.05","3.20","2.28","0.46","5.94","3.65","3.65","3.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.87","0.46","0.00","0.46","4.11","7.76","1.37","0.91","0.46","1.37","2.74","0.91","3.20","1.37","0.91","0.91","2.28","0.00","2.28","0.00","0.00","14.16","4.11","3.65","6.39","0.46","0.46","2.74","8.22","0.00","12.33","1.37","4.11","6.85","13.24","0.00","0.46","7.76","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.46","6.85","6.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.37","2.74","0.46","0.91","2.28","1046","8.5","22.2","317","214","12","61.87","10.9","9.1","12.29","11.7","54","7.083333333333334","19.213457943925235","143","20.5","6","0.41","0","5","14","19","0","22","9","1","1","1","34","25","2","10","0","0","10","12","11","0","0","0","11","0","5","3","4","6","7","9","0","0","0","1"

Reps. Pete Olson and Gene Green participated in a round table discussion with top physicians and research experts from the Texas Medical Center last week as part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s bipartisan initiative called 21st Century Cures.

The goal of this initiative is to accelerate the pace at which lifesaving medical treatments are discovered, developed, and delivered in the United States. The Texas Medical Center is the largest medical center in the world with one of the highest densities of clinical facilities for patient care, basic science, and translational research. Several panelists provided important updates on what they are working on and how the federal government can play a role in enhancing their efforts.

“America has long been a leader in medical breakthroughs,” Rep. Pete Olson said. “Our laws need to keep up so we can help get these innovations to those who need them. Government should be an ally in the quest to find the cure for diseases that plague our world. From Ebola to cancer, the experts can help us figure out where the gaps are so that the government and our laws can help speed up cures rather than hinder them. I applaud the hard work being done by the folks at the Texas Medical Center and across the country who are all working to find a pathway to cures.”

“It was excellent to hear from some of Houston’s leading scientists and health officials,” Rep. Gene Green said. “Our distinguished panelists and the institutions they represent are leading the world in research, innovation, and care. Through the 21st Century Cures Initiative, we can take full advantage of advances that have been made and improve the discovery, development and delivery of care.”

TMC Panelists included: Bobby Robbins, M.D. — President, Texas Medical Center, Paul Klotman, M.D. — President, Baylor College of Medicine, Mauro Ferrari, Ph.D. — Houston Methodist Research Institute, Richard Gibbs, Ph.D. — Baylor College of Medicine, Thomas Kent, M.D. — DeBakey VA Hospital, Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D. — Baylor College of Medicine, Malcolm Brenner, M.D., Ph.D. — Baylor College of Medicine, Kirstin Matthews, Ph.D. — Rice University, Bill McKeon — Texas Medical Center, Jeffrey P. Sutton, M.D., Ph.D — Baylor College of Medicine, and Jiajie Zhang, Ph.D. — University of Texas Health.","2014-11-02 16:11:00","1","66.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","49.0","0.0","219.0","194.0","10.0","230.0","0.0","24.0","0","377","94.47","80.93","11.50","70.68","22.18","28.91","74.27","37.40","6.63","3.71","0.27","2.12","0.00","0.00","1.33","2.92","7.43","12.73","5.57","1.33","4.77","0.00","8.75","3.18","1.33","1.59","0.27","1.06","2.39","2.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.69","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","5.31","1.33","1.86","1.06","0.27","0.27","0.80","2.12","1.06","0.80","0.53","5.57","0.00","5.31","0.00","0.27","12.47","3.45","4.24","5.84","1.33","0.27","2.65","7.16","0.00","12.47","1.33","8.49","2.65","9.28","0.27","0.27","0.27","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","24.14","11.14","9.81","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.12","0.53","0.00","0.27","1884","8.21","27.928571428571427","586","387","26","64.81","11.7","7.9","12.06","10.3","94","12.125","17.67576227390181","219","23.71","23","0.41","0","14","2","33","1","39","19","0","3","6","38","121","2","23","0","0","9","6","3","0","0","3","8","0","17","8","7","7","11","3","3","3","0","2"

Dan Bongino is the ideal candidate for Congress.

Bongino has the pedigree as a former Secret Service agent that provides an automatic stamp of approval from everyone who learns this one fact about him.

He has built-in name identification through his regular guest radio hosting gigs on both Washington, D.C. local and nationally syndicated radio shows, as well as a best-selling book ""Inside the Bubble"" that puts him on the credibility map.

Bongino even has demonstrated expertise in social media with more than 21,000 personal followers on twitter.

Young, smart, handsome, savvy, and quick with a sharp sound bite, Dan Bongino is everything the Republican Party purports to look for in a candidate, yet the National Republican Congressional Committee has not lifted a finger to support his election effort. As of this writing, they haven't even called him.

Part of the reason could be that early in the race Bongino was considered a long-shot, running in the blue state of Maryland in a district that was gerrymandered to give a Democrat a good chance of winning. However, even with the most creative drawing of the district lines, the District is only a D+4, meaning that it leans Democrat but can be won by a Republican in an election cycle that favors the GOP.

And that is exactly what we have. 2014 is the ideal election cycle for mobilized voters in the highly conservative western Maryland part of the district to overwhelm the disenchanted and demoralized Democrats in the D.C. suburban part of the District.

Bongino for his part has nationalized the election having both Senator Rand Paul and Mike Lee into the District to rally the base, along with other conservative superstars like Col. Allen West.

On the fundraising front, Bongino continues to raise more money than his Democrat incumbent opponent, another touchstone for legitimacy.

Yet, even though Bongino's district is in the Washington, D.C. media market, the political masterminds at the NRCC remain deaf to the possible pick-up.

It makes one wonder if the lack of enthusiasm for Dan Bongino is because he is a constitutional conservative who has a libertarian streak. A man accustomed to saying what he believes and not backing down from a fight, it is fair to ask if House Republican leadership would prefer to have Bongino on the outside looking in to their cozy little club. After all, who needs another Louie Gohmert constitutional conservative holding them accountable to limited government principles.

No matter their motivation, the ugly truth is that the Republican National Committee is currently soliciting volunteers from the DC area (including Bongino's district) to volunteer in northern Virginia for their dead in the water Senate nominee and a likely winning congressional candidate. In most election years, this might make sense, but in 2014, the state of Maryland has a competitive governor's race featuring a very attractive African American Republican Lt. Governor candidate, important state house and state senate races (Virginia has no state races on the ballot), and the chance to win a congressional seat with a candidate who will be a Party leader for the next twenty years.

The upshot is that Bongino can win (polling is too close to call), but it will be in spite of the national Republican leadership. The question is will conservative leaders step up to the plate in the next two weeks, replacing the Party, and make the ground game happen in Bongino's and other ignored conservative candidate's districts?

Our nation is at a crossroads, and America needs Members of Congress like Dan Bongino. With November 4 a mere two weeks away, it is time for conservatives across the nation to go all-in, and use their networks to replace the indifferent Republican Party efforts to turn out the vote. Whether you live in the D.C. area, Utah or Florida, your vote and that of your family, friends and neighbors matter. Find the best candidate who will stand up for America and spend at least one weekend along with election day helping that candidate win.

It is now up to you. You can sit at home and complain, or you can take a stand. With our nation adrift, failure is simply not an option.

AUSTIN — Texas has the second highest health insurance enrollment among the 26 states relying on the federal government to administer the health insurance marketplace, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As of Dec. 28, 2013, enrollment in Texas was 118,532, reflecting a surge in December activity as the enrollment website’s functionality improved and consumers sought coverage effective Jan. 1.

Unfortunately, the positive impact for Texas hospitals is diminished. The state’s failure to extend Medicaid coverage to the working poor or devise its own solution to reduce the number of uninsured leaves more than one million Texans with no access to affordable coverage options.

In addition, ongoing and new federal funding cuts result in significantly fewer resources for Texas hospitals to provide care for the uninsured.

• Hospitals already provide more than $5 billion annually in uncompensated care because of Texas’ high rate of uninsured.

• Reductions in Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments began in FY 2012 and for FY 2014 alone are between $16 million and $19 million.

• The recent congressional budget deal will extend federal cuts to the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital program that were intended as “pay-fors” for Medicaid expansion for an additional year through 2023.

• The budget deal also extends the two percent sequester reduction in reimbursement rates for Medicare providers (including hospitals) for two additional years from 2021 to 2023.

• The three-month SGR or “doc fix” will avert deep cuts to physician reimbursement but contains substantially lower payments for long-term care hospitals that serve patients with clinically complex conditions.

“Increased private insurance enrollment through the Marketplace is certainly good news, but with a million Texans remaining uninsured and reduced federal resources, Texas hospitals will shoulder a heavy financial burden,” said John Hawkins, THA senior vice president for government relations. “The state’s inaction on coverage for the working poor and new and continued funding cuts at the federal level are a real threat to Texas hospitals’ continued ability to provide the highest quality care to all who need it.”","2014-01-14 10:30:00","1","72.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","228.0","208.0","10.0","302.0","0.0","25.0","0","373","99.00","52.14","14.85","35.11","26.64","37.27","69.97","31.37","1.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.34","6.97","15.82","2.68","0.80","4.56","0.27","5.09","6.70","3.22","0.27","8.04","1.61","4.83","2.68","2.14","0.27","0.27","0.80","2.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.36","1.61","1.34","0.27","0.80","0.80","1.61","1.34","0.80","0.27","0.27","6.43","0.27","6.17","0.00","0.00","7.24","1.34","1.61","3.49","0.80","0.80","1.61","4.02","0.80","11.80","0.54","7.51","4.02","6.43","0.00","0.00","6.17","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.28","4.29","2.95","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.80","2.14","1.34","0.54","2.68","2047","9.26","31.416666666666668","652","375","14","35.81","17.5","14.9","15.9","18.7","102","11.875","23.6","212","27.0","13","0.32","0","12","29","28","0","45","41","4","2","3","64","54","5","25","0","0","1","1","9","0","0","0","14","0","9","7","8","3","5","5","2","1","0","0"

From our community

Darryl Grant stepped back on to the field at Rice Stadium for the first time in over 30 years on Thursday, taking up an offer from head coach David Bailiff to speak to the current group of Owls as they wrapped up preparations for Saturday’s Homecoming clash with UTSA.

Few former Owls could bring as formidable a list of accomplishments with their message to the current players. Grant beat the odds as a ninth-round pick by Washington in 1981, playing for 11 years in the NFL and capturing two Super Bowl rings. In 2007, he was enshrined in the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame, where he joined former Rice standouts Tommy Kramer, Tobin Rote and Norm Charlton.

But fewer could find kinship with so many of the position groups of players who gathered to hear his message, because during his time at Rice, Grant seemingly saw playing time at nearly every position along the offensive and defensive fronts for the Owls.

Grant arrived on South Main in 1977 as a center, but someone who had excelled on both sides of the ball at Highlands High School in San Antonio. He would letter as a true freshman at that position, then move to nose guard as a sophomore, linebacker as a junior and then flip back to offensive tackle as a senior.

“They (the Rice coaching staff) knew that I could play pretty much anywhere they needed me. I was willing to move, so they placed me wherever there was a need. I always looked at it that they had confidence in me to handle it,” Grant said. “It seemed like I was always drawing the assignment against the other team’s best player. When I was a sophomore at nose guard and we played against Oklahoma, it meant I was going against Greg Roberts (1978 Outland winner). When I was a senior playing Arkansas, it meant lining up a tackle against Billy Ray Smith (two-time, All-American).”

“I looked at each challenge as an opportunity to be noticed because I knew scouts would be watching tape of those players. My hope always was that I would stand out on film and they would add me to their list of prospects. I always believed that showing versatility would be something that would help me get to the pros.”

Grant’s hunch paid off when Washington selected him in the ninth round in 1981, announcing his selection as a guard. Grant was part of a draft haul for the Redskins that included Mark May (OT), Russ Grimm (OG), Dexter Manley (DE) and Clint Didier (TE). Each of those players would become a stalwart on Washington teams that would play for the NFC title four times in the next decade. Grant would join them, but only after yet another position change, to defensive tackle.

After a rookie season spent learning the position, Grant became a fixture on the Washington defensive front, along with Manley, Charles Mann and Dave Butz. In 10 seasons in Washington, Grant went to the playoffs six times, played in four NFC Championships and three Super Bowls, winning twice.

But for all his accumulated time in the postseason, Grant’s career may be best remembered for the celebratory spike after scoring the only touchdown of his career to cement Washington’s 31-17 win over Dallas in the NFC title game.

With Washington clinging to a 24-17 lead with seven minutes left in the game, Dallas quarterback Gary Hogeboom’s screen pass to Tony Dorsett was deflected into the air by Manley. Grant grabbed the deflection and deftly avoided tacklers to reach the end zone.

Grant unleashed a fearsome spike of the ball as the Washington fans went into a state of delirium fueled by the knowledge they had vanquished the hated Cowboys and were going to the Super Bowl. The celebration grew so boisterous that sections of RFK Stadium began to bounce and a few began to crash in to each other.

A photo of Grant’s spike found its way on the cover of Sports Illustrated, ensuring Grant a lifetime of autograph requests.

“I’ve easily signed tens of thousands of them,” Grant recalled. “And these are not reprints of the cover. These are original magazines with the address labels on them. The funny thing is whenever anyone has one for me to sign, they also tell me they were there in that end zone when I scored, but there is no way that many people were actually in that corner,” he laughed.

Ironically, Grant’s moment in time allowed him to join a former Rice teammate, Earl Cooper, as two of three former Owls (Frank Ryan, twice as a member of the Cleveland Browns) to grace the cover of Sports Illustrated. Cooper made two appearances in his career with San Francisco giving the duo three covers, or just one less than the number of wins they enjoyed in three seasons as teammates at Rice.

This weekend, Grant will join with many of his old teammates to reminisce not so much about the scores of games, but of the experiences that bond teammates for eternity, no matter the outcome of contests.

“We held our own in so many games back then, but we did not come out with a lot of wins,” Grant said. “But they were great times and I am looking forward to sharing a lot of stories.”","2014-11-07 16:02:00","1","79.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","228.0","208.0","10.0","302.0","0.0","25.0","0","932","94.70","62.23","38.92","78.78","25.19","17.38","77.15","46.57","9.55","6.01","2.36","0.54","0.00","1.39","1.72","3.54","8.05","17.81","4.83","3.00","5.79","0.54","11.48","4.61","2.90","0.97","3.97","2.58","4.51","3.65","0.75","0.11","0.32","0.00","7.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.50","8.37","1.72","0.86","1.61","1.50","0.97","2.15","2.58","1.39","0.64","0.43","1.18","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.86","8.58","3.33","2.79","3.22","1.93","0.43","6.01","3.65","1.18","16.09","1.93","8.48","6.33","2.58","3.11","0.32","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.52","3.97","4.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.54","1.50","0.97","1.72","0.21","4111","7.52","26.885714285714286","1248","927","37","71.38","11.0","9.5","9.75","12.8","155","26.0","18.728241639697952","448","23.51","25","0.44","0","23","32","92","0","140","39","2","2","14","126","141","1","48","0","0","49","12","34","0","0","6","30","0","31","62","18","13","6","6","4","2","0","6"

Duluth is one of eight cities scheduled as experimental sites for the program.

News Tribune, April 16, 1994

* A decision isn’t expected for several weeks on the impending sale of Cobb and Lakeside school buildings, school officials said yesterday. Staff will review the bids, and the final decision will be made by School Board members at a special meeting.

* Three inmates from the Duluth Federal Prison Camp were in Ironworld yesterday to talk to ninth-graders from Chisholm and Hibbing about mistakes they have made in their lives. It was part of the “Teens, Crime and the Community” program that started in January.

"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/europe-enhances-weiks-confidence-cyclocross","Europe enhances Weik's confidence in cyclocross","The tale of tape and scale affirmed their suspicions: The 17-year-old from Wrenshall grew just over an inch and put on about nine pounds.

""I'm growing into my adult body,"" the now 5-foot-10, 130-pound Weik said with pride last week.

He now casts a longer shadow and there's more muscle to propel his bike through challenging courses, but his stature also has increased within cyclocross circles. And Weik hopes that growth spurt continues.

""People know who he is now,"" said his dad, Matt, who accompanied Josey for part of his recent trip and saw him interact with cyclocross-crazed Europeans. ""There's a whole different level of competition over there.

""He's 130 pounds, and it's all about power-to-weight ratio. The thing that holds him back the most in cyclocross is he doesn't have a huge amount of massive muscle to give a big sprint. But when the courses are really really hard, he has huge amounts of endurance. He can go super hard and longer than most. And he can ride a bike technically better than most.""

Which is important considering the challenges a cyclocross course can present.

""The (courses) really twist and turn and have obstacles,"" Josey Weik said. ""There are a variety of surfaces depending on the time of year and the course. There are barriers on the courses, which are hurdles that are about 25-40 centimeters high.

""For those, you either have to get off your bike and run over them or hop them. There are also staircases that you have to run up. Sometimes there are run-ups that are just so steep and slippery that you can't ride up them, you have to run up them.""

Weik represented his Red Zone Cycling team well in Europe. He placed as high as 19th in one race, but he's most proud of a 21st-place finish he claimed at a World Cup stop with precious few American juniors (17- to 18-year-olds) in the field.

""There's something special about wearing the stars and stripes,"" he said.

Weik didn't have long to reflect on his accomplishments before returning to Europe last week to take part in EuroCrossCamp, which is designed to prepare young U.S. riders to compete with the world's top athletes. Weik and his fellow countrymen will compete in five races in two weeks. Last year he was the youngest rider ever invited to EuroCrossCamp.

Now he's hoping for another invitation... to compete at next year's cyclocross world championships as a member of the U.S. junior men's team. There are only five spots available, but he sees his competition every day at EuroCrossCamp and is learning where he ranks.

""We're all such good friends, but we're all very competitive,"" Weik said. ""We're all fighting for U.S. team spots. This will be a great opportunity to show how I stack up against them.""

Once he returns from Europe on Jan. 2, Weik won't have to wait long to find out if he made the American team. The USA Cycling Cyclocross National Championships are set for Jan. 8-12 in Boulder, Colo., and the winner receives an automatic spot on the team. The other spots will be chosen.

""There's seven or eight kids, and any one of them could take nationals,"" Matt Weik said.

""It's very tight this year,"" said Josey Weik.

But, for now, Weik is focused on the EuroCrossCamp races and rising in the U.S. junior pecking order.

""There's a ton of competition, but I'm very confident going into these races,"" he said. ""It's time to get results. This is where my total focus is.""

Throughout her life, Gerri was known as a talker, and befriended many people along the way. She could be found chatting with her friends and sipping coffee. For many years she and her family resided in Morgan Park, and it was common knowledge that she knew every family in the neighborhood, which houses they lived in, and who they were related to from the area. Besides being a caring mother and friend, she held a variety of jobs including working for the telephone company, Glassblock Department Store, Shoes 'n Things, Dr. LeVasser's Dentist Office, and Thrun Trucking. In her spare time, she loved bowling, and could dance the jitterbug like none other.

Over the years, Gerri enjoyed a variety of pastimes. Gerri was a skilled knitter, and her beautiful baby sweaters were sought after by family, friends, and church bazaar shoppers. At Christmas her family could count on a new supply of dishcloths, hats, and mittens made from the heart. Additionally, Gerri was the best baker that grandkids could ever ask for in a grandma. Her chocolate chip cookies, Christmas cookies, pumpkin bars, and white cake with chocolate frosting were in high demand. In the summer, her potato salad was a centerpiece on the barbeque menu, and nobody could make it as delicious. She was also a collector, driving from one end of Duluth to the other in pursuit of Hummels, teapots and Beanie Babies. Gerri gallivanted all over town, and loved treating her grandkids to chocolate frosted doughnuts, trips to Coney Island, and visits with her friends.

Gerri was a member of St. Margaret Mary Catholic Church, and her services will be held there on Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2014.

She is preceded in death by her daughter, Barbie (Benson) Fedorowski; parents; sisters, Nora and Orella; and brother Toby.

"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/racist-letter-shows-need-anti-racism-efforts","Racist letter shows the need for anti-racism efforts","Inside a nondescript, business-sized envelope were three news clippings that I read, read again and then just let drop onto my desk. I was that stunned and shocked. Shaking away disbelief, I picked up the clippings and read them a third time, fixated not so much on the news stories as on the handwritten comments someone added in the margins and then mailed in -- as though the News Tribune would ever consider publishing them as a letter to the editor.

""Baboons"" was the first handwritten word that jumped out at me. The story was about Tuskegee Airman Joe Gomer of Duluth. The headline referred to ""honoring our veteran pilots."" The word ""honoring"" was underlined twice with a question mark added after it. After that, a hand-scrawled ""Baboons"" was followed by two more question marks, leaving the impression of a query made with alarm: Honoring baboons? Why in the world?

And here I always considered the Tuskegee Airmen heroes.

""Read the Bible,"" I was urged. A citation to the Book of Mormon was included: the Second Book of Nephi, Chapter 5. I looked it up -- and was able to determine pretty quickly that its suggestion that people of color were ""cut off from the presence of the Lord"" was long ago and quite soundly debunked as a too literal misinterpretation. Apparently not in the minds of everyone.

A second clip was about the annual Clayton Jackson McGhie remembrance ceremony. ""Remembering a tragedy,"" read this headline, a reference to the sad day in 1920 when three black circus workers were lynched in downtown Duluth for a crime they didn't commit. On the clipping, ""tragedy"" was scribbled out and ""True Blessing!"" was added in its place. Lynching victims Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson and Isaac McGhie were identified with arrows as ""Saten's children"" (sic).

You see why I was so stunned?

The third clip -- and, thankfully, the final clip in the envelope -- included a picture of Rodney King, whose videotaped beating by Los Angeles police in 1991 sparked a national outrage. Written in red ink over his picture was, ""Now, a good baboon!"" ""Good"" was underlined twice.

The envelope included only a first initial, a last name and the name of a Northland city in the space normally used for a return address. I won't divulge the names for fear of erroneously associating anyone or anyplace with such hatred. I did use the names to do some online research and to make some calls, but I wasn't able to identify the writer. He or she easily could have been using false names.

The postmark on the envelope, however, was stamped ""Duluth."" Sadly, the letter was mailed locally.

In January, before the controversial Un-Fair Campaign launched, one of its leaders, Ellen O'Neill, said, ""The purpose of the campaign is to open a dialogue.""

""A praiseworthy purpose,"" I wrote for an editorial in Thursday's paper. A dialogue and more are needed. That seemed apparent even before yesterday's mail was ripped open.

""Racism and what's causing it in our community demands to be discussed, debated and then taken on, with a united, communitywide front,"" I wrote in the editorial.

Unfortunately, the dialogue Duluth needs to have has gotten bogged down by confrontation and defensiveness. The campaign's 18 partners created a subcommittee this week to re-evaluate how it was delivering its message and how it was attempting to open dialogue. The partners are scheduled to meet again July 17, hopefully to decide on a new, more-engaging and more-effective approach.

Can they meet sooner? Please?

On the Tuskegee Airman clipping, next to a picture of Joe Gomer as he looked during World War II, the anonymous letter-mailer wrote, ""We will never buy another heathen paper like yours again."" ""Never"" was underlined twice.

Good. And you can consider that underlined twice, too.

"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/above-average-guy-left-his-mark","Above 'average guy' left his mark","A self-proclaimed “average guy,” Jon Donahue crafted a long-running sports talk show around that premise — “The Average Guys.” Donahue and co-host Kenny Kalligher kibitzed about all things sports and developed a Twin Ports following in the process.

But for as much as Donahue embraced the word “average,” most people who knew him would argue that Jonny D was anything but average.

The lifelong Duluthian left an indelible mark on his family, friends and acquaintances before passing away late Saturday night following a two-year battle with cancer. He was only 49 years old.

Donahue was one of the first people I met when I moved here in the late ’90s, when all I knew about Duluth was that it was north of the Twin Cities and overlooked a giant freshwater lake. He welcomed a transplant into his community like an old friend blowing into town for a visit.

Forging and maintaining friendships is difficult for most of us — especially men — but Donahue could build a bond with just a handshake, a smile and an encouraging word or two. His ever-present enthusiasm spread to everyone around him.

No matter how much time passed between meetings, our conversations invariably returned to a pair of his favorite topics: Baseball and music.

He wasn’t a Detroit Tigers fan, per se, but he loved baseball with a passion and we often chatted about the 1984 World Series champion Tigers and their iconic players that I lionized as a youngster — Jack Morris, Kirk Gibson, Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker.

When the conversation drifted to music, the Canadian power trio Rush dominated the discussion. It’s impossible for me to hear Rush tunes such as “Spirit of Radio,” “Tom Sawyer,” “Fly By Night” or “Limelight” without thinking of Jonny D.

But Donahue will be remembered for much more than just his love of music, sports and “The Average Guys,” which debuted on PACT-TV on Christmas Day 1998. Episode No. 575 — Donahue’s final episode — was taped on Aug. 22, 2013.

He held firmly to a strong Christian faith and was a devoted husband and father, as well as a fixture in the Piedmont Heights community where his weekend campfires were a favorite gathering place. He was a member of the city’s Alcohol, Gambling and Tobacco Commission and even ran for mayor of Duluth and the Duluth School Board.

He helped his wife, Lisa, through her own battle with cancer and even threw a party in July 2012 to mark the five-year anniversary of her remission from the disease.

A month later, it was Lisa providing the loving care for her husband, who was struck with gliosarcoma, a cancer of the brain, and a stroke that paralyzed the left side of his body during the six-hour surgery in which doctors removed a softball-sized tumor from the right side of his brain.

But as destructive as the cancer was, it couldn’t curb his love of life. His concernswere chiefly focused on his wife and school-age children — Alyssa, Jacob and Tyler.

“I was either going to let the cancer control me, or I was going to take control of the situation,” Donahue told the News Tribune later that year. “I was not going to live in fear, I was just going to make the most of the time I have — however long that may be — and just enjoy every moment.”

Donahue did just that. He fought back his cancer with vigor and enjoyed his own period of remission and improved mobility. The Duluth community rallied around him, turning out in droves to a benefit hosted by Mr. D’s.

Sadly, that remission was brief. The cancer eventually returned and did not let go.

But the lessons Donahue taught so many people during his courageous battle will remain with them:

That faith can carry families and friends through difficult times, no matter the outcome.

That life is short, and that every day should be greeted with a smile, much laughter and eyes open to every possibility.

That friendships are priceless and one of life’s purest joys.

That humbleness doesn’t always hide someone’s greatness.

Jonny D was anything but average.

To anyone who met him, that word carried a much different definition.","2014-09-16 18:13:16","0","52.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","12.0","0.0","154.0","159.0","0.0","265.0","20.0","32.0","12","706","81.53","77.78","14.26","73.39","19.61","21.25","81.30","47.17","10.76","6.52","1.56","0.42","0.00","4.25","0.28","4.25","8.78","12.61","5.67","4.11","7.51","1.27","10.76","5.24","2.83","1.42","1.98","3.26","5.67","4.11","1.56","0.14","0.99","0.14","12.75","0.99","0.99","0.71","4.82","7.93","0.85","0.71","0.71","1.84","1.56","2.69","1.42","0.28","0.99","0.14","3.54","0.57","2.41","0.14","0.14","7.79","4.39","0.57","2.12","0.42","0.57","5.38","2.83","1.13","14.45","3.26","5.10","6.37","1.13","2.41","0.28","0.28","0.71","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","16.15","5.24","4.96","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.42","2.83","1.42","0.00","0.00","3208","7.66","22.34375","989","705","34","67.38","11.1","9.0","10.5","11.5","134","6.333333333333333","17.882836879432627","379","19.94","17","0.46","0","40","13","73","0","81","40","1","3","7","128","83","0","28","0","0","30","20","34","0","0","2","13","0","19","55","11","8","8","7","3","3","0","5"

"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/archbishop-nienstedt-wont-resign-vows-make-changes-0","Archbishop Nienstedt won’t resign, vows to make changes","Nienstedt has come under fire in recent months for his handling of clergy sex abuse cases.

“I have acknowledged my responsibility in the current crisis we face, and I also take responsibility for leading our archdiocese to a new and better day,” Nienstedt wrote in a column to be published in Thursday’s Catholic Spirit newsletter.

That “crisis” is the result of accusations and lawsuits against the archdiocese, church officials and priests regarding alleged child abuse and what some have called cover-up of crimes. Critics say Nienstedt and his predecessors did not take action to remove credibly accused priests from the ministry.

Nienstedt said he will not resign and will, instead, “apply these hard lessons that I have learned over the past months.”

The archbishop said he is creating “a new leadership team that operates under the philosophy of ‘Victims First’ ” and that he’s appointing a victim liaison. Nienstedt said the church has reached out to victims of abuse for their input.

He conceded that “we did not handle all complaints the way we should have in the past,” but said the archdiocese is trying to remain transparent and to create safe environments for children.

Nienstedt’s column also addresses an investigation he requested into claims that he had past inappropriate sexual relationships or contact with other men — something he has denied. He said he expects to be vindicated.

He apologized for his “administrative and personal style, with its strong point of view,” which he said may have offended and hurt people, and vowed a softer approach.

“The last year has helped me realize I need to change my administrative style, soften my words, and get out from behind the desk to spend more time with the faithful,” he wrote.

He closed by vowing to regain people’s trust.

“The challenges are there, to be sure, but we are more ready to tackle them now than at any time in our past history,” he wrote. “I know that we are making progress and there is a momentum to that. Still there is more to be done.”

Nienstedt gave interviews to some local media Wednesday.

His father, Dean, was an 18-year member of the Brooklyn Park (Minn.) Police Department.

Warneke, a Zumbrota, Minn., native, earned a bachelor's degree from Minnesota State University, Mankato. Before coming to Duluth, he worked as a police officer in Kenyon, Minn.

Sixth Judicial District Chief Judge Shaun Floerke administered the oath to the new officers.

Duluth Police Chief Gordon Ramsay said the department is still about eight officers short, but he expects more to be hired in the coming months.

In the meantime, he said he expects the new hires to be old hands someday on the Duluth force.

""They'll be here for many years to come,"" he said.

"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/doyle-signs-bill-protecting-wisconsin-water-resources","Doyle signs bill protecting Wisconsin water resources","Gov. Jim Doyle signed the bills to ""protect, improve and preserve Wisconsin's natural resources,"" according to a statement released by his office.

At a ceremony at Totogatic County Park, Doyle signed a measure written by Rep. Nick Milroy, D-Superior, designating the free-flowing reaches of the Totogatic River a State Wild River.

""By adding the Totogatic to our Wild River program, we are ensuring that the natural beauty and unique recreation value of the river is protected, preserved and improved for generations to come,"" the governor said in his prepared remarks. ""In this state, our natural resources are not just a part of our landscape, they're a part of who we are.""

The Totogatic River flows for 70 miles through five counties. Under the new designation, natural obstructions can be removed in the uppermost reach to maintain steady water levels and protect wild rice growth on Totogatic Lake.

Doyle also announced more than $22,000 in River Protection Grant money to Washburn County to further protect the Totogatic River.

Washburn County and local conservation groups were instrumental in the early stages of the effort in designating the Totogatic a wild river.

Doyle also signed a Senate bill that establishes a slow-no-wake restriction for all motorboats that are not personal watercraft when operating within 100 feet of the shoreline of all lakes. Previously, motorboats could not operate at greater than slow-no-wake speed within 100 feet of a dock, raft or pier. The new law also seeks to reduce noise pollution in near-shore areas.

Lakes in Wisconsin also are to benefit under the law, which will extend protection of animals and plants on the near-shore areas. It also will address erosion. The law goes into effect next spring.

In his visit to the area, Doyle also toured the bridge project on State Highway 35 near eastbound County Highway C, just south of Superior. The project, paid for by federal stimulus money, has put 20 people to work.

He also stopped by the Shack Smokehouse & Grille in Superior to praise the owners' decision to go smoke-free a year before a statewide smoking ban takes effect.

Doyle's visit and Shelley Nelson's interview with him on DNTV at www.duluthnews.tv.","2014-02-21 19:42:10","0","39.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","8.0","0.0","158.0","159.0","0.0","260.0","20.0","31.0","12","378","98.47","65.44","37.24","82.57","18.00","24.07","72.22","40.74","4.50","2.65","0.00","1.32","0.00","1.32","0.00","1.85","9.52","16.93","3.70","2.65","4.23","1.32","6.88","5.29","1.85","0.79","2.12","1.85","3.44","3.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.32","3.70","1.06","0.79","0.26","0.26","0.53","1.59","1.85","0.79","0.79","0.00","2.91","1.06","0.53","0.00","1.32","8.47","1.59","1.32","2.91","0.79","1.85","1.59","4.50","0.79","17.99","3.17","11.64","3.70","4.76","0.79","0.26","1.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.93","6.08","5.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.38","1.59","1.32","0.00","0.53","1784","8.18","18.95","557","365","20","61.36","11.9","9.2","12.36","11.8","84","10.8","18.525479452054793","216","17.3","3","0.4","1","8","8","41","0","51","23","2","0","4","61","58","0","23","0","0","6","6","15","1","0","0","13","0","18","8","5","7","7","9","3","1","0","1"
"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/defeated-foe-says-bulldogs-can-win-it-all","Defeated foe says Bulldogs can win it all","""When you get clobbered like this, the turning point of the game was when they got off the bus,"" Luckhardt quipped in postgame interviews, shortly after the No. 6 Bulldogs (14-0) stunned most of the 3,200 spectators -- and delighted about 160 UMD fans -- at Adamson Stadium in California, Pa.

He likes UMD's chances against No. 3 Northwest Missouri State (13-1) when the Division II national title is played at noon Saturday in Florence, Ala. ESPN2 will broadcast the game, and there will be live blog coverage at duluthnewstribune.com.

""These guys have a [heck] of a chance, I think, of winning the thing because they can run it and they can throw it. ... [plus] the stout defense that they have.""

Luckhardt didn't know too much about the Bulldogs before the game, because the two teams had no history or common opponents. But the Vulcan coaches and players received a painful crash course in Bulldogs 101.

""They do remind me of a good [University of] Wisconsin team, where they are extremely strong and physical at the line of scrimmage and very tenacious. They like to spread you out and run the ball,"" Luckhardt said. ""They do a great job in their blitz game of identifying your protections and then countering them. We knew that going in. That's probably one of the great strengths they have in their defense. They like to be aggressive, first and foremost.

""They control both sides of the line of scrimmage very well.""

The Bulldogs pummeled the No. 7 Vulcans (12-2) for 310 rushing yards and another 141 passing. Sophomore running back Isaac Odim led the way with 126 yards rushing and four touchdowns (three rushing and one receiving). Sophomore running back Brad Foss added 94 yards on the ground and a touchdown, while senior quarterback Ted Schlafke carried the ball 14 times for 67 yards and went 12-for-21 for 141 yards and two touchdown passes (one to Odim and another to senior wide receiver Tony Doherty).

Minnesota Duluth proved just as dominating on defense, holding the talented Vulcan skill players -- wide receivers Marcel Pestano and AJ Jackson, quarterback Kevin McCabe and running back Daine Williams -- in check. McCabe went 17-for-36 for 171 yards, but was sacked twice and threw three picks. He was only able to connect with Jackson for a third-quarter TD long after the game had been decided. Williams mustered only 56 yards on 20 carries.

""I wish we would have played better, but I'm not sure if we would have played our best that [it] would have been good enough today, to be honest with you,"" said Luckhardt, who added that UMD was the best team California had played in his seven years as coach.

UMD coach Bob Nielson and the Bulldogs hope another opposing coach is singing their praises this weekend in Florence, Ala.

""From day one, people have asked me, 'How good is this team?,' and I just keep saying, 'It's going to take an awfully good team to beat us.' Obviously, we're going to play an awfully good team next week. We'll find out.""","2014-03-07 19:12:18","1","39.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","155.0","159.0","0.0","256.0","17.0","32.0","12","523","74.50","79.98","30.70","91.26","18.03","21.22","76.10","45.32","10.13","6.69","1.15","1.34","0.76","0.57","2.87","3.44","6.69","11.66","7.07","4.21","7.07","1.15","14.72","3.82","1.91","1.15","8.22","1.53","6.88","5.35","1.34","0.00","0.57","0.00","10.33","0.19","0.19","0.00","0.96","6.12","1.34","1.15","1.15","1.15","0.76","1.53","1.53","0.00","0.76","0.76","0.57","0.00","0.57","0.00","0.00","10.33","3.44","3.06","2.68","3.25","0.76","5.16","7.27","1.72","15.68","4.59","6.88","5.35","2.87","5.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","22.75","6.31","5.16","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","3.06","2.49","2.10","1.91","1.53","2334","7.04","19.62962962962963","683","513","30","79.5","9.6","6.4","10.38","9.8","83","7.083333333333334","15.311734892787525","296","17.81","12","0.43","0","26","37","46","0","56","27","0","4","7","61","61","0","29","0","0","33","6","22","1","0","3","9","0","19","25","17","11","17","7","0","1","0","4"

"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/federal-money-makes-minnesota-deficit-smaller-3","Federal money makes Minnesota deficit smaller","The deficit now is expected to be $4.57 billion in the two years beginning July 1 -- out of a $33 billion budget -- instead of the previously predicted $4.85 billion. Without the federally approved economic recovery money, however, the deficit would be $6.4 billion, according to budget documents leaked to reporters before this morning's official announcement.

Gov. Tim Pawlenty and other state leaders had predicted the deficit would be at least $6 billion, and could top $7 billion.

Federal money should mean the current budget will not go into the red, and a couple of million dollars could be left over in the state budget reserve, state finance officials are expected to announce.

State officials continue to figure out how they can use federal money, passed last month as a way to stimulate the nation's economy. Strings attached to the money have not all been sorted out.

Even with a smaller-than expected deficit, state officials have their work cut out for them. The $4.57 billion deficit means they have to either cut spending, raise taxes or do a combination of both. Even in past down economic times, state budgets have increased, not actually shrunk.","2014-03-07 20:12:22","0","33.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","159.0","159.0","0.0","258.0","21.0","31.0","12","194","93.78","30.30","40.70","18.20","19.40","29.90","80.93","44.33","3.09","2.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.06","1.03","8.76","14.95","10.31","3.61","3.61","2.06","13.40","4.64","3.61","0.52","8.76","2.58","1.55","0.52","1.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.58","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.40","1.55","1.55","4.12","0.52","0.52","5.67","1.03","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.19","0.00","2.06","5.15","0.00","0.00","3.09","10.31","3.09","16.49","1.55","8.25","6.70","4.64","0.00","0.00","8.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.04","5.15","5.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.58","0.00","1.03","0.00","3.61","931","8.1","20.0","295","193","11","62.17","12.1","8.9","11.83","11.2","44","6.75","18.11917098445596","124","18.6","0","0.4","0","4","21","21","0","17","10","1","1","7","33","8","0","11","0","0","3","1","10","0","0","4","8","0","14","2","2","12","6","3","0","0","0","1"
"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/rick-lubbers-column-retreats-require-some-work-relax","Rick Lubbers column: Retreats require some work to relax","But no matter what does or doesn't get shoved into my duffel bag, I absolutely can't forget to pack a sports almanac or else I'll be defenseless against my friends' constant barrage of sports questions while we're listening to '80s music, swapping high school war stories and otherwise reliving our youth.

Twenty years ago I felt honored to be the sports guru inside my circle of friends. If they shot me a sports-related question, more often than not I could oblige. Of course, back then my brain was still a sponge and nearly every fact I came across stuck to my gray matter like Super Glue.

I could look at the back of a baseball card and the stats stayed with me for years. I could recall all of the scores from a highlight show on command.

Now I can't remember the Twins score from last night.

I know that's just part of getting older, so I've been cramming harder than for any exam I took in college, and I'm not ashamed to use a cheat sheet if I have to. (Uh, just for the record, I never used one in college). But I can't let my reputation get too sullied.

This weekend I'll be staying on Lake Huron's Bois Blanc Island, within sight of the Mackinac Bridge. We won't exactly be roughing it. We'll be staying in a house with running water, electricity and a fridge stuffed with meat and beverages, but sans computers and smart phones, so sports-related information won't be at my fingertips.

Still, one nice thing about these yearly reunions is that the conversations are somewhat predictable. We'll debate many of the same things we did a couple of decades ago:

-- Who's the better guitarist -- Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton or Eddie Van Halen? (It's Slowhand, for my money.)

-- Who's the top NFL running back of all time? (Most will say Detroit Lions great Barry Sanders.)

-- Who was the hottest girl in our high school? (This will probably be the most heated debate. It could get ugly.)

-- What is the meaning of ANY Duran Duran song? (Still a mystery.)

-- Favorite ""Star Wars"" character? (It's a coin flip between Han Solo and Darth Vader.)

-- Ginger or Mary Ann? (Obviously, Mary Ann.)

The debatable conversations or trivial issues I can handle. It's the chats that require actual numbers that scare me now. Sometime during the past couple of decades, my mind stopped recording numerical data. It's the weirdest thing.

I can remember who the lead singer of Wang Chung is (Jack Hues), but for the life of me I can't recall what Joe Mauer's batting average was last year (.287, according to MLB.com). Want to know the second video ever played on MTV? That's easy, it was Pat Benatar's ""You Better Run."" But I couldn't conjure the jersey number of Minnesota Vikings sack master Jared Allen if you spotted me one or two of the numerals. (I've just been told it's No. 69.)

So, armed only with a fuzzy memory for numbers and no Internet, I could be in trouble this weekend. That sports almanac better be thick.

Fortunately, the sports stats-related inquiries will be just as predictable as our other talks.

-- How many yards and TDs did Detroit Lions QB Matthew Stafford throw for last season? (5,038 and 41, respectively)

-- What's Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s boxing record? (43-0)

-- What was Kansas City Royals star George Brett's batting average in 1980? (.390)

-- What was Michael Jordan's career scoring average? (30.1 points per game)

-- How many goals did Detroit Red Wings great Steve Yzerman score? (692)

"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/nebraska-omaha-halts-umd-win-streak","Nebraska-Omaha halts UMD win streak","UMD’s short-lived, nation-leading six-game winning streak fell short of a historic seventh win Saturday in a 4-1 loss in NCHC play at CenturyLink Center.

The Bulldogs haven’t won seven consecutive games since 2011. Meanwhile, Saturday’s loss also signaled the end of six consecutive wins in series finales on Saturday or Sunday since the start of the season.

In Friday’s opener, the Bulldogs scored three unanswered goals to rally from a 2-0 second-intermission deficit. On Saturday, it was the Mavericks scoring three unanswered goals in the first and second periods after giving up the first goal to UMD. The Mavericks added a fourth goal in the final minute of play with the Bulldog net empty.

“Derek said, ‘We probably won the game we shouldn’t have won and probably lost the game we should have won,’ ” said UMD coach Scott Sandelin, quoting assistant coach Derek Plante. “Give them credit too. They battled and were opportunistic just like we were last night.”

Duluth native and freshman wing Jake Randolph set up the Mavs’ first score with a pass from behind the net to freshman wing Tyler Vesel, who easily skated to the front of the net unmarked while UMD’s skaters were fixated on Randolph.

Sophomore wing Austin Ortega, who also assisted on Vesel’s goal and recorded the empty-netter, found an easy yet different path to the top of the UMD crease just under two and a half minutes later to put the Mavericks on top by a goal. In the second period, he helped extend the Mavs’ lead to 3-1 by finding sophomore forward Jake Guentzel alone up the ice for a breakaway.

Guentzel, who had missed three-straight games prior to Omaha’s bye last weekend, beat Bulldogs freshman goaltender Kasimir Kaskisuo one-on-one with a backhander to the top shelf.

“There were just a couple good chances we gave them and they capitalized,” UMD sophomore center Dominic Toninato said. “That’s what good teams do, they score on your mistakes.”

UMD sophomore wing Kyle Osterberg tallied the first goal of the game after goaltender Ryan Messa stopped the two initial shots thrown his way by Osterberg and UMD junior wing Tony Cameranesi, but not Osterberg’s second attempt.

Osterberg’s goal was one of a plethora of scoring chances for the Bulldogs in the first period, along with junior forward Cal Decowski’s shot to Massa’s left that failed to land on net despite Decowski — the hero in Friday’s come-from-behind win — having what seemed like minutes to fire the puck.

UMD sophomore defenseman Willie Raskob also hit the post on a power play midway through the first period that would have given UMD a 2-0 lead. Instead it turned into a three-goal swing in favor of the Mavericks, who were outshot 16-5 in the first 20 minutes.

Four of the Bulldogs’ 16 first-period shots on goal came on the lone power-play chance with Raskob’s shot not counting as “on goal” since it hit the post.

In the third period, UMD outshot Omaha 13-3 with junior wing Austyn Young getting turned away twice in less than a minute. Cameranesi also was able to redirect a shot from the point on a power play late in the third, but Massa was there to stop that, too.

“We didn’t play poorly, we just couldn’t find a way to score,” Sandelin said.

Massa stopped 39 of 40 shots for the Mavericks in what was only their second NCHC series of the season. Kaskisuo made 14 saves on 17 shots for UMD, allowing more than two goals for the first time since giving up three to Miami in Duluth on Nov. 1.

“They played a very good defensive game all around,” Toninato said. “They had some good chances and they were stopping the puck.

“Overall it was a pretty good weekend, but we would have liked to get two (wins) absolutely.”

"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/senate-plan-would-raise-all-income-taxes-3","Senate plan would raise all income taxes","Higher income taxes are the key to the Democratic-Farmer-Labor controlled Senate plan that raises taxes $2 billion all told.

Today's announcement sets up a three-way tax battle with the House and Gov. Tim Pawlenty.

The DFL-controlled House on Monday begin looking at a plan that keeps all income taxes the same except for couples who earn more than $300,000. They would pay 9 percent of their income in taxes. The House bill also would raise tobacco and alcohol taxes.

""It's bad enough that Democrats propose giving Minnesota one of the highest income tax rates in the nation and raising taxes on someone having a beer or a glass of wine,"" Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung said. ""But they really go over the cliff when they propose to increase taxes for child care or for donating an organ.""

Republican Pawlenty continues to say he will not accept a state tax increase. However, he does add revenue to his budget proposal by borrowing $1 billion.

The Senate plan raises the lowest income tax rate from 5.3 percent to 6 percent. Middle-income Minnesotans now pay 7.05 percent of their income in taxes, but under the Senate plan it would rise to 7.7 percent. The former upper bracket taxpayers' rates rise from 7.85 percent to 8.5 percent.

The Senate's proposed tax increases would run through 2013.

It also allows Cook County to use its existing local sales tax for more uses than one community center and allows the Seaway Port Authority of Duluth to levy a property tax up to 0.01813 percent. It also allows Cloquet and Perch Lake Township to levy a property tax up to 0.2835 percent of taxable market value.

Also, the bill eliminates truth in taxation hearings that local governments now are required to hold, giving the public a chance to comment on budget decisions.","2014-02-21 19:12:10","1","37.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","161.0","159.0","0.0","259.0","21.0","31.0","12","310","96.81","61.44","12.83","43.39","18.24","20.00","79.03","38.06","6.13","2.58","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.97","1.61","3.55","8.39","14.52","3.23","2.90","4.84","0.32","8.39","3.55","3.23","0.65","6.13","4.52","2.90","1.94","0.97","0.00","0.32","0.32","6.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.97","9.03","0.65","2.26","1.29","1.29","0.97","3.23","1.29","0.32","0.97","0.00","1.29","0.00","0.32","0.00","1.29","9.68","0.32","1.94","7.10","0.65","0.32","1.29","5.48","1.61","12.58","2.26","8.39","2.58","10.65","1.29","0.97","11.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.58","5.48","1.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.61","1.29","1.29","0.00","0.97","1421","8.03","18.823529411764707","447","304","20","64.51","9.8","8.0","10.43","9.2","70","7.25","17.290526315789474","184","17.65","1","0.36","0","9","26","28","1","29","10","3","2","5","62","32","2","18","0","0","9","4","13","0","0","1","14","0","14","4","8","2","8","11","3","1","0","1"
"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/senate-dfl-proposes-cuts-2-billion-tax-hike-5","Senate DFL proposes cuts, $2 billion tax hike","Senate leaders announced their budget-balancing plans this afternoon, cutting every segment for a total of $2.4 billion. They include a $1 billion education cut, compared to Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty's proposal to spare public school education from budget cuts needed to fill a deficit.

While the Democratic leaders say they would take roughly equal amounts of new taxes and program cuts to balance the budget, they have yet to figure out where to put about $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money. Given that, Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, said education cuts may end up being moderated once details of how the state can spend the federal money are unraveled.

The state's $33 billion two-year budget would be $6.4 billion short without cuts, new taxes and federal money. Pawlenty figures the federal money into his budget and calls the deficit $4.6 billion.

After weeks of speculation in the Capitol, Senate leaders revealed their target for tax increases will be top-income Minnesotans.

Senate Tax Chairman Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said that is where he plans to start as he crafts a tax bill. He said whatever comes from new taxes ""a lion's share"" will be assessed to the rich.

Bakk said he would like to freeze the amount of money the state gives local governments at a time when most policymakers are calling for a cut in local government aid.

Republican senators said they were not consulted about the proposal. They called tax increases job killers.

Senate committees are to begin taking up the budget plan in the coming days, putting details on the outline released today.","2014-02-21 18:42:10","1","36.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","162.0","159.0","0.0","259.0","21.0","31.0","12","271","95.28","82.19","11.05","25.77","19.36","25.09","80.07","36.90","5.90","4.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.85","2.58","1.48","8.12","12.92","6.27","2.58","2.58","0.74","12.55","4.06","2.21","1.85","5.17","2.95","2.21","1.11","1.11","0.00","0.37","0.00","10.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.85","5.54","1.11","0.74","1.48","0.74","0.74","0.74","3.32","0.37","2.21","0.37","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.37","9.96","0.37","2.95","7.75","0.74","0.00","3.32","7.01","2.58","15.13","2.21","6.64","6.27","9.96","0.37","0.00","8.49","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.13","5.17","4.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.85","0.74","1.11","0.00","2.21","1303","7.96","19.785714285714285","406","266","15","61.97","11.6","9.0","12.12","11.6","58","10.8","17.801804511278196","163","18.79","2","0.35","0","3","16","25","0","24","17","0","1","7","49","26","0","23","0","0","9","3","4","0","0","3","10","0","15","11","5","8","6","7","1","0","0","4"
"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/shouting-ends-deficit-session-10","Shouting ends deficit session","Legislators failed to reach a deal with Gov. Tim Pawlenty, but the Republican governor said he will finish the job.

The normally staid Senate adjourned for the year moments after its midnight deadline with Republicans shouting to be allowed to talk about a hastily introduced tax bill.

Minutes before adjournment, Sen. Paul Koering, R-Fort Ripley, stood next to his desk in the front of the Senate chamber and shouted to Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, near the back: ""Sen. Pogemiller, can you do something about this? This is really ridiculous.""

""Never have I seen anything like this,"" added the usually quiet Senate Minority Leader Dave Senjem, R-Rochester. ""This is not the way Minnesota governs.""

They were complaining that Senate President Jim Metzen, DFL-South St. Paul, refused to call on Republicans who wanted to discuss the bill that would raise taxes $1 billion and delay $1.7 billion in school payments. Pogemiller had instructed Metzen to rush through the proceedings so the bill's vote would occur before the midnight constitutional deadline for the Legislature to adjourn.

At one point, Metzen ignored the pleas of seven Republicans who stood, seeking to talk during a 16-minute debate on the bill.

""We are a disgrace to the state of Minnesota,"" Senjem shouted.

The last-minute flurry of activity -- before adjourning until noon Feb. 4, 2010 -- failed to nail down an overall state budget agreement. In the coming weeks, Pawlenty expects to chop $2.7 billion of spending to bring it in line with expected state revenues.

Those pending cuts left many questions for local government officials, school leaders and people who depend upon state-funded health programs, all whom could see state funds shrink.

Democrats wrote their last-minute tax bill to ease spending cuts Pawlenty would make.

The alcohol tax and income taxes on wealthy Minnesotans would be increased.

""It closes the deal, balances the budget and protects our priorities,"" said Rep. Paul Marquart, DFL-Dilworth, as the bill was rushed from a conference committee to the House floor.

Representatives started debating the bill at 11:29 p.m. Republicans said Democrats were cramming a $1 billion tax increase through the legislative process without the usual consideration given major tax bills.

""There's nothing they're saying that isn't true,"" House Tax Chairwoman Ann Lenczewski, DFL-Bloomington, could be heard telling fellow Democrats seated near her in the chamber.

The GOP minority attempted to block the vote and Rep. Torrey Westrom, R-Elbow Lake, unsuccessfully tried to end the session before a vote was taken.

Over Republican objections, House Democrats breezed through floor procedures, limited debate and called for a vote before midnight. The bill passed 82-47 and was sent to the Senate, where the vote was 35-1 in a 67-person chamber. Republicans refused to vote.

""This bill was slipped together quickly,"" House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall.

Legislators ended their work for the year at 12:01 a.m.

Neither Lenczewski nor Senate Taxes Chairman Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, voted for the tax bill.

Pawlenty said the Democratic-controlled Legislature failed to do its job.

""The basic responsibility of the Legislature is to responsibly pass a balanced budget and the DFL failed,"" Pawlenty said. ""They spent $34 billion when they only had $31 billion available.""

Democrats, on the other hand, said that with their last-minute tax bill they actually did pass a balanced-budget proposal. They bridged the gap with higher taxes and the school payment delay, even though it was clear Pawlenty would not accept the bill.

Sen. Rod Skoe, DFL-Clearbrook, a tax committee negotiator, said lawmakers know Pawlenty opposes tax increases, but said the Legislature's job is to balance the budget.

""We think that it's important to mitigate the unallotment process as much as we can, and we're giving one more shot at it,"" Skoe said.

The 201 legislators debated a series of bills on their final day -- medical marijuana, seat belts and other issues that had been pushed aside earlier as the budget took priority.

Among bills heard in the final three hours of the 2009 legislative session was one spending $397 million in the next two years on outdoors and arts projects with money from a sales tax increase voters approved last Nov. 4. Representatives backed the bill 104-30, with senators passing it 67-0.

""This is the promise to the future,"" Rep. Mary Murphy, DFL-Hermantown, said about habitat, parks, trails, arts, history and other areas funded in the bill.

Water clean-up work would get the most money from Murphy's bill, $151 million. Also funded are arts, $93 million; outdoor heritage fund, $88 million; and parks and trials, $65 million.

It was a historic session because lawmakers faced a record-high $6.4 billion deficit in the two-year budget that starts July 1. One-time federal aid shrunk the shortfall to $4.6 billion.

The Democratic-Farmer-Labor-controlled Legislature and Republican Pawlenty agreed some spending cuts were needed, but could not agree on how to plug the entire deficit. Democrats wanted to raise taxes; Pawlenty refused.

Legislative leaders put the best possible spin on the session's outcome Monday, even as efforts to reach a budget agreement were failing.

""Pretty remarkable"" is how House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher, DFL-Minneapolis, described the session.

The good news, Kelliher said, is that ""there will be no government shutdown, there will be no special session.""

Both were promises Pawlenty made Thursday when he announced his planned historic use of an ""unallotment"" law to reduce state spending without legislative approval.

This is the first time a Minnesota governor is using unallotment to essentially write a budget. Governors occasionally have used unallotment to trim budgets when revenues fell below expectations near the end of a budget cycle.

Pawlenty has said that he likely will delay payments to schools to make up much of the remaining deficit. And it appears he will reduce state payments to local governments, perhaps by several hundred million dollars. Another expected target is health-care services.

The governor's spokesman, Brian McClung, said no timeline has been established for when Pawlenty will make decisions on specifically what to cut.

House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall, blamed Democrats' repeated attempts to raise taxes for failure to negotiate a deal.

He complained that the DFL-led Legislature sent bills spending $34 billion in the next two years to the governor, while agreeing with Pawlenty on just $31 billion in revenue.

""Democrats sent $3 billion of red ink out to the people of Minnesota,"" Seifert said.

Also in the Legislature's final day:

The House passed 70-64 a bill allowing terminally ill patients to use marijuana to ease pain, with the Senate agreeing 38-28. ""This bill is about compassion for people who are sick and dying,"" said bill sponsor Rep. Tom Rukavina, DFL-Virginia. Minnesotans could not grow their own marijuana under the bill. Pawlenty says he will veto the bill. Rep. Rod Hamilton, R-Mountain Lake, said he opposes medical marijuana, even though he someday may need it because he has multiple sclerosis. ""I'm a parent first and an MS patient second.""

The House approved 95-39 and the Senate 46-8 a bill requiring schools to establish an anti-bullying policy. Earlier references to reasons for harassment, especially the controversial reference to gay students, were removed.

The House passed 73-60, with the Senate following 47-19, a bill that would allow law enforcement officers to pull motorists over when someone in the vehicle is not wearing a seat belt. Under current law, drivers and passengers may be ticketed for not wearing belts, but a vehicle cannot be stopped for that reason. Rukavina succeeded in his effort to amend the bill to allow motorists passing vehicles on two-lane roads to drive faster than the speed limit.

Trucks about half the size of normal ones would be allowed on county roads under a bill the House approved 122-8.","2014-02-21 19:12:10","1","74.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","8.0","0.0","160.0","164.0","0.0","266.0","24.0","32.0","12","1330","94.54","66.05","9.15","37.75","16.62","26.62","75.04","37.89","5.71","2.33","0.15","0.38","0.08","0.98","0.75","3.38","9.10","12.03","5.94","2.63","3.61","1.28","12.63","2.93","1.58","1.05","6.17","1.20","3.23","1.95","1.28","0.00","0.23","0.53","6.92","0.08","0.08","0.15","0.98","7.74","0.75","1.80","1.58","1.35","0.75","1.80","2.56","0.38","2.03","0.15","1.20","0.30","0.60","0.15","0.23","7.74","0.60","1.88","5.71","0.53","0.60","5.56","4.89","1.20","12.86","2.33","5.04","5.71","6.84","0.75","0.75","6.02","0.00","0.08","0.53","0.00","0.45","0.08","0.00","0.00","21.50","6.09","6.24","0.30","0.23","0.08","0.00","3.83","2.56","0.98","0.00","1.20","6503","7.94","19.794117647058822","1944","1281","80","63.7","11.2","8.4","13.57","11.9","285","5.3125","17.29929742388759","609","18.66","21","0.36","0","27","82","137","0","119","77","3","1","23","207","173","15","80","1","0","32","11","35","1","1","4","49","0","62","91","24","27","13","30","4","6","0","8"

Tuscarora Ave., Fire Marshal Steve Zaccard said. Crews arrived about two minutes later and found the woman, 22, had escaped unhurt from the basement, where she’d been sleeping when a smoke alarm woke her, he said.

St. Paul fire investigator Jamie Novak said the owner of the home’s 17-year-old nephew was smoking a hookah, a water pipe used to smoke a tobacco mixture.

The boy was smoking the hookah in the house’s basement bathroom before he went to church Sunday morning, Novak said. Investigators believe the hookah had tipped over after the boy left for church, causing hot ashes to spark flames in the bathroom’s trash can that slowly spread throughout the basement.","2014-05-11 18:46:19","0","31.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","154.0","159.0","0.0","253.0","17.0","31.0","12","135","99.00","85.02","12.42","15.37","15.00","18.52","73.33","36.30","3.70","2.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.96","0.00","0.74","14.07","11.85","5.19","2.22","1.48","0.00","13.33","3.70","2.22","1.48","4.44","0.00","0.74","0.00","0.74","0.74","0.00","0.00","10.37","0.74","0.00","2.22","3.70","2.96","1.48","1.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.67","0.00","2.96","3.70","4.44","0.74","0.00","0.00","3.70","4.44","1.48","0.00","1.48","0.00","1.48","11.11","1.48","0.00","15.56","3.70","5.19","8.15","2.96","3.70","1.48","1.48","1.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.26","8.15","5.93","0.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.48","0.00","2.96","0.00","0.00","607","7.34","27.8","179","131","7","69.41","8.4","8.2","10.91","10.8","23","7.5","16.502900763358777","95","25.6","1","0.38","0","1","6","19","0","14","3","0","0","1","36","16","0","4","0","0","3","1","1","1","0","0","3","0","3","15","4","5","1","0","0","0","0","2"

If these units are actually mobilized, affected soldiers would expect to be on active duty for about 12 months. All Soldiers in the newly alerted units haven been notified of the possible mobilization.

"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/top-duluth-public-defender-fred-friedman-retire","Top Duluth public defender Fred Friedman to retire","Fred Friedman said Tuesday that he will retire at the end of March. He said he has spent the past few weeks telling friends and colleagues of his decision to step down.

""It's been the honor of my life, getting to work with the people of Northeastern Minnesota,"" Friedman said. ""Everything is great; I just thought it was time to retire.""

Friedman, 66, joined the public defender's office in December 1972 and became the chief in 1986. In his position, Friedman oversees the administration and direction of all public defender services in Carlton, Cook, Lake and St. Louis counties.

The Board of Public Defense is accepting applications from qualified attorneys who are licensed to practice in Minnesota through Nov. 29. Friedman said a public meeting will be held in January or February to interview candidates before making a final decision.

The selection committee will be composed of four people chosen by the Minnesota Supreme Court, three by the governor and two by 6th Judicial District Chief Judge Shaun Floerke. Friedman said he would not be involved in the decision.

Friedman stressed the need for public defender services, saying about 90 percent of criminal defendants in Northeastern Minnesota rely on his agency's services.

""Private criminal law is more of a TV deal,"" he said. ""You could go to court for months and not see private counsel.""

Born and raised in the Chicago area, Friedman came to Duluth in 1964 and graduated from Denfeld High School in 1965. He received an undergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota Duluth in 1969, and earned a law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1972, just months before being hired by the public defender's office.

Friedman also has taught part-time in the sociology department and medical school at UMD since 1975.

He said he plans to remain in Duluth after retirement.

""I'm not going away,"" he said. ""The state of Minnesota has paid me to do this all these years, and I'll look forward to paying taxes all these years ahead.""","2014-03-08 02:42:18","1","39.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","8.0","0.0","156.0","159.0","0.0","260.0","20.0","31.0","12","338","96.40","82.06","21.53","13.70","16.10","25.15","81.95","43.49","7.69","5.33","1.48","0.00","0.30","3.55","0.00","2.37","7.10","17.75","6.51","1.18","3.85","0.89","15.98","2.37","1.18","0.30","3.85","2.07","3.25","1.18","2.07","0.30","0.00","0.00","12.43","0.00","0.59","0.00","3.55","5.62","1.78","0.59","0.89","0.30","1.18","1.18","3.25","0.59","2.66","0.00","0.89","0.00","0.59","0.00","0.30","8.88","0.89","1.78","4.14","0.89","1.78","6.21","5.62","2.07","16.27","1.78","8.58","6.51","9.76","0.59","0.00","1.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.57","6.21","4.44","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.30","3.55","1.78","0.00","0.00","1607","7.56","18.105263157894736","495","337","19","61.97","11.8","9.0","11.37","10.9","65","6.916666666666667","16.79513353115727","198","16.79","5","0.44","0","12","14","28","0","48","14","1","0","5","44","54","0","17","2","0","16","4","11","0","0","1","10","0","13","17","8","12","3","9","0","1","0","0"

Registration is optional, but the department asks veterans to sign up at www.mnhonorsvietnamvets.org/registration or call (651) 296-2562 by June 10. Veterans who register will receive a lapel pin when checking in on June 13.

The free event, which is open to anyone, will feature a 2 p.m. program, along with flyovers throughout the day, music from the period, Vietnam memorabilia, food and a replica of the National Vietnam Memorial.

Veteran medical bill

Veterans returning home could find jobs as paramedics under a bill introduced by U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.

The Veterans-to-Paramedics Transition Act would streamline civilian paramedic training for returning vets who obtained some military medical experience.

""When they signed up to serve there wasn't a waiting line and when they come home and need health care or a job, there shouldn't be a waiting line,"" Klobuchar said. ""Today, we have an abundance of returning veterans who have significant medical training and experience. They're an ideal talent pool to relieve the severe shortage of emergency medical personnel in rural communities.""

When veterans return to civilian life, their military medical training does not count toward civilian paramedic certification.","2014-02-21 19:12:10","0","36.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","162.0","159.0","0.0","260.0","21.0","31.0","12","221","94.43","64.15","12.26","82.48","18.42","32.13","72.85","38.46","4.07","1.81","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.00","1.36","2.26","8.14","13.57","5.88","2.71","5.88","1.36","11.31","1.36","0.45","3.62","2.71","0.45","4.07","3.62","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.79","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.79","0.45","0.00","2.71","2.71","0.00","2.26","1.81","0.00","0.90","0.00","3.62","0.00","3.17","0.00","0.45","8.60","0.90","1.36","6.79","0.45","0.00","1.36","7.24","1.36","14.03","0.90","5.43","8.14","4.52","0.90","0.90","1.36","0.00","0.45","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","22.17","8.14","6.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.71","1.81","1.81","0.90","0.45","1089","8.27","20.09090909090909","334","210","13","55.03","12.9","9.6","14.15","12.4","51","6.666666666666667","18.194285714285712","150","18.36","4","0.38","1","8","6","19","0","19","18","0","0","4","40","26","3","13","0","0","4","1","3","0","0","1","9","0","12","3","6","1","8","7","1","3","0","5"
"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/wind-funnels-thousands-songbirds-duluth-reports-dead-songbirds-are-rise","As wind funnels thousands of songbirds to Duluth, reports of dead songbirds are on the rise","At least 68 songbirds have been killed after flying into windows in the Duluth area recently, including nearly 50 at the Duluth International Airport, said Duluth birder Laura Erickson, who has started a website to document bird collisions with windows.

“It’s just a mess of a problem,” said Erickson, the author of several books on birding. “There are so many things hurting birds and only a few that we as individuals can make an impact on. Preventing window collisions is one.”

Many more migrating birds probably have been killed in collisions with cars in Duluth and along Minnesota Highway 61, according to individual reports and Facebook postings.

“A lot of birds were being killed along Highway 61,” said Janelle Long, executive director of Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory. “A lot of people, including me, had witnessed that —

yellow-rumped warblers and juncos. They’re tired and looking for food.”

Duluth’s Peggy Farr of Wildwoods, a wildlife rehabilitation organization, said Wildwoods had received 54 calls of injured birds on Friday.

“That’s huge. We admitted 14, I think,” Farr said. “Yesterday (Sunday) there were a bunch more. Some died, some recovered. Most were window strikes.”

Counters at Duluth’s Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory reported counting more than 65,000 migrating nonraptors — most of them songbirds such as robins, warblers and sparrows — from Friday through Sunday. The birds were pushed toward Lake Superior by strong northwesterly winds. To avoid flying over the lake, the birds follow the North Shore toward Duluth before continuing their migrations to Mexico, Central America and South America, Erickson said.

The dead birds at the airport were observed by Duluth’s Penny Schwarze, who saw about 20 two weeks ago and 28 more on Sunday, she said. She found them on the ground below large panes of glass.

“It’s an avoidable thing,” Schwarze said. “I was really upset.”

Natalie Peterson, director of communication and marketing for the Duluth Airport Authority, said the airport is looking for options to solve the problem.

“We don’t want to see the birds hitting the windows,” Peterson said. “I’ve been meeting with a company to come up with a solution. We are looking at films we can put on the outside of the building that the birds can see.”

Solving the problem of vehicles hitting birds may be more difficult. The migrating birds typically are weary and hungry and less able to avoid the hazards of moving vehicles, Erickson said. One driver estimated in a Facebook post that he had hit 20 songbirds while driving over the weekend.

“On Highway 61, the pavement warms faster than the grass or plants,” Erickson said. “Insects are more prevalent on the road itself and next to it. That draws the birds in. They’re so confused and hungry. They’re in this really keyed-up, stressed situation.”

Erickson said she has no way of estimating how many birds may have been killed in car collisions.

“A lot are killed by cars,” Erickson said. “I don’t think anyone driving along (Highway) 61 this weekend didn’t hit a bird or just miss them. One person got two birds with their bike.”

The influx of migrating birds that has ended up in or near Duluth is called, in ornithological terms, a “fall-out” of birds. Duluth has seen similar fall-out events in some past years, Erickson said.

The peak of the weekend’s songbird migration occurred Saturday, according to reports from Hawk Ridge. On that day, counters tallied more than 37,000 non-raptors, including more than 23,000 robins. Counters called it a “massive” non-raptor migration.

“It seemed every road and yard had robins, sparrows and warblers,” the report stated. “Unfortunately, many yellow-rumps (yellow-rumped warblers) were killed along Highway 61.”

Car collisions can be avoided only by drivers slowing down where it’s safe and practical, Erickson said.

“But you can’t drive too slowly on 61,” she said.

Large windows on buildings pose a significant problem for birds, said Erickson, who has been active in an effort to reduce potential bird collisions with windows at the new Minnesota Vikings stadium in Minneapolis.

Most bird collisions with windows occur at night, Erickson said, when the birds are drawn to areas of light. She said when she saw the expansive windows at the Duluth airport, she knew they would pose a problem for birds.

“We’re going to need to get some kind of netting over those windows,” she said.

Farr said the Vikings stadium discussion has drawn attention to the issue of bird collisions with windows.

“I’m glad Laura’s bringing awareness to it,” she said. “I think it’s a very important issue, especially for cities like Duluth, where we’re on a major flyway.”","2014-10-07 11:59:54","0","54.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","8.0","0.0","157.0","159.0","0.0","261.0","20.0","32.0","12","777","93.78","75.25","21.26","3.56","14.66","24.07","72.97","42.47","7.34","3.99","0.90","0.90","0.13","1.29","0.77","3.35","7.46","15.44","7.34","2.96","3.60","0.64","15.06","5.02","3.22","1.03","3.09","3.60","4.12","0.90","3.22","0.90","0.77","0.26","8.88","0.00","0.00","1.16","0.13","7.21","1.54","0.64","1.03","3.09","0.26","1.54","5.28","1.54","3.47","0.26","0.90","0.13","0.51","0.00","0.39","6.56","1.29","1.03","2.45","0.26","1.67","7.21","6.82","0.51","14.54","2.57","8.49","3.86","1.67","1.67","1.54","0.26","0.00","1.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.81","6.82","6.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.03","5.66","2.70","0.77","0.00","3709","7.53","17.755555555555556","1131","770","52","64.91","10.8","7.9","11.88","10.1","154","8.2","15.92","362","16.71","9","0.43","0","20","24","66","1","98","53","6","3","8","85","88","1","80","0","0","41","2","22","4","0","5","16","0","19","51","26","26","24","18","2","3","0","5"
"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/douglas-county-approves-capital-projects","Douglas County approves capital projects","The county will repurpose the former veterans’ service office in the courthouse to serve as a jury room and make improvements in the jail.

Supervisor Keith Allen questioned why plans for the jail were never brought to the committee with oversight for public safety.

“They should, and have been in the past, and I don’t understand why we knew a couple months ago this was going to be done,” Allen said. He said that in the future he would like to see projects proposed to follow the proper procedure, which includes approvals by the oversight committee and the county’s Administration Committee before being presented to the board.

The Administration Committee recommended the projects approved Thursday night.

“If we don’t want to follow procedure, we can just hand it to the Administration Committee and they can decide it there,” Allen said.

Nick Baker, chairman of the Public Safety Committee, said he was never advised of the project proposals.

Douglas County Board Chairman Doug Finn said the county will have to review its process to make sure the county is following proper procedure.

“Our whole system here runs on the knowledge of the committees,” said Supervisor Sue Hendrickson. “If you’re not on a committee, you don’t always know all the ins and outs, and it’s important for those committee members to know about those things that come forward in their committee knowledge area.”

The projects passed with a 17-1 vote. Allen voted against the project proposal.","2014-06-23 21:28:24","1","23.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","2.0","0.0","119.0","135.0","0.0","133.0","17.0","4.0","6","245","87.95","76.87","18.00","83.72","20.42","23.27","84.49","48.57","9.80","5.31","0.41","1.63","0.82","1.22","1.22","4.49","11.43","12.65","8.57","3.27","4.08","2.45","17.96","1.22","1.22","1.22","0.82","1.22","3.27","3.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.22","9.80","3.27","1.63","2.04","1.22","2.04","1.63","3.27","0.41","2.45","0.41","0.82","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.41","8.16","2.04","0.82","4.49","0.00","0.82","7.76","9.80","2.04","13.47","3.67","5.71","4.90","10.61","0.00","0.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.92","4.90","4.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.41","3.27","2.86","0.00","0.00","1190","7.43","22.818181818181817","356","244","12","59.33","12.0","10.0","12.3","12.8","43","12.625","17.169180327868855","147","20.18","1","0.48","0","7","2","31","0","24","14","0","0","6","35","27","0","14","1","0","14","3","7","0","0","0","11","0","15","14","3","7","7","4","2","0","0","2"
"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/wisconsin-superior-officials-discuss-move-umac","Wisconsin-Superior officials discuss move to UMAC","The query arrived as soon as Nelson concluded his opening remarks: Would UWS combine its jump to the UMAC with a grand reintroduction of the school’s long-dormant football program?

Nelson grinned as soon as the words were uttered, and the AD said there are no formal plans to do so, but he certainly didn’t close the door on the prospect. That’s more than he could say with UWS in the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.

“I could never look at adding any sports offering because of the travel in the WIAC,” Nelson said before dropping a tidy little sound bite. “At least now we can look at it.”

While nothing came of Thursday’s news conference on the football front, this much is certain: UWS is leaving the WIAC, of which it’s been a member for 102 years, in 2015-16. The league, one of the premier NCAA Division III conferences in the country, simply had outgrown the Yellowjackets. After UWS, at about 2,500 students, the next-smallest school in the WIAC is Wisconsin-River Falls with an enrollment of nearly 7,000. Wisconsin-Oshkosh has more than 13,000 students.

That kind of disparity put UWS at a distinct disadvantage, both competitively and financially. The Yellowjackets just didn’t have the resources to keep up with their big-school brethren, and Nelson knew something had to be done. He said he started having informal talks with the UMAC seven or eight years ago.

UWS finally submitted a formal application last fall to join the UMAC, which features seven Minnesota schools, including St. Scholastica, plus Northland College in Ashland.

“It just came to a point where we needed a new home,” Nelson said.

Also attending Thursday’s press conference on the Superior campus were UMAC commissioner Corey Borchardt, UWS chancellor Renee Wachter and St. Scholastica athletic director Don Olson.

All spoke glowingly of the move, which will greatly reduce burdensome travel while at the same time aligning the school with institutions that are similar in size and closer in proximity. Another offshoot, of course, is that it will add some juice to the UWS-St. Scholastica rivalry.

“I hope we can manifest that and make that a happening around here,” Nelson said.

UWS, which will be the third-largest school in its new league behind St. Scholastica and Northwestern, also should bolster the UMAC.

“We’re pleased because, No. 1, we feel that it strengthens our conference,” Olson said.

Nelson admitted the move will take some getting used to. UWS is a charter member of the WIAC, and now only the school’s hockey teams will compete in the league — the UMAC doesn’t offer hockey.

It wasn’t an easy decision to make, he said, but it had to be done.

“This is absolutely the right thing to do, and I think it’s exciting to be with like-minded schools,” Yellowjackets women’s basketball coach Don Mulhern said. “Any time you have change, there’s always going to be trepidation by everybody.”

Mulhern was visibly excited when discussing the ramifications of the move and what it will mean for the “bridge battles” between UWS and St. Scholastica. Rather than just bragging rights, those contests now will carry greater weight, including league standings, tournament seeding and possibly even NCAA playoff berths.

Most of the Yellowjackets’ road trips in the UMAC, even the longest ones, would be among their shortest trips in the WIAC. The financial toll of all that travel, combined with the amount of school student-athletes miss, was a big factor in the decision, which was announced Wednesday.

The UMAC’s Council of Presidents voted unanimously to accept UWS on Monday.","2014-05-09 05:45:19","1","46.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","8.0","0.0","154.0","159.0","0.0","261.0","20.0","32.0","12","602","87.12","64.89","31.49","53.90","16.72","23.26","80.56","47.18","8.31","2.99","0.50","1.00","0.17","1.00","0.33","5.32","9.63","13.29","8.80","4.49","4.65","1.33","16.78","5.48","3.49","1.33","2.49","2.66","2.82","2.16","0.66","0.00","0.17","0.17","6.31","0.00","0.00","0.17","1.00","8.97","1.66","1.16","1.33","1.83","1.83","1.83","3.16","0.66","1.99","0.50","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.33","6.81","2.49","0.66","2.99","1.16","0.17","5.48","8.80","2.16","16.45","3.32","8.31","4.82","5.98","2.33","0.50","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.00","20.43","5.81","7.14","0.33","0.00","0.17","0.00","1.66","2.66","2.66","0.00","0.00","2866","7.99","21.344827586206897","856","592","34","70.73","11.6","7.7","12.06","11.3","131","12.375","17.81135135135135","331","19.97","32","0.46","0","16","14","71","1","66","32","4","5","14","82","79","0","32","1","0","23","6","37","0","0","2","14","0","26","31","14","10","13","13","8","1","0","2"
"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/bills-regulate-mobile-phone-tracking","Bills regulate mobile phone tracking","The two similar bills easily passed on voice votes to require police to obtain search warrants before tracking phones. The bills would allow emergency tracking, such as when a life in is immediate danger, without going to a judge first.

Current law has a lower standard to track phones than obtaining a search warrant.

Atkins and Rep. John Lesch, D-St. Paul, said their bills can be tweaked to satisfy law enforcement officials' concerns before final votes.

""We are not necessarily far apart on this issue,"" Lesch said.

The bills have more committee stops before reaching the full House.

Assistant Superintendent Drew Evans of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension told the House Public Safety Committee that police have used cellphone-tracking technology for five years.

One of his complaints about the bills is they would restrict tracking to felony investigations. He said suspects in lesser crimes, such as domestic assault and stalking, also should be tracked.

The bills also have provisions that require law enforcement agencies to eventually notify people they are tracking, although a judge can delay that notification.

""Any premature disclosure of information ... mid-investigation, especially when we are dealing with long-term criminal investigation ... is going to be an issue with the loss of future investigative evidence,"" said James Franklin, executive director of the Minnesota State Sheriffs' Association.

Privacy advocates said current law allows too much data to remain secret.

""Law enforcement is increasingly taking advantage of Minnesota's privacy laws written before these innovations,"" said Charles Samuelson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union Minnesota chapter.","2014-03-13 10:35:57","1","40.0","0.0","5.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","156.0","159.0","0.0","256.0","17.0","31.0","12","261","92.06","73.00","11.50","20.01","15.35","30.65","76.63","36.02","4.60","2.68","0.00","0.77","0.00","0.77","1.15","1.92","6.51","12.64","7.28","3.83","3.45","0.77","12.26","5.36","3.83","0.77","1.53","1.53","4.21","1.92","2.30","0.38","0.38","0.77","8.05","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.77","7.66","1.92","1.15","1.15","0.77","0.77","1.92","4.60","0.77","3.83","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","13.41","1.53","1.92","8.05","1.53","1.92","3.83","7.28","1.53","11.88","1.53","3.83","6.51","9.58","0.00","1.15","3.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.01","8.05","4.98","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.53","2.30","1.15","0.00","0.00","1413","9.36","20.153846153846153","436","257","17","47.69","13.0","10.4","15.54","13.3","81","5.1875","20.647003891050588","174","19.15","1","0.34","0","2","3","21","1","26","17","3","0","5","40","38","0","27","0","0","5","2","12","0","0","0","9","0","13","7","10","5","7","6","1","0","0","2"

Lower gas prices have led to expected inflation of just 2 percent, the lowest on record for the survey.

Many economists have pointed to plunging gas prices as a catalyst for increased holiday spending, and that may yet come to pass. But only 8 percent of shoppers who plan to spend more on holiday gifts this year cite lower gas prices as the reason, compared with a third who cite higher incomes.

In the wake of the GOP victory in the Senate, Republican optimism over the outlook for the economy rose to the highest level since December 2009. However, Republicans still are net pessimistic on the economic outlook compared to Democrats who are net positive.



Higher stock prices also seem to be buoying American spirits, with 41 percent saying now is a good time to invest, a 10-point gain. Better sentiment about the market goes beyond just the wealthy or those who are heavily invested in stocks. Blue collar workers and those with incomes between $50,000 and $70,000 all registered their most upbeat views on stocks since 2008. And for the first time since 2008, women are net positive about stocks (that is, those saying it's a good time to invest minus those saying it's a bad time.) In general, women have been more pessimistic on equities than men during the recession and expansion.

And it's doing it right in Detroit's backyard by challenging conventional thinking about the size and efficiency of the internal combustion engine.

EM's patented engine architecture—named ""opoc"" for opposed piston, opposed cylinder—is unique in that it is significantly smaller and lighter than conventional engines. The company claims its engines are also highly versatile across a broad range of vehicle and machine applications and operate cleanly with the fuels and fueling infrastructure already in place. That can have broad application toward how automakers design and manufacture vehicles in the future.

EM's opoc design eliminates the cylinder head and valve train components of conventional engines, resulting in fewer parts and a smaller, lighter and more compact package. Fewer parts also mean less friction, which contributes substantially to gains in fuel economy.

The technology has attracted joint venture partner FAW Jingye Engine. In March it was announced that the Chinese partner would invest $200 million to build a factory in China's Shanxi province to make 100,000 engines annually.","2014-06-17 06:00:00","0","34.0","21.0","1.0","0.0","63.0","0.0","369.0","353.0","27.0","354.0","728.0","23.0","3","199","91.80","55.99","7.98","34.49","22.11","33.67","63.32","36.18","4.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.52","6.53","12.56","5.03","3.02","7.54","0.00","7.04","7.54","6.03","1.51","3.02","3.02","1.51","1.01","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.01","0.00","1.01","0.00","0.00","5.53","1.51","3.02","1.01","0.00","0.00","0.50","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.50","1.01","0.50","0.50","0.00","0.00","6.03","1.01","2.01","2.51","0.50","0.50","2.01","4.52","0.50","11.56","0.00","9.55","1.51","5.03","0.00","1.01","1.51","0.00","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.07","4.52","3.52","1.01","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","2.51","1.01","0.50","1065","10.28","22.666666666666668","328","196","9","40.89","14.2","13.0","15.37","16.0","69","13.125","24.80163265306123","140","21.33","7","0.36","0","11","6","14","0","21","12","8","0","2","44","20","0","13","0","0","4","1","9","0","0","0","5","0","6","3","5","4","4","8","2","0","0","2"

Kelly said that gross domestic product expansion would likely be constrained to about 2 percent in the long term but could be higher if the government lowered the corporate tax rate or passed immigration and entitlement reform, for example.

He said a flat corporate tax rate of 10 percent would cause capital to flow back to the U.S., increase mergers and acquisitions, dividends, stock buybacks and, ultimately, spending.

""That could cause a productivity and capital spending boom in this country,"" Kelly said. ""That would really help.""

""As a citizen this frustrates me ... but as an investor I know darn well that it makes no sense to base an investment strategy on what Washington will do. Because Washington won't,"" he added.

Despite his frustration, Kelly said he still recommended stocks over bonds despite their relatively high valuations. He hesitantly mentioned a few potential fixed income investments, including high-yield bonds and emerging markets local debt.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/17/a-report-from-the-lunatic-fringe-of-fund-investing.html","What would Bogle and Buffett think of these ETFs?","With the rise of electric-powered vehicles and Tesla's announcement that it's building a 5 million-square-foot factory in Nevada, the lithium used in the production of batteries might seem like a good investment. The Global X Lithium ETF, which tracks a market-cap-weighted index of global lithium producers, thus holds some appeal, but experts urge caution.



""It's a very, very narrow slice of the market,"" Goldsborough warned, speaking to the ETF's lack of liquidity and volatility. ""An investor would need an incredibly strong level of commitment to that industry and would [still] need to make it a small portion of their portfolio."" He added that the broad U.S. market has outperformed LIT over the past three years. The fund is up 5.17 percent year-to-date—compared to a year-to-date return of more than 8 percent in the S&P 500 and 12 percent in the Nasdaq 100. LIT has gathered $59 million in assets.



Bogart warned that LIT's 22-stock portfolio defines the lithium market generously. ""It takes an interesting approach to capturing the lithium theme by investing in a range of companies, from household-electronics producers to chemicals companies,"" he said.

It's also worth noting that, in aggregate, LIT's portfolio companies are losing money, not making it, according to an ETF.com analysis. Bogart said that for an ETF that only features 22 stocks, there are quite a few that are losing money, and that is evident in a price-to-earnings ratio that ETF.com calculates to be at -5,119—yes, that's a negative before the 5,119.

While Global X lists a P/E of 21 on its website, Bogart said fund managers often toss out negative earnings entirely or cap negative earnings at a certain value and use that capped amount when calculating P/E. The reason that issuers do this is 1) it often makes their funds look more attractive and 2) because a negative P/E ratio is counterintuitive and completely lost on most investors. Either way, tossing them out or capping them distorts the real P/E picture, the ETF.com analyst said.



Global X declined to comment, but it's worth looking at the counter-argument: While the P/E ratio is eye-popping, it should be taken with a grain of salt. As in many immature industries, it is expected companies will lose money in their early history. One example: Tesla.

The company's version-control system was built around a piece of software created in 2005 by Linux developer Linus Torvalds that he named Git—a British slang word referring to a foolish person. In 2008, as Git adoption grew, developer Tom Preston-Werner (creator of the avatar service Gravatar) and several colleagues realized that a site that could run most Git functions was needed. They created and launched GitHub, a site that allows coders to collaborate over the Internet easily and in real time.

Just 36 percent say people are living in poverty because of their own actions or decisions. But just 45 percent say the wealthy have achieved their success because of their own actions and 43 percent say it's because of circumstances outside their own control.

In addition to asking respondents to choose whether wealth and poverty were caused primarily by circumstance or a person's own action, CNBC also asked for a more detailed response: whether poverty and wealth resulted from work ethic, circumstance, education or luck. The detailed answers show some conflict with the broader question.

When it comes to work ethic, 58 percent of Republicans believe that Americans are wealthy because of hard work compared with just 22 percent of Democrats. But only 37 percent of Republicans believe that Americans are poor due lack of hard work compared to 13 percent of Democrats.

About a third of both Republicans and Democrats view poverty resulting from ""poor education""—the one area where the two parties come together. Meanwhile, 29 percent of Democrats see wealth resulting from a good education, compared with just 17 percent of Republicans.

The survey was conducted March 13-16 by Hart-McInturff, Democratic and Republican pollsters. It had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

Americans by a 2-to-1 margin favor increasing the minimum wage to $10.10, with a big jump in those who strongly favor the move.

By 47-40 percent, Americans believe it is more significant that raising the minimum wage will potentially reduce poverty than it will potentially cost jobs.

Easing of Cuba trade would be 'huge'","""It will be fantastic, obviously,"" said Rob Norris, CEO of cigar retailer and direct marketer JR Cigar. ""Who knows what the news will be or how long it will take to take place, but that would be very exciting.""

The United States imposed an embargo on Cuba in the early 1960s, following a communist revolution led by rebels under Fidel Castro who overthrew the U.S.-friendly regime there. The event ended what had been a brisk trade in cigars from Cuba to the United States—tobacco from the island nation is globally recognized as some of the world's best.

The new rules would allow U.S. travelers to bring up to $100 worth of Cuban tobacco back to the United States, though nominally it would be only for personal use.

""U.S. residents like Cuban cigars not only because of their quality, but also because they were prohibited,"" said Pedro Cabrera, co-owner of cigar retailer and manufacturer Cigarros Pedro Lopez, which is based in the Dominican Republic. Cabrera called Wednesday's developments ""huge news.""

In fact, that trade never really ceased. Despite the sale of Cuban cigars being illegal, the United States has remained the world's biggest consumer of Cuban cigars, said Greg Zimmerman, secretary of the International Premium Cigar & Pipe Retail Association, and the proprietor of The Tobacco Company, a retailer in Pennsylvania.

Now, however, that-once illegal trade looks like it will go aboveboard.

Boehner burst a gasket at a news conference last week discussing Obama's handling of the growing immigration crisis along the Southwest border saying, ""He's been president five and a half years; when is he going to take responsibility for something?"" Obama snapped back during a speech in Austin, TX, ""The best things you can say for them this year is that so far they haven't shut down the government.""

He added, ""Of course it's only July, so who knows what they may cook up in the next couple of months.""



Read MoreBorder blowback: House says Obama wants too much



This, of course, is a far cry from their early interactions when Obama was a relative newcomer to the Oval Office and the wily, veteran lawmaker Boehner was just coming into his own as a major political force in Washington.

Even before the Republicans regained control of the House and elevated Boehner to Speaker in late 2010, the Ohio lawmaker with the year-round tan joked about his comfortable relationship with Obama.



""First thing that happens is, you know, I come in and he'll say, 'Boehner, you're almost as dark as me,'"" Boehner quipped during an appearance on Fox News October 6, 2010, according to the Huffington Post. ""You know, I listen. We talk about golf. We'll talk about our skin color. We have a nice relationship.""



The turning point in their once promising relationship came in 2011, when the two men's secret talks over a ""Grand Bargain"" of spending and entitlement cuts and tax increases abruptly blew up.

Boehner accused Obama of moving the goal posts with a last minute demand for more tax revenue. Obama insisted that Boehner abandoned the talks after feeling heat from conservatives and realizing he couldn't get his rank-and-file members to go along with him on a tax increase.



Since then, the two men have avoided direct contact except when absolutely necessary. That includes annual State of the Union addresses at the Capitol where the Speaker typically sits glum-faced while the president addresses a joint session of Congress. Or at bipartisan congressional leadership meetings at the White House that Boehner can't afford to miss. Or once in a while in a phone call.



Last Feb. 25, Boehner met privately with the Obama, face-to-face, for about an hour. According to Reuters, ""it was the first time the two leaders had met alone in the Oval Office since December 17, 2012.""

She generally has dismissed charges that the Fed has caused dangers but did acknowledge the potential.

""When interest rates begin to rise, if firms or individuals have taken risks and aren't adequately prepared to deal with them that can cause distress,"" she said. ""Among the institutions that we supervise we're certainly looking at management of interest rate risk.""

In her initial remarks during semi-annual testimony to Congress, Yellen said there were signs of a production and spending rebound in the second quarter, but ""this bears close watching.""

Yellen also noted that housing activity has been disappointing, with the sector showing ""little progress"" of late with readings this year ""disappointing"" as mortgage rates have edged higher.

The remarks were part of what once was known as the ""Humphrey Hakwins"" testimony in which the central bank chief apprises lawmakers of the state of policy and the U.S. economy. Yellen's testimony came as the Fed looks to end its monthly bond-buying program—currently at $35 billion—and contemplates when to begin raising short-term interest rates from near-zero levels.

Some of the questioning got a bit more granular, though. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., questioned Yellen on whether large financial institutions remained a threat the economy. She pointed out that JPMorgan Chase, for instance, has 3,391 subsidiaries—more than three times the number of Lehman Brothers when it failed in 2008 and triggered the worst of the financial crisis.

For the most part, though, the exchanges were cordial, with Yellen straddling the line between expressing confidence in the recovery and caution that the central bank's job is not finished.

""The economy is continuing to make progress toward the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum employment and price stability,"" Yellen said.

But that just means they have to pay more later, which means lower profits and a lower tax bill. In other words, the revenue source for highway projects across the nation has all the structural soundness of a sand castle.



If it sounds like the opposite of how a well-run enterprise should be run, that's because it is. Indeed, it's a classic example of the kind of counter-productive short-term thinking that Washington politicians have often criticized American business for.



Call it democracy or, if you are more jaded, politics. But it's the only way Washington rolls in 2014.

Democrats point to crumbling roads and bridges and want higher spending levels. Republicans insist government spends too much and oppose anything revenue measure that can be called a tax increase.



A bipartisan Senate plan to raise the gas tax—which has remained unchanged for two decades as more fuel-efficient cars have eroded its value—has no chance in the House.

Neither party has the power to simply impose its will.

The results: Nearly all business on Capitol Hill has halted. Even legislation that both parties agree on—on energy efficiency earlier this year, and on hunting and fishing rights more recently—can't reach the finish line. Sometimes it's because one party wants to deny a sponsor of the other party an achievement that has value in this fall's campaign; sometimes it's because votes on unrelated amendments might prove politically embarrassing.

The only good news is that Washington retains the capacity to act in moments of genuine crisis. Congress passed the Wall Street bailout in the home stretch of the 2008 presidential campaign when the alternative was financial collapse. It passed the fiscal cliff deal at the end of 2012 when the alternative was an economically damaging tax increase for every taxpayer.

Though Congress has initially balked, chances are good that lawmakers will approve supplemental spending to ease the crisis of unaccompanied children from Central America on the southern US border. The specter of unchecked border crossing and homeless children is too much for even gridlocked legislators to ignore.

And the same is true of the highway bill. Infirm as it is, Congress retains some sense of when it's about drive into a wall. The potential halt of road repair and construction in every state is one of those walls.



The last minute turn away won't be pretty. But for beleaguered American voters, at least it's better than a crash.

""Congress should enact legislation immediately . . . to shut down this abuse of our tax system,"" Mr Lew wrote in the letter to Mr Camp, which was obtained by the Financial Times on Tuesday. ""What we need as a nation is a new sense of economic patriotism, where we all rise and fall together,"" Mr Lew wrote.



The Obama administration proposal, which was backed by powerful liberal Democrats such as Carl and Sandy Levin, as well as Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate finance committee, would clamp down on tax inversions by raising the threshold of foreign share ownership required for such a deal to be structured from 20 per cent to 50 per cent.

By having it take effect starting in May 2014, the US Treasury and congressional Democrats hope to avoid a further increase in companies structuring such agreements over the next few months. However, retroactive application of tax changes is relatively unusual, and its use to reduce the number of inversion transactions has received criticism from business groups, conservative tax economists, and Republican lawmakers.



Mr Lew's letter on Tuesday was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. It follows plans revealed this week by Mylan, the US generic drugmaker, to move to the Netherlands through its purchase of Abbott Laboratories's European generics drugs unit.

Unfortunately this serves to confuse the issue and, it needs to be addressed immediately because I want to keep my vacation home — and my head.

Read MorePIketty's wealth inequality book is a 'big mess': AEI

Of the many factors that have contributed to the dramatic increase in income inequality, the most significant has been a steady decline in interest rates from late 1981 to their current levels. In 1981, the yield on a 2-year Treasury note was 16.5 percent. A decline over more than three decades has left 2-year yields at a current level of .35 percent. When we subtract the 11-percent inflation rate in 1981 and the current 2-percent inflation rate we get a ""real rate"" of 5.5 percent in 1981 vs. -1.65 percent currently.

This march to negative rates has been the primary driver of wealth inequality by altering key economic and behavioral trends. Critics of the Federal Reserve correctly claim that inorganically low interest rates effectively transfer money from retirees searching for safe investments to banks in the form of cheap funding. Unfortunately, this only scratches the surface. Here's are other effects of low interest rates:

1. They tend to inflate assets held disproportionately by the wealthy, like real estate, stocks and bonds. The S&P 500 has risen 1571 percent (from 116 to 1885) since 1981.

2. They have inarguably fueled two asset bubble-bust cycles. A normal pattern of these cycles is to draw in the weakest money at the latest stage of the boom phase. Then, as the bubble bursts, these late comers are disproportionately punished after having purchased the asset at wildly inflated levels. The typical buyer in the late stage boom cycle is a person with limited assets and has used leverage in the purchase. In the bottoming phase of the bust cycle, severely undervalued assets are then purchased by those in good financial shape. The depressed assets then return to more normal price levels completing a transfer of wealth from those that can least afford it to those who are already much higher on the relative wealth scale.

3. They tend to drive up the prices of energy by increasing speculation. Costs of food and energy tend to eat up a far greater portion of the incomes of the lower and middle class. As an example of this phenomenon, oil prices have increased 700 percent since the mid 1980's despite relatively low inflation elsewhere. (Proving that food prices have risen will present a slight challenge as current tools don't distinguish between premium and mass-produced food products.)

4. They dramatically discourage savings in favor of consumption. This tends to encourage and reinforce a short-term pattern of borrow and buy over traditional, long-term savings. Oddly, it took ten years before we saw this behavior significantly accelerate. Perhaps because, although rates were declining in the 1980s, they were coming from historically high levels and didn't reach single digits until the early 1990s. The proliferation of SUV sales serve as a perfect metaphor for the accelerating consumption economy of the early 90s. The material change in lifestyles in the U.S. in the early nineties can be graphically represented in charts of many different things. For example, stock prices, contracts for athletes and musicians, consumption of sugar, imported foods, bottled water and countless other trends.

5. They provide incentive for companies to invest in technology at the expense of labor.

6. They provide incentive for companies to buy back shares creating a further concentration of wealth at the executive level.

7. They increase corporate and individual risk-taking that generally manifests itself in increased levels of acquisitions by corporations. This creates companies that use efficiencies created by scale to streamline operations and eliminate jobs made redundant. Wealth is then concentrated at the executive level. Over time, this also creates the ""too big to fail"" phenomenon that's is far to prevalent today.

Here's an example of how increased individual risk-taking plays out over long periods of depressed interest rates:

Imagine there are 12 people who each have 100,000 of investable money. Psychology suggests that several of these people have a genetic predisposition for risk-taking, let's assume that number is four. Let's also assume that four of these people are genetically risk averse. That leaves the middle four people who have a more neutral attitude toward risk. These 12 people are each approached with an investment opportunity that has a 33-percent chance of succeeding, in which case your money would increase by 400 percent.

Read MoreWant to close the wealth gap? 'Make smart sexy again'

Each investment opportunity is individual for each person in terms of success or failure. If, however, the investment fails, you would lose your entire amount of investable money. In an environment that offered normal ""risk-free"" interest rates, I think we could expect the following: All four of the risk takers would opt for the investment opportunity because of its risk-reward ratio. We also could assume that all four of the risk avoiders would shun the investment in favor of the safe rate. Let's assume that the middle four then split 50/50 on the investment. The net result of this model would be that two of the 12 would have 400k, six of the 12 would have 100k (+ the safe rate) and four of the 12 would have nothing left.

Now let's look at that same model in an environment where the ""safe rate"" has been eliminated as an option. Keep in mind that there is no arguing the fact that the Fed has intentionally and admittedly engineered an environment that forces money further out the risk spectrum by eliminating a safe rate of return in order to spur economic activity. I think it's safe to assume that all of the middle four will, over time, grow tired of earning a paltry safe rate and opt for the more risky investment. The behavior of the most risky and least risky would probably stay the same. The most favorable net result of this example would be that three (2.64) of the 12 would have 400k, four would have 100k plus the safe rate and five would have nothing.

In the first example, a net initial aggregate total of 1.2 million is turned into 1.4 million. In the second example, a net initial amount of 1.2 million was turned into 1.6 million. However, in the second example wealth is more concentrated at the top -- and there is a greater number of those left behind.

Although this particular example is hypothetical, a similar scenario plays out everyday in an extended period of low rates. I bought a restaurant in early 2012. This was a decision I would never have made had I been receiving 7 percent to 9 percent on safe interest-bearing instruments.

There are several other significant causes of growing wealth inequality. Among those are increases in information and communication technology that allows a company or individual a far greater distribution area for their product or their service. Also, the development a more global economy combined with currency manipulation fueled an exodus of 22 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and a resultant disappearance of packaging and transportation jobs. These types of jobs have historically bolstered a vibrant middle class.

There have also been significant social changes that have fueled wealth inequality.

Most significantly, a dramatic shift in family structure to a point where 53 percent of babies born to women under 30 years old, are born into a single-parent family. Households headed by single parents are far more likely to struggle financially.

Finally, the women's movement that began in the 60's has fueled a movement of family formation characterized by two highly educated and earning parents in opposition of the one bread winner model of the 1950's.

The purpose of this is not to dismiss any of these factors. These particular factors have been adequately identified and covered, whereas the interest-rate portion has not despite its position at the top of the list.

Then there's the relationship between government fiscal policy and Fed monetary policy. As Chairman Ben Bernanke implied often, aggressive monetary policy is necessary to counterbalance fiscal inaction. Our current corporate tax structure, for example, provides obvious incentive to offshore capital and production, slowing an already sluggish recovery. Easy money tends to cushion the blow of this bad policy decisions providing little incentive to correct it. So the negative cycle has a tendency to continue drawing us nearer to a point of reckoning.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., announced Wednesday he's pulling the patent troll legislation for the foreseeable future because of an inability to resolve some outstanding issues.

""Unfortunately, there has been no agreement on how to combat the scourge of patent trolls on our economy without burdening the companies and universities who rely on the patent system every day to protect their inventions,"" Leahy said in a statement.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/17/americas-weapon-in-the-us-russia-space-war.html","America's weapon in the US-Russia space war","""Generally speaking, SpaceX is No. 1 because it builds on the principles that define the NewSpace industry. ... It targets a diverse customer base from commercial satellite companies to NASA to universities to smaller companies. It lives and breathes on taking innovative products to market.""

""The fact that SpaceX is now winning opportunities to launch satellites globally is a huge deal,"" said Carissa Christensen, managing partner at commercial space industry consulting firm Tauri Group. ""They've changed the conversation and shifted the ground to focus on price from the very beginning. And now they're starting to get a piece of this market that the U.S. hasn't been in for years.""

Indeed, the U.S. went from launching basically all the world's commercial satellites prior to the 1980s to launching virtually none of them a decade later as launch costs spiraled and companies like Arianespace offered less-expensive options. Currently, the U.S. government regularly spends upward of $200 million launching its most expensive and sensitive satellites into orbit, hiring United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, under non-competitive contracts to do so.

SpaceX may soon be eating away at ULA's market as well, one worth tens of billions of dollars. In April, SpaceX filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Air Force demanding it open up a block of 36 launches recently awarded to ULA under an exclusive contract. ULA claims it requires $225 million to launch a military satellite into orbit. SpaceX says it can do so for $100 million per launch, making it an appealing option if it can force the government to open the contracts for competition. Global events may work in the company's favor as well, as tensions continue to build between the U.S. and Russia, from which ULA sources some of its rocket engines.

""If they can get access to the military launch market, that is a substantial market,"" Christensen said. ""It also has historically been a fairly predictable and stable market, and that could be very significant for SpaceX.""

When SpaceX's next-gen heavy-lift rocket, the Falcon Heavy, flies for the first time early next year, SpaceX will also have the world's largest rocket in its portfolio, preparing it to compete with anyone in the marketplace on capability while leaving everyone behind on price, thanks to full ownership of its own product ecosystem.

The networks including CNBC's parent NBC as well as ABC, CBS, and Fox say Aereo steals free, over-the-air programming and then transmits that content to its online customers, without paying retransmission fees to the broadcasters.

Kanojia said Aereo should not be subject to retransmission fees, because they have ""nothing to do with copyright.""

The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 requires cable and pay-TV companies to get permission from broadcasters to show local and network programming. Part of that permission—designed at the time to protect the broadcasters—are those retransmission fees, which have grown into big business for the networks.

According to research firm SNL Kagan, retransmission fees paid by cable and other pay-TV services to broadcasters totaled $2.36 billion in 2012. That number is expected to nearly triple by 2018, accounting for 23 percent of total TV station revenue.

Kanojia said Aereo should be treated like a tech company, not a cable operator.

""Where would you draw the line? Would you say Sony has to pay a carriage fee now because the [TV] signal is being rendered on their television set?"" he asked. ""I supply technology. Of course, I'm allowed to do that. There's no restrictions.""



Aereo charges around $8 to $12 a month—a fraction of the cost of a typical monthly cable subscription. The service is available in about 11 cities, including New York, Miami, Boston, Atlanta, and Houston, with more on the way.

Many states point with great pride to the quality and availability of their workers, as well as government-sponsored programs to train them. We rate states based on the education level of their workforce, as well as the numbers of available workers. We also consider union membership and the states' right-to-work laws. While organized labor contends that a union workforce is a quality workforce, that argument, more often than not, does not resonate with business. We also look at the relative success of each state's worker-training programs in placing their participants in jobs.

Quality of Life (300 points)

The best places to do business are also the best places to live. We score the states on several factors, including crime rate and health care and the percent of the population with health insurance. We evaluate local attractions, parks and recreation, as well as environmental quality.

Technology & Innovation (300 points)

Succeeding in the new economy—or any economy—takes innovation. The top states for business prize innovation, nurture new ideas and have the infrastructure to support them. We evaluate the states on their support for innovation, the number of patents issued to their residents and the record of high-tech business formation. We also consider federal health, science and agricultural research grants to the states.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2014/0126/Grammys-2014-Barometer-of-what-Americans-are-listening-to","Grammys 2014: Barometer of what Americans are listening to","Advanced technology and shifting tastes have changed the face of the annual Grammy Awards. Rock music’s stature as the primary vehicle to express rebellion and individualism is over.

“Hey, hey, my, my/ Rock and roll will never die,” Neil Young once famously sang.

According to the Grammys, it’s already in the ground.

The Grammy Awards are often seen as a barometer of what most Americans are listening to online; on their radio, television, smart phone; and at their local amphitheater. The 56th annual awards, telecast Sunday from the Staples Center in Los Angeles, is no different. Leading in the highest profile categories are Daft Punk, Lorde, Bruno Mars, Robin Thicke, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Taylor Swift, and others, none of whom could be identified as making music within a traditional rock band setting or using a guitar as the primary instrument in their music.

Even though rock music remains an endurable fixture in the music that passes through our ears every day, it doesn’t sell as much as it once did. According to Nielsen SoundScan, R&B was the only genre to post an increase in sales in 2013, growing 1.2 percent. Even though rock represents double the sales of R&B, its sales have continually been stuck in reverse for years. Last year, sales slid nearly 6 percent. Despite the release last year of new albums by some of the biggest rock bands of the current moment – Pearl Jam, Queens of the Stone Age, and even veterans Black Sabbath – the biggest sellers were hit albums by Justin Timberlake, Mr. Thicke, and Ms. Swift.

Of course, predictions that guitar rock is on its way out are legion, dating back decades. In 1962, Dick Rowe, the Decca Records A&R man who famously rejected the Beatles, did so because he felt “guitar groups are on their way out.”

Mr. Rowe’s sentiments were relayed into the future many times when similar predictions were made in the era of disco, synthpop, and the early days of hip-hop.

However, the ax appeared sharpest in the mid-1990s when hip-hop emerged as a more culturally relevant music, and rock found itself in a crisis moment, trying to amalgamate rappers inside rock bands, and punk rock bands with turntable stylists. The fad inevitably produced a backlash – a “return to rock” wave featuring new bands such as the Strokes, the White Stripes, and the Vines – but even that vanished not long after it appeared.

Critical to this shift is how music is now consumed. Commercial radio has long moved away from rock formats, or at least the ones that showcase new rock bands. Classic rock prevails on the dial, so that anything new is considered niche, relegated to satellite channels, online outlets, and word of mouth. Digital music, and the ease of finding and accessing new music, is also helping train listeners to expand their tastes so that one band, one song, one sound no longer defines a single generation as it did decades earlier. Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young’s “Ohio” may sum up the Woodstock generation, and Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” may sum up Generation X. However, identifying that single song for Millennials is not that easy.

“Downloading music has changed the industry dramatically for the younger generation who do not have allegiance to any format of music,” says David Fiorenza, a Grammy voting member who teaches at Villanova University outside Philadelphia. “Rock is still around … but it’s not played on the radio except for the Foo Fighters.”

As rapid shifts in technology are changing how music is heard, they are also democratizing how it is made.

Laptop recording has opened the door for people to make beats on their own, without the need of instruments or even other people. That insular model is more affordable than the traditional guitar-bass-drum model that has sustained rock music for decades, and it has proved key to the organic evolution of replacing guitar-driven music meant for the rock club with more synthetic sounds that are meant for the dance floor. Back in the early 1990s, when underground bands first started experimenting with computers, a term was born: “post rock,” to describe music made without instruments traditionally associated with rock.

“Music’s not in the garage anymore; it’s in the bedroom,” says Devon Powers, who teaches music criticism and culture at Drexel University in Philadelphia. “Computers are the new musical instruments to do so many things, so you’re recording, mixing, and doing everything you used to do that required a huge studio and huge amount of capital.”

Another hurdle for new rock bands is competition from the older generation in sales. Catalog titles by veteran artists, such as Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” or anything by the Beatles, continue to have robust sales through reissue campaigns that started in the mid-1990s as a surefire way for record companies to make money in the era of illegal downloading.

John Covach, director of the Institute of Popular Music at the University of Rochester in New York State, says that new artists now “have to compete with the Beatles and everything in-between” when they release new music, which suggests the demise of the genre. His own students “don’t want to hear new rock; they think the better music is from the classic period.”

“When there doesn’t seem to be much innovation past a certain point, that’s really the first signs of the end of a style. In many ways, we’re seeing rock music receding and the classic rock artists have formed a canon, and like any kind of dying style, it’s very difficult to get attention at the tail end,” Professor Covach says.

The Recording Academy, the industry organization that produces the Grammy Awards, likewise appears to prefer rock music played by bands that produced their biggest hits 40 years ago. For example, dominating the rock categories this year are Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Paul McCartney, in performance with the surviving members of Nirvana, the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, and David Bowie. Shake your head very fast and you might think you were reading a list from 1972.

The industry’s leading producers also appear to prefer finding their hooks in nostalgia rather than taking a chance on something new. Last year’s hit album from Eminem borrows heavily from bedrock hooks by classic rockers Billy Squier and Joe Walsh, for example. There’s little mistake the album was co-produced by Rick Rubin, who is known for producing hit albums for many rock bands, including the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Metallica.

If rock music is losing its commercial vitality, it likely remains personally vital for some. No doubt budding guitarists are still learning riffs, and young hot bands are still working their way up through clubs. And there’s no denying the continued presence of artists such as Savages, Jack White, the Arctic Monkeys, or the Black Keys in keeping the flame alive.

But what is certain is that rock’s stature as the primary vehicle to express rebellion and individualism is over.

“This also has to do with the diversification of America as you have music with more Latin influence, more urban influences, and more women – that’s not to say they haven’t played rock, and they have – but you are getting new styles and influences and flavors coming forward,” Ms. Powers says. “Rock just has to share the stage with a lot of other stuff.”","2014-01-26 09:03:00","1","61.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","41.0","0.0","216.0","75.0","0.0","373.0","0.0","37.0","9","1236","89.01","61.16","39.59","34.17","25.22","22.41","81.80","43.69","6.88","2.18","0.16","0.16","0.57","0.16","1.13","4.69","8.09","14.24","6.72","4.13","6.47","1.46","12.38","6.23","3.16","1.38","1.29","2.35","2.59","1.54","1.05","0.16","0.57","0.16","6.47","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.24","9.55","1.86","2.18","0.65","2.43","0.73","2.67","5.74","1.13","3.72","0.57","1.29","0.57","0.32","0.08","0.40","5.91","1.05","1.46","3.24","0.81","0.32","3.32","7.77","0.65","15.53","2.02","6.72","7.04","3.40","7.93","0.32","0.89","0.40","0.32","0.65","0.08","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.20","4.37","7.77","0.08","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.73","2.59","1.86","0.00","0.49","5849","8.28","26.829787234042552","1799","1232","50","54.97","12.9","11.7","11.84","14.3","267","5.5","20.508831168831172","604","23.72","7","0.42","0","42","14","113","0","155","85","4","7","5","207","153","3","81","0","0","25","17","61","6","0","4","28","0","33","30","41","32","34","51","11","8","0","8"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2014/0820/White-House-could-announce-world-s-largest-marine-reserve-soon","White House could announce world's largest marine reserve soon","If the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument becomes a marine reserve, it would double the area globally subject to tight fishing restrictions. Other countries are also working to expand the area of such ocean havens.

If all goes as planned, before the year is out as much as 700,000 square miles of the south-central Pacific Ocean could be off limits to fishing, resource exploration, and other economic activities – courtesy of the stroke of a presidential pen in Washington.

The move would turn the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, established by President George W. Bush in 2009, into the world’s largest marine reserve. In the process it would double the area globally subject to such tight fishing restrictions.

“We anticipate sometime in late summer or early fall an announcement from the White House on their decision,” said Seth Horstmeyer, a director for the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Global Ocean Legacy program.

Well-designed and properly managed marine protected areas (MPAs) are widely seen in the conservation community as effective ways to restore vitality to overfished areas, shelter and nurture fish in the quest to develop sustainable fisheries, and act as reservoirs of biodiversity and resilience in the face of global warming and ocean acidification.

“They are the most practical tool we have available to us to protect ecosystems and keep them functioning and protect habitat” from a range of human-based threats, says Tundi Agardy, a marine biologist who heads Sound Seas, a marine-policy group in Washington.

Nor is the United States alone in working to expand the area of the oceans that would represent havens for marine life and the ecosystems that support it. In late July, for instance, Scotland announced the doubling of the area of its marine reserves – including what purports to be the largest MPA in Europe.

In February, Palau announced plans to extend full protections for marine life in some 80 percent of the waters embraced by its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. Kiribati has pledged to end commercial fishing by Jan. 1, 2015, in a California-size marine reserve it governs.

Meanwhile, Britain is weighing approval of a commercial-fishing-free zone around the Pitcairn Islands in the southeastern Pacific that would cover some 320,000 square miles.

These moves are part of an international effort under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity to protect 10 percent of the world’s oceans by 2020 (scientists advising the International Union for the Conservation of Nature have pushed for 20 percent).

So far, however, only about 1.8 percent of the world’s oceans are covered by some form of protection. Within that total, only about 0.6 percent falls under fishing bans, generally seen as the most effective form of MPA. Recent announcements nudge the needle toward the 2020 goal, but not as quickly as many conservation specialists would like.

Part of the challenge is coming up with the right design. In a study published in February in the journal Nature, marine scientists identified five features that determine a reserve’s chances of success: It’s part of a no-take zone, at least 10 years old, at least 62 square miles in size, well enforced, and isolated by deep water or sand. The most successful protected areas in the study had at least four of these traits. Of the five, isolation appeared to be the most important criterion. By that measure, the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument would fit the bill as a potential winner. The waters around the islands teem with life and host about as pristine a set of marine ecosystems as one can find anywhere.

Remote patches of sea represent also the low-hanging fruit for conservation. Local economic and political pushback to fishing or other restrictions is relatively weak. And regulations can often be adopted by executive order.

What Dr. Agardy dubs the race to announce the largest MPA says little about how well those areas will be managed and policed and how adequate their long-term funding will be. In the rush to designate protected areas by a certain date, “areas least needing protection are the ones that get designated” for protection, she says.

Soon, countries will have to increase their focus on near-shore waters – where economic interests are more deeply entrenched and where environmental problems generated far inland can flow down rivers to affect the quality of coastal waters, historically the most biologically productive.

Preservation efforts will be time-consuming and messy, requiring full participation from stakeholders from the outset in planning the protected area. “A lot of people would agree it takes usually a decade, a lot of give and take, and a lot of messy sausage-making” to lay the groundwork for an effective marine protected area, Agardy says.","2014-08-20 18:08:00","0","57.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","38.0","0.0","181.0","73.0","0.0","364.0","0.0","37.0","10","793","97.66","56.01","31.80","51.74","24.03","27.24","75.91","41.87","4.16","1.13","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.13","0.63","3.03","9.71","16.52","5.30","3.53","5.42","0.38","9.33","6.43","3.28","0.88","3.03","4.04","3.66","2.52","1.13","0.13","0.13","0.50","3.03","0.00","0.13","0.13","0.00","7.57","1.13","1.26","1.64","2.90","0.38","1.51","2.52","0.88","0.76","0.63","1.89","0.25","0.76","0.00","0.50","7.94","0.76","1.89","3.15","1.01","1.89","0.88","6.05","1.39","17.28","1.64","12.48","3.15","5.04","1.01","0.13","1.01","0.13","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.38","0.00","13.62","4.29","5.17","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.77","1.01","0.76","0.50","0.00","3939","8.67","25.806451612903224","1215","780","35","48.84","13.3","12.0","13.35","14.3","194","8.1","20.86871794871795","410","23.23","5","0.4","0","23","23","87","0","104","76","1","7","16","131","74","2","57","0","0","12","5","30","1","5","4","21","0","36","7","12","21","16","17","5","3","0","4"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2014/1029/In-Ebola-disputes-keep-focus-on-health-workers","In Ebola disputes, keep focus on health workers","A common theme that can help resolve Ebola disputes – such as issues over medical protocols and quarantines – is the desire to support healing professionals in West Africa.

Moses Jarba, center, and others gather for an Oct. 29 prayer service organized in response to the Ebola outbreak in Africa and attended by Liberia's ambassador to the United States, Jeremiah Sulunteh, at Saint James Episcopal Church in Lancaster, Pa.

Since the Ebola crisis erupted, the United States has had two big disputes over what to do about it. The first was over medical protocols found inadequate in a Dallas hospital. Later the issue was whether to quarantine health workers returning from West Africa. In each case, a consensus had to be found that balances public concerns about the Ebola virus and the best protection against it.

A common theme ran through these disputes: Let’s raise the level of support for health workers in the affected countries. This was the unifying focus in order to contain Ebola (“source control”).

Even though the science on Ebola remains unsettled, West Africa needs more people in the healing professions – and more support of those brave workers. An article in the Oct. 27 New England Journal of Medicine summed it up:

“As we continue to learn more about this virus, its transmission, and associated illness, we must continue to revisit our approach to its control and treatment. We should be guided by the science and not the tremendous fear that this virus evokes.

“We should be honoring, not quarantining, health care workers who put their lives at risk not only to save people suffering from Ebola virus disease in West Africa but also to help achieve source control, bringing the world closer to stopping the spread of this killer epidemic.”

On two measures, the US “approach” has shifted. One, donations for Ebola relief efforts finally took off in recent weeks, and not only from wealthy people such as Mark Zuckerberg and Paul Allen. Small donors have begun to give. And two, the latest poll shows that fear among Americans of a family member contracting Ebola has dropped from 43 percent to 36 percent.

As the fear has declined, empathy has risen for the people in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, and especially for the health workers on the front line. Both with money and prayers, more Americans are responding.

President Obama promised to track any returning health worker “in a prudent fashion.” But he added this: “We want to make sure that we understand that they are doing God’s work over there, and they’re doing that to keep us safe.”

The World Bank estimates the three countries need at least 5,000 more health workers. That demand can be met as the fear of Ebola subsides and support for the healing work rises.","2014-10-29 14:56:00","0","50.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","40.0","0.0","188.0","75.0","0.0","371.0","0.0","37.0","10","466","94.01","70.43","19.68","66.39","19.42","23.18","79.40","44.64","7.73","2.79","0.00","2.15","0.00","0.21","0.43","4.94","7.94","16.09","5.79","2.79","5.58","0.86","11.59","5.15","3.43","0.64","2.58","2.58","6.01","4.08","1.93","1.50","0.21","0.43","6.22","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.43","7.94","1.07","1.93","1.72","0.43","0.86","2.15","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.00","3.65","0.00","3.65","0.00","0.00","12.88","4.08","3.43","5.58","1.50","1.07","3.00","7.94","0.43","14.59","1.72","9.66","3.00","4.72","0.21","0.21","0.86","1.29","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.81","5.15","5.36","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.36","0.86","0.43","0.00","2212","7.91","24.736842105263158","659","468","24","68.6","10.9","8.5","11.26","11.5","98","8.4","18.17606837606838","264","22.74","3","0.44","0","18","11","48","0","61","19","5","3","5","75","56","3","33","0","0","14","4","12","0","0","2","18","0","22","10","11","12","12","13","1","2","0","0"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2014/1005/A-first-responder-to-the-fear-of-Ebola","A first responder to the fear of Ebola","Compassion toward Ebola patients starts to kick in as more people, especially health-care workers, put fear and prejudice in their place. The crisis demands a humanitarian response as much as isolation of Ebola.

Even before a case of Ebola was diagnosed in the United States last month, a Harvard University poll recorded a high level of fear among Americans. Four of 10 people were concerned about an outbreak. One in 4 said he or she or a family member would succumb within a year.

With such public anxiety, compassion was hard to find for the family who has lived in an apartment with Thomas Duncan, the Ebola patient in Dallas, before he sought treatment at a hospital. As their apartment needed to be cleaned, no one wanted to give them a place to live.

But then Dallas County’s top elected official, Judge Clay Jenkins, stepped in. He found homeowners willing to take them in. “There is a lot of misinformation and erroneous fear,” he told reporters. “The people that are being monitored are real people, too – that need your prayers.”

His reaction – one of not letting irrational fear get in the way of compassion – has become more common as more people around the world, especially health-care workers, put hope above fear and action before retreat.

In the West Africa nations hit by Ebola, hundreds are now volunteering for jobs as nurses or other front-line workers. Hundreds more from other countries are heading to Africa. “It’s almost a privilege to be there and just hold a hand,” Dr. Hernando Garzon, an emergency department physician in Sacramento, Calif., told the Sacramento Bee, before his trip to Sierra Leone.

West Africa needs more than medical supplies to counter Ebola. It and the rest of the world first need to put the fear of Ebola and a prejudice toward its victims in their proper place.

“We talk about stigma and ignorance in Liberia, but let’s be frank, there’s plenty of stigma and ignorance in our own countries, and irrational fear of being on the ground. We have an obligation to counter that fear,” Sheldon Yett, the UNICEF country representative in Liberia, told The Globe and Mail of Toronto.

Much of the foreign aid being sent to West Africa is designed to contain the outbreak. The US, for example, has sent soldiers to build medical facilities. Governments have a huge capacity to act quickly. But just as important are individuals who decide to act simply to bring healing to both victims and entire nations.

“Charities and individual philanthropies have given generously and they can make a big difference,” President Obama said. “And more citizens – of all nations – can educate themselves on this crisis, contribute to relief efforts, and call on their leaders to act. So everybody can do something.”

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, for example, pledged $50 million, perhaps the largest private donation so far. But smaller donors are stepping up. They see the crisis as much as a humanitarian need as one of self-preservation. That instinct of love took a while to kick in. But now it has put a fear of Ebola in its place.","2014-10-05 09:43:00","0","51.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","40.0","0.0","177.0","75.0","0.0","371.0","0.0","37.0","10","528","93.54","82.33","25.48","15.17","17.03","22.73","82.01","46.78","7.20","4.17","0.00","0.95","0.19","1.33","1.70","3.03","7.95","17.42","6.06","3.79","7.20","0.38","13.26","5.87","4.73","0.38","2.27","2.65","6.06","2.46","3.22","2.27","0.38","0.19","10.98","0.38","0.00","0.19","1.14","7.39","1.14","0.57","1.52","1.52","0.95","2.46","1.14","0.38","0.38","0.38","2.46","0.19","2.08","0.00","0.00","8.33","2.46","1.33","4.17","0.76","0.57","3.41","9.09","0.76","16.29","2.46","11.17","2.65","2.27","0.38","0.95","0.57","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.48","6.25","6.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.76","2.27","0.76","0.00","0.19","2455","7.86","18.344827586206897","774","529","33","63.7","10.7","8.4","10.55","9.4","115","7.25","17.095652173913045","294","16.9","2","0.46","0","24","8","46","0","70","31","4","1","4","86","53","3","33","0","0","16","10","22","3","0","1","22","0","27","18","7","14","14","10","1","2","0","0"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Movies/2014/0207/The-Monuments-Men-is-lackluster-despite-a-great-premise-and-cast","'The Monuments Men' is lackluster despite a great premise and cast","As “The Monuments Men” plodded along, I kept asking myself why a movie with such a great subject, with such a good cast, was so lackluster. Based, as they say, on a true story (the source material is a book by Robert M. Edsel), it’s about a cadre of art historians, sculptors, theater impresarios, and restorers who served the Allied cause by rescuing stolen masterpieces from the Nazis in the waning days of World War II.

Heading up the team is Frank Stokes, played by George Clooney, who also directed and co-wrote the script (with Grant Heslov). Along for the mission are men played by Bill Murray, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville, and Matt Damon. Since none of these men are striplings, much wheezy humor is expended on how unschooled they are in the ways of war. It’s like an over-the-hill gang variant on “The Dirty Dozen,” except not as much fun as that sounds.

The central question posed by the movie, over and over again, is: Should anyone risk his or her own life, or the lives of others, trying to save a masterpiece? The answer here appears to be a qualified “yes.” Frank makes puffed up pronouncements to F.D.R. about how “art is the very foundation of modern society.” I would have felt better hearing this if the filmmakers had shown a bit more reverence for the great art they so meagerly place on display.

Cate Blanchett, complete with cutting-edge French accent, turns up as Claire Simone, based on the real-life art curator for Paris’s Jeu de Paume museum. Suspicious at first of the Monuments Men, she warms to Damon’s James Granger, even giving him a fancy tie as an enticement for some ooh-la-la. Claire spends most of the movie looking gaunt and drab – a dead giveaway that there will come a scene when she unlooses her hair, ditches the uncomely specs, and wears lipstick and bright colors. She is, after all, French.

Hot tip: A much better movie dealing with a similar scenario is John Frankenheimer’s 1964 “The Train,” starring Burt Lancaster, about the French Resistance hijacking a shipment of Germany-bound art treasures.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Movies/2014/0411/The-Railway-Man-Colin-Firth-portrays-a-former-POW-who-confronts-an-enemy","'The Railway Man': Colin Firth portrays a former POW who confronts an enemy","Firth plays real-life figure Eric Lomax, a British POW who was kept prisoner by the Japanese and decades later seeks out the man who oversaw his torture.

“The Railway Man,” starring Colin Firth, is based on the autobiography of Eric Lomax, a British POW who was forced as a young officer by the Japanese to work on the infamous “Death Railway” connecting Burma and Siam during World War II. Tortured mercilessly, he survived, psychologically scarred. Decades later, he discovered that Takashi Nagase (Hiroyuki Sanada), the Japanese interpreter who had overseen the torture, was alive and acting as a tour guide at the same internment camp where Lomax once was held.

With his wife, Patti (Nicole Kidman), Lomax decides to seek out and confront Nagase. The film, directed by Jonathan Teplitzky and written by Andy Paterson and Frank Cottrell Boyce, is designed to put us in the place of its protagonist and ask, “What would you have done?”

Lomax’s well-publicized real-life confrontation – which was also the subject of a documentary and a television drama – resulted improbably in forgiveness and friendship. The film rises or falls on the believability of that reconciliation. Much of the time it falters.

Firth is very good at playing racked men of high principle. He’s so well cast as Lomax that, at times, he’s almost too perfect in the role. He’s still the best thing about the movie. As an actor, Firth can sometimes seem a bit bland and hollowed out, but as Lomax, all that soulful vacancy makes sense. We can see how this man’s passion for trains and train schedules (a passion he carried from boyhood) became a cruel irony when he was yoked to the “Death Railway.” And yet he retained that love into his adulthood after the war. It’s what keeps him sane.

It is on a train in Scotland that he first meets Patti and falls instantly in love. She becomes his redeemer. With the help of a fellow POW survivor played by Stellan Skarsgaard, she breaks through his code of silence about the war’s horrors. Patti’s is a thankless role, though – she does a lot of standing by her man, but we never see much of her own torments. She’s St. Patti.

About half the film is framed as wartime flashbacks from the Firth scenes set in the 1980s (though they seem to be set in the 1940s). Jeremy Irvine (from “War Horse”) plays the young Lomax with a staunch affability even in the most excruciating situations. When the Japanese discover that the young officer has constructed a radio receiver out of pilfered parts, they torture him so mercilessly, including waterboarding, that I couldn’t help wondering why the filmmakers didn’t give Firth a limp or a scar or something to mark him. Lomax as an adult is as unscathed on the outside as he isn’t on the inside.

Teplitzky has deliberately made an old-fashioned movie on the assumption, I suppose, that anything newfangled would detract from the redemption scenario. (It’s no accident that the 1980s scenes look 40 years out of step.) But old-fashioned here too often comes across as staid, even in the internment camp scenes, with their tastefully composed shots of brutality. Despite the subject matter, there is nothing jolting about the horrors in “The Railway Man.” Perhaps the filmmakers believed that if the flashbacks were even more gruesome, we would not believe Lomax’s ultimate act of reconciliation.

They’ve rigged the game. Love beats hate. It’s a nice sentiment – even a necessary one. To convincingly dramatize it, however, many more psychological layers are needed than this film provides.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2014/0820/Putin-s-backward-gaze","Putin’s backward gaze","By moving on Ukraine, Vladimir Putin looks to the past when he should be envisioning a fresh future for Russia.

UKRAINE-CRISIS/PUTIN RTR42H3S 14 Aug. 2014 Yalta, Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting in Yalta, Crimea, Aug. 14, 2014. Putin said on Thursday Russia would stand up for itself but not at the cost of confrontation with the outside world, a conciliatory note after months of tough rhetoric over the crisis in Ukraine.

Is Vladimir Putin a genius, a Russian chess master thinking several moves ahead of the West in the diplomatic and military confrontation playing out in Ukraine?

He sends a column of trucks toward that country purportedly carrying humanitarian aid while at the same time sending in convoys of arms for the Russian-backed rebels fighting just inside the eastern border. And now he’s suddenly speaking in conciliatory tones, ready to talk with Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko, in an Aug. 26 face-to-face meeting.

Is he a mastermind brilliantly pushing for advantage in every facet of the Ukraine problem?

A more useful view might be that of a desperate Russian leader trying to make his country relevant in a world that is passing it by.

When a country loses its sense of direction and purpose, a foreign adventure can serve as a handy unifying force.

Instead of looking ahead, President Putin is looking backward longingly at imperial and Soviet Russia. He’s attempting to energize his country around the idea of reuniting Russian-speakers in now independent former Soviet states with Mother Russia.

Putin’s Russia is rich in natural resources, including oil and gas. But that isn’t the foundation of a diversified, 21st-century economy. Russia’s population is stagnant. Yes, its oligarchs have become super-rich, but not through innovation: According to one source, Russia ranks behind the US state of Alabama in the number of patents it has been awarded in the past decade.

Here’s the rub: The decline of Russia isn’t in the interests of the world. Western economic sanctions may be useful in the short run, but the goal is a stable Russia that is engaged economically and otherwise with Europe, the United States, and the world, not a sickly and isolated Russian bear.

The government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel has stepped in and engaged Putin in talks that should aim at finding a way to keep Ukraine intact as an independent, neutral buffer state between the European Union and Russia. That “soft power” role is an appropriate one for Germany as a thriving democracy and Europe’s leading economic power.

That effort should free the US to stand back and play the long game of carrots and sticks aimed at inducing Russia to turn away from an expansionist policy. Taking steps to make Russia’s incursion into Ukraine more costly (already begun with sanctions) and boosting Ukraine’s economy are two actions.

Russia has strong emotional ties to Ukraine, an important region of the old Soviet Union. Its loss, as one Russia-watcher has put it, is like “the pain an amputee feels in a phantom limb.”

Putin and Russia may long for what now seem like grander days of empire under czars and communists. But those are roads to a past that can’t be repeated. Putin’s energy would be better spent on building a different, new Russia, one whose prosperity is based on cooperation, not confrontation, with its neighbors.","2014-08-20 15:31:00","0","59.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","43.0","0.0","188.0","77.0","0.0","386.0","0.0","37.0","10","567","97.29","55.60","44.08","52.22","19.55","25.40","76.72","45.15","5.11","1.59","0.00","0.35","0.00","1.23","0.00","3.53","9.88","16.93","6.70","2.12","5.11","1.23","11.64","4.59","2.29","0.71","1.76","0.71","6.53","3.88","2.47","0.18","0.88","0.71","4.94","0.18","0.18","0.18","1.23","7.94","1.59","1.76","1.06","1.06","0.18","2.65","2.47","0.88","0.53","0.71","1.06","0.53","0.53","0.00","0.00","8.29","1.41","2.65","3.70","1.06","0.88","1.41","8.64","1.06","18.17","2.82","10.93","4.76","3.70","0.71","0.18","1.94","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","15.52","4.76","5.11","0.35","0.00","0.35","0.00","1.41","0.71","2.29","0.35","0.18","2728","8.25","23.2","836","558","28","59.74","12.5","9.9","12.24","12.5","128","8.9","19.135627240143368","310","21.28","7","0.43","0","21","9","58","1","82","61","1","0","10","89","73","1","27","0","0","9","6","21","2","0","3","12","0","23","4","23","10","5","21","4","1","1","2"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2014/0610/Rape-in-wartime-A-plan-to-end-it","Rape in wartime: A plan to end it","Angelina Jolie and Britain's top diplomat, William Hague, are dashing myths about the use of rape as a war tool. The world can work to end this crime, as seen in a summit in London this week.

Foreign Secretary William Hague and actress Angelina Jolie arrive at the 'End Sexual Violence in Conflict' summit in London June 10. They are hosting a four-day summit on sexual violence in war zones, attended by officials from over 100 countries.

Angelina Jolie and William Hague are an unlikely team. Yet for two years the Hollywood star and the British foreign secretary have worked together to create a radical shift in worldwide thinking. They want an end to the common assumption that mass rape will take place in any war.

On Tuesday, they opened the first global summit on the issue with representatives from more than 100 countries in attendance at a London venue. Like any reformer who takes on a seemingly impossible goal, their first task has been to challenge an unexamined assumption about sexual violence during wartime.

“It is a myth that rape is an inevitable part of conflict,” Ms. Jolie stated at the London conference. “There’s nothing inevitable about it.""

Her assertion is not mere words. For two decades, ever since an estimated 50,000 women were raped during the war in Bosnia, many global institutions have begun to condemn wartime rape and seek ways to prevent it. The United Nations Security Council put a spotlight on the issue in 2000 and then later acknowledged that rape had become a tool of warfare. That helped the International Criminal Court to prosecute such crimes.

But it is Jolie and Mr. Hague who have provided the tightest and most consistent focus by working toward a global shift in attitudes that will “consign this vile abuse to history,” as Hague says, in much the same way that the transatlantic slave trade was ended during the 19th century. They hope to keep a harsh spotlight on the use of rape in conflicts from Congo to Syria to Colombia.

The London summit has practical aims, such as devising a common method for investigating and documenting cases of sexual violence in a conflict. Organizers also hope to push countries to train soldiers and peacekeepers to prevent sexual violence. Britain already has a unique team of more than 70 experts who can be quickly deployed to trouble spots to deal with mass rape.

“We need to shatter the culture of impunity and make justice the norm, not the exception, for these crimes,” says Jolie, who took up this cause after producing a film, “The Land of Blood and Honey,” about sexual violence during the Bosnian conflict. She also serves as a special envoy for the UN commissioner for refugees.

Her second most important message during the summit was aimed at women who have been raped during war. She wants them to help end the culture of shame that surrounds such an act. “We must send a message around the world that there is no disgrace in being a survivor of sexual violence – that the shame is on the aggressor,” she said.

Taking an absolutist stance against rape is an important way to help abolish it. In India on Monday, the new government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised “zero tolerance” toward violence against women, a policy prompted by several recent rape-murders. Earlier this year, top generals in the American military announced a similar policy after fresh scrutiny of sexual assaults in the armed forces.

Over the past century, more nations have adopted policies to avoid the abuse of civilians during conflicts. Now may be an ideal time to make one of the worst abuses, rape, a relic of humanity’s barbarous past.","2014-06-10 16:50:00","0","52.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","183.0","76.0","0.0","383.0","0.0","37.0","10","625","98.44","66.71","26.77","1.00","20.83","22.88","78.72","44.32","6.08","2.08","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.80","0.96","4.00","10.56","17.60","5.60","2.56","3.36","0.64","9.76","4.96","4.00","0.80","2.40","1.76","8.48","1.92","6.56","0.48","4.00","0.00","5.92","0.00","0.16","1.28","0.00","6.72","0.96","1.44","1.28","1.76","0.96","1.28","1.12","0.16","0.48","0.32","3.36","0.16","0.00","3.20","0.00","9.60","1.44","2.24","5.28","0.80","0.96","2.88","6.72","1.12","17.12","0.96","9.28","6.72","3.36","0.64","0.00","0.32","0.16","1.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.64","5.12","4.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","2.24","0.80","0.00","0.00","2924","7.92","20.933333333333334","909","623","32","60.14","12.0","9.7","10.91","11.2","131","6.333333333333333","18.21091492776886","327","19.67","1","0.44","0","13","12","75","0","94","55","3","1","6","115","55","0","35","1","0","15","3","13","1","2","1","21","0","26","13","10","16","15","17","3","5","0","0"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Culture-Cafe/2014/1205/Peter-Pan-Live!-How-it-upended-hate-watchers-expectations","'Peter Pan Live!': How it upended hate-watchers' expectations","'The Sound of Music Live!,' NBC's previous live musical production, received poor reviews but huge ratings. 'Pan' surprised many by being a fairly good show, with even critics who disliked it admitting that it was better than 'Music.'

Last year, more than 18 million viewers tuned into NBC’s production “The Sound of Music Live!,” making it a ratings hit for the network. But it was a guilty pleasure for many viewers: many critics disliked the production, with Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy writing that “the only real problem was the real reason most people tuned in: Carrie Underwood… [there was] zero chemistry with her love interest and lacked any intensity or shading.” Hank Stuever of the Washington Post called Underwood “as flat as the label on a Swiss Miss package of cocoa.”

This year, however, was a different story. Star Allison Williams insisted before the broadcast of NBC’s newest musical, “Peter Pan Live!,” that “Pan” can’t be “hate-watched” the way “Music” was. “’Peter Pan,’ you cannot watch cynically,” Williams, who portrayed the Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up, told Us Weekly before the broadcast.

And some critics agree with her post-broadcast, writing that the quality of the “Pan” production was far above last year’s “Music.” “ NBC… acquitted itself worthily, earnestly, sometimes ploddingly and, at a few golden moments, magically,” Deadline writer Jeremy Gerard wrote of the show. “If you were prepared to hoot and howl over the casting of Allison Williams… well, your snark went unrequited. This was a much better production than last year’s Sound Of Music Live!” Gerard praised the rest of the cast as well as Williams.

Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz agreed, writing, “Something incredible happened. Peter Pan Live! wasn’t an epic failure. It was something much more shocking to the American public. It was… fine. Totally fine. Just as I’d suspected. Nothing spectacular. But nothing so embarrassing as NBC’s live production of The Sound of Music… Maybe the most surprising thing about Peter Pan Live! was that it largely wiped the spite off Twitter for a few hours.” USA Today critic Mark Bianco was also mostly won over, writing, “Thursday's live musical on NBC didn't always soar, but it did generally manage to stay off the ground.""

Not all reviewers agreed about the overall quality of the show – Kennedy wrote that “Pan” “needed a lot more fairy dust… [it] was an oddly ponderous, disconnected, disjointed and jerky mess.” However, he noted, “To be sure, the new show lifted the bar technically, making ""The Sound of Music Live!"" seem like summer stock in comparison.”

If NBC's live productions keep improving, be prepared to be wowed by their next scheduled musical, ""The Music Man.""","2014-12-05 10:04:00","0","47.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","41.0","0.0","191.0","75.0","0.0","375.0","0.0","37.0","9","448","90.39","50.89","10.26","59.59","16.00","23.66","77.90","40.40","7.37","2.01","0.22","0.22","0.67","0.67","0.22","5.36","8.93","12.05","5.58","3.57","4.91","1.79","13.62","7.37","4.91","0.67","0.67","3.57","7.59","4.69","2.90","0.45","0.67","0.45","5.36","0.00","0.00","0.45","0.67","12.28","1.12","2.23","1.34","3.79","1.34","4.02","6.03","1.79","4.02","0.22","2.90","0.00","2.46","0.00","0.22","4.24","0.67","1.34","1.79","0.89","0.67","6.70","5.58","0.45","10.04","0.89","4.24","4.91","5.13","3.57","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.89","0.00","0.22","0.22","0.45","0.00","30.80","6.70","7.59","0.45","0.00","0.00","1.56","0.45","8.48","4.69","0.00","0.89","2147","8.0","21.952380952380953","660","448","29","64.3","10.6","8.1","12.18","10.5","102","7.083333333333334","17.267142857142858","254","20.29","9","0.41","0","10","3","45","0","52","50","2","1","1","65","83","0","13","0","0","14","4","26","3","1","2","5","0","12","40","10","9","7","0","0","2","0","0"

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2014/0514/Less-than-40-percent-of-12th-graders-ready-for-college-analysis-finds","Less than 40 percent of 12th-graders ready for college, analysis finds","Results from NAEP, also known as the 'nation's report card,' have now been linked with academic preparedness for college. Currently, at least a quarter of college students need to take remedial-level courses.

Cornelia Orr, Executive Director, National Assessment Governing Board pauses before she begins a program at Dunbar High School on May in Washington to announce results of The Nation's Report Card: 2013 Mathematics and Reading, Grade 12, which details 12th graders' performance in mathematics and reading nationwide and in 13 pilot states.

Less than 40 percent of America’s 12th-graders are academically prepared for college, according to results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), often known as the ""nation’s report card.""

Twelfth-grade math and reading results for NAEP were released last week, and now on Wednesday, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for the first time linked those results with academic preparedness for college. The results were sobering. Just 39 percent of 12th-graders have the math skills needed for entry-level college course work, and 38 percent have the necessary reading skills.

“Our job is to be the gold standard, the truth-teller,” says David Driscoll, chair of the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policy for NAEP. “But clearly this is not acceptable, so I’m hoping people will get energized about this.”

Linking the NAEP scores to college readiness is the result of a 10-year effort on the part of the governing board – an attempt to make the tests a better indicator of preparedness and to give a clear picture of how ready students are to succeed in college in at least basic-level credit-bearing courses, without taking remedial classes.

Researchers investigated the skills needed in college and compared NAEP with other assessments for seniors, like SATs and ACTs. Mr. Driscoll says he feels highly confident that the NAEP scores are a good indicator of students’ preparedness.

The board did not feel comfortable linking the scores to career preparedness, where the skill sets needed are so varied.

To be considered academically prepared for college, seniors needed to score at least a 302 on NAEP’s reading test, which matches the “proficient” category, and at least a 163 on NAEP’s mathematics test, which falls between the ""basic” and “proficient” categories.

These results, Driscoll notes, don’t include dropouts, which would have made the final statistics even worse. “In some urban schools,” he says, “they lose half their kids by the 12th grade.”

The concept of “college and career readiness” has been a focus of education reformers for some time, who are concerned that while graduation rates may be inching up, many students are leaving high school without the preparation they need for what lies beyond.

“A lot of times we’re getting kids to graduate by asking less of them, not more of them,” says David Conley, director of the Center for Educational Policy Research at the University of Oregon in Eugene.

“The question we have to ask ourselves is, how is it that we have probably twice that number of kids taking college-type prep courses, and yet only half of them are getting to the knowledge level they need? What’s going on in courses that are supposed to prepare kids for college?” Professor Conley asks.

Current NCES statistics, he says, show that about a quarter of college students need to take remedial-level courses (which aren’t credit-bearing), though he and other researchers think the actual number may be twice as much.

The students who fall into that remediation category tend to be disproportionately minority and low-income – the very students who are already underrepresented in college. The need for remediation drives up student debt and the cost of higher education, and it increases the likelihood that students won’t complete college, Conley says. “And if you look at where the economy is going, these are the people who are going to have to have at least some college if they’re going to succeed in this new economy, where most jobs require some kind of certificate,” he adds.

As dismal as the NAEP results are, they are actually higher than some other attempts to gauge seniors’ readiness for college. College readiness benchmarks set from the ACT – the most popular college entrance exam – have shown only about a quarter of ACT test-takers are prepared to succeed in college.

The lack of readiness is a problem for the US economy, says Driscoll. “We see our kids losing their place [compared with students in other countries], and there’s no question that the jobs of the future are going to require other skills,” he says. “But to me it’s more a moral imperative. We owe it to our kids. It’s not their fault. We should be holding them to higher standards.”","2014-05-14 17:34:00","0","57.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","185.0","76.0","0.0","386.0","0.0","37.0","9","794","90.95","68.38","11.29","56.71","24.06","26.57","85.52","45.21","8.69","4.03","0.25","1.39","0.13","0.88","1.39","4.66","7.81","15.49","7.30","3.40","4.41","1.26","14.61","5.79","3.40","2.14","2.27","3.02","3.53","2.52","0.88","0.00","0.13","0.38","7.30","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.76","10.83","2.14","1.64","2.02","2.64","0.76","2.52","1.89","0.63","1.01","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.20","1.39","2.39","4.41","2.27","0.76","1.76","10.83","2.77","11.71","1.26","7.43","3.02","14.11","0.00","0.00","1.26","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.40","4.03","6.05","0.13","0.00","0.25","0.00","1.76","3.53","2.64","0.76","0.25","3860","8.14","27.033333333333335","1182","785","33","55.78","12.5","11.4","12.94","14.8","165","12.25","19.927643312101914","360","24.07","17","0.45","0","21","13","75","0","105","45","6","5","5","125","73","1","67","1","0","31","6","30","2","2","2","26","0","27","11","22","19","40","32","7","6","0","5"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2014/0610/Common-Core-battered-by-midterm-politics-gets-higher-ed-support.-Too-late","Common Core, battered by midterm politics, gets higher-ed support. Too late?","The midterms 'can't come soon enough' for Common Core, which has been taking fire from both the left and right. Higher Ed for Higher Standards says it hopes to debunk Common Core myths.

Stacey Jacobson-Francis helps her 6-year-old daughter Luci with her math homework at their home in Berkeley, Calif., May 14. Stacey said her daughter’s homework requires her to know four different ways to add. 'That is way too much to ask of a first grader,' she says.

A new coalition of Common Core supporters, this time from the higher-education community, announced itself Tuesday. Its mission: to raise awareness about the importance of the standards and try to counter the spread of misinformation and the growing backlash against the standards.

It's a battle that has become central in the education world lately, and is spilling out into more general debate, as Common Core becomes a key issue in many midterm campaigns.

In the past two weeks, South Carolina and Oklahoma have joined Indiana in dropping the standards, bringing the number of states with Common Core down to 43. Tea Party candidates and many Republicans have started using opposition to Common Core as a sort of litmus test, with many referring to it as ""ObamaCore."" On the left, a growing number of educators have raised concerns over the standards for early-elementary grades, and have pushed for a slow-down on Common Core implementation and high-stakes accountability. And a number of states have announced they no longer plan to use one of the two big assessments being developed to align with Common Core.

""For supporters of Common Core, the November elections can’t come soon enough,"" says Patrick McGuinn, a political science and education professor at Drew University. ""Common Core has become a real symbol, and is being talked about in this ideological way. The debate is not about the standards.""

Common Core was the result of a state-led effort to develop a uniform set of high-quality standards that built on each other, emphasized critical thinking skills, and prepared high school graduates to be ready for college and careers, and was initially adopted by 46 states and the District of Columbia – a remarkable achievement, especially given how quickly the adoption occurred.

But over the past year, backlash to the standards, both from the right, who tend to see Common Core as the sign of federal intrusion into education, and the left, who view it as a sign of privatization of education and another piece in a growing body of accountability reforms, has ballooned. Common Core advocates have been slow to respond – in part, notes Professor McGuinn, because they are so decentralized – and are now working to put out flames and spread a different message, explaining to the public both what the standards are, and what they aren't.

""There are a lot of myths out there, and bad information,"" said John Morgan, chancellor of the Tennessee Board of Regents, in a phone call with reporters to announce a new higher-ed coalition in support of Common Core, Higher Ed for Higher Standards. ""When you really explain to people this is about college-ready standards, not about how to teach or about curriculum ... that’s a message that resonates.""

Mr. Morgan and Nancy Zimpher, chancellor of the State University of New York, emphasized the stake higher education has in Common Core remaining intact, particularly given the large number of college students who currently enter school unprepared. Some 50 percent of students entering two-year colleges and 20 percent of students entering four-year institutions require some form of remediation – a factor that's a huge contributor to students not graduating on time or at all from college.

""If we let these standards go it will be decades before we will be able to rally 45 or 50 states in the kind of work that was done to get these standards,"" said Ms. Zimpher in the call. More than 200 college and university leaders from 33 states have signed onto the new coalition.

But in some ways, the original idea behind Common Core – the idea that it would be a quiet, seamless, nonpartisan move that would make it easy to compare students across states – has already been lost, says Frederick Hess, director of Education Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. And a bigger concern to supporters than states dropping out may well be the number of states who are no longer planning to use the new assessments, or who are keeping the standards but not really implementing them, says Mr. Hess.

In a few years, Hess says, ""Common Core advocates are going to want to say we should only be judged on these 15 states that are really serious, but research and evaluation will compare all these 40, for most of which it’s just words on paper.""

Also on Tuesday, Vicki Phillips, director of education for the Gates Foundation – a major catalyst behind Common Core, and subject of an much-discussed Washington Post piece this weekend – published a letter calling for a two-year moratorium on using Common Core assessments for high-stakes decisions on teacher evaluation or student promotion.

The letter was well-received by many educators, and such a delay on high-stakes accountability could help quell some of the criticism on the left, says McGuinn.

""If you suspend accountability for two to three years, a lot of the political problems around Common Core, the mounting opposition, certainly from the left, goes away,"" he says.

But even as advocates rush to change the message, educate the public, and counter the backlash, they're not always reading the situation right, says Hess, and their refusal to take seriously some of the concerns that have been voiced are making their job harder.

""They keep trying to get more megaphones, try to get more people talking, but I’m not sure the things they’re saying are the kinds of stuff that will quiet the nerves of the people on either the right or the left,"" says Hess.","2014-06-10 18:40:00","1","58.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","43.0","0.0","185.0","76.0","0.0","387.0","0.0","37.0","9","1005","94.49","62.50","43.37","40.04","30.45","22.89","79.90","45.27","6.27","1.99","0.10","0.30","0.20","0.60","0.80","4.28","8.96","15.82","6.77","3.18","5.57","1.09","13.83","7.36","2.99","1.19","2.19","3.38","2.39","1.59","0.80","0.00","0.30","0.10","7.26","0.20","0.00","0.70","0.10","9.05","1.49","1.29","0.90","2.39","0.70","3.38","2.39","0.20","1.99","0.20","0.30","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.10","8.46","1.09","1.59","5.07","0.80","0.30","2.79","8.76","1.19","16.52","2.19","8.56","4.08","6.77","0.20","0.40","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","16.02","3.88","6.97","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.79","1.79","1.49","0.00","0.00","4767","8.18","31.78125","1475","996","34","50.2","13.4","13.5","12.25","16.7","195","6.571428571428571","21.551325301204823","451","27.47","2","0.44","0","44","21","109","0","125","60","10","1","11","145","105","1","76","2","0","24","8","39","1","0","4","34","0","43","14","29","24","34","30","12","7","0","3"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2014/0626/New-test-could-hint-at-nuclear-weapons-inspections-of-the-future","New test could hint at nuclear weapons inspections of the future","How can nuclear weapons inspections determine if a warhead is real or fake without opening it up and giving away national secrets? Scientists have devised a test.

This file photo shows a mockup of a Minuteman 3 nuclear missile used for training by missile maintenance crews at F. E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. Scientists have come up with a novel way to help verify reductions in nuclear warheads.

Researchers in the US and Britain say they have devised a simplified way to verify reductions in nuclear warheads that would meet the need of future arms control agreements while at the same time keeping information about a warhead's design secret.

The prospect for leaks of classified weapon-design information has been a concern within the arms-control community as it weighs different technological approaches to verifying whether a warhead is the real deal without opening it up. No country wants to reveal their designs to potential adversaries or to those who might sell the information to the highest bidder.

Researchers from Princeton University and Microsoft Research, based in Cambridge, Mass., propose taking a page from the computer-security community by comparing measurements from a warhead an inspector randomly selects with similar measurements from warheads an inspector wants to verify as the real deal.

In the process, no information relevant to weapon design finds its way into an inspector's hand. The only information an inspector sees is match or no match between the warhead being verified and the ""template"" warhead. No match? That's when, in effect, one country calls the other's bluff. It's known as the zero-knowledge protocol.

""The day the Russians say: We're going to dismantle 500 warheads, this is the day you really want to be sure that whatever they declare, these are authentic warheads, and they're not somehow moving the real ones to a different location,"" says Alexander Glaser, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University in New Jersey, and the lead author of a study setting out the approach. The results appear in this week's issue of the journal Nature.

Currently, nuclear arms agreements between the US and Russia involve reducing the number of strategic weapons that each country deploys. The easiest way to verify that is to count bombers, land-based missile silos, or ballistic-missile submarines, the researchers say.

But when a missile is scrapped, its warheads typically are stored, notes Hans Kristensen, director of the Federation of American Scientists' nuclear information project. At some point, they become too expensive to store, so some eventually are dismantled. But no strategic-arms treaty at the moment requires either country to destroy the warheads they no longer deploy.

Current frosty relations between the US and Russia, as well as between President Obama and congressional Republicans, preclude reaching a warhead-destroying agreement anytime soon. But that type of agreement will emerge at some point, suggests James Acton, a senior associate in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Nuclear Policy Program. It's wise to have one's verification approaches in order before such talks might begin, he writes in a commentary that accompanies the study by Dr. Glaser and colleagues.

""It's a very interesting and promising approach,"" says Mr. Kristensen.

The technique involves sending a beam of high-energy neutrons into the template warhead and measuring the amount and properties of the neutrons that pass through it. The information is loaded into detectors set up to verify the authenticity of additional warheads. When the additional warheads are subjected to the same neutron beams, the neutron signatures are compared with the template's.

At this point, the team has used the approach on a test target and modeled the results, which indicate the approach will work. The next steps involve setting up a larger-scale demonstration program, Glaser says. This includes working on approaches that will reduce the likelihood that the system can be scammed or that could lead to errors in the measurements.

""My hope is that within a year, we might be able to invite folks in and really show them"" the approach's potential, Glaser says.","2014-06-26 19:26:00","0","54.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","43.0","0.0","194.0","76.0","0.0","386.0","0.0","37.0","9","682","96.05","60.42","31.94","41.69","20.67","31.82","75.51","45.01","6.60","2.05","0.15","0.73","0.15","0.15","0.88","4.55","11.73","14.08","5.87","2.49","5.43","1.32","10.85","5.13","2.64","1.17","0.59","0.88","3.23","2.05","1.17","0.00","0.88","0.00","5.87","0.15","0.15","0.00","0.15","10.26","2.64","1.91","1.17","3.08","0.15","2.64","2.05","0.88","1.03","0.15","0.88","0.73","0.00","0.00","0.15","8.36","2.05","1.47","3.96","1.17","0.29","0.59","8.50","2.49","14.08","2.20","8.50","3.23","4.84","0.29","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.00","15.10","4.99","4.84","0.15","0.00","0.29","0.00","1.47","1.17","2.20","0.00","0.00","3484","8.71","22.451612903225808","1076","672","33","50.77","13.6","11.2","13.92","14.1","173","6.166666666666667","20.457619047619048","350","20.23","5","0.44","0","24","4","98","0","80","52","2","2","10","124","49","2","53","0","0","17","4","15","1","0","4","21","0","28","7","18","17","23","30","6","1","0","4"

US accusations hypocritical and self-deceiving

“China was completely justified in rejecting remarks made by US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel at the 13th Asia Security Summit, or Shangri-La Dialogue, in Singapore [in late May],” writes Wang Hui in response to remarks by Secretary Hagel about China’s “unilateral” actions in the South China Sea and cyberspying against the United States. “The US has thrown its weight behind Japan, its regional ally, since September 2012 when the Japanese government unilaterally announced its decision to ‘nationalize’ China’s Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea.”

Delusions of a superpower

In his commencement address to West Point graduates in May, President Obama “stressed that the U.S. would not become isolationist, and that ‘America must always lead on the world stage. If we don’t, no one else will.’ This smacks of self-delusion. Once the world’s leading superpower, the U.S. looks increasingly dwarfed by Russia and China,” states an editorial. “Though much of the American public might believe Obama’s interpretation of events, the rest of the world is watching, and it is not so easily deceived. Where Obama sees success in soft diplomacy and stepping back, the international community sees stumbling and inaction.”

New rules on coal underline US hypocrisy

“Washington has spent a good deal of time complaining that Canada lacks an adequate strategy to address the emissions issue. Coal is by far the dirtiest way to produce electricity, and Canada uses far less of it than the U.S. ... yet Washington keeps citing Canadian emissions policies as a significant reason Mr. Obama hasn’t been able to bring himself to make a decision on the Keystone XL oil pipeline,” writes Kelly McParland about US emissions regulations proposed in early June. “Now that the U.S. has an actual plan on the table, maybe it will quit beefing about Canada and focus on whether its own efforts are adequate.”

Price of US higher ed hurts poor

“Thirty years ago, the proportion of young Americans completing college – around 30 per cent – was easily the highest in the world. Today, the US proportion is almost unchanged, and has been overtaken by many other countries, including Australia,” writes John Quiggin, an Australian economist. “The US education system is now much like its health system. It does a great job for the 1 per cent who go to the Ivy League schools (and whose parents are mostly in or close to the top 1 per cent of the income distribution), does an adequate but expensive job for the next 20 per cent or so, and leaves everyone else in the lurch.”

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/2014/1107/The-color-purple-Republican-gains-mean-divided-government-in-many-states","The color purple: Republican gains mean divided government in many states","From Maryland to Colorado, as many as 19 states will have power split between political parties. And unlike federal politics, the result could be pragmatism and compromise more than gridlock.

Pennsylvania Democratic Gov.-elect Tom Wolf meets with well-wishers outside the Manchester Cafe the day after he won the gubernatorial election.

This election was pretty much all about Republican gains, but that doesn’t mean more Americans will be living under “red” government at the state level.

Instead, the big import in states is a return of divided government – with control split between the two major parties.

Illinois, Colorado, Minnesota, West Virginia, Massachusetts, and Maryland are all shifting from “blue” (all Democratic) to a murkier purple in political tone.

Pennsylvania is going purple thanks to a Democratic victory, as Tom Wolf replaces Tom Corbett in the governor’s mansion. Alaska is still counting mail-in ballots, but the early results suggest that it, too, could shift toward split government – with independent Bill Walker as governor alongside a GOP legislature.

The outcome: more than one-third of Americans will live in purple states – with this election putting more than 40 million people newly in this category.

What does that mean?

Answers will vary by locale, but residents of these states can in general expect something very different from the kind of bluster and inaction that frequently characterizes the federal government, with its rifts between President Obama and powerful Republicans in Congress.

Yes, state politicians can engage in their own share of grandstanding and gridlock. But several forces historically nudge state governments toward pragmatism and compromise.

State governments need to balance their budgets, for one thing, and governors often wield significant veto powers such as the ability to reduce or eliminate spending items they don’t like. Those rules can force two sides to the bargaining table.

Beyond that, state governments operate in a realm that’s not far removed from the voters they serve. Elected officials have highways to maintain and schools that need funding – and citizens who will hold them accountable if they don’t get the job done.

“In most states, most of the time, it’s eminently practical,” says Christopher Mooney, a University of Illinois political scientist who studies state governments. That includes states with unified as well as split control.

“In some ways it's going to be less divisive” in the purple states, Mr. Mooney says. “You’ve got to come more to consensus,” he explains, whereas single-party rule can sometimes lead to actions that rankle moderate voters as well as the opposition party.

Taxes and budgets will be at or near the top of priority lists in newly purple states. Republicans Bruce Rauner in Illinois and Larry Hogan in Maryland, for example, won upset victories for governor largely on voter concerns about fiscal management.

The tenor of purple government won’t be uniform across America.

In New York, a state Senate that’s now fully under Republican control may provide Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) with leverage against a Democratic House for his relatively centrist fiscal plans.

But, in contrast to the strong powers that governors typically wield, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) will face an all-Republican legislature that now has a veto-proof supermajority.

Purple America will include a smattering of Western states (Washington, Montana, New Mexico, Colorado). But most of its states are in the Midwest region (Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky) and a Northeastern swatch of nine states running from Maine and New Hampshire to Virginia and West Virginia.

Next year, well over 100 million Americans will reside in these split-control states, as will at least one office-holder who's a potential presidential nominee: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.

Still, the biggest share of Americans – nearly half – will live in states that are bright red. That Republican-state share won’t change much due to the election, although the composition shifts a bit. Republicans lose their lock on Pennsylvania but now have even fuller control of the South (with Arkansas), as well as the Plains and states in other regions such as Nevada.

The altered political landscape after this election is also a reminder of how fast things can change.

Before 2010, more Americans lived under Democrat-controlled states than under Republican ones.

Now, if Alaska ends up purple and Vermont’s legislature reaffirms Pete Shumlin (D) as governor, just seven US states will be Democratic, compared with 24 under Republican control and 19 with split control. That tally counts Nebraska as Republican in practice, even though its legislature is officially nonpartisan.

One reason state control can be volatile is that voters are often willing to consider governors of varying political stripes, even when legislative control is more consistently with one party.

Mooney cites Massachusetts as a classic example, with its solid blue legislature and its penchant for picking Republicans like Mitt Romney as well as Democrats for governor. And California, which just reelected Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown and a Democratic legislature, not so long ago had Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor.","2014-11-07 14:48:00","0","66.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","214.0","76.0","0.0","380.0","0.0","37.0","9","831","87.76","48.56","21.40","71.01","19.33","29.12","72.20","42.12","6.26","1.44","0.00","0.12","0.12","0.36","0.84","4.81","5.54","15.64","6.86","4.45","6.98","0.84","9.39","8.66","5.29","0.84","2.41","2.77","3.01","2.65","0.24","0.12","0.00","0.12","3.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.36","10.11","0.84","2.65","0.84","2.29","0.60","3.73","2.29","2.05","0.24","0.00","1.20","0.12","0.60","0.36","0.12","10.59","1.44","1.56","7.82","0.96","0.12","1.08","7.70","2.41","12.88","1.44","7.82","3.73","5.29","0.84","0.24","0.96","0.00","0.00","0.84","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.72","0.00","17.81","5.29","6.26","0.24","0.00","0.12","0.00","1.32","1.20","1.68","1.68","0.00","4305","8.52","19.651162790697676","1312","827","44","52.39","13.1","10.6","14.33","13.6","207","6.142857142857143","19.532091898428053","419","18.58","5","0.41","0","30","17","60","0","120","77","8","4","21","116","111","10","63","0","0","10","9","53","2","1","1","15","0","30","9","10","5","22","26","9","4","0","2"

Mary Landrieu of Louisiana lost her reelection bid to Rep. Bill Cassidy Saturday, strengthening the GOP’s position in the Senate and confirming the widening racial divide in the South regarding party affiliation and elections.

Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., hugs supporters after conceding defeat in her Senate runoff election against Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., in New Orleans, Saturday, Dec. 6, 2014.

Mary Landrieu’s thumping in a Louisiana run-off election Saturday has many lessons for Democrats, none of them happy.

It strengthens Republicans’ grip on the US Senate, increasing their majority to 54 seats – nine more than they had before last month’s mid-term election – which also gives them a better hand in 2016 when more GOP senators up for reelection will be vulnerable (as were Democrats this year).

Saturday’s voting also boosted the GOP’s grip on the US House to at least 246 seats. As the AP points out, this gives Republicans a commanding majority that matches the party's post-World War II high during Democratic President Harry S. Truman's administration.

The election also confirms the extreme difficulty D’s now have in winning (or holding on to) elected positions in the South.

Here’s a stark snapshot from Politico: “In 1962, every senator and an overwhelming majority of House members from the South was a Democrat. Next year, Democrats will control 39 of 149 Southern congressional seats, fewer than at any time since Reconstruction. The GOP won each of the seven governor’s races in the South this year as well, padding majorities in state legislatures across the region.”

It matters not that Sen. Landrieu aligned herself with Republicans on a key issue – the Keystone XL pipeline. Her support of Obama administration programs – especially the Affordable Care Act – more than outweighed that. Much more.

Landrieu’s defeat at the hands of US Rep. Bill Cassidy confirms the widening racial divide in the South regarding party affiliation and elections.

During Louisiana’s open primary vote last month, Landrieu’s 42 percent tally (which forced the run-off for the three-term incumbent) included just 18 percent of the white vote, according to exit polls. Here too, Obama weighed down Landrieu’s increasingly desperate attempt to hold on to her Senate seat: 73 percent of white voters polled in November said they “strongly disapproved” of Obama.

US House delegations across nine states stretching from the Carolinas to Texas are divided almost entirely by race, with white Republicans representing majority-white districts, while majority non-white districts are represented by black or Hispanic Democrats, according to the AP.

In the end, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee cut its losses, canceling TV ads it had scheduled for Landrieu. With outside help from groups like American Crossroads, Freedom Partners, and the National Rifle Association, Rep. Cassidy outspent Landrieu in the run-off.

Campaigning for Cassidy were Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, former Sen. Rick Santorum, neurologist Ben Carson, and Sen.-elect Joni Ernst. Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush helped raise campaign cash.

In the end, it wasn’t close. Cassidy beat Landrieu 56-44 percent. Early voting turnout was overwhelmingly white and Republican. Stats blog FiveThirtyEight put her chance of losing at 99.8 percent.

Politico accurately summed up Saturday’s election in Louisiana (and its broader import) in just five words: “Dems' final insult: Landrieu crushed.”

Landrieu's defeat is a blow for one of Louisiana's most famous political families, leaving her brother, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, to carry the banner.","2014-12-07 11:38:00","0","56.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","187.0","76.0","0.0","381.0","0.0","37.0","9","580","98.14","64.79","28.47","28.64","14.50","29.14","67.07","35.34","5.17","2.76","0.00","0.69","0.00","1.21","0.86","2.41","7.24","15.52","2.59","2.24","3.45","0.52","6.03","6.72","3.45","0.52","3.45","4.31","5.34","2.76","2.59","0.69","0.34","1.03","5.00","0.34","0.17","1.21","0.17","3.62","0.34","0.52","0.00","1.03","0.69","1.38","2.07","1.21","0.17","0.69","0.69","0.34","0.17","0.00","0.17","10.52","2.93","1.72","6.72","0.52","0.52","2.59","2.93","0.34","17.07","1.38","9.66","5.86","2.59","1.03","0.69","0.86","0.00","0.17","0.34","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.17","0.00","21.90","7.41","5.86","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.07","1.03","3.45","1.38","0.00","2959","8.52","22.185185185185187","902","573","38","56.15","11.4","9.2","13.74","11.8","150","4.611111111111111","18.511204188481678","334","20.41","17","0.36","0","12","21","48","0","72","45","6","1","2","88","129","11","25","0","0","9","8","22","1","1","6","10","0","6","26","20","5","6","15","3","0","0","1"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2014/0116/Nuclear-materials-threat-Countries-improving-security-agency-finds","Nuclear materials threat: Countries improving security, agency finds","The Nuclear Materials Security Index notes progress in several countries. In the last two years, seven have given up most of their weapons-grade uranium and plutonium, while others are tightening security measures.

The final delivery of low enriched uranium fuel under the Megatons to Megawatts program arrives at USEC’s Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Ky., Dec. 11, 2013. The fuel was shipped from St Petersburg, Russia in November. With this shipment, 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium from Russian nuclear warheads, equivalent to 20,000 nuclear weapons, has now been downblended into fuel for America’s commercial nuclear power plants to use in generating electricity.

Pakistan is often depicted as an unstable nuclear power where extremists might someday get their hands on deadly nuclear materials. But in the past two years, Pakistan has addressed some gaps in nuclear materials regulations and improved its overall nuclear security.

And over the same two years, seven countries – including Ukraine, once feared as a potential source of “loose” nuclear materials that could fall into the hands of terrorists – have given up most of their weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. That reduced by almost one-fourth the number of countries in the world with appreciable amounts of fuel for atomic bombs.

That good news on global nuclear security is part of an international report card out this month that finds progress in the safekeeping of nuclear materials in much of the world. Called the Nuclear Materials Security Index, the report by the Washington-based Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) points to Japan, Belgium, and Canada as countries making significant improvements in the safeguarding of nuclear materials.

Japan, the report notes, made considerable strides in nuclear security after the Fukushima reactor disaster in 2011, among other things setting up a new regulatory body to take up nuclear safety and security issues.

The report is not all roses, however, and even has some critical words for the United States – which at President Obama’s initiative in 2010 launched what have become biennial summits to nudge countries to improve the security of nuclear materials.

After the first summit in Washington in 2010, the 2012 summit was held in Seoul, and in March world leaders will meet on the issue in The Hague. Mr. Obama recently announced that the US will host the 2016 summit, which is likely to be the last.

The US slipped to 11th place in this year’s index for failing to ratify two international nuclear accords it has committed to implementing, and for excluding a facility that handles nuclear materials from agreed safeguards.

In announcing this year’s results, the NTI lauded the series of summits for how they have encouraged countries to make security strides. But it also said the world must move beyond an initiative that counts on individual country action to a global security system with standards and incentives for countries to go farther.

“We are in a race between cooperation and catastrophe. We must run faster,” said former US senator and NTI co-chairman Sam Nunn, reviewing nuclear challenges and security issues before the American Nuclear Society late last year.

In issuing this year’s index, Mr. Nunn – who has championed arms-control and nuclear nonproliferation issues for decades – noted that “a nuclear detonation in any part of the world will affect us all.” He called for leaders at the summit in The Hague to set the foundations of a global security system. “We need a global nuclear materials system to secure all materials, to employ international standards and best practices, and to give states the capacity to assess nuclear security globally and hold each other accountable,” he added.

Still, the 2014 index, which NTI developed in conjunction with the Economist Intelligence Unit, a London-based risk assessment organization, suggests the current system is moving the world forward.

In addition to Ukraine, the other countries that rid themselves of most of their holdings of uranium and plutonium were Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Sweden, and Vietnam. That reduced the number of countries with appreciable amounts of those fuels from 32 to 25. The index also ranks 151 other countries that have little or no weapons-grade materials but which could be used as safe havens or transit points for what are often called “loose nukes.”

The drop in countries with bomb-fueling materials does not mean that no extremely worrisome gaps in nuclear security remain, as NTI points out. North Korea remains at the bottom of the list, with the index finding the pariah state consistently deficient on most measures of nuclear security. Also at the bottom of the list are Iran, India – and Pakistan, despite the improvements it registered.

Moreover, concerns about the potential for terrorists to get their hands on materials to make a “dirty bomb” extend beyond uranium and plutonium alone.

In December two men were arrested in the Caucasus country of Georgia for attempting to traffic a quantity of the radioactive material radium 266 sufficient to build a dirty bomb. And in December in Mexico, alarm bells heard as far away as the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna were rung after thieves stole a truck carrying a small but extremely dangerous quantity of the radioactive isotope cobalt-60. The truck and the material – enough if ground down to fuel a dirty bomb, according to nuclear experts – were later recovered.

The two incidents were reminders of what small amounts of nuclear materials are required to build weapons – and why the NTI says “much remains to be done” to secure the estimated 2,000 metric tons of the major weapons-usable materials – highly enriched uranium or plutonium – in the world.

“All it takes to build a bomb is enough highly enriched uranium to fill a five-pound bag of sugar,” the report notes, “or a quantity of plutonium the size of a grapefruit.”","2014-01-16 18:37:00","0","59.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","196.0","76.0","0.0","384.0","0.0","37.0","10","974","98.34","56.94","27.16","50.69","26.32","28.54","71.87","41.68","5.44","1.64","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.21","0.72","3.80","9.24","17.15","4.41","1.85","4.72","0.41","8.01","7.08","2.57","1.13","3.18","2.46","5.24","3.29","1.95","0.62","0.82","0.31","3.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.31","7.29","0.41","2.05","0.62","2.16","0.92","1.95","1.33","0.10","0.62","0.51","0.62","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.10","8.93","1.03","2.26","3.08","0.82","2.57","2.46","4.62","0.72","15.81","1.33","10.88","3.80","2.98","0.21","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.35","4.11","5.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","1.85","0.62","0.21","0.00","4864","8.4","28.823529411764707","1604","971","37","36.42","16.1","14.7","13.12","16.1","213","8.6","21.254459320288362","446","25.65","10","0.4","0","32","29","106","1","132","93","0","5","8","139","88","1","94","0","0","12","6","34","0","0","5","32","0","33","26","17","25","19","26","10","4","0","3"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2014/0219/FBI-reports-a-drop-in-crime-in-2013-why-the-rate-continues-to-fall","FBI reports a drop in crime in 2013: why the rate continues to fall","New FBI data confirm a sustained drop in the US crime rate, despite a broader definition of what constitutes rape. Creative policing, better use of data, and community involvement play a role.

Overall reported crime was down in the first half of last year, according to new federal data from more than 270 cities that show declines in all categories except rape.

The overall decline follows a national trend that is 10 years in the making, says Tod Burke, a criminologist at Radford University in Radford, Va. “The trend is downward. This is all good news,” he says.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported Tuesday that homicides dropped nearly 7 percent in the first half of 2013, compared with the same period a year earlier. Violent crime fell 5 percent. The greatest drop in homicides, 14.5 percent, took place in the Northeast, but other regions also reported a falloff in homicide rates: the West (6.9 percent), South (5.4 percent) and Midwest (4.3 percent).

Arson was the only category represented by a double-digit decrease last year at nearly 16 percent. Burglaries fell the second most, 8 percent. Robbery (1.8 percent) and motor vehicle theft (3.2 percent) fell the least.

There are multiple reasons why crime rates continue to fall. One is more effective policing techniques, which incorporate technology and data to target specific areas or individuals, and are much more effective in prevention efforts.

“It is no longer how many officers you have, it’s where you place them. You’re seeing a lot more creative policing than what was going on in the past,” Professor Burke says.

Digital and mobile technologies are also creating more awareness and connecting the public with law enforcement more immediately. Not only can the public serve as “the eyes and ears of the police” via the cameras they have on their devices, but they are able to send and receive alerts immediately, which can help preventing and solving crime. “The community becomes an extension of the police,” he says.

Other factors include rising incarceration rates, which remove those most likely to commit crimes from the streets; and urban removal efforts, which have improved blighted areas most likely to be havens for crime.

The FBI data are not a comprehensive representation of national crime trends, as only 272 cities report their statistics.

“It’s a snapshot and we should take it as just that,” Burke says. Besides not including every city in the US, one disadvantage is that some municipalities may, intentionally or not, have different reporting methods for classifying certain crimes.

In releasing the data, the FBI announced it was the first time that the number of rapes was based on a new definition, which it said represents a clearer picture of sexual violence.

Starting in 1927, the FBI began collecting data on “forcible rape,” that is ""the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will."" In its latest crime report, the FBI has expanded its definition to include both genders of victim and perpetrator and a broader definition of what constitutes rape.

The difference in reporting is reflected in the numbers. Under the new definition, data show that rapes increased nearly nine percent in the first six months of 2013, compared with the same time period the previous year. Under the old definition, the opposite was true: rape fell nearly 11 percent in 2013.

Katie Hanna, executive director of the Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence in Cleveland, says that the former definition did not “reflect the large number of victims we know, as advocates, are out there.”

“By including the new definition, what it says is this is a public health issue we need to take seriously,"" Ms. Hanna says, adding that the number of rape victims is likely much greater, since a large percentage of victims choose not to report the crime.","2014-02-19 19:15:00","1","59.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","43.0","0.0","190.0","78.0","0.0","393.0","0.0","37.0","10","640","93.70","61.09","53.75","13.16","20.65","25.47","80.00","42.81","7.66","2.50","0.00","0.78","0.47","0.47","0.78","5.16","10.00","12.66","6.09","2.81","4.06","1.09","10.47","7.50","4.84","1.88","4.69","5.47","4.38","1.72","2.66","0.00","1.41","0.00","5.78","0.00","0.00","0.31","0.31","12.03","3.44","2.19","0.47","2.66","1.09","3.12","2.34","0.78","1.56","0.00","2.03","0.31","0.16","1.56","0.00","7.81","1.41","2.03","3.44","0.94","0.47","2.81","7.50","0.47","15.94","2.34","8.12","5.62","3.59","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.50","5.00","7.03","0.31","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.16","2.81","0.47","1.56","0.00","3086","8.25","22.379310344827587","975","639","36","61.87","11.9","9.1","11.77","11.3","151","7.5","18.57226917057903","327","19.69","7","0.42","0","19","28","72","0","74","54","6","3","5","105","39","0","50","0","0","18","5","27","6","3","0","10","0","15","22","14","8","24","26","8","4","0","3"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2014/1109/Loretta-Lynch-GOP-likely-to-confirm-new-Attorney-General.-But-when","Loretta Lynch: GOP likely to confirm new Attorney General. But when?","Loretta Lynch has the qualifications to be the next Attorney General, plus she comes without the political baggage Eric Holder accumulated butting heads with Republicans in Congress. Still, the White House is unlikely to push for early confirmation.

US Attorney Loretta Lynch in the Roosevelt Room of the White House Saturday after President Obama nominated her to be the next Attorney General succeeding Eric Holder.

Loretta Lynch, President Obama’s pick to replace retiring US Attorney General Eric Holder, would appear to be an ideal candidate designed not to raise any confirmation roadblocks among Republicans soon to take control of the US Senate.

She has a strong record as a crime-fighting US Attorney “who battles mobsters and drug lords and terrorists and still has the reputation for being a charming people person,"" as Obama put it in introducing Ms. Lynch Saturday.

Plus, she is not Mr. Holder – a former judge and US Attorney who led what GOP critics charged was a highly-political Department of Justice, once being held in contempt of Congress.

“I’m hopeful that her tenure, if confirmed, will restore confidence in the Attorney General as a politically independent voice for the American people,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The key question is, how quickly will Republicans be willing to move on Lynch’s confirmation? Before the end of the year, while Democrats still hold a Senate majority? Or not at least until January when they become the majority and a Republican – Sen. Grassley – chairs the hearings?

Grassley promises that Lynch “will receive “a very fair, but thorough, vetting by the Judiciary Committee,” but he also notes that “US Attorneys are rarely elevated directly to this position.”

Republicans, whether they’re in the majority or not, are likely to use the hearings as a vehicle to make points about Obama administration actions and policies they have fought – IRS probing (they would say harassment) of conservative political groups, the Affordable Health Care Act, and immigration.

Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah are set to pounce on immigration – specifically, Obama’s pledge to take executive action on immigration by year’s end without waiting for Congress, including relief from deportation to several million people in the United States illegally.

""The Attorney General is the President's chief law enforcement officer. As such, the nominee must demonstrate full and complete commitment to the law. Loretta Lynch deserves the opportunity to demonstrate those qualities, beginning with a statement whether or not she believes the President’s executive amnesty plans are constitutional and legal,"" Cruz and Lee said in a statement Saturday.

GOP Senators Jeff Sessions, Rand Paul, and soon-to-be majority leader Mitch McConnell have made similar statements.

So far, Democrats aren’t pushing for early confirmation hearings. They’re mainly focusing on Lynch’s qualifications and the fact that she’s already been confirmed – twice – as US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.

Senator Patrick Leahy (D) of Vermont, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, has been noncommittal on when confirmation hearings should begin. “I have spoken with the President about the need to confirm our next attorney general in a reasonable time period, and I look forward to beginning that process,” he said in a statement.

So far, that seems to be OK with the White House.

Obama decided against the option of trying to push Lynch's confirmation while Democrats still control the Senate and instead will leave it up to the Republican-controlled Senate to vote on the choice in 2015, according to the people who described Obama's plans, the Associated Press reports. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.

Democrats on Capitol Hill have told the White House it would be difficult to win confirmation for a new attorney general during the lame-duck session of Congress beginning next week, especially considering all the other competing priorities they face before relinquishing power to Republicans in January. Pushing through a nominee so quickly could have tainted the new attorney general's start in the office.","2014-11-09 11:28:00","0","56.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","41.0","0.0","188.0","75.0","0.0","374.0","0.0","37.0","9","679","92.98","63.83","22.64","38.89","24.25","31.22","77.32","44.77","6.33","3.83","0.44","1.18","0.00","1.33","0.88","2.50","9.28","14.87","6.77","3.39","6.19","1.33","12.22","6.63","1.77","1.47","0.59","1.33","3.24","1.91","1.18","0.15","0.74","0.15","7.07","0.00","0.00","1.03","0.29","10.01","1.77","1.77","1.47","2.06","1.47","2.95","2.21","0.88","1.18","0.15","0.59","0.29","0.29","0.00","0.00","10.16","1.33","1.62","6.77","1.47","0.15","2.50","7.07","1.33","14.14","2.36","5.30","7.22","5.30","0.00","0.74","0.29","0.15","1.33","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","15.32","3.98","5.30","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.88","1.91","2.21","0.59","0.00","3486","8.49","27.76","1118","680","29","47.72","14.9","12.4","13.99","15.4","159","13.0","20.71294117647059","341","25.08","15","0.42","0","20","2","68","0","80","45","0","1","10","80","136","11","27","1","0","21","3","35","0","0","1","27","0","32","17","22","14","15","18","0","5","0","3"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2014/1209/Eric-Garner-case-101-Why-grand-juries-rarely-indict-police-officers","Eric Garner case 101: Why grand juries rarely indict police officers","In the wake of the Eric Garner and Michael Brown cases, questions have arisen regarding the grand-jury system and whether working relationships between prosecutors and law enforcement complicate the process when it comes to cases involving officers.

A protester attends a rally outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn against a grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner.

Two grand juries in recent weeks – one in New York and one in Missouri – declined to indict two police officers in the deaths of two unarmed black men, raising questions and public outcry about why grand juries rarely charge police officers with crimes.

Q: What is the purpose of the grand jury system?

At its most basic, the grand jury system is another check on government power. Before the government can charge a citizen with a serious crime, in many cases it must first get the approval of a panel of 12 to 23 impartial peers. Unlike a trial jury, also called a petit jury, a grand jury does not determine innocence or guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and it does not require a unanimous decision. A grand jury only determines whether the government has enough “probable cause” to press formal charges.

Q: Do all serious crimes require an indictment from a grand jury?

No. The Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution requires a grand jury indictment for the federal government to bring serious charges, but this does not apply to states. Rules vary, but about half the states require grand juries for felony prosecutions, with varying rules and jury sizes.

Q: How often do grand juries make indictments?

Nearly always. As a famous joke goes, a grand jury would “indict a ham sandwich” if that’s what a prosecutor wanted. In 2010, federal prosecutors sought indictments in about 162,000 cases, according to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics. Grand jurors declined to indict in 11 of these federal cases. On a state level, grand juries returned indictments in similar numbers.

One reason a grand jury could “indict a ham sandwich” is that a very low bar is required to establish probable cause.

As Justice Elena Kagan remarked in a Supreme Court case last year, for a grand jury, “Probable cause ... we have often told litigants, is not a high bar: It requires only the ‘kind of “fair probability” on which “reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.” ’ ”

Typically, grand juries remain secret. The prosecutor controls the proceedings, and in most jurisdictions, no judge or defense counsel is present. And in the vast majority of cases, the prosecutor only presents one or two witnesses, as well as additional physical or forensic evidence if necessary. This normally takes place in a day or two.

Q: How many police officers are indicted by grand juries?

Very few. According to studies, US police officers kill approximately 1,000 citizens per year in the line of duty. On average, four officers are indicted for causing gun-related deaths on duty every year, according to a study by Bowling Green State University in Ohio.

In one sample, grand juries in Harris County, Texas, haven’t indicted a police officer in a decade. Grand juries in Dallas looked at 81 possible cases of police criminality between 2008 and 2012, but handed down only one indictment, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Q: Why is it so rare for prosecutors to indict police officers?

The reasons are manifold. Police officers are given the power to kill in society, and they are often given the benefit of the doubt in cases in which they may face life-threatening danger. Many often have qualified immunity as well – part of a deeply held social compact that recognizes the pressures of the job.

Some suggest that jurors have a built-in bias to trust the word of police officers, who know the system and understand the law. But prosecutors and police officers mostly work hand in hand in the nation’s criminal-justice system. Prosecutors rely on police to gather evidence and provide personal security. They fraternize closely with police on a day-to-day basis. Critics suggest that this close working relationship makes it difficult for prosecutors to have an incentive to aggressively pursue indictments against police.

In grand jury cases such as the one in Ferguson, Mo., that decided not to indict Police Officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown, and the grand jury case on Staten Island, N.Y., that decided not to indict Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner, prosecutors took the unusual step of presenting nearly all the evidence to the grand jury – including the testimony of the officers.

But critics contend that this evidence did not undergo rigorous cross-examination by opposing counsel, giving the prosecutors sole control over the shape of the case.

Q: What are states doing to ensure trust in the grand jury system when it comes to police killings?

Because of the close working relationship between prosecutors and police officers, many have called for independent investigations whenever a person dies in police custody. This April, Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed the nation’s first law requiring a team of at least two investigators from an outside agency to lead reviews of such deaths and a public report to be released if criminal charges are not filed.","2014-12-09 13:30:00","1","63.0","36.0","10.0","0.0","44.0","0.0","201.0","77.0","0.0","394.0","0.0","37.0","10","895","97.17","50.45","19.10","71.87","19.46","24.25","75.98","41.68","4.02","0.78","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.34","3.24","9.94","15.08","4.02","4.02","5.25","1.45","7.15","6.48","1.45","1.68","3.24","2.12","6.15","4.25","1.79","0.56","0.56","0.11","4.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.11","11.51","2.68","2.35","1.01","3.58","0.67","3.24","1.12","0.67","0.11","0.34","1.34","0.45","0.45","0.00","0.45","10.39","1.12","1.12","7.04","0.45","1.01","1.45","5.59","0.11","10.84","0.78","6.93","3.13","6.26","0.56","0.00","0.22","0.00","1.12","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","14.75","5.03","5.03","0.78","0.00","0.67","0.00","0.89","1.45","0.67","0.00","0.22","4313","8.29","20.477272727272727","1409","891","45","51.38","13.2","11.0","11.95","12.2","207","16.166666666666668","19.212929292929296","415","18.25","13","0.39","0","28","25","99","0","113","80","0","3","5","149","77","2","86","2","0","11","1","43","0","0","1","27","0","28","16","19","16","30","26","5","4","0","5"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2014/0612/Illegal-immigration-dilemma-Are-migrant-children-refugees-or-criminals","Illegal immigration dilemma: Are migrant children refugees or criminals?","An overwhelmed US immigration system is trying to figure out the exact legal status of thousands of immigrant children rushing the US border. In one of the most politicized asylum systems in the Western world, that won’t be easy.

Immigrant children who come into the US alone are housed in shelters like this one in Harlingen, Texas.

The growing crush of vulnerable migrant children crossing the Rio Grande and entering the US through south Texas has put urgency to a vexing question for the US immigration system:

Are children fleeing Central American violence refugees who need asylum or illegal gold-diggers who need to go home?

The rush on the border has created what the White House and many others have called a humanitarian crisis. But it has also pushed Washington into finger-pointing mode, with politicians and commentators trying to pin down why children, often guided by “coyote” smugglers, are traveling hundreds of miles across Mexico into the US.

The massive border breach by “unaccompanied alien children” has been building since 2012, going from 6,560 in fiscal year 2011 to an estimated 90,000 this year, and a possible 150,000 in 2015. Of those, as many as two-thirds should qualify as legitimate refugees because their fears of persecution in their home countries – whether from gangs or political factions – seem to be well-founded, according to a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Whether they will be is an open question for America’s unique asylum system, where protection-seekers can now linger for years before a judge determines whether they face a reasonable fear of persecution or violence in their home country.

The UNHCR, in a February report, claimed most of the children are fleeing violence and political persecution in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, the country with the highest murder rate in the world, according to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime. The report also notes that the bulk of asylum-seekers aren’t coming to the US, but instead seeking protection from countries like Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.

In the US, however, the influx of young migrants – and images of crowded detention facilities – comes amid a potent and divisive national debate about immigration reform and what it means for American security and the economy. That pits humanitarian needs against politics.

“The key here is that this is an opportunity for us to step up and stick to American principles and traditions of being a nation that accepts refugees, that protects human rights, and enforces our laws that say we will provide asylum to people that meet the criteria,” says Michelle Brané, who directs the Women’s Refugee Commission’s migrant rights and justice program. Opposing that are “gut responses that say, ‘How do you stop all these kids from getting into the US?’ and claims that the US border is too open and too lax and too welcoming of these populations.”

In 2003, federal care for unaccompanied children crossing the border was moved from the law enforcement branch of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Department of Health and Human Services. Since then, the US has taken extra care when looking at asylum requests from unaccompanied minors. A 2008 human trafficking law also added protections.

But recent reports from the UN and the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies in San Francisco suggest that child asylum-seekers, especially those who come alone, should be afforded greater protections, as well as better representation. For example, current law doesn’t mandate children receive a lawyer to argue their case.

The US is a signatory to a 1951 UN refugee treaty that says anyone who crosses the border and shows signs of being at risk cannot be sent back until their circumstances have been investigated thoroughly.

“We’re not dealing with groups of people here who are not entitled to US protection,” says James Hathaway, the director of the Program in Refugee and Asylum Law at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “Quite the contrary, we’re dealing with a population that actually seems to in very large measure qualify for protection that we offered to provide by signing the UN Refugee Convention.”

But there remains skepticism among many citizens, lawmakers, and federal immigration judges about the true roots of the migration – which could strengthen if the crisis deepens. Many say the children are not as much fleeing as being drawn by rumors that the Obama administration will protect child migrants. By letting more child border-crossers stay in the US, it would create incentive for more illegal immigrants to try their luck on the US border, they argue.

They note that the current surge began in 2012, when President Obama signed an executive action that allowed undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as minors to defer deportation proceedings for two years. Last week, the administration announced plans that would allow these immigrants to defer their deportations a further two years.

None of the unaccompanied minors crossing the border illegally now would qualify. Mr. Obama’s actions apply only to undocumented immigrants who came to the US before June 15, 2007. But coyotes won’t care about the finer details.

“Word has gotten out around the world about President Obama’s lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the United States illegally, many of whom are children,” Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R) of Virginia, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.

Those concerns could further impact an asylum system that Professor Hathaway says is “clearly one of the worst” in the world. “So the concern that [what appears a crisis on the border] can have negative ramifications on asylum-seekers is probably well founded.”","2014-06-12 17:03:00","1","59.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","43.0","0.0","180.0","75.0","0.0","382.0","0.0","37.0","9","957","91.76","82.65","19.70","38.80","26.58","26.54","76.28","46.92","8.78","3.55","0.00","2.30","0.10","0.00","1.15","5.22","9.40","14.94","5.85","3.66","6.06","1.04","11.49","4.28","2.82","2.30","2.40","1.67","3.97","2.30","1.57","0.52","0.31","0.31","10.34","0.00","0.10","0.10","0.00","8.67","1.15","1.46","1.15","3.24","0.52","2.30","1.46","0.52","0.84","0.10","0.63","0.31","0.21","0.10","0.00","11.81","2.93","1.15","5.22","0.73","1.99","1.88","7.63","0.94","13.58","2.72","8.05","3.13","3.87","0.10","0.52","0.21","0.00","0.10","0.42","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.31","0.00","14.00","3.66","5.22","0.10","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.94","1.99","1.25","0.42","0.21","4747","8.72","30.25","1485","950","36","44.68","14.1","13.6","13.12","16.2","227","12.375","22.117894736842107","476","26.84","24","0.43","0","35","22","98","0","126","65","4","3","12","129","102","3","86","1","0","14","8","39","1","1","3","26","0","27","17","30","21","30","35","11","13","0","5"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2014/1102/Justice-for-sale-More-money-flowing-to-judicial-elections","Justice for sale? More money flowing to judicial elections","As political action committees become involved in judicial elections, there's growing concern that the influence of outside money could erode public trust in a judge’s impartiality.

North Carolina in April isn’t usually the focus of much political activity, but that changed this year when viewers around the state started seeing this TV ad.

Until that point, state Supreme Court judge Robin Hudson had been used to judicial elections that many described as “sleepy,” where it was as much work mobilizing people to vote at all as it was mobilizing them to vote a certain way.

Then the ad aired, accusing Hudson of being “not tough on child molesters,” and what had traditionally been a quiet and personalized judicial election for North Carolina changed to a loud and partisan one. And it may have changed judicial elections in the state forever.

Spending on judicial election campaigns has reached record highs in states around the country this year, fueled in large part by an influx of outside money from special interest groups. Like the ad targeting Hudson earlier this year – a so-called “issue ad” paid for by conservative Super PAC Justice For All NC, not authorized by any candidate – outside groups are spending millions of dollars around the country to unseat certain judges they think could rule against their interests in court.

Candidates for North Carolina’s Supreme Court have raised a record breaking $5.2 million in campaign funds this election cycle, according to the Brennan Center for Justice and Justice at Stake. Outside groups have spent over $12 million on TV ad buys in 10 states since January, according to the two groups, with nearly $1 million being spent on five of these states in the last week alone.

These attacks have prompted candidates themselves to campaign round the clock for funding in response, and the increasingly politicized judicial election climate has people worried that the impartiality of state courts could become politicized as well.

Bert Brandenburg, executive director of Justice at Stake, says the growth in money and politics around state judicial elections are “pressuring judges to become politicians in black robes.”

“A lot of judges are feeling trapped,” Brandenburg says.

“You can ask someone to be a judge, you can ask someone to be a politician, you should not ask someone to be both,” he adds. “What this money is doing is that it’s eroding that insulation that is designed to keep politics out of the courtroom.”

The millions being spent on state judicial elections may pale in comparison to legislative election spending this midterm election, which totals well over $1 billion for the 2013-14 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org, but many consider state judicial elections a completely different animal to their legislative and gubernatorial cousins. Some people also worry that state courts now appear to be “for sale,” that the number could increase significantly in the future.

Judicial elections rules vary from state to state, but 38 states in the US elect their Supreme Court judges in some way. Some states have executives or special committees appoint justices when seats open up, and then require them to run for reappointment in individual “retention” elections when their term expires. Other states require sitting judges to run against other candidates. In some states these contested elections are non-partisan, with candidates running independent of any political party. In other states these elections are partisan.

But the nature of judicial elections also makes the relatively small amounts of money being spent on them go a long way. Judicial elections are typically “low-information” races, according to Chris Kromm, director of the Institute for Southern Studies, where most people know little about the candidates. The lack of a visible “platform” for judicial candidates has also led to outside groups funding attack ads that target specific decisions judges have made.

As a result, Mr. Kromm says, a judge could be hearing a case and not thinking about what makes the best decision, but what could end up in an attack ad when they next run for office.

“They make hundreds of decisions throughout their career and any one could be misinterpreted,” Kromm adds. “That’s a hell of a thing for these judges to be thinking about when making a decision.”

For the judges themselves, the specific brand of judicial election matters less than the amount of money that’s spent on them.

Michigan had the most expensive Supreme Court race in the country in 2012, with outside groups spending $13.85 million on issue ads that year. Five candidates are competing for two seats on the state Supreme Court this year, all nominated by political parties. And after leading the country in TV ad spending in 2012, Michigan is leading the pack again this year with over $4.3 million in total TV ad spending.

The Virginia-based Center for Individual Freedom spent around $146,000 last week on an ad supporting Republican Justices David Viviano and Brian Zahra for “throwing the book at violent child predators,” according to Kantar Media/CMAG. The Michigan Republican Party itself has spent over $2.3 million on TV ads this year, according to the Brennan Center and Justice at Stake.

Justice William B. Murphy, a Democratic candidate and incumbent, says the partisan nature of judicial elections in Michigan isn’t the problem. Murphy is more worried that the growing influence of outside money – and the personal fundraising response from judges and their campaign committees – could erode the public’s trust in a judge’s impartiality.

In its endorsement of Judge Murphy earlier this month, the Detroit Free Press noted that since this will likely be Murphy’s last eight-year term as a Supreme Court justice, his judgment “will be unconstrained by anxieties about his political future” on a court that is “still struggling to assert its independence from special interests and partisan politics.”

“I’ve been a judge for 26 years and I’ve been independent and tried to make decisions based on what the law is,” Murphy says in an interview with The Monitor.

If he were elected to what would be his last term, he adds, “I won’t have to be concerned about making decisions that would impact people I’d have to rely on for support down the road.”

Big-money super PACs now appear to be entering state judicial races.

The Koch brothers-linked conservative dark money group Americans for Prosperity has sponsored TV ads attacking Justice Mike Wheat in Montana for his “extreme politics” and “history of supporting extreme partisan measures.”

American Freedom Builders, a conservative advocacy group with national ties and a strong connection to Ohio Governor John Kasich (R), has spent over $350,000 on TV ads to run through Election Day.

The mounting tide of outside money now has judges working round the clock to raise money to compete. Robin Hudson says she’s now working “two full-time jobs,” one as a judge, the other as a fundraiser.

But the visible effect campaign funding has on a judge’s decisions is harder to quantify.

There are a handful of notable cases where judges appear to have ruled in favor of parties who supported them during elections.

In West Virginia in 1998 the chief executive of the A.T. Massey Coal Company set up a non-profit group called “And for the Sake of the Kids” and used it to funnel over $3 million into unseating a state Supreme Court justice about to preside over a lawsuit against the company. The incumbent judge lost and his replacement ultimately helped overturn the $50 million suit.

In Illinois the outside group Campaign for 2016 recently ran two TV ads attacking Supreme Court Justice Lloyd Karmeier for overturning multimillion dollar judgments against Philip Morris and State Farm in two high-profile cases after the companies reportedly “push[ed] four million dollars” into Justice Karmeier’s 2004 election.

And a recent report from Emory University School of Law and the American Constitution Society concluded that the more TV attack ads aired during state supreme court judicial elections in a state, the less likely justices are to vote in favor of criminal defendants.

The study points in particular to the 2010 Citizens United decision by the US Supreme Court that declared it unconstitutional to restrict the spending of outside groups on state elections.

“These findings are likely to be only a preview of escalating trends in judicial campaign finance and elections,” the study concluded. “Outside groups, whether funded by corporations, unions and wealthy individuals have only begun to professionalize their operations and will only grow more sophisticated in the years to come.”

New rulings on judicial campaign laws could also impact judicial elections in the future.

In January the US Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a case from Florida that could eliminate rules in 30 states that ban judicial candidates from personally asking for money, opening up another avenue for funding to enter judicial campaigns.

For Robin Hudson, the North Carolina judge targeted earlier this year by the first judicial primary election ad funded by outside sources to air in the state’s history, the new waves of spending are in sharp contrast to the spending limits the state required from 2004 to 2012.

In 2004 the state established a public campaign fund for judicial elections designed to replace judges campaigning for themselves – and the ethical questions that can raise.

The program allowed judicial candidates to access the public campaign funds if they could raise contributions of $10-$500 from at least 350 registered voters, adding up to at least $39,450, and ended up slashing the percent of campaign funds supplied by attorneys and special-interest groups from 73 percent to 14 percent, while increasing the share from individual donors.

North Carolina’s public campaign fund was praised as a model program for the nation, but was repealed in 2013 by the state’s Republican governor and Republican-controlled legislature.

Indeed, many experts are characterizing the increased financing of state judicial elections as a way for single parties to gain control of all three branches of government in states. With 36 states now controlled by a single party – 23 by Republicans and 13 by Democrats, the most states under single-party rule in six decades – experts are worried that it’s only a matter of time before state courts go a similar way.

There appear to be as many potential solutions as there are unique judicial election rules in states. North Carolina’s public campaign fund is a popular proposal, as is having judges appointed by the executive or a special, non-partisan committee.

Hudson believes the problem starts, and could even end, with reducing the influence of outside money on state judicial elections. That would require either the US Supreme Court overturning its Citizens United decision, or Congress passing a Constitutional amendment.

“There isn’t really any other alternative, states can’t really do anything about it,” Hudson says.

The attack ad leveled against her in the spring ended up backfiring. Hudson won her primary and will be on the ballot in this week’s election. Ultimately, she thinks this could be the only way to stop millions of special interest dollars flowing into judicial elections.

“It seems like the one thing that might make it stop is if it stops working,” she adds. “Maybe they will figure that in judges races [attack ads] are a bad idea.”

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0126/Minimum-wage-gets-maximum-push-from-Democrats","Minimum wage gets maximum push from Democrats","With polls showing 71 percent of Americans in favor of raising the minimum wage, Democrats in at least 30 states are sponsoring bills proposing wage hikes. Five states passed minimum wage measures last year.

Assemblyman Carl Heastie, D-Bronx, a sponsor to raise the state's minimum wage, works in the Assembly Chamber at the state Capitol on Wednesday, in Albany, N.Y. Minimum wage proposals are getting a maximum push from Democrats in statehouses around the nation this year.

Minimum-wage increase proposals are getting the maximum push from Democrats in statehouses in more than half of US states, highlighting the politically potent income inequality issue this year.

Lawmakers in at least 30 states are sponsoring or are expected to introduce wage hike measures, according to a national review by The Associated Press. They hope to notch state-level victories as President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats remain stymied in attempts to raise the federalminimum wage above $7.25 an hour. The president is expected to mention the minimum wage in his State of the Union address Tuesday.

Even in Republican-dominated capitals where the bills are longshots, the measures still give Democrats a chance to hammer home the popular theme of fairwages in what is an election year in most places.

""It's a no-brainer for any Democrat,"" said Neil Sroka, a strategist for progressive groups who is communications director at the Howard Dean-founded Democracy for America. ""Congress is failing. They can take real action right in the states and have a demonstrable impact right here at home. For politics and policy, it's a winning strategy.""

Minimum wage is a perennial issue that has taken on a higher profile amid the slowly recovering economy and growing public debate about income inequality. A Quinnipiac University poll this month found 71 percent of Americans in favor of raising the minimum wage — including more than half of Republicans polled.

Michael Sargeant, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, calls it an ""organic issue that's bubbling up from the grassroots."" But it's also being pressed by politicians and labor unions. Democrats challenging Republican governors have taken up the issue, and there are ballot initiatives in several states.

""We are facing a huge income gap that only continues to widen, where the workers at the top see large wage increases and the workers at the bottom are at a standstill. That needs to change,"" said Massachusetts Democratic Senate President Therese Murray.

Five states passed minimum wage measures last year, and advocates hope that number will grow as states from New Hampshire to Washington consider proposals. Many would push families above the federal poverty line, which is $15,730 for a family of two. In Iowa, a bill would hike the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10. A Rhode Island bill would raise it from $8 to $9. And a year after New York approved a multiyear minimum wage hike, Assembly Democrats introduced another bill for 2014 sponsored by Labor Committee Chairman Carl Heastie of New York City that would accelerate the increase.

Labor unions and other advocates point to workers like Andrew Lloyd, who cleans the cabins, bathrooms and cockpits of airplanes between flights at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City for $8 an hour. With a wife and 1-year-old, he relies on food stamps to help stock the refrigerator and his paychecks barely cover diapers and other needs of his daughter. He said he can't afford a new pair of socks for himself.

""It's not enough. What we're making is not enough to support,"" Lloyd said. ""There's just no way they can justify what is going on is right.""

Opponents, many of them Republicans, argue that the higher wages translate into fewer jobs and higher consumer costs. So wage hike bills in Republican-controlled legislatures, like Florida and South Carolina, are not expected to pass. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott said the claim that working families need the boost to make ends meet makes him ""cringe, because I know that statement is a lie.""

""Even if we did raise the minimum wage, working families will still not be able to make ends meet on those jobs,"" Scott said. ""We need good jobs that lead to good careers for our families, and that's what I am focused on.""

Already, a Democrat-backed bill to increase Indiana's minimum wage by $1 was blocked by majority Republicans on a party-line vote Tuesday.

Win or lose, the legislation gives Democrats a potential weapon against Republican opponents. Eddie Vale, a Democratic strategist with close ties to labor unions, said Republicans who oppose a wage hike will face fierce criticism.

""There's a lot of people in this state that are making the minimum wage that are voting Republican right now,"" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Turner of Tennessee, where they plan to introduce a minimum wage bill this year. ""Maybe if they see that they don't have their best interests in their heart, they might change their minds.""

There's hope that success will breed more success. Vale, a top adviser at the Democratic super PAC American Bridge, said the thinking behind the push is to get things started at the state level, where lawmakers come into more direct contact with their constituents. Once state legislatures start moving, it will lend momentum to a federal expansion.

In Minnesota, Rep. Ryan Winkler said as the debate spreads to more states, lawmakers might be more comfortable boosting the wage floor in his state.

""It's not peer pressure, but it's safety in numbers,"" Winkler said. ""It makes people feel like this is a mainstream thing to do.""

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0424/Florida-execution-Robert-Hendrix-convicted-of-murdering-2-executed-Weds","Florida execution: Robert Hendrix, convicted of murdering 2, executed Weds.","Florida execution: Hendrix was convicted of the 1990 murders of Elmer and Michelle Scott at their Lake County home.

Amy Jo Smith (seated) sings with protesters to the death penalty, April 23, at the Florida State Prison near Starke, Fla., just hours before the execution of Robert Eugene Hendrix, who killed his cousin and his cousin's wife to prevent him from testifying in a burglary case against him.

Florida executed a man on Wednesday who was convicted of murdering two relatives to prevent one of them from testifying against him in a burglary trial.

Robert Hendrix was pronounced dead at 6:21 p.m. at Florida State Prison in Starke, shortly after the lethal injection procedure began. He made no final statement.

Hendrix was convicted of the 1990 murders of Elmer and Michelle Scott at their Lake County home.

Prosecutors said Hendrix killed the couple because Elmer Scott intended to testify against him. But Hendrix's attorney said no forensic evidence links his client to the murders, and the witnesses against him were unreliable.

Hendrix was the fourth person executed in Florida this year and the 16th since Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011.

The victims' daughter, Rachel Scott, was only 5 months old when her parents were killed. She was home in her crib but was not harmed, and said she hopes her parents are remembered for who they were as people.

""I plan on keeping them alive in my heart and suggest everyone else do the same. I will always continue to tell their story,"" she said.

Elmer Scott's sister, Lisa Hunt, said the execution brought a sense of relief. Lisa is also a cousin of Hendrix.

""I feel today, as we watched my cousin die, justice, only because he is finally dead,"" she said.

Evidence in the case showed Hendrix shot and stabbed Scott in his trailer home the night before Hendrix's trial in the armed burglary case was to begin in August 1990. Hendrix then murdered Scott's wife, Michelle.

Scott had already made a plea deal with prosecutors in the armed burglary case in which he and Hendrix broke into a house but only Scott was caught. His cooperation led investigators to arrest Hendrix. In the weeks leading up to his trial, prosecutors say, Hendrix told friends he would kill Scott rather than return to prison

Prosecutors say that on the night of the murders, Hendrix's live-in girlfriend — Denise Turbyville — drove him from Orange County, where they lived, to the Scotts' trailer in neighboring Lake County and dropped him off.

Michelle Scott welcomed Hendrix into the trailer, and told him Elmer Scott was in the bathroom shaving and would be out shortly. When Elmer Scott came out, Hendrix asked to use the bathroom. When he left the bathroom, Hendrix fired shots at Elmer Scott and then grabbed a knife and attacked Michelle Scott, according to prosecutors.

Turbyville pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and was sentenced to 75 years in prison. Another witness against Hendrix, Roger LaForce, was a confidential informant for a narcotics task force and stood to gain a lighter sentence for his assistance, Hendrix's attorneys say.

Hendrix attorney Harry Brody also said the presiding judge had a conflict of interest, Hendrix's trial lawyer was ineffective at presenting mitigating circumstances during sentencing and that Hendrix was shackled during his trial, leading jurors to a biased impression that he was dangerous.

During sentencing, Hendrix's attorneys failed to call witnesses who could have testified that Hendrix was regularly beaten by his father and had a serious drug addiction, factors that could explain his unbalanced mental state, according to court papers filed by Hendrix.

Earlier Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Hendrix's last-minute request for a stay without comment. He ate a last meal of pork chops, sausage gravy and biscuits, German chocolate cake and a soft drink, state corrections officials said.","2014-04-24 11:21:00","0","58.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","180.0","75.0","0.0","381.0","0.0","37.0","9","650","91.72","84.14","7.02","3.00","20.31","26.46","70.92","42.62","8.92","6.92","0.77","0.15","0.00","4.92","1.08","2.00","6.92","14.46","5.23","2.46","5.23","0.62","11.69","2.62","1.38","1.38","2.15","0.31","4.31","0.92","3.38","0.15","2.00","0.31","13.23","1.85","0.46","1.69","4.15","6.15","1.23","1.69","0.92","0.15","0.46","2.00","2.92","0.46","1.85","0.46","2.00","0.15","0.77","0.00","1.08","6.46","2.46","1.08","2.92","0.31","0.62","8.46","3.23","0.62","14.00","1.23","7.08","5.85","1.69","0.77","1.38","0.15","0.00","3.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.08","5.54","6.00","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.62","1.85","0.31","0.00","3157","7.51","21.322580645161292","929","647","34","69.11","11.2","8.3","12.24","12.1","120","10.4","17.01885625965997","321","19.32","5","0.41","0","23","13","49","0","77","35","1","0","5","95","104","0","36","0","0","27","18","17","0","0","4","19","0","15","66","13","16","14","4","2","4","0","4"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0404/Koch-brothers-weren-t-consulted-before-seniors-group-criticized-senators","Koch brothers weren't consulted before seniors group criticized senators","Koch brothers are influential in conservative political circles. A seniors organization, financially supported by the Koch brothers, didn't tell them an ad attacking seven US senators would be aired.

Koch brothers: In this Aug. 30, 2013 file photo, Americans for Prosperity Foundation Chairman David Koch speaks in Orlando, Fla.

A seniors group that received almost $16 million from the conservative Koch brothers started running ads this week that the billionaire siblings did not support.

The Koch-led Freedom Partners routinely spends millions to help conservative allies, but the umbrella organization does not have a day-to-day say in those groups' tactics. That sometimes leads to conflicting or contradictory messages coming out of the brothers' vast network of advocacy organizations.

Take, for instance, the 60 Plus Association's latest ads against seven members of the Senate Banking Committee. The $1.5 million in ads aims to derail a proposal to effectively scrap mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.

In the ads, the seniors group urges committee members — three Democrats and four Republicans — ""don't bring Obamacare to the mortgage industry.""

It was not a message that is shared among the Kochs' political advisers, who were frustrated by the ad, according to an official inside Freedom Partners, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss private conversations inside the Koch network.

A spokesman at 60 Plus Association said the group does not consult any of its donors, including Freedom Partners, about its ads.

""No one is putting words in our mouths,"" spokesman Gerry Scimeca said Thursday. ""This is an ad that comes from us.""

The occasional split between advocacy groups and their patrons are a risk the Kochs run as their network continues to grow in scale and importance.

Long active in conservative politics, the 78-year-old Charles Koch and the 73-year-old David Koch seized on the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling in the 2010 Citizens United case allowing virtually unlimited corporate spending on political campaigns, often without disclosing donors.

Adding to the brothers' political clout: Wednesday's Supreme Court decision voided the overall federal limit on individuals' contributions — $123,200 in 2013 and 2014, broken down as $48,600 to all candidates combined and $74,600 to all party committees and political action committees in total. Donors like the Koch brothers can now donate the maximum to as many candidates and committees as they like.

The Koch brothers inherited a small Wichita, Kan.-based oil company from their father. They expanded worldwide into chemicals, textiles, paper and other products, building a hugely profitable and privately held conglomerate.

Forbes magazine ranks the brothers as tied for sixth among the world's richest people, worth $40 billion each.

The brothers spent $250 million to influence 2012's elections, including almost $16 million to the 60 Plus Association. The group sent $32 million to Americans for Prosperity, which would go on to spend $122 million on elections in 2012.

Other conservative groups inside the Koch fold include the Center to Protect Patient Rights, the American Future Fund, the National Rifle Association, the Chamber of Commerce and Heritage Action for America.

That hardly means the Kochs control those groups. Instead, these groups sometimes take actions that run counter to the Kochs' preferred strategy and occasionally create headaches for their umbrella organization.

For instance, Heritage Action for America agitated for last year's partial government shutdown. The Kochs' political network did not.

Democrats have made criticism to the Koch brothers a central piece of their electoral strategy heading toward November's elections, linking GOP policy proposals with the industrialists even when evidence is dubious.

And this week's ads address mortgage legislation that is not a priority for Freedom Partners.

""We sometimes get involved in arcane issues,"" Scimeca said.

The seniors group said it worries that changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could hurt retirees, whose investments sometimes include bonds sold through the mortgage giants.

The ads are running against Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who is being hammered on television in ads from Americans for Prosperity, another Koch-backed group. Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Warner of Virginia are also facing the 60 Plus Association ads.

The ads are also running against Republicans, including Sen. Mike Crapo, the Idaho senator who is the senior Republican on the banking panel, as well as Sens. Dean Heller of Nevada, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Jerry Moran of Kansas.","2014-04-04 10:41:00","0","65.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","44.0","0.0","198.0","77.0","0.0","395.0","0.0","37.0","9","738","96.85","75.53","20.19","45.69","18.92","33.20","72.49","38.08","5.69","1.76","0.00","0.54","0.00","0.14","1.08","3.93","8.67","14.36","3.93","1.76","4.61","1.49","9.08","2.98","1.36","0.95","5.56","2.71","3.52","2.30","1.22","0.27","0.68","0.14","10.30","1.76","0.54","0.00","1.76","7.59","0.95","1.63","0.54","2.03","0.41","2.44","1.49","0.14","1.08","0.14","0.54","0.14","0.14","0.27","0.00","12.87","6.10","0.95","4.34","1.36","0.41","2.85","5.56","0.41","13.28","2.85","6.23","4.34","6.37","0.81","0.68","2.57","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","17.62","5.69","5.69","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.22","1.08","2.30","0.00","1.36","3851","8.68","21.4","1174","728","40","53.0","12.7","10.4","14.85","13.8","191","8.166666666666666","19.774505494505497","404","19.54","7","0.35","0","23","38","75","0","78","49","0","1","4","84","116","11","75","0","0","8","8","33","0","0","1","21","0","17","25","19","13","17","21","6","4","1","1"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0512/Colorado-Wyoming-snowstorms-close-parts-of-I-80","Colorado, Wyoming snowstorms close parts of I-80","Colorado, Wyoming snowstorms dumped up to two-feet of snow in places. Some 70 snowplows were in the streets of Denver, Colorado. In Wyoming, snowstorms closed a 150-mile stretch of Interstate 80 from Cheyenne to Rawlins on Sunday.

Dozens of snowplows were taking to the slush-covered streets of Denver early Monday, after a powerful spring storm dropped heavy snow across parts of Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska, even as stormy weather moved into the plains states and drew warnings about conditions ripe for severe thunderstorm and tornadoes.

The Mother's Day storm dropped more than a foot of sloppy, wet snow on parts of Colorado and Wyoming, while nearly a foot fell in parts of the Nebraska Panhandle. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for most of northern Colorado and parts of southern Wyoming for all of Sunday and for Monday morning.

Forecasters warned that instability ahead of the cold front created conditions for damaging winds as thunderstorms and tornadoes developed in Nebraska on Sunday and threatened to push south. The storm also created high winds across the West.

Powerful thunderstorms produced tornadoes as they moved across Nebraska on Sunday caused damage in several towns and rural areas in the east of the state. Officials said the storms damaged homes and businesses in or near Sutton, Garland, Cordova and Daykin, and knocked out power to 18,000 utility customers. By Monday morning, 6,200 customers were still without power.

The storm was expected to weaken as it heads northeast from the Plains, possibly bringing rain as it moves into the Great Lakes, the weather service said.

Kyle Fredin, a meteorologist for the weather service in Boulder, said the weather pattern is typical for this time of year, and ""it's going to be kind of the same thing pretty much through the end of June.""

And the storm brought picturesque scenes to some areas.

""We got about a foot of snow and all the trees are covered. It looks like a beautiful painting,'"" said Janie Robertson, owner of the Dripping Springs Resort B&B in Estes Park.

In Colorado, Department of Transportation officials said plunging temperatures and snow created icy road conditions, and multiple accidents were reported on several highways Sunday.

Denver officials deployed 70 snowplows overnight to prepare for Monday's commute. At 3 a.m. Monday, the weather service said it was still snowing around the city.

Julie Smith, a spokeswoman for Denver International Airport, said crews treated runways in anticipation of dropping temperatures Sunday night.

""At this point we are seeing some delays with our airlines while they are getting their deicing operations up and running, and we do expect the airlines to be fully deicing in the morning,"" she said. About 25 flights were canceled Monday morning because of the weather.

Southwest of Denver, a seven-car pileup Sunday evening injured a sheriff's deputy and three civilians on U.S. 285 near the community of Doubleheader, The Denver Post reported. Weather was likely a factor in the crash, but its cause was still being investigated, sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley told the newspaper.

""The roads are just really bad out there,"" she said.

In another Highway 285 crash, the State Patrol said a Jefferson County Sheriff's deputy who was helping a motorist that slid off the roadway was taken to a hospital with undetermined injuries after the deputy's parked car was stuck by an SUV. Two people in the SUV were also hospitalized as a precaution.

Snow amounts could vary greatly as temperatures continue to drop later Sunday. But up to 15 inches could fall at higher elevations and 4 to 9 inches could fall at lower elevations, including Denver and other cities along Colorado's Front Range.

""May snow certainly isn't unheard of here in Colorado, even down in the Denver metro area,"" said David Barjenbruch, another weather service meteorologist in Boulder. ""If we see the total accumulations that we are anticipating from this storm, we are certainly going to see a top 10 May snow event for the Denver metro area.""

In southern Wyoming, the storm forced transportation officials to close a 150-mile stretch of Interstate 80 from Cheyenne to Rawlins on Sunday. In Nebraska, part of westbound Interstate 80 was closed to keep motorists from reaching Wyoming.

The weather service said mountainous areas in south-central Wyoming got up to 2 feet of snow, and the metro areas of Cheyenne and Laramie averaged 6 to 10 inches. Rob Cox, a weather service meteorologist in Cheyenne, said he expects more accumulation overnight, likely an additional 2 to 4 inches in some locations.

""There will be a lot of water after all this is said and done,"" he said, adding that there could be some localized flooding.

In the West, high winds at the bottom of the storm sent dust blowing across Arizona and New Mexico, and the Los Angeles area had been under ""red flag"" fire warnings, with authorities saying blazes could quickly spread out of control under low humidity, gusty winds and dry conditions.

The storm is the result of a low-pressure system moving east colliding with a cold air mass from the north. Spring-like weather was expected to return to the Rockies by Tuesday.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0603/Primary-roundup-Tea-party-hopes-hinge-on-photo-finish-Mississippi-vote","Primary roundup: Tea party hopes hinge on photo-finish Mississippi vote","In southern Mississippi, six-term Sen. Thad Cochran is facing tea party challenger Chris McDaniel. With 91 percent of the state's precincts in, McDaniel was ahead, with a June 24 runoff looking increasingly possible.

A US flag waves as Jaimie Altstiel walks out the doors of Faith Baptist Fellowship in Sioux Falls, S.D., after voting during the South Dakota primary election on Tuesday, June 3.

Mississippi's Senate primary race on Tuesday represented the ultraconservative tea party's last, best chance to topple a Republican establishment-backed candidate in this year's midterm elections, and prove it remains relevant a few years after it burst upon the political scene.

Nominations for the Senate are also on the ballot in Alabama, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota in a year in which Republicans need to gain six seats to win a majority. Five states picked nominees for governor, including California, where Democrat Jerry Brown cruised to renomination to a fourth term.

A loose coalition of small-government, anti-tax activists, the tea party rose to prominence in the wake of President Barack Obama's election 2008 and forced the Republican party further to the right than many Americans were comfortable with.

After a string of victories in midterm elections sent tea party candidates to the House and Senate, some of their luster has faded.

Many establishment Republicans fear tea party victories in primaries only play into Democratic hands as their candidates are often too right-wing for general elections voters.

The eight states holding primaries will help determine whether Republicans have a credible chance of gaining the six Senate seats required to take control of the chamber in November elections.

The Republicans are virtually certain to retain their House majority, and control of the Senate would allow them to shut down Obama's legislative agenda during the last two years of his term. For this reason, the Republican establishment is working hard to keep tea party candidates off the ballot in November.

In southern Mississippi, six-term Sen. Thad Cochran is facing conservative challenger Chris McDaniel, who carries the hopes of tea party supporters nationwide, eager to topple a high-profile Republican incumbent after earlier losses in Senate primaries in Texas, North Carolina, and Kentucky.

Returns from 91 percent of the state's precincts showed the challenger narrowly ahead in a three-way race, and a June 24 runoff was increasingly possible if neither candidate gains more than 50 percent of the vote.

During the campaign, Senator Cochran, 76, emphasized the federal money that he has steered to Mississippi for decades. The 41-year-old Mr. McDaniel's critique of the incumbent is that he's too willing to go along with Democrats in Washington.

McDaniel's campaign suffered a setback when four of his supporters were arrested on charges of photographing Cochran's bedridden wife, who has dementia.

McDaniel said he knew nothing about it, but Cochran supporters suspected dirty politics.

Cochran meanwhile has campaigned with Southern gentility, the party establishment's support and a promise to leverage his Senate seniority for federal help for the state. He cast himself as a reliable opponent of Obama.

While a McDaniel win would be a rare victory for tea party conservatives this year over a candidate favored by the party's establishment wing, it's not likely to affect control of the Senate. The winner of the Republicanprimary will be the heavy favorite in November against the Democratic nominee.

One race, which may affect control of the Senate is in Iowa, where Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's retirement triggered a feisty Republican primary.

State Sen. Joni Ernst beat out four other challengers Tuesday, following a campaign whose ads about guns and hog castration helped her shore up support among conservatives. Republicans are eyeing as a prime opportunity to pick up a seat.

In North Dakota, former Gov. Mike Rounds cruised to victory in the Republican primary for the US Senate seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson. Republicans believe South Dakota presents one of their best chances nationally to take a seat from Democrats.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0602/Doctors-and-Democrats-Why-have-physicians-started-leaning-left","Doctors and Democrats: Why have physicians started leaning left?","A new study of contributions from doctors defies the historical image of doctors as a conservative, right-leaning bunch, say researchers.

Once strongly aligned with the GOP, American physicians are leaning more left, an analysis of campaign contributions over two decades shows.

The first rigorous look at donor doctors also finds they've become increasingly generous, with political contributions surging to almost $200 million in recent years.

An increase in female doctors – who more often than men donated to Democrats – and a decline in physicians working on their own or in small practices occurred during study years. Those changes likely contributed but reasons for the political shift are unclear, said study co-author David Rothman, a social medicine professor at Columbia University's medical school.

""We've got to stop thinking of physicians as a group as 'solidly Republican.' They are polarized, almost equally divided between Republicans and Democrats,"" Rothman said.

The study focused on donations of $200 or more to presidential and congressional candidates or political organizations from 1991 through 2012. At the beginning, almost 3 percent of US doctors made contributions, rising to almost 10 percent by the end of the study.

Doctor donations to Republican candidates peaked in the mid-1990s, when almost 75 percent of all MD contributions went to the GOP. Those donations mostly declined after that, to about 50 percent in 2011-12. The exception was in 2009-10 during emergence of the Affordable Care Act, when Republican donations briefly increased.

Donations from non-physicians also increased and tilted more Democratic during the study, but the authors say the MD findings are remarkable for two reasons: they defy the historical image of doctors as a conservative, right-leaning bunch, and political contributions from doctors increased at a greater rate than among the general public.

Political alliances also differed by medical specialty: Surgeons, dominated by men, were the strongest GOP supporters while pediatricians – more than half of whom are women – were most likely to contribute to Democrats.

By the end of the study, 24 percent of women who donated gave to GOP candidates versus 52 percent of the men.

Women comprise almost one-third of the nation's 1 million physicians and almost half of medical school graduates, according to 2012-13 data from the Association of American Medical Colleges.

The study was published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine. The researchers analyzed data from the Federal Election Commission; a political contributions database created by Stanford political scientist Adam Bonica, the lead author; and health-care provider directories.

Doctors' right-leaning reputation dates back at least as far as 1965, when the American Medical Association strongly opposed the passage of Medicare, the study authors say.

The AMA has since lost sway – less than one-third of US physicians are members – but it remains the nation's largest doctor group and a powerful lobbying presence in Washington. It also has moved more to the center, including voicing support for the Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare.

For the 2012 elections, the AMA says reports to the FEC show it contributed $2 million to campaign committees, with recipients including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Republican National Committee.

A journal editorial says the study provides an unprecedented, though largely predictable description of doctors' campaign contributions. The author, Dr. Arnold Relman, a professor emeritus at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital, also questioned whether the study represents all physicians since contributions totaling less than $200 weren't included.

Rothman said it's unlikely the smaller contributions would have changed the results.

With nearly 1 million people spending more than 1.2 billion hours working for AmeriCorps, former President Bill Clinton said the volunteers have 'kept your promise to get things done.'

President Barack Obama, followed by former President Bill Clinton, arrives for a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Friday, Sept. 12, 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of the AmeriCorps national service program and welcome hundreds of new volunteers to be sworn in for duty.

President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton joined forces Friday to mark the 20th anniversary of the AmeriCorps national service program, heralding the impact volunteering can have on both individuals and the nation.

""You have made America stronger for what you have done,"" Obama said during a White House ceremony where hundreds of new volunteers were sworn in for duty. ""AmeriCorps has changed the life of our nation.""

Clinton signed the legislation that created the AmeriCorps program, an act he called one of his proudest achievements. With nearly 1 million people spending more than 1.2 billion hours working for AmeriCorps, Clinton said the volunteers have ""kept your promise to get things done.""

At a time of partisanship and frustration with Washington, Clinton said the volunteers give him a reason to be hopeful.

""This is no time to be pessimistic about America's future,"" he said. ""Look at you. Look at the rainbow of diversity united to advance our common humanity.""

Obama announced a new initiative to encourage employers — private, nonprofit and government at all levels — to create recruitment, hiring and advancement opportunities for graduates of AmeriCorps, which operates exclusively in the U.S., and the Peace Corps, which directs volunteers to service opportunities outside the U.S.

Several private and nonprofit employers already have signed up for the effort, including Disney, Comcast, CSX, the American Red Cross and Habitat for Humanity, the White House said.

Obama also announced a new award to recognize the accomplishments of younger volunteers and encourage service by their peers.

In addition, an expansion of partnerships between the Corporation for National and Community Service, other federal agencies and the private sector will create thousands of new opportunities for service in communities across the country, the White House said. The corporation is the federal agency that runs AmeriCorps.

Beyond the White House, swearing-in ceremonies were also being held Friday in the 50 states and several U.S. territories.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2014/1129/Chris-Christie-preps-for-2016-showdown-at-GOP-governors-conference","Chris Christie preps for 2016 showdown at GOP governors conference","The looming 2016 contest was the subtext of most events at the Republican Governors Association's annual conference in Boca Raton, Florida last week. A half-dozen potential GOP candidates spent the week schmoozing donors and sizing each other up.

A half-dozen potential Republican presidential contenders spent last week peacocking across the sprawling grounds of a pink-hued luxury resort, schmoozing with donors and sizing up the competition in the party's most fractured field in decades.

They rarely criticized each other in public, but there were subtle jabs.

Within hours of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie gracing the cover of a magazine in an illustration of him kissing a baby's head, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal suggested the party needs bold leaders, not showmen.

""We have enough politicians who try to be celebrities and kiss babies and cut ribbons,"" Jindal said.

Whether it was an intentional shot at Christie or not, the looming 2016 contest changed the context of every speech, interview and panel discussion at the Republican Governors Association's annual conference. The summit at the oceanside Boca Raton Resort & Club felt like a test run for what is increasingly shaping up to be a brutal showdown for the GOP presidential nomination among more than a dozen potential contenders, including a cluster of governors.

In contrast, Hillary Rodham Clinton has spent recent weeks basking in the glows of grandmotherhood and applause at a few public events — without any major challenger for the Democratic nod, should she choose to pursue it.

While the potential GOP field appears stronger than four years ago, the Republicans are without a front-runner.

""There are, like, 16 people who could run,"" said former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who downplayed the potential risk of so many candidates at each other's throats. ""They won't all run, of course, but a lot of quality in there.""

The candidates aren't expected to start formally declaring their intentions until the first quarter of next year. But the developing tensions were already apparent as five potential candidates appeared together on stage in a packed, grand ballroom to answering questions from moderator Chuck Todd, the host of NBC's ""Meet The Press"" — a dress rehearsal of sorts for the looming primary.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a former congressman, repeatedly crossed words with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, challenging Walker's telling of the history of the Bill Clinton administration. On another panel, Walker mentioned that he'd been in high school at a time when Kasich had voted on a piece of immigration legislation.

""Well, you don't look that much younger,"" Kasich quipped.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry left little doubt that the race is on.

""I think the campaign has engaged. We're talking about issues here that are going to affect the presidential election in 2016,"" Perry said. ""I think we need to have this conversation with America.""

The governors who would be president agreed on one thing: their superiority as candidates over their nongubernatorial competition. Those in attendance repeatedly stressed that the party's best hope for reclaiming the White House lies with a chief executive at the top of the ticket.

But they dismissed the idea of any kind of advance pact to ensure they don't inflict too much damage during the primary.

""Um, no, no pacts, at least none that I'm involved in,"" said Christie, joking that he'd be closely watching Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, another potential contender, to make sure he wasn't forging any deals.

Behind the scenes, however, that's exactly what the contenders were aiming for.

Dozens of the party's biggest donors enjoyed private audiences with prospective candidates. They mingled in hotel corridors, at fancy dinners, on a nearby golf course where basketball great Michael Jordan was spotted, and at fetes, like an oceanside reception decorated with twinkling lights, a clam cake station and ice sculptures.

The guest list included Republican heavy hitters like Paul Singer, Anthony Scaramucci and Foster Friess.

Christie, who arrived with what appeared to be his entire senior team, said he was enjoying spending time with donors ""in an atmosphere that's a lot more relaxed, like this one this week.""

Indeed, one top consultant who has served as senior adviser on numerous campaigns was spotted walking through the lobby in his bathing suit on the way to the pool between meetings. And at all times, lobbyists from companies like Google hovered, slipping business cards to governors and aides, who left one speed dating-style session with pockets bursting.

Still, the presidential undertones were more subtle at times than in annual retreats of years past when prospective candidates like Mitt Romney, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani held private meetings to craft campaign strategy with key supporters.

""In prior election cycles, the RGA postelection meeting has been the kicking off point for presidential campaigns,"" said GOP operative Charlie Spies, who led Romney's super PAC in 2012, echoing several other longtime attendees. ""This year's event was more low-key.""

The event was ""not about asking. This is about thanking and congratulating,"" said longtime Republican adviser and money man Fred Malek. ""Part of it also is inspiration so that people will have their mind set on moving ahead in the next cycle.""","2014-11-29 09:54:00","1","65.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","37.0","0.0","200.0","72.0","0.0","361.0","0.0","37.0","9","858","95.89","67.52","26.60","63.33","19.07","26.92","75.64","40.79","6.99","2.80","0.35","0.35","0.12","0.93","1.05","4.20","8.74","15.03","5.48","2.33","3.61","1.52","11.19","4.43","3.38","1.75","2.21","3.38","4.43","3.15","1.17","0.47","0.35","0.12","8.28","0.23","0.12","0.23","0.93","8.16","0.93","0.70","0.82","2.80","0.93","2.33","2.33","1.05","0.93","0.35","0.58","0.23","0.12","0.00","0.23","8.62","1.86","2.56","4.55","0.47","0.23","4.90","4.66","2.10","15.38","1.52","7.93","5.94","5.59","2.33","0.23","0.93","0.00","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.23","0.00","18.30","5.24","6.53","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.70","3.03","2.56","0.00","0.12","4336","8.52","19.57777777777778","1301","855","43","59.74","12.5","9.9","13.52","13.5","211","7.583333333333334","19.831345029239767","478","18.56","12","0.41","0","19","11","94","1","119","83","4","5","4","139","98","2","66","0","0","21","7","24","2","1","4","13","0","18","48","34","14","15","16","2","11","0","3"

In this June 13, 2014 file photo President Barack Obama and Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe David Archambault II, left, watch dancers during a visit to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in Cannon Ball, N.D. Obama on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2014 announced an initiative to improve conditions and opportunities for American Indian youth, more than one-third of whom live in poverty.

President Barack Obama announced an initiative Wednesday aimed at improving conditions and opportunities for American Indian youth, more than a third of whom live in poverty.

Obama's Generation Indigenous initiative calls for programs focused on better preparing young American Indians for college and careers, and developing leadership skills through the Department of Education and the Aspen Institute's Center for Native American Youth. Members of the president's staff also plan to visit reservations next year.

The announcement, made as part of the White House Tribal Nations Conference that Obama is hosting on Wednesday, comes five months after the president and his wife visited the impoverished Standing Rock Indian Reservation in the Dakotas.

The 3,600-square-mile reservation is home to about 8,500 people, many of whom live in run-down homes, and where the unemployment rate runs as high as 20 percent. The suicide rate for American Indians aged 15 to 24 is more than twice the national rate.

Cecilia Munoz, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the president and first lady ""were deeply moved"" after listening to children's stories about challenges they faced on the reservation, such as depression and alcohol abuse.

Wednesday's conference involves leaders from 566 federally recognized tribal nations, along with 36 White House Youth Ambassadors chosen from around the country through an essay contest.

""People who grow up in a poverty culture sometimes need guidance, need values, need a little bit of structure,"" said Chase Iron Eyes, an attorney and Native American rights activist from Standing Rock who is attending the conference.

""Through some of the things the administration is doing, it looks like they're trying to do that,"" he said. ""Youth — they just need the right tools, and maybe they can empower themselves.""

The White House also released a report Wednesday acknowledging failures in federal policy and highlighting the need for more tribal help in the areas of economic development, health and education. Slightly more than two-thirds of Native youth graduate from high school, according to the 2014 Native Youth Report.

One of the report's recommendations is to strengthen tribal control of the education system on reservations. Officials are working to overhaul the Bureau of Indian Education, which is responsible for educating 48,000 Indian students in 23 states, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said.

Jewell estimated it would cost more than $1 billion to fix schools with crumbling infrastructures. Officials are pursuing money through Congress, existing government programs and philanthropic organizations.

""We have to get creative,"" Jewell said.

"http://www.euronews.com/2014/07/22/mauritania-water-crisis-in-nouakchott","Mauritania: Water crisis in Nouakchott","Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, is a town built around a well of the same name, where camel herders used to go and water their flock.

Today, it suffers from a serious water problem, as Sidi Al Moktar Sheiguer explains: “You know, our city is in a basin. It’s below sea level and the smallest tsunami would, quite simply, totally flood the capital. Nouakchott has no pipeline, no sanitation system or diversion for trickling sewage water. And that water has to find a place to stagnate, which it does underground before surfacing here, for example.”

The used, stagnant water can be found in several places. The lack of sanitation ducts causes it to resurface, resulting in serious problems in terms of pollution and providing the perfect breeding ground for malaria mosquitoes.

“But one of the biggest threats is the advancement of sand dunes. Here there are dunes which can bury entire districts of the city,” adds Sidi Al Moktar Sheiguer.

The lack of water means the city has few trees, which would act as a buffer to desertification and the advancing sand.

But in a better off area of town, the water problem is less severe.

Journalist Mohamad Memine shows us an example of “how the other half live”: “As you can see here, we have running, drinkable water. It comes through a pipeline, originating in a river in Senegal. This is how it is in the so-called ‘well-off’ parts of the town. In this area, the water problem – apart from winter floods – is basically solved. But in another district, it’s an entirely different situation,” he says.

We visit the poverty belt of the city, where the most destitute live in informal, provisional settlements, deprived of sanitary facilities and fresh water. They are forced to resort to another drinking water supply system.

“We have nothing,” says one local woman. “We buy water from street carts. We don’t have pipes, taps, anything… Nothing at all.”

A water supply can be found several kilometres away from the settlement, built with the help of the European Union. People go to buy water by the barrel or by the container and carry it home on the back of a donkey or on carts. Some people have made a career out of it.

One water vendor outlines his prices: “We sell the water at around 14 euro cents a barrel and they sell it on to the consumer at around 57 cents,” he explains. “We sell a container for 3 cents and the resale value is double that, at around 6 cents.”

Those living nearby go directly to the vendor to buy their water: “Here, 20 litres of tap water sell for around 6 cents. We both drink and wash our clothes in it,” one consumer tells us.

But there are concerns about Thaci’s involvement in the sale of organs removed from Serb prisoners during the 1998-99 Kosovo conflict.

Despite Thaci’s trademark thumbs up gesture, his popularity has taken a hit as frustrations grow among Kosovo Albanians over widespread corruption, nepotism and poverty after six years of PDK rule.

Opinion polls show the head of the opposition LDK ,(Democratic League of Kosovo), Isa Mustapha is just behind the ruling PDK party.

All main opposition parties have vowed not to go into coalition with the PDK to form the next government.

There has been little sign of election activity in the northern, Serbian half of the town of Mitrovica. There are doubts that Serbian minorities will take part in the vote.

After the election, attention is expected to turn to an ad-hoc tribunal to investigate the organ-harvesting allegations.","2014-06-08 00:03:01","0","91.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","335.0","262.0","0.0","513.0","13.0","25.0","3","163","99.00","54.87","20.01","48.54","20.38","23.93","70.55","41.72","2.45","1.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","0.00","1.23","9.82","19.02","6.13","3.07","1.84","0.61","11.04","2.45","1.84","0.00","3.07","1.23","3.68","2.45","1.23","0.61","0.61","0.00","3.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","5.52","0.61","0.00","1.23","1.84","0.61","1.84","0.61","0.61","0.00","0.00","1.23","1.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.82","1.84","0.00","6.13","1.23","0.61","1.23","7.98","1.84","15.95","3.07","8.59","4.29","2.45","1.23","0.00","2.45","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.88","4.91","3.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.84","0.00","1.23","1.23","0.00","799","8.77","20.625","239","160","8","59.64","11.9","9.9","12.88","13.1","42","10.4","20.5","120","19.0","4","0.41","0","2","3","16","0","27","11","0","0","2","32","23","1","9","0","0","1","1","2","0","0","1","5","0","7","1","1","5","5","7","0","0","0","0"

Sebastian Ariosa from Uruguay was diagnosed with mediastinal cancer in June at which point he returned home for treatment.

To add insult to injury the 28-year-old defender revealed that his club Olimpia owed him six months salary at the time of his diagnosis.

He said: “I always had to show them that they were at fault so that they complied and well – now with this, my patience has worn thin. It is a blow that one receives at a very undesirable moment.”

Club director Raul Pintos argued that the suspension was only temporary and said Arioso – who had two years left to run on his contract – would be welcome to return when he had recovered.

Paraguay’s football union has provided Ariosa with a lawyer and the pair are to meet with club officials on Monday to discuss the player’s situation. His case is likely to be followed closely by world football’s governing body FIFA.","2014-01-06 07:18:14","0","90.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","335.0","262.0","0.0","510.0","13.0","25.0","3","175","75.46","88.48","8.00","3.68","21.88","21.14","85.71","49.71","14.29","9.14","1.14","0.00","0.00","6.29","1.71","5.14","5.14","14.86","9.71","3.43","3.43","0.00","16.00","1.14","0.00","1.71","2.29","0.57","4.57","1.14","3.43","0.00","1.14","0.57","13.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.29","5.71","1.71","1.14","1.14","1.14","0.57","0.00","2.29","1.14","1.14","0.00","3.43","1.14","2.86","0.00","0.00","9.71","4.00","0.57","2.86","0.57","1.71","8.57","7.43","0.00","17.14","1.71","7.43","8.57","2.29","4.00","0.57","1.14","0.00","0.00","0.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.57","0.00","9.71","4.57","0.57","0.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.14","1.14","1.71","0.00","0.00","792","8.05","25.428571428571427","247","176","8","66.07","11.7","9.5","9.81","11.6","37","10.2","19.20909090909091","122","23.57","3","0.49","0","3","4","10","0","25","8","0","0","1","36","13","0","3","0","0","10","7","6","0","0","0","8","0","9","15","2","6","1","7","2","1","0","1"

"http://www.euronews.com/2014/12/17/eu-may-appeal-against-court-order-to-remove-hamas-from-terror-list","EU 'may appeal' against court order to remove Hamas from terror list","The Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas is to come off the EU’s blacklist of terror organisations.

That is not a political decision by the European Union, which says it still considers Hamas to be a terrorist group.

Rather it is a ruling from the General Court of the European Union, the EU’s second highest court – which said the EU had no grounds to include the organisation on the list as the decision was based on media reports not considered analysis.

Hamas has hailed the court ruling as a “victory” for Palestinian rights.

“Hamas is a movement of resistance and it has a natural right according to all international laws and standards to resist the occupation,” said the movement’s Deputy Chief Moussa Abu Marzouk.

Israel has criticised the move, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Europe had “learned nothing” from the Holocaust.

He called on the EU to keep Hamas on its terror list, describing it as a “murderous organisation” committed to Israel’s destruction.

PM Netanyahu: We're not satisfied w/ the EU's explanation that the removal of Hamas from its list of terrorist orgs is a 'technical matter'> — PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) December 17, 2014

The burden of proof is on the European Union and we expect it to put Hamas back on the list forthwith > — PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) December 17, 2014

It is understood by all that Hamas is a murderous terrorist org, the covenant of which specifies the destruction of Israel as its goal. > — PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) December 17, 2014

The Israeli Foreign Ministry noted that the court had stressed it was not judging the substantive arguments about Hamas, rather the procedure.

“We believe that the Europeans agree with us and many others in the international community that Hamas is a terrorist organization. It is the Europeans who put Hamas on the terror list in the first place,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Paul Hirschson.

The EU’s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who visited Gaza last month, has said the decision will be studied carefully.

The Commission says the EU will consider making an appeal.

A European freeze on funding for Hamas remains in place for three months or until an eventual appeal is heard.","2014-12-17 15:17:09","1","99.0","37.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","342.0","265.0","0.0","512.0","13.0","28.0","3","366","97.19","61.83","13.86","1.00","26.14","26.23","74.32","44.54","7.65","1.37","0.00","1.09","0.00","0.27","0.00","6.28","13.66","12.57","6.56","1.37","2.73","1.64","13.93","2.46","1.37","1.37","2.46","1.09","4.64","0.55","4.10","2.19","1.64","0.00","5.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.27","7.38","3.01","0.55","0.82","0.27","1.37","2.19","3.01","0.27","2.46","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.29","2.46","0.82","6.01","0.55","0.27","4.37","7.38","1.09","10.38","2.46","5.46","2.73","3.01","0.00","0.00","0.27","1.09","0.82","0.55","0.00","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","16.12","3.83","3.55","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.73","2.46","1.64","1.64","1761","8.66","26.642857142857142","555","370","14","53.14","14.9","12.4","12.07","15.4","87","8.5","21.965405405405406","178","22.71","12","0.44","0","5","7","54","0","43","24","0","1","2","56","69","2","10","0","0","13","3","8","0","0","1","8","0","8","13","5","10","5","20","4","2","0","0"
"http://www.euronews.com/amp/2014/07/09/moldova-wants-to-become-eu-candidate-in-2015","Moldova wants to become EU candidate in 2015","At the end of June three former Soviet countries – Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia – signed Association agreements with the EU.

All three of them hope to become EU members sooner or later.

Moldovan Prime Minister Iurie Leancă told Euronews correspondent Natalia Richardson-Vikulina about his country great European expectations.

Natalia Richardson-Vikulina, Euronews:

An Association agreement Moldova-EU was just signed. Is it time to drink champagne? Or time to start working harder in the country where roughly only 50 percent of the population supports a deeper European integration?

Iurie Leancă, Prime Minister of Moldova:

I think it is time for both. For celebration because it reflects a period of 4.5 years of very hard work not just on negotiating of this agreement but also on making sure that reforms at home are conducted, that the legal framework has been approximated, that the practices, the standards have been changed. That is the reason why it is a very important event, a milestone in our European agenda. And we need to celebrate.

But of course it is also a very good reminder that now we need to work even harder and to make sure that Moldovan institutions, Moldovan economy meaning Moldovan entrepreneurs are able to benefit fully from the provisions of this agreement association agreement together with its integral part – free trade area arrangements.

Euronews:

Russian officials say that Moldova might face some risks in case of integration with the EU because the country will not be able to combine two regulatory systems – the CIS and the EU. What is your answer to that?

Iurie Leancă:

Our answer is very simple. In the first place we have conducted our own analysis on the compatibility of these two agreements. And our conclusion supported by foreign expertise as well was that there is no incompatibilities, that both agreements are in full compliance with a principle of the WTO. Number two: we said to our Russian colleagues that we have nothing to hide. That’s why we already had two rounds of consultations on a technical level. The last one took place in Kishinev (Chisinau) and we were able to respond to all the concerns of our Russian partners. And again I hope that our answers were good enough to show that there are no incompatibilities, that the free trade area of the European Union will not generate any big problems in our trade relations. Therefore what we said and we are committed to this principle that of there are any justifiable concerns let’s discuss them. But not on renegotiating the association agreement with the European Union together with free trade area but to look where specific concerns are and what could be the best mechanism to respond to those concerns.

Are you afraid that Moldova can have a Ukrainian or a Georgian-style scenario?

Iurie Leancă:

We of course studied very carefully what happened in Georgia years ago and in Ukraine which is our immediate neighbour, which is our extremely important partner, a country which we share a border with a length of 1240 km. We have very good traditional relationship, active trade, energy cooperation and of course Transnistrian conflict in the eastern district of Moldova which borders also Ukraine. Therefore we think we understand what happen in Ukraine and what were the conclusions for us of the Ukrainian tragedy developments. And the key conclusion is that once you have chosen your path, once you set up your objective you can not show hesitation or weaknesses. You just need to show determination and then the result will be the one that you expect. So that’s why the Ukrainian lessons to us is that we need to be more determined in pursuing the reforms, in showing to our people the results of those reforms and to explain that the European integration is the only existing alternative if you want to create a modern sustainable functioning state. And I am sure that this is the best option to proceed and in this way we will be able to avoid these tragic developments. Because ultimately the European integration means nothing else but making Moldova, Moldovan leadership much more predictable, much more stable. And if we are predictable it is not predictable only for our Western partners but also to our Eastern partners. So it’s a win-win situation and the entire region should benefit from this approach.","2014-07-09 18:47:17","0","36.0","2.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","22.0","24.0","0.0","41.0","2.0","4.0","0","730","65.83","86.64","16.71","92.96","22.12","26.85","83.29","51.37","13.70","6.71","0.41","4.52","1.37","0.14","0.27","6.99","7.12","11.92","7.95","5.07","5.75","1.37","11.78","3.42","1.64","2.05","1.92","2.19","6.16","5.21","0.96","0.55","0.00","0.27","9.73","0.00","0.82","0.00","0.14","12.33","2.88","2.60","1.92","2.33","1.51","2.74","1.51","0.68","0.41","0.41","0.27","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.14","13.29","7.40","2.74","2.33","1.64","0.82","2.60","9.18","1.92","11.23","0.27","7.53","3.42","4.25","0.41","0.27","1.23","0.27","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","9.45","3.97","2.47","0.96","0.00","0.55","0.00","0.68","0.00","0.55","0.27","0.00","3516","7.95","22.272727272727273","1087","729","34","58.21","12.3","10.5","11.72","12.8","150","7.2142857142857135","18.79045267489712","324","19.85","10","0.51","0","29","11","74","0","83","66","0","2","9","92","57","0","43","1","0","39","18","43","7","0","1","27","0","32","12","9","11","28","21","7","5","0","5"
"http://www.euronews.com/amp/2014/05/30/to-russia-with-love-transnistria-s-yearning-for-the-motherland","To Russia with love: Transnistria's yearning for 'the Motherland'","Transnistria dreams of a Russian future. The region broke away form Moldova in the early 1990s and, legally at least, remains part of it. De facto, it is a self-governing separate entity, though unrecognised by any UN member state.

Most of its half million inhabitants yearn to become part of the Russian Federation. Many, like Sergey, whom euronews spoke to in a park in the capital Tiraspol, have Russian passports: “Personally I prefer to be with Russia, because I feel close to Russia, I was born in Russia, I speak the Russian language.”

It is a sentiment shared by others on the streets of the city: “The best solution is to unite with the Russian Federation, and that’s not only my personal opinion but all people in Tiraspol and all over Transnistria think like that,” said one woman.

“Of course, I want Transnistria to join the Russian Federation. because many Transnistrians go to Russia for work so they can make a living and feed their families. Moldova gave us nothing,” another woman told our reporter.

Hundreds were killed in a brief but bloody separatist war in 1992 before Moscow intervened. Some 1,200 Russian troops remain there.

Today it is a frozen conflict and its impact is far-reaching. In Grigoriopol we met retired engineer Alexey Mocreac who showed us around a closed food canning factory. It used to employ up to 3,000 people. But breaking away from Moldova took an economic toll on Transnistria, the factory failed and people left.

“Many of the jobless went abroad: to Italy, Romania, some even to the USA, to Portugal. But most of them went to Russia, or to Ukraine because many people have relatives and family there,” Alexey explained.

Some 50,000 exiled Transnistrians send money home from abroad. It helps keep the economy afloat. The region urgently needs investors – but who wants to put money into an unrecognised breakaway state?

At the parliament in Tiraspol, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, as the assembly is called, has just pushed through a resolution calling on Russia and the UN to recognise Transnistria. Next on the wish list; annexation by Russia, which would require changing existing borders.

“We believe that the will of the people is the supreme factor,” Chairman Mikhail Burla says.

“The people’s will prevails over the principle of the integrity of borders, as was proclaimed in Helsinki in 1975. But I insist our goal should only be reached peacefully, by peaceful means. We don’t want any violence.”

A major question in the debate is to what extent is there a Transnistrian identity? To find out we dropped into a rehearsal of the Viorika ensemble. For years they have been collecting traditional folk songs and dances in villages across the region.

We asked the conductor, Alexandru Galatsan, about the roots of Transnistrian folk music.

“The main essence of the music, the essence of the melodies and also the harmonic structure of the songs are really very close to Moldovan sounds,” he said.

“No, there is no border,” adds Boris Rosneritsa, the group’s choreographer. “They constructed some artificial borders, but we are one people, really: one people. We share the same dances here, all around in Transnistria and all over Moldova, and also in Romania; the dances are the same.”

Big business also looks eastward.The Sheriff conglomerate, which is said to have links to Russian political and security interests, covers much of Transnistria’s private sector, from petrol stations to supermarkets and even a football club. It bought players from Brazil and elsewhere.","2014-05-30 11:54:24","1","38.0","2.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","1.0","27.0","28.0","0.0","50.0","2.0","4.0","0","593","94.87","77.60","21.95","40.98","16.47","24.11","77.23","46.21","7.42","4.05","1.18","1.85","0.00","0.17","0.84","3.37","9.78","15.51","5.56","3.54","5.56","0.84","12.48","2.70","1.85","1.01","2.36","3.88","3.04","1.85","1.01","0.00","0.34","0.51","10.46","0.51","0.00","0.34","0.17","10.46","2.19","1.52","1.52","2.53","0.84","2.53","2.70","0.34","2.02","0.34","0.67","0.17","0.17","0.00","0.34","7.76","4.55","0.84","2.19","0.67","0.34","4.05","7.93","0.84","12.14","1.85","9.11","1.35","3.88","2.02","0.67","1.18","0.00","0.34","0.17","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.89","5.90","7.42","0.67","0.34","0.34","0.00","0.34","3.04","0.84","0.00","0.00","2830","7.81","18.12121212121212","848","588","37","72.26","10.6","7.1","11.77","10.3","126","7.75","16.931428571428572","334","16.12","10","0.45","0","23","13","71","1","73","41","0","4","5","76","59","2","37","0","0","27","6","32","0","0","1","22","0","15","23","7","9","20","24","2","4","0","0"

The truce was due to begin at 1900 local time (1600 GMT.)

The deal is understood to include an immediate easing of the Israeli blockade of Gaza, and a gradual lifting of restrictions on fishing off the coast of the strip.

The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, hailed the agreement as a chance to “build a new nation and end the occupation”

Israeli air raids had continued on Tuesday, attacking two high-rise buildings in Gaza City, one which was home to 70 families and dozens of shops and offices. Six Palestinians were killed in other Israeli strikes.

Shortly after the announcement, rocket sirens could be heard in southern Israel. One Israeli was killed by a mortar attack in Eshkol and six others were wounded.","2014-08-26 18:44:46","0","90.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","337.0","264.0","0.0","510.0","13.0","25.0","3","142","98.79","50.00","55.50","15.81","20.29","23.94","74.65","42.25","2.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.11","10.56","16.90","7.04","0.70","6.34","0.00","10.56","3.52","2.11","0.70","6.34","0.00","4.93","2.11","2.82","0.00","2.82","0.00","1.41","0.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.23","0.70","0.00","0.70","0.70","0.70","1.41","2.11","1.41","0.70","0.00","0.70","0.00","0.70","0.00","0.00","4.23","0.70","0.00","2.82","0.00","0.70","5.63","3.52","0.00","20.42","0.70","12.68","7.75","2.11","2.11","1.41","0.70","0.00","1.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.20","4.93","4.93","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.11","2.82","0.00","1.41","0.00","668","8.94","23.666666666666668","199","139","7","68.2","10.9","8.7","11.95","12.2","38","12.5","20.89525179856115","100","21.67","1","0.4","0","7","6","15","0","19","11","0","0","1","22","19","1","10","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","4","0","5","8","2","7","1","1","1","0","0","0"

A second convoy of ready-to-eat supplies is expected over the next few days.

The Rafa crossing has been opened for aid for the first time in seven years as part of the ceasefire agreement to end the latest conflict with Israel.

The Egyptian-mediated plan took effect on Tuesday, with both sides agreeing to an indefinite halt in hostilities.

Rebuilding homes and livelihoods in Gaza will be a longer term issue after several weeks of Israeli attacks left homes and businesses reduced to rubble.

Many residents returned on Thursday to search by hand for any remaining belongings, only to find little left to pick from.

Two days into the ceasefire, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal warned that the seven week war was unlikely to be the last round of conflict.

“This is not the end. This is just a milestone to reaching our objective,” he told a news conference in Qatar.

But still, Israeli tanks were seen pulling back from the border with Gaza on Thursday (August 28).","2014-08-28 22:20:02","0","93.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","337.0","264.0","0.0","509.0","13.0","25.0","3","194","99.00","58.16","76.11","25.77","19.40","20.62","84.02","41.75","2.58","1.03","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.00","1.55","8.76","20.62","5.67","2.06","2.06","0.52","10.82","4.12","2.58","0.00","4.64","3.61","4.12","2.06","2.06","0.00","1.55","0.00","3.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.52","5.67","1.03","1.55","0.52","2.06","0.00","1.03","3.61","3.09","0.00","1.03","2.06","0.52","0.52","0.00","1.03","6.19","1.03","1.55","2.06","0.52","1.55","4.12","5.67","2.06","24.23","1.03","10.31","13.40","2.06","0.00","2.06","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.86","5.15","3.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.55","1.03","0.00","1.03","0.00","891","8.07","19.4","264","190","10","69.11","10.4","8.3","11.08","11.1","42","10.5","18.442105263157895","137","18.2","1","0.42","0","3","7","20","0","29","13","1","1","1","29","17","0","20","0","0","1","1","5","0","0","1","11","0","9","8","7","5","1","4","0","0","0","0"
"http://www.euronews.com/2014/08/27/mideast-ceasefire-gaza-residents-return-to-survey-destruction","Mideast ceasefire - Gaza residents return to survey destruction","After seven weeks of war, thousands of Gaza residents left their temporary shelters in United Nations-run schools on Wednesday as an open-ended ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect.

As they returned, many found their homes and businesses had been completely destroyed by Israeli attacks.

More than half a million Palestinians have been displaced by the latest violence; many say they’ve grown weary of the on-off conflicts between the two sides.

Gaza shop-keeper Ahmed Kharwat was among those calling for peace as he surveyed the damage to his property.

“Nobody likes war. They should find a real solution. We don’t want to go through war every one, two, or even four (years). They need to find a real solution so that we can live and work. As you see, after we rebuilt, war came. Two years later everything is destroyed again,” he said.

Israel has agreed to open its borders with Gaza to allow humanitarian aid and reconstruction materials to reach those who need them most.

A World Food Programme convoy, carrying enough aid for 150,000 people, passed through the Rafa crossing on Wednesday.

Israelis though, are more sceptical about prospects of lasting peace.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces deep criticism in some quarters for not taking stronger military action against Hamas.

Jerusalem resident Beth Hava doesn’t think the ceasefire will be respected for long.

“If the ceasefire works so that really there is quiet and Hamas is not able to re-arm themselves and something is put in place so that they are demilitarised, then I think it’s a good thing. I think everyone is tired and needs a rest and needs to get back to a normal life,” she said.

Despite facing nearly two months of persistent rocket fire, Israel said the war had dealt a strong blow to Hamas, killing several of its military leaders and destroying the group’s cross-border infiltration tunnels.","2014-08-27 18:24:01","0","96.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","511.0","13.0","25.0","3","321","79.36","70.19","29.43","4.10","17.83","21.81","85.05","43.93","10.28","5.92","0.62","0.93","0.31","1.25","2.80","4.36","5.61","14.02","6.85","3.74","6.23","1.56","16.20","5.92","4.05","0.31","4.05","2.80","7.17","2.49","4.67","0.00","3.74","0.00","9.03","0.00","0.00","0.31","0.93","11.53","3.12","1.25","2.18","2.80","1.25","2.80","3.12","1.25","1.56","0.31","2.18","0.62","1.25","0.00","0.31","10.59","1.25","2.18","5.30","1.25","0.93","4.98","10.90","0.93","14.64","2.49","6.23","6.23","2.18","0.31","0.93","0.62","0.31","1.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.89","5.61","4.67","0.00","0.31","0.00","0.00","1.87","1.25","1.56","0.62","0.00","1522","7.67","18.11111111111111","439","314","18","70.73","10.7","7.7","11.89","11.2","63","6.583333333333333","16.985477707006368","223","17.22","3","0.42","0","10","10","21","0","40","22","2","1","3","44","30","1","20","1","0","17","5","13","1","1","1","10","0","11","15","7","12","14","12","0","1","0","0"

The deal could strengthen their hand in talks with Israel next month.

The factions had agreed to the make up of a national unity government earlier this year but a dispute over public sector worker pay strained their relationship.

“Fatah and Hamas have agreed to support the political efforts of the Palestinian leadership, which will continue working because there is a full schedule to get through,” said Fatah negotiator, Azzam Ahmed.

“What we have achieved at this point is to facilitate a route for the conference and to make sure that the donors feel safe about their money. They can monitor the process with the United Nations from beginning to end,” explained Hamas´ Political Bureau Chairman, Moussa Abu Marzouk.

Weeks of conflict in Gaza between Hamas and Israel ended late last month.

More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed along with 67 Israeli soldiers and six civilians.

The Palestinian Authority has claimed that reconstruction work would cost over six billion euros.

Euronews’ correspondent in Cairo, Mohammed Shaikhibrahim, said that “despite the agreement, the question remains over its implementation and a timetable. Security, border controls and weapons in the Gaza Strip are the most important challenges ahead.”","2014-09-26 02:00:02","0","93.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","337.0","264.0","0.0","509.0","13.0","25.0","3","219","98.35","72.35","29.73","82.85","19.91","27.85","80.37","42.92","5.94","2.28","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.00","1.83","3.65","10.05","16.44","5.94","0.91","4.11","0.00","11.42","5.48","2.28","0.91","2.74","0.91","5.94","4.57","1.37","0.46","0.91","0.00","6.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.76","1.83","2.28","0.91","1.37","0.46","1.37","3.65","1.83","0.91","0.91","0.46","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.70","0.91","4.11","8.22","1.37","0.91","3.20","8.22","0.91","15.53","0.00","8.22","7.31","8.68","0.00","0.00","1.83","0.46","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.24","5.02","4.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.74","0.46","0.00","0.46","1120","8.75","19.90909090909091","323","218","11","59.84","11.6","9.8","13.69","13.6","57","9.0","20.378715596330277","149","19.0","1","0.42","0","8","6","24","0","30","13","1","0","4","33","33","2","12","0","0","2","4","2","1","1","1","7","0","10","6","2","5","4","5","1","1","0","0"

It was convened by Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah who travelled to the Hamas-dominated territory from the West Bank.

Hamas and the Fatah party agreed to form a joint cabinet in May for the first time since the rival factions fought a brief civil war in 2007.

Palestinian parties agreed last month that the unity government would assume authority over Gaza.

“I assure you that Gaza is the top priority for the president (Mahmoud Abbas) and the government. Gaza was and still is an important part of the Palestinian homeland. There will be no Palestinian national project without Gaza. The split has ended forever,” Rami Hamdallah told the crowd.

The prime minister visited a neighbourhood destroyed during this summer’s war with Israel. Many Gazans are now putting their faith in the unity government after years of internal Palestinian division.

Hamdallah said he hoped that enough money would be donated at the Cairo donor conference for the rebuilding of Gaza to restart.

He has estimated reconstruction costs at three billion euros over three years.

Potential donors were put off giving aid to Gaza while Hamas, blacklisted as a terrorist group, was in charge.","2014-10-09 22:30:02","0","93.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","509.0","13.0","25.0","3","225","98.40","70.32","46.30","59.44","17.31","24.44","78.22","41.78","4.89","2.22","0.44","0.00","0.44","0.89","0.44","2.67","11.11","15.11","7.11","1.33","2.22","0.89","12.00","1.78","1.33","0.44","3.56","1.78","7.11","4.44","2.67","0.44","2.22","0.00","7.11","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.89","5.78","0.89","0.44","1.33","1.78","1.33","0.89","4.00","3.56","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.56","1.33","3.11","8.00","0.44","0.00","5.33","4.44","1.78","20.44","2.22","9.78","8.89","4.89","0.89","0.44","2.22","1.33","0.89","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.78","5.78","1.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.89","0.44","0.89","0.00","1111","7.65","17.384615384615383","340","225","13","62.38","13.1","8.9","12.06","11.3","45","8.8","16.919999999999998","146","16.38","1","0.39","0","3","6","28","0","32","27","0","0","3","38","28","1","8","0","0","5","1","4","0","0","1","4","0","5","14","2","6","2","6","0","1","0","0"

The early election comes after six years in power and two consecutive mandates for Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and his Kosovo Democratic party.

A key feature will be the participation, or lack of it, of the country’s Serbian minority.

“I hope the new lawmakers will be more accountable, so there will not be cases of them missing parliamentary sessions. We are one nation and our wish is for them to fully pursue our interests, and obey our will,” said one elderly man.

“If there are changes for sure there will be improvements, but if we continue with the same people I don’t see any future,” was one female professor’s opinion.

Many claim that Thaci’s six years in office have only brought corruption, nepotism, and poverty to the country, which has a long way to go before it can even consider EU membership, and the opinion polls indicate that Thaci’s patchy record means this result is too close to call.","2014-06-08 12:51:02","0","90.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","335.0","262.0","0.0","511.0","13.0","25.0","3","188","65.57","73.84","31.36","66.07","26.86","19.15","83.51","47.34","9.57","5.32","1.06","2.66","0.00","0.53","1.06","4.26","6.38","10.64","10.11","4.26","6.91","1.06","17.02","6.38","3.19","0.53","3.19","1.60","4.26","3.19","1.06","0.00","0.53","0.53","8.51","0.00","0.00","0.53","1.06","9.04","1.06","1.60","2.66","3.72","0.53","2.66","1.06","0.53","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.04","3.72","0.53","4.26","0.00","0.53","2.13","11.70","4.79","16.49","2.66","7.45","6.38","3.19","0.53","0.00","1.06","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.36","3.72","5.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.13","2.66","0.00","0.00","857","8.58","27.571428571428573","261","188","7","61.09","12.0","11.4","10.62","14.4","43","10.6","21.908936170212765","137","25.0","4","0.48","0","9","6","13","0","19","20","0","0","6","32","12","0","13","0","0","9","5","7","1","0","0","5","0","11","5","2","1","9","5","1","0","0","0"

"http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/03/beaten-robinson-calls-for-madagascar-presidential-recount","Beaten Robinson calls for Madagascar presidential recount","The politically volatile Indian ocean island of Madagascar looks set for more uncertainty after the winner of the presidential election was challenged by the beaten candidate.

The result of the first presidential election since a 2009 coup gave victory to that coup leader’s chosen successor, former finance minister Hery Rajaonarimampianina. He has been given 53.5 percent of the December 20 vote.

Turnout was just over 50 percent, reflecting a general disillusionment with politicians on the island, but Jean Louis Robinson, who was given 46.5 percent of the vote, claims there has been massive electoral fraud.

Robinson has filed nearly 300 complaints, and is demanding a recount.

“This is a provisional result proclaimed by the electoral commission, so it doesn’t bother me. I’m now waiting to see what the special court decides,” said one man.

Since the 2009 coup Madagascar has suffered capital flight, and aid has been reduced, deepening poverty levels in one of Africa’s already-poorest states.

Robinson’s recount demand has gone unanswered for the moment, with the provisional winner only demanding that people peacefully wait for the final result.","2014-01-03 19:20:15","0","91.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","509.0","13.0","25.0","3","181","94.31","58.73","9.86","11.47","20.11","29.83","72.93","40.88","4.97","1.66","1.10","0.00","0.00","0.55","0.00","3.31","10.50","11.60","8.84","3.87","2.21","0.55","14.92","5.52","2.21","1.10","5.52","2.21","6.63","2.76","3.87","0.55","1.10","1.10","4.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.10","6.08","1.66","2.76","0.00","1.10","0.00","0.55","1.66","1.10","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.15","0.00","3.87","11.05","1.66","0.00","7.73","8.29","0.00","10.50","1.10","2.76","6.63","3.87","0.00","0.00","1.66","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.47","4.97","6.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.55","1.10","2.76","0.00","0.00","948","8.75","20.88888888888889","286","180","11","54.83","11.7","9.7","14.32","12.7","49","6.5","19.448888888888888","126","19.67","1","0.4","0","3","11","21","0","22","16","1","0","0","40","12","0","7","0","0","4","0","8","0","0","0","2","0","2","6","5","13","3","10","0","2","0","0"
"http://www.euronews.com/2014/02/17/ugandan-president-to-sign-tough-anti-gay-laws","Ugandan president to sign tough anti-gay laws","Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has announced he will sign a new law that makes homosexuality punishable by life in prison.

The U-turn comes as a shock as Museveni indicated last month that he was planning to block the bill after it drew harsh criticism from human rights groups and Western business donors.

According to Ofwono Opondo, a government spokesperson, Museveni announced his latest decision before members of the ruling NRM party on Friday February 14.

Just earlier this month entrepreneur Richard Branson told euronews in an exclusive interview that a group of prominent business people had worked together to help convince Museveni to overturn the law: “We got together a group of business people who could talk to the president and the president changed his mind and vetoed the law,” Branson revealed.

Opondo explained the president’s turnaround saying: “This law is very popular both in Parliament and in Ugandan society…The president is under pressure at home to sign the law”.

Opondo also posted to Twitter that the NRM welcomed the president’s decision.

The NRM caucus has welcomed the development as a measure to protect Ugandans from social deviants — Ofwono Opondo (@OfwonoOpondo) February 14, 2014

The law, which was supported by a large majority of the Ugandan government, criminalises “the promotion or recognition” of homosexual relations. An earlier form of the bill in 2009 initially proposed the death penalty but international outcry helped to overturn this version. As it stands, first-time offenders will face a 14-year prison sentence, while repeat offenders could be sentenced to life in prison.

Earlier in the year a spokesperson for the president said he opposed the law, not because he approved of homosexuality, but because he thought “these people have the right to exist”.

However last week Museveni said he had changed his mind after consulting a group of scientists that was established to “study homosexuality and genetics”.

This comes after 14 medical experts presented a report that homosexuality is not genetic but a social behaviour — Ofwono Opondo (@OfwonoOpondo) February 14, 2014

US President Barack Obama warned Museveni that enacting the law would complicate their relations, calling it a “step backward for all Ugandans”. Currently the US is one of the largest foreign aid donors to Uganda, giving more than 400 million dollars annually in recent years.","2014-02-17 10:23:20","0","100.0","36.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","340.0","265.0","0.0","515.0","13.0","27.0","3","385","96.08","84.45","21.98","21.77","29.62","31.17","80.26","40.52","8.05","3.64","0.00","0.78","0.26","2.34","0.26","4.42","10.65","12.47","4.68","1.04","4.68","0.52","9.87","4.94","4.16","0.52","3.12","2.08","3.90","1.82","2.08","0.26","1.04","0.00","11.95","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.34","7.53","2.60","1.56","0.78","0.26","0.26","2.34","1.82","0.26","1.30","0.26","2.34","0.26","0.78","1.30","0.00","15.06","4.94","1.04","8.57","0.52","0.52","5.45","3.64","0.78","14.55","2.08","5.19","7.53","7.79","0.52","0.26","1.56","0.00","0.26","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.51","3.64","3.38","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.78","3.12","0.52","1.04","0.52","1971","9.06","29.76923076923077","631","383","13","41.53","16.4","14.8","14.28","18.5","96","11.5","23.826109660574414","210","26.62","6","0.4","0","9","11","48","1","43","21","2","2","5","74","40","0","21","0","0","10","4","12","1","0","0","13","0","15","25","7","7","1","11","3","1","0","0"
"http://www.euronews.com/2014/02/18/one-dead-many-hurt-as-asylum-seekers-riot-at-png-detention-camp","One dead, many hurt as asylum seekers riot at PNG detention camp","An asylum seeker was killed and at least 77 injured in the second riot this week at a detention centre in Papua New Guinea used to process asylum seekers, Australia’s Immigration Minister said on Tuesday.

One person was in critical condition with a head injury and another sustained gunshot wounds during the clashes on a small island in impoverished Papua New Guinea.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison says the riot began when detainees forced their way out of the centre, but refugee advocates insist it was sparked when Manus Island residents and police stormed the facility, attacking the asylum seekers.

The facility is part of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s tough stance against asylum seekers but it has come under fire over human rights concerns.

“Our sympathies are extended to the transferees – that person’s family and friends who would have been in the facility as well,” Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said in reference to the dead asylum seeker.

“If people choose to remove themselves from that centre then they’re obviously putting themselves at much greater risk and in an environment where there is violent behaviour,” he told reporters in the northern Australian city of Darwin.

Canberra’s tough stance on asylum seekers, including offshore processing and a blanket ban on people arriving by boat ever settling in Australia, has been criticised by the United Nations and other groups as illegal and inhumane.

Australia uses detention centres at Manus Island and another on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru to process would-be refugees sent there after trying to get to Australia, often in unsafe boats after paying people smugglers in Indonesia. Refugee advocates say that long-term detention, combined with a lack of clarity on where and when the asylum seekers may be resettled, contribute to a host of mental health problems at the facilities.

Last month, detainees at a centre in the remote Australian territory of Christmas Island sewed their lips together as part of a hunger strike in protest over their treatment. The latest incident followed an attempted breakout from the Manus Island facility on Sunday night, when 35 asylum seekers briefly escaped. Nineteen were injured and eight arrested in that incident.

Refugee advocates said detainees and staff members had told them that the violence started again when Manus Island villagers armed with makeshift weapons and police stormed the facility after dark and began attacking detainees.

“Locals armed with machetes, pipes, sticks and stones – have bashed and cut asylum seekers. One asylum seeker has been thrown from the second floor of a building; others have suffered machete cuts,” the Refugee Action Committee said in a statement.

The Sydney Morning Herald said it had spoken with a man whose brother is in the facility. Ghulam Murtaza told the newspaper he had received a phone call from his brother late on Monday saying villagers had come inside the compound.

“He said, ‘they will kill us’. He was in the compound saying ‘I am going to run away to save my life’,” Murtaza said.

British outsourcing giant G4S, which is responsible for security at the facility, said villagers were not involved. “Claims that the transferees breached the fence following internal attacks on them by local residents are unfounded,” it said in a statement.

Morrison said security guards had regained control of the centre, which had not been damaged. He said it was possible some detainees were still missing.

The unrest in Papua New Guinea quickly drew calls from critics to shut the facility. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had already said in a November report it failed to provide “safe and humane conditions of treatment in detention”.

"http://www.euronews.com/2014/03/11/uganada-activists-petition-severe-anti-gay-bill-","Uganda: Anti-gay laws 'violate basic human rights'","A mixed group of Ugandans and NGOs have filed a petition against the country’s controversial anti-homosexuality law, saying it is unconstitutional and violates basic human rights.

The bill, which was passed by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on February 24, criminalises lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) activities.

The Ugandan penal code already criminalises ‘carnal knowledge against the order of nature’, but the Anti-Homosexuality Act goes much further. ‘Aggravated homosexuality’ can earn offenders a life sentence in jail while ‘aiding and abetting homosexuality’ is punishable by a seven-year prison sentence.

Activists say Museveni’s bill infringes on fundamental rights to non-discrimination and equality, as well as rights to privacy, freedom of expression, thought, civic participation, assembly and association. The petition states the law fosters homophobia and stigmatisation and defies the international human rights treaties that Uganda has ratified.","2014-03-11 15:13:42","0","99.0","35.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","346.0","265.0","0.0","514.0","13.0","26.0","3","140","94.69","63.97","13.15","8.64","23.33","37.14","67.14","33.57","2.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.14","8.57","10.00","4.29","1.43","8.57","0.00","7.14","5.71","2.86","0.71","1.43","2.14","4.29","1.43","2.86","0.00","2.86","0.00","6.43","0.00","0.00","0.71","0.00","5.71","1.43","0.71","0.00","0.71","0.71","2.86","1.43","0.00","1.43","0.00","5.71","0.00","0.71","4.29","0.71","7.86","1.43","0.71","5.71","0.71","0.00","2.14","5.00","0.00","10.00","1.43","5.00","2.86","4.29","0.71","0.00","1.43","0.00","0.00","0.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.71","0.00","22.14","4.29","7.86","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.86","2.14","3.57","1.43","0.00","814","10.68","23.666666666666668","269","136","6","14.59","16.5","16.9","19.32","19.4","51","11.8","26.080000000000002","106","21.83","2","0.34","0","9","2","12","0","12","16","0","0","1","33","13","1","10","0","0","1","0","4","1","0","0","2","0","2","2","3","4","3","9","2","0","0","0"

The directive, blocked by both countries since 2008, requires all EU member states to automatically share information on bank accounts held by their citizens abroad inside the bloc.

Luxembourg and Austria gave the green light after Brussels promised to push Switzerland and four other countries into signing a similar deal soon.

The measures, which will be adopted next Monday and become national law across the EU over the next two years, aim to make it harder for tax cheats to squirrel away funds.

EU Council chief Herman Van Rompuy described the deal as indispensable, claiming banking secrecy was about to die.

Under current rules, EU states do not share data on interest earned from financial products linked to investment funds, pensions or trusts.","2014-03-21 16:19:25","0","90.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","339.0","266.0","0.0","511.0","13.0","25.0","3","140","98.65","61.26","48.10","78.19","23.33","27.86","72.86","36.43","2.86","0.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.71","2.14","7.14","17.14","4.29","1.43","4.29","0.71","9.29","5.71","2.86","0.71","2.14","1.43","4.29","3.57","0.71","0.00","0.71","0.00","5.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.86","2.14","2.14","0.00","0.71","1.43","2.14","2.14","1.43","0.00","0.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.29","2.14","1.43","4.29","0.71","1.43","2.86","7.14","1.43","16.43","0.71","10.00","5.71","9.29","0.00","0.00","7.86","0.00","0.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.29","4.29","5.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","710","8.97","23.333333333333332","206","140","6","56.29","12.5","11.2","13.41","14.9","37","12.125","21.891428571428573","108","22.5","5","0.34","0","5","3","12","0","16","11","1","0","1","18","16","0","16","1","0","1","1","4","0","0","1","7","0","5","4","4","8","3","1","1","0","0","0"
"http://www.euronews.com/2014/03/21/rivals-for-european-commission-presidential-role-clash-over-ukraine","Rivals for European Commission presidential role clash over Ukraine","Greek opposition leader Alexis Tsipras has attacked one of his key rivals in the race to become the next president of the European Commission.

Left-leaning Tsipras hit out at German Martin Schulz over comments made about Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

Schulz, currently president of the European Parliament, said: “European borders recognised under international law have already been redrawn in response to outside pressure. For the first time in Europe since the end of the Cold War, a State has used force to annex part of another State. Russia has broken international law. That is unacceptable. We must treat the Crimea crisis as a wake-up call, one which prompts us to rethink our European Neighbourhood Policy and our relations with Russia.”

But Tsipras, leader of The Coalition of the Radical Left in Greece, pounced on Schulz’s comments that a state has been forced to annex part of another for the first time since the end of the Cold War.

Tsipras, in a statement to euronews, said: “I have read with a certain feeling of surprise and disbelief the statement made by Martin Schultz regarding developments in Crimea on “redrawn borders” in Europe.

I am wondering: Has Mr. Schultz lost his memory or is it the case that his alliance with Ms. Merkel is driving him to such inaccuracies?

Has he forgotten Yugoslavia? Or is he unaware of the fact that, for the first time after the Second World War, borders in Europe were violated with the invasion of Cyprus by the Attila troops?

What is actually happening for the first time today is that, centering on Ukraine, the European Union supports a government with far-right and neo-Nazi elements, which violates its own country’s constitution. In Ukraine, the European Union has denied its own precedent, when it imposed sanctions on Austria in 2000, because Jörg Haider’s far-right participated in the government. And it is walking a Cold-War tightrope with Russia.

Statements of this kind send us back to the darkness of the Cold War.

They are proof that Mr. Schultz has abandoned the postwar socialdemocratic tradition—in particular the inspired Ostpolitik. In this way, he stays closer to Ms. Merkel rather than to Willy Brandt.","2014-03-21 17:15:22","0","94.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","339.0","266.0","0.0","512.0","13.0","25.0","3","369","97.72","70.62","49.11","7.18","20.50","26.02","77.78","46.88","8.94","4.07","0.54","1.36","0.00","1.90","0.27","4.88","9.49","18.16","6.50","1.90","2.71","0.00","11.38","3.52","1.36","1.08","2.17","1.08","4.88","1.63","3.25","0.27","2.17","0.54","6.23","0.00","0.27","0.00","1.90","9.49","3.52","2.44","0.54","1.63","1.08","1.63","2.17","0.27","0.54","1.36","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.38","2.98","1.90","6.78","0.00","0.27","3.79","6.78","0.00","17.62","1.08","11.38","5.69","2.98","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","1.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.45","5.15","4.61","0.81","0.00","0.81","0.00","1.63","1.36","1.08","0.00","0.00","1761","8.12","21.941176470588236","537","362","22","63.19","11.7","8.5","11.95","10.8","84","6.214285714285714","17.881767955801106","200","19.76","2","0.44","0","6","3","39","0","59","29","1","0","1","49","69","0","12","0","0","13","7","7","0","0","2","10","0","8","10","7","14","4","18","3","1","0","1"

"http://www.euronews.com/2014/06/20/mauritania-election-threatened-by-boycott","Mauritania election threatened by boycott","Mauritania goes to the polls on Saturday in a presidential election expected to be easily won by the incumbent Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.

His biggest challenge will be to achieve a convincing turnout with all his main rivals calling for a boycott.

But Abdel Aziz believes the country’s fledging democracy is strong enough to handle the test.

Speaking at an election rally on Thursday he said:

“We have created an independent committee for these elections to increase democracy because we

believe in democracy.”

With no major rivals, Abdel Aziz has had ample electoral resources for his re-election bid and enjoys strong support.

“He’s achieved so many things and that’s why we’re behind him so we’re asking other everyone to vote for him,” enthused one woman at an election rally.

There have been seven coup d’etat since Mauritania gained independence from France in 1960 and Abdel Aziz’s critics say a boycott is the best way to protest against his continued rule.

Opposition protester Sheikh Ahmad Haidi told euronews: “This campaign against the regime is the only way to meet the ambitions of the people who want more democracy, justice and development.”

Our correspondent in the capital Nouakchott, Riad Muasses, says the scene is set for a story that has become all too familiar.

“These elections are strangely reminiscent of those in several Arab countries recently. The opposition calls for a boycott, a field full of weak candidates and a president who comes from the army and wants to remain in power.”","2014-06-20 18:27:15","1","96.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","511.0","13.0","25.0","3","252","93.93","87.51","2.05","82.57","22.91","27.38","73.81","45.63","9.52","5.16","0.00","1.98","0.00","3.17","0.00","4.37","9.52","14.68","6.75","2.38","3.97","0.40","13.89","3.57","1.59","1.19","1.19","1.98","4.76","3.97","0.79","0.00","0.40","0.00","11.51","0.00","0.00","0.40","3.17","7.94","1.59","2.38","1.19","0.00","1.19","1.59","1.59","0.00","1.59","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","11.51","2.38","3.17","6.35","2.38","0.00","2.38","10.32","1.19","9.92","1.19","6.75","1.98","3.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.89","4.37","2.38","0.79","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.40","3.17","2.78","0.00","0.00","1225","8.99","28.666666666666668","380","250","11","56.89","12.9","11.0","12.77","14.1","67","8.7","21.8","169","26.22","0","0.47","0","7","3","31","0","29","20","1","2","1","47","22","0","13","1","0","8","5","7","0","0","0","9","0","9","6","3","7","8","14","1","2","0","1"

President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz can be certain of being returned to office for another five years, after his main rivals boycotted a ballot they claim is biased in his favour.

But he has struggled to secure a turnout high enough to give him a convincing mandate, with reports of between 30 and 50 percent at several polling stations in the capital, Nouakchott.

Among the four candidates who did run against him was anti-slavery campaigner Biram Ould Abeid.

Mauritania abolished the practice in 1980, but human rights experts say it is one of the few countries in the world where it still exists.

Mariem Mint Moulaye Idriss, an administrator at Mauritania’s national press agency, was the only woman in the race.

President Abdel Aziz came to power in an army coup in 2008, won an election the next year and is a Western ally against al Qaeda in West Africa’s impoverished and unstable Sahel region.

Riad Muasses, our correspondent in Nouakchott, says that despite the relatively low turnout – given the opposition boycott – this election looks sure to give the president his second mandate.","2014-06-22 01:58:02","0","92.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","511.0","13.0","25.0","3","201","98.05","74.12","24.79","53.85","25.12","27.86","72.14","42.29","6.97","3.98","0.00","0.50","0.00","2.99","0.50","2.99","9.95","15.42","5.47","1.99","2.49","0.00","9.95","2.49","0.50","1.00","3.98","2.49","3.48","2.49","1.00","0.50","0.00","0.50","8.46","0.00","0.50","0.50","2.99","5.47","1.00","0.50","0.00","0.00","1.49","2.49","2.99","1.00","1.00","0.50","0.50","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.95","1.00","1.00","7.46","0.50","0.50","3.48","6.47","0.00","16.42","1.00","11.94","3.48","4.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.95","3.98","4.98","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.50","0.00","1.49","0.00","0.00","981","9.27","25.5","311","202","8","54.26","12.8","12.0","12.25","14.9","56","10.1","23.209108910891093","145","23.62","0","0.42","0","5","7","23","0","27","17","0","0","1","37","27","0","9","0","1","6","4","3","0","0","0","5","0","5","8","2","4","4","7","0","1","0","1"

Europe’s second highest court has ruled it was appropriate in view of the facts of the case.

Judges at the Luxembourg-based General Court rejected Intel’s argument that the penalty was disproportionate.

In 2009 the European Commission said Intel had tried to hit the sales of its rival Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to personal computer makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard, NEC and Lenovo if they bought most of their computer chips from Intel.

The European Commission welcomed the ruling, as did consumers’ lobbying group BEUC.

“When large companies abuse their dominance of the market, it causes direct harm to consumers. The court’s ruling issued a strong reminder that such behaviour is illegal and unacceptable,” said BEUC director-general Monique Goyens.

‘Better not to fight’

The court’s judgement suggests companies would be better off settling antitrust charges instead of fighting them, said Martina Maier, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery.

“Companies under investigation by the Commission should not count on winning in court with the argument that the Commission would not have properly assessed the economic effects of an abuse of dominance,” she said.

“This might well lead to a supplementary incentive for a company under investigation for an alleged abuse of dominance to settle with the Commission or to offer commitments in order to motivate the Commission to end its investigation.”

Intel, which can take its case further to the Court of Justice of the European Union but only on points of law, declined to say whether it would do so.

“We are very disappointed about the decision. It’s a complex case which is reflected in the decision. We will begin evaluating the decision,” Intel spokeswoman Sophie Jacobs said.","2014-06-12 15:57:21","0","96.0","35.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","339.0","266.0","0.0","512.0","13.0","25.0","3","308","95.70","74.20","6.72","7.20","22.00","27.27","77.60","44.81","7.14","2.60","0.00","0.97","0.00","0.32","1.30","4.55","9.74","15.26","7.79","2.60","2.92","0.97","12.34","4.55","1.95","1.30","1.62","0.65","7.79","2.92","4.55","0.00","3.25","0.65","9.09","0.00","0.32","0.32","0.00","9.74","2.92","2.27","1.62","1.30","0.65","2.60","2.60","0.32","2.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.34","2.27","3.90","7.79","1.62","0.00","4.87","4.55","1.30","8.44","0.97","5.52","1.62","6.82","0.00","0.00","3.90","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.00","14.61","4.55","3.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.97","2.92","2.27","0.00","0.32","1543","8.79","24.153846153846153","480","305","15","50.87","13.7","11.2","13.34","13.6","80","10.2","20.611803278688527","195","21.77","4","0.44","0","4","5","31","1","39","19","1","2","8","46","41","1","17","0","0","11","5","9","1","0","2","12","0","16","16","7","8","3","6","2","0","0","1"

"http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/226866-experienced-interrogator-torture-doesnt-work","Experienced interrogator: Torture doesn’t work","I’ve sat across the table from murderers, sex offenders, terrorists, and drug dealers. As a former professional interrogator, I know there’s a good chance that information obtained through coercion isn’t accurate. This is why the release of details about the CIA’s “enhanced interrogation” of terrorist suspects after 9/11 is so important.

In popular media, movies like Zero Dark Thirty and the television show 24 depict torture a tool to get a terrorist to reveal information that leads authorities to the resolve the threat, often seizing a ticking time bomb or capturing those plotting an attack. It makes for great entertainment, but in the real world, cruelty is counterproductive. Torture forces a victim to say anything just to try to end the painful experience.

I understand the anger we feel toward terrorists. I’ve heard the siren song of violence in my head many times. But torture violates everything we stand for as Americans, especially our respect for human dignity.

The just released 500-page executive summary of this report reveals that the CIA’s torture program was even more ruthless than we were led to believe. Waterboarding, beatings violent enough to break bones, assault, mock executions, electric shocks to sensitive areas: all of this was performed by our government on our behalf.

Learning about these practices brings back painful memories of my colleague in the Drug Enforcement Administration, Enrique “Kiki” Camarena. In 1985 Kiki was abducted by corrupt Mexican police officers working for drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo. They tortured him, broke his bones, and eventually killed him. They were thugs.

The report also shows that abuse was an epic failure as an intelligence-gathering technique. It didn’t prevent any attacks and or gain information that couldn’t have been gained legally through rapport-based interrogations. As for the claim that torture produced information that led the United States to Bin Laden: no, wrong, it didn’t. At the same time, abuse elicited bogus information that hindered counterterrorism efforts.

I care deeply about the honor and effectiveness of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement. It pains me to hear about what the CIA’s tactics because I know firsthand that there’s a better way. I look back with great satisfaction at the confessions and convictions my colleagues and I have won, all within the legal framework.

The United States is safest when it adheres to its laws and ideals. During World War II, our nation confronted the horrors of the prison camps of the Japanese and the knowledge of the Nazi’s Holocaust depredations. Yet the United States held to our values and consistently treated Japanese and German prisoners of war humanely in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. It was one of our finest moments.

When it comes to torture, the years after 9/11 were not, unfortunately, some of our finest moments. The intelligence committee report uncovers our trip to the “dark side,” which will always be a stain on our character and reputation.

But releasing this information is a step forward, an acknowledgement that we lost our way. I hope there will be a public reckoning and that we will take the necessary steps to emerge from this dark period of our history, never to return. Ideally, the president and Congressional leaders will use this opportunity to pursue new legislation that solidifies the legal ban on torture and all mistreatment of detainees.

The popular media does not always get it wrong. In the 1998 movie The Siege, Denzel Washington’s character confronts Bruce Willis’s, who is about to torture a detainee. Washington exhorts him, “You can’t do this! Because if we torture him – we do that – and everything we have fought, and bled, and died for is over. And they’ve won!” ​

"http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/226690-gop-wants-accountability-innovation-from-accreditation-at-least","GOP wants accountability, innovation from accreditation – at least right now","The recent midterm elections did not produce a change of party in the House of Representatives, but does this automatically mean that the politics of the House will not change? Will Republicans want the same things in the 114th Congress that they sought in the 113th? And, will there be a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and when?

These questions are particularly important when it comes to accreditation and the current Congressional sense of urgency about the quality of higher education. We know some things about how the House education committee is coming together and the issues, but there is a lot more we do not know.

ADVERTISEMENT

We know that Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) will continue to chair the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and that Rep.(R-N.C.) is likely to remain as chair of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training.(D-Va.) will be the new ranking member of the committee. The overall composition of the committee will change, too. Because of the increase in House seats for Republicans as a result of midterms, their numbers on the committee will increase. The committee has lost long-standing members George Miller (D-Calif.) and(D-N.Y.).

We know that, before the midterms, House Republicans were clear about some of what is important to them about accreditation and higher education. Their 2014 white paper, Strengthening America’s Higher Education System, spoke to the importance of keeping the federal role in accreditation and higher education limited.The 2014 discussion draft from the House budget committee included a call to “disrupt the accreditation status quo” by making it easier for new accrediting organizations to become federally recognized and encouraging competition and innovation such as course accreditation. Representative Foxx sponsored bills to enhance transparency in higher education and reduce regulatory over-reach. Rep. Matt Salmon Matthew (Matt) James SalmonQuiet jockeying for McCain seat angers Republicans McSally tells GOP colleagues she'll run for Arizona Senate GOP Senate hopeful Kelli Ward leads challengers in internal poll MORE (R-Ariz.) introduced legislation to establish a demonstration project for competency-based education that included access to federal aid.

The big message from Republicans in 2014 has been “Yes, we agree with you that accreditation is important. We agree with you about regulatory relief, but you’ve got to do more with accountability, innovation and, above all, student achievement.” Republicans want more accountability in the form of greater transparency and evidence of institutional performance and student learning. They want to see more innovation such as a larger role for accreditation in review of the quality of competency-based education. They want to see tools developed to efficiently extend quality review to new providers such as private companies offering training, courses and modules. And, if traditional accreditation does not do this, some Republicans are ready to establish new organizations for this purpose.

What do we need to know? We will be looking for signs about whether a House agenda for accreditation modeled on current messages carries into 2015 and whether this fits the newly Republican Senate’s interests and wishes. Senate Republicans have signaled some support for accreditation and are as interested as the House in accountability and innovation. And, the message of the incoming chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Lamar Alexander Andrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderGOP ponders how to fill rest of 2018 Nearly 1 million people out of workforce due to opioid addiction: study GOP chairman introduces draft bills to curb opioid use MORE (R-Tenn.) – more limited regulatory oversight but evidence of a more powerful commitment to change in accreditation – serves as a bridge to the House white paper and the discussion draft of the budget.

We need to know about the timing of reauthorization. A strong case can be made that there is just too much on Congress’ plate to get to higher education and that reauthorization will not occur in 2015. If we don’t get reauthorization in 2015, so the argument goes, it will not happen in 2016, an election year. And, even if there is a bill, whether the president would sign it is an unknown.

If the Republicans sustain their interest in less regulation and a more limited federal role into 2015, this is good news for accreditation. However, this can happen only if accreditation responds even more effectively to the challenges of renewed and intensified calls for accountability and even more demanding expectations about innovation.

"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/223011-democrats-sift-through-the-debris","Democrats sift through the debris","Democrats on Wednesday morning began sorting through the wreckage of disastrous midterm elections in which losses eclipsed even their worst fears.

The scale of the defeats, taken together, was breathtaking: a Senate majority lost, more than a dozen House seats swept away, and Democrats ousted from governors’ mansions across the country.

The drubbing is sure to spark a round of soul-searching, as Democrats ponder whether President Obama is to blame — or whether something deeper has gone wrong in the party that could threaten its chances of retaining the White House in 2016.

“This is where the administration has to take a real honest look at its decisionmaking and its management. Between the Veterans Administration, the health care website. … It was a lot of things for the last two years that kept feeding this concern that Democrats aren’t able to manage this government,” said one Democratic strategist who requested anonymity to speak freely.

Finger-pointing had begun between Senate Democrats and the White House even before every race has been decided. The blame game is sure to get worse in the coming days.

“The president’s approval rating is barely 40 percent,” David Krone, chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidDems to party: Go on offense with Trump’s alleged affairs Harry Reid tears into Trump, Senate GOP: They’re ‘acolytes for Trump’ GOP pushes to change Senate rules for Trump MORE (D-Nev.) told Washington Post reporters. “What else more is there to say? ... He wasn’t going to play well in North Carolina or Iowa or New Hampshire. I’m sorry. It doesn’t mean that the message was bad, but sometimes the messenger isn’t good.”

Democratic losses were staggering in the Senate. The hopes of party strategists that ominous final polls might have been overstating the Republican advantage proved hollow.

If anything, the reverse proved true: In Iowa, Republican Joni Ernst defeated Rep.

Losses in governors’ races — which the White House had touted last week as a better barometer of a successful evening — were even more shocking. Republicans prevailed in states that are normally considered solid blue, including Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois.

According to national exit poll data, most voters said they were frustrated with Washington gridlock and with the performance of both parties, but President Obama’s approval ratings were particularly dismal.

Fifty-five percent of voters said they disapproved of his job performance; 42 percent strongly disapproved. When asked to describe their feelings toward the Obama administration, 60 percent said they were “angry” or “dissatisfied” versus 40 percent who declared themselves “enthusiastic” or “satisfied.”

However, 78 percent also said they disapproved of the job Congress was doing, and 60 percent characterized themselves as “angry” or “dissatisfied” with GOP leadership.

“People point to the president's unpopularity in these states, and that was an issue, but in many cases the congressional Republican and Tea Party brand was equal or worse,” said Democratic strategist Doug Thornell.

“But, give them credit, Republicans were able to outperform their brand by running smart races, and they had an incredibly simple message.”

Much like in 2010, the midterm electorate tilted toward Republicans — 37 percent of voters self-identified as conservative, 40 percent said they were moderate, and 23 percent described themselves as liberal.

When all of those dynamics were fed into the mix, the results were grim for Democrats.

“I won’t sugarcoat it — we always knew tonight would be a challenging night, and it was for Democrats at every level,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.

Israel rationalized House losses, arguing that “an avalanche of outside spending” had moved seats the GOP’s way at the end of the campaign. But other Democrats suggested that the party’s message had missed the mark — and that the White House bore at least some responsibility for that failure.

Sen. Joe Manchin Joseph (Joe) ManchinDems face difficult choices on resources in battle for Senate House members demand Senate confirm Jim Bridenstine as NASA chief The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (D-W.Va.), a frequent critic of both the Obama administration and the Senate leadership of outgoing Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said the president’s policies, specifically on energy, had taken a toll.

“It doesn't make sense that we have to fight so hard against our own government and our own administration and our president to try to find a balance,” Manchin told MSNBC Tuesday night.

Ultimately, Democrats feel a number of races started to slip away from them in the final days. The pattern was apparent even in Virginia, where Sen. Mark Warner Mark Robert WarnerFacebook will 'fact-check' photos and videos The window for Facebook to make amends with the public is quickly closing Facebook controversy stokes digital privacy debate MORE (D) — considered safe by just about everyone — remained locked in a too-close-to-call race against Republican Ed Gillespie as dawn broke on Wednesday.

“You can't only count on a ground game,” said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, who is also a columnist for The Hill. Mellman described the political environment as “toxic” for his party and asserted that this was something for which Obama could not be held solely responsible.

Ultimately, Democrats feel they had just too much to overcome, including a rapidly shifting news cycle that veered away from their preferred topic of economic fairness, and unexpected crises ranging from the resurgence of Islamic militancy in the Middle East to the Ebola outbreak.

“Over the course of the last year, Democrats’ message on the economy, fighting for the middle class and Republican dysfunction either hasn’t broken through or [has] been drowned out by outside events,” said Thornell.

“Republicans have been effective in pushing out a pretty simple message that the president has been a failure. It doesn’t help party enthusiasm when you have a small but vocal group of congressional Democrats running away from him.”

Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson might have put it simplest when he touted the Democrats’ victory in New Hampshire.

“The fact that we got our butts kicked up and down the block only makes it *more* hilarious that Scott Brown lost,” he tweeted.","2014-11-05 05:17:39","1","46.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","14.0","0.0","285.0","213.0","0.0","192.0","0.0","45.0","22","1335","93.26","68.94","14.04","22.29","23.02","25.92","72.96","37.75","6.07","2.47","0.15","0.52","0.15","0.45","1.20","3.60","6.67","13.63","5.84","2.70","4.19","1.05","11.54","6.22","3.22","1.20","1.95","3.45","6.82","3.30","3.52","0.15","0.97","1.20","8.01","0.00","0.00","0.07","0.45","7.34","1.50","0.82","0.75","1.80","1.20","2.47","3.07","1.35","1.20","0.52","0.90","0.30","0.30","0.07","0.22","11.99","2.47","2.55","6.59","1.12","1.42","5.32","4.49","0.75","11.61","1.57","6.97","3.15","5.17","1.35","0.75","0.60","0.15","0.07","0.30","0.07","0.15","0.00","0.07","0.00","19.70","5.02","4.42","0.52","0.15","0.07","0.00","1.12","3.00","2.77","2.25","0.37","6758","8.6","32.42857142857143","2009","1324","58","56.79","12.6","11.0","14.05","15.2","321","12.75","20.817885196374625","679","28.9","44","0.38","0","37","24","102","1","150","106","4","3","11","208","255","19","67","0","0","32","13","51","3","2","5","30","0","39","80","26","29","19","27","9","4","0","6"
"http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/224728-the-anti-immigrant-freshmen-come-to-washington","The anti-immigrant freshmen come to Washington","Over the past two weeks, Congressional Republican leaders have been rattling their sabers about the prospect of President Obama using his authority to keep immigration families together. An important part of their argument is that administrative relief will undermine legislation.

The problem is: these candidates have it wrong. Administrative relief is a step toward fixing our outdated immigration laws and legislation is the necessary completion. And, the Republican Party has zero credibility on immigration. After seventeen months of failing to allow a vote on immigration reform in the Republican-led House -- after it overwhelmingly passed in the Senate -- there’s no evidence of the party’s appetite for a comprehensive solution. And, more worryingly, the GOP seems to have elevated a new class of “rising stars” who have used anti-immigrant rhetoric to ride a conservative wave into Washington.

Around the country, House and Senate candidates took a hard right turn to gin up enthusiasm among conservative voters, and the party’s leadership then opted to celebrate their victories.

A few examples may help. During this campaign season:

In North Carolina, successful House candidate Mark Walker (R) opened the door to invading Mexico to reduce current immigration flows, a proposal that is as offensive as it is impractical.

In Georgia, Rep.-elect Barry Loudermilk (R) ran on his record of promoting anti-immigrant legislation in the State Senate, an unfortunate demonstration that some Republicans are still hewing to a state-by-state restrictionist strategy of passing laws that courts have struck down time and again from Arizona to Alabama.

And this was not just a southern phenomenon. Even in our largely progressive home state of New York, Rep.-elect Lee Zeldin (R) harshly criticized incumbent Tim Bishop Timothy (Tim) Howard BishopDems separated by 29 votes in NY House primary Flint residents hire first K Street firm House moves to vote on .1T package; backup plan in place MORE (D) for supporting comprehensive immigration reform and, at one debate, flatly said, “I do support deportations.” This strategically, while electorally successful, mirrored the broader anti-immigrant campaign platform launched by the New York State Republican Committee, including mailers and ads that relied on racist imagery of immigrants jumping over fences and “No Trespassing” signs.

These are just a few of the many freshmen Republicans coming to Washington for the 2015-2016 session who give no reason for hope that the GOP will come to its senses on immigration reform.

Meanwhile, back in Washington this summer, the only immigration bill that House Republicans’ (already-elected) leadership pushed through was a vote to de-fund the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that protected hundreds of thousands of immigrant youth (DREAMers) from being separated from their families.

In the absence of a willing partner to his right, President Obama must take action to address a broken immigration system that has separated hundreds of thousands of families each year, stifled investment in our country, and kept apart families due to a massive visa processing backlog.

Nothing about presidential action precludes bipartisan legislation. In fact, it should be a prelude to a bigger compromise that fixes our nation’s broken immigration system once and for all and includes a path to citizenship for eleven million undocumented immigrants that American voters overwhelmingly support.

Obama should act swiftly and boldly to keep as many families as possible together. Now.

"http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/221286-sifma-releases-cybersecurity-principles","Banks offer cybersecurity advice to government","An influential advocate for banks and financial services on Monday released 10 principles it believes the government should follow when issuing new cybersecurity regulations.

While a partnership between the government and private industry is important, information sharing should be ""limited to cybersecurity purposes,"" according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).

“Cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication, and it is critical that the industry and government collaborate to mitigate these threats,"" the group's president and chief executive, Kenneth Bentsen, said in a statement. ""We appreciate that the public sector has embraced this partnership and we will continue to offer our insights to help them in their work.”

The last year has seen a series of high-profile cyberattacks hit U.S. businesses, including one targeting JPMorgan Chase earlier this year that affected 76 million individuals and 7 million small-business accounts. News of the hack first surfaced in August, but the full extent of the damage was not revealed until earlier this month. Hackers accessed the names and contact information of customers, but not account or Social Security numbers.

The principles were issued in a paper by SIFMA on Monday — one in a series of initiatives focused in cybersecurity.

The ten principles provided from the group are included below:

Principle 1: The U.S. Government Has a Significant Role and Responsibility in Protecting the Business Community

Principle 2: Recognize the Value of Public–Private Collaboration in the Development of Agency Guidance

Principle 3: Compliance with Cybersecurity Agency Guidance Must be Flexible, Scalable and Practical

Principle 4: Financial Services Cybersecurity Guidance Should be Harmonized Across Agencies

Principle 5: Agency Guidance Must Consider the Resources of the Firm

Principle 6: Effective Cybersecurity Guidance is Risk-Based and Threat-Informed

Principle 7: Financial Regulators Should Engage in Risk-Based, Value-Added Audits Instead of Checklist Reviews

Principle 8: Crisis Response is an Essential Component to an Effective Cybersecurity Program

"http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/222470-states-ditch-electronic-voting-machines","States ditch electronic voting machines","States have abandoned electronic voting machines in droves, ensuring that most voters will be casting their ballots by hand on Election Day.

With many electronic voting machines more than a decade old, and states lacking the funding to repair or replace them, officials have opted to return to the pencil-and-paper voting that the new technology was supposed to replace.

Nearly 70 percent of voters will be casting ballots by hand on Tuesday, according to Pamela Smith, president of election watchdog Verified Voting.

""Paper, even though it sounds kind of old school, it actually has properties that serve the elections really well,"" Smith said.

It’s an outcome few would have predicted after the 2000 election, when the battle over “hanging chads” in the Florida recount spurred a massive, $3 billion federal investment in electronic voting machines.

States at the time ditched punch cards and levers in favor of touch screens and ballot-scanners, with the perennial battleground state of Ohio spending $115 million alone on upgrades.

Smith said the mid-2000s might go down as the “heyday” of electronic voting.

Since then, states have failed to maintain the machines, partly due to budget shortfalls.

“There is simply no money to replace them,” said Michael Shamos, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University who has examined computerized voting systems in six states.

The lack of spending on the machines is a major problem because the electronic equipment wears out quickly. Smith recalled sitting in a meeting with Missouri election officials in 2012 where they complained 25 percent of their equipment had malfunctioned in preelection testing.

“You’re dealing with voting machines that are more than a decade old,” Smith said.

Roughly half of the states that significantly adopted electronic voting following the cash influx have started to move back toward paper.

The Presidential Commission on Election Administration in January warned that the deterioration of voting machines is an “impending crisis,” but House Republicans say the issue should be left to the states.

Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.), who chairs the house committee that oversees federal elections and is a former Michigan secretary of State, said the cash infusion to the states in the mid-2000s was ""unprecedented.""

""State and local election officials should not rely on the federal government to replace voting machines that may be nearing the end of its useful life. Therefore, state and local election officials should recognize that they are responsible for upgrading their voting equipment as needed, and hopefully they are budgeting accordingly,"" Miller said in a statement to The Hill.

Some voters might welcome the return to punch voting, given that researchers have repeatedly proved the fallibility of individual e-voting machines.

One group from Princeton needed only seven minutes and simple hacking tools to install a computer program on a voting machine that took votes for one candidate and gave them to another.

More whimsically, two researchers showed they could install Pac-Man onto a touch-screen voting machine, leaving no detectable traces of their presence.

But concerns of widespread tampering are overblown, Shamos said.

“It’s something you can demonstrate under lab conditions,” he said. To translate it to an election-altering hack, “you would have to commit the perfect crime.”

“There's never been a proven case of manipulation of an electronic voting machine,” he said.

Voting machines are not connected to any network and not connected to each other, making them difficult to tamper with.

“These machines are not hooked up or networked in any way that would make them vulnerable to external access,” said Matt McClellan, press secretary for the Ohio secretary of State. “We’re confident that process is secure and the integrity is being maintained.”

“There’s no mechanism whereby viruses can pass from one machine to another,” Shamos agreed. Best-case scenario, “maybe I could fool a few people” and get several hundred votes “for my guy.”

Bryan Whitener, director of communications for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, noted that all electronic voting machines are tested and certified.

Many states, like Colorado, keep their machines under video surveillance with detailed records of when software is being installed.

When Ohio made the $115 million statewide switch to e-voting, it passed a law that all voting methods, including touch screens, must also generate a paper trail.

“It’s not just solely an electronic vote,” McClellan said.

More than 60 percent of states passed similar laws with the electronic switch. Some states moved preemptively; others were reactionary.

An electronic machine in North Carolina lost roughly 4,500 votes in a 2004 statewide race after it simply stopped recording votes. The race was ultimately decided by fewer than 2,000 votes.

“Now what do you do?” Smith asked. “You can’t really do a recount. There’s nothing to count.”

Within a year, the state passed a law requiring a paper back-up.

Paper trails are simply “more resilient,” Smith said.

Shamos said he expects the move back to paper ballots to continue, unless there’s a high-profile crisis similar to the 2000 election.

Still, he predicted the drumbeat for Internet and mobile voting will grow.

“Eventually [a generation is] going to have the thought that it’s idiotic for me not to be able to vote using my cell phone,” Shamos said.

Then all bets are off.","2014-11-02 09:00:03","1","55.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","214.0","213.0","0.0","140.0","0.0","33.0","23","880","90.20","59.43","9.00","20.60","18.33","27.50","72.39","42.84","7.16","3.18","0.45","0.11","0.57","0.45","1.59","3.98","7.95","13.30","7.84","3.86","3.41","1.36","16.59","3.18","2.27","0.80","2.84","3.07","2.61","1.14","1.48","0.11","0.34","0.45","6.14","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.68","9.20","0.91","1.36","1.82","2.05","1.25","2.50","3.18","0.57","1.93","0.68","0.45","0.34","0.11","0.00","0.00","5.57","0.45","0.57","3.30","0.80","1.14","4.55","7.16","1.70","11.36","1.93","5.57","4.32","4.32","0.45","0.23","1.14","0.00","0.00","0.34","0.11","0.11","0.00","0.11","0.00","19.89","5.68","5.57","0.00","0.11","0.11","0.00","1.59","4.77","1.25","0.23","0.57","4446","8.38","21.261904761904763","1320","865","49","61.97","11.7","9.0","13.92","13.0","212","12.625","18.883468208092484","445","19.86","5","0.41","0","19","26","84","0","93","62","3","1","18","135","69","1","67","0","0","30","8","39","3","0","3","32","0","43","42","33","22","19","21","7","3","0","5"

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which is charged with regulating the commodities trading market, can’t actually test companies’ cyber defenses, agency Chairman Timothy Massad said.



“Keep in mind that some of our major financial institutions are spending more on cybersecurity each year than our agency’s entire budget,” he told an industry conference in Chicago.



Massad maintained that the CFTC hasn’t ignored cybersecurity. In recent years, the agency has added “more detailed standards addressing various aspects of cybersecurity,” he said.



Companies are required to have cyber risk analysis programs, adequately secure systems, cyber emergency response procedures and regular, independent auditing of the whole program.



But the CFTC can’t always be that auditor.



“Our current budget does not permit us to conduct as many examinations as we should,” he said.



And the examinations it does conduct are limited. Instead of testing the program’s effectiveness, “we look at whether there is evidence to support management’s assertions that they are in compliance with the requirements,” Massad said.



“The simple fact is that, without additional resources, our markets cannot be as well supervised; customers cannot be as well protected; market transparency and efficiency cannot be as fully achieved.”



The CFTC was burdened with implementing much of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Wall Street reform bill passed in the wake of the financial crisis to heighten transparency and oversight of financial markets.



It has struggled with budget shortfalls since. Last week, hundreds of CFTC employees voted to join the National Treasury Employees Union, reportedly complaining of stagnating salaries and burdensome work requirements.



A recent breach at JPMorgan, which exposed 76 million household’s information, has only increased the need for a more watchful government eye, Massad said.

"http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/224281-cyber-bills-fate-hinges-on-nsa-reform","Cyber bill’s fate hinges on NSA reform","The upcoming Senate vote on a bill to reform the National Security Agency (NSA) could make or break legislation on sharing cyber threat information in the lame duck.

Privacy groups are warning that they will oppose the cyber bill unless lawmakers first reform the NSA’s surveillance programs.

Senate Intelligence committee leaders have been pushing hard to pass the Cybersecurity Intelligence Sharing Act (CISA), which would enable critical infrastructure companies to exchange cyber threat information with the NSA.

Supporters say allowing companies and the government to share information about cyber threats is critical to protecting the country from hackers. But privacy advocates remain wary of the intelligence community.

The cyber bill’s biggest hurdle, though, could come as early as next week, when the Senate takes a procedural vote on an NSA reform bill, the USA Freedom Act, which would rein in surveillance programs and strengthen the secret intelligence court overseeing the agency.

If the NSA bill passes, it could pave the way for cyber information sharing, backers say.

“Oh yeah, it would,” said House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas). “I think that’s totally correct.”

But if the NSA bill dies, it could also deal a blow to the cyber sharing bill.

“The Senate absolutely must pass USA Freedom before it can even consider taking up cyber info sharing legislation,” said Robyn Greene, policy counsel for the Open Technology Institute.

Some critics of the cyber bill also say that CISA as currently written could weaken reforms enacted by the NSA bill.

“If CISA passes, it is quite literally an exemption to existing privacy protections,” added Gabe Rottman, legislative counsel and policy advisor with the American Civil Liberties Union.

“It would severely undercut everything that USA Freedom is trying to do.”

CISA’s co-author and main champion, Senate Intelligence Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein Dianne Emiel Feinstein Biden endorses Feinstein's reelection bid: 'She’s tenacious. She’s accomplished' Senate panel requests info on Trump aides for Russia probe Dems to top DOJ officials: Publicly promise not to interfere in Mueller's probe MORE (D-Calif.), says the White House is adamant about moving first on surveillance reform.

But Feinstein thinks her bill can move independently of NSA reform, and some wonder if she will offer it as an amendment to USA Freedom during the lame duck session.

“In a different age, I would have said that would be a savvy political move,” said James Barnett, who oversaw the Federal Communications Commission’s earliest cybersecurity division. “But in this atmosphere?”

“If she does that,” Rottman warned, people might “pull support from USA Freedom.”

Surveillance reform and cybersecurity, two contentious issues in their own right, have been tied together since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed classified government spying programs. That’s left some calling for cyber sharing legislation frustrated.

“We have to do things to secure the nation,” Barnett said. “By the same token, people need to have their privacy rights respected.

“No matter how you do it, those things are going to tug at each other,” he added.

An info sharing bill is also being held up on the House side.

McCaul has his own House-passed cyber information sharing bill, the National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act. That measure would facilitate cyber info sharing between the private sector and the Department of Homeland Security, instead of the NSA.

But McCaul said his bill is already hung up over a fight between the Homeland Security committees and Intelligence committees over which agency should oversee government websites.

Barnett, who supports CISA, is skeptical that even passage of NSA reform could put cyber sharing on the fast track.

“There are so many other things vying for the very few legislative days that I’m not positive CISA is going to find that sweet spot of support from both sides of the aisle to move it forward,” he said.","2014-11-16 09:00:03","1","42.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","227.0","213.0","0.0","146.0","0.0","33.0","23","639","85.59","69.17","6.14","89.02","20.61","27.23","73.40","38.97","7.82","2.66","0.47","0.16","0.16","1.41","0.47","5.16","7.51","10.64","7.82","2.66","5.01","0.47","16.12","3.60","1.88","1.10","0.47","1.72","8.29","5.95","2.19","0.47","1.25","0.31","8.61","0.00","0.00","0.78","0.63","10.95","2.50","1.10","3.29","2.19","1.10","2.97","2.19","0.16","1.72","0.16","0.31","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.16","11.27","2.66","1.25","5.48","0.78","2.03","2.66","8.76","0.94","10.49","2.66","5.48","2.66","4.85","0.00","0.63","2.03","0.00","0.16","0.63","0.00","0.16","0.31","0.16","0.00","18.62","4.85","5.48","0.31","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.63","3.91","2.03","1.25","0.00","3291","8.22","24.074074074074073","1028","635","32","51.38","13.6","11.0","14.33","14.2","145","13.25","19.05385826771654","333","22.56","30","0.37","0","15","1","58","0","59","42","0","2","20","108","110","2","30","0","0","21","5","24","0","0","4","17","1","36","17","23","9","17","19","5","2","0","2"

The Sony hackers have sent a new message to the production company, calling the studio's choice to cancel the release of “The Interview” “very wise” and threatening to release more information if the company doesn’t take down all other references to the controversial movie, according to CNN.

That message, obtained by CNN, came in an email to Sony executives Thursday night.

“Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy,” the email said. It also adds that it will keep stolen data safe unless Sony makes “additional trouble.”

In late November, anonymous hackers broke into Sony servers and stole a trove of employee personal information and copies of upcoming movies. But more than a week after the company discovered the initial hack, a group called the Guardians of Peace took responsibility for the hack and threatened a 9/11-style attack on theaters that decided to show “The Interview.” That’s the controversial movie where Seth Rogen and James Franco assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

The threat prompted cancellations in theaters across the country, which ultimately culminated in Sony Pictures pulling the film’s release entirely. News outlets have reported that the U.S. believes North Korea sanctioned the cyberattack, but the administration has yet to publicly point the finger at the country.

Sony has not yet responded to the hackers’ latest message.","2014-12-19 11:26:46","1","24.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","220.0","213.0","0.0","142.0","0.0","45.0","23","248","97.26","68.57","41.81","14.61","24.80","28.63","80.24","39.92","4.44","0.81","0.00","0.40","0.40","0.00","0.00","3.63","12.10","12.10","3.63","3.23","4.84","1.61","10.08","5.24","2.02","0.81","1.21","2.82","4.44","1.61","2.42","1.21","1.61","0.40","9.27","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","9.68","3.23","0.81","0.81","1.61","1.21","3.63","2.02","1.21","0.40","0.40","0.40","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.89","2.82","0.40","4.84","2.02","2.42","3.63","5.65","0.81","13.71","1.21","6.85","5.65","5.24","6.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.95","4.84","4.84","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.02","4.03","2.02","0.00","1.21","1264","9.02","31.5","390","243","11","49.04","14.0","11.9","14.33","15.3","66","17.333333333333332","21.7041975308642","172","27.75","7","0.4","0","9","3","33","0","23","13","2","1","1","43","36","1","14","0","0","4","0","11","0","0","1","9","0","7","13","4","8","6","6","3","0","0","1"
"http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/223084-privacy-advocates-call-for-dcs-help-to-restrain-fbi","Privacy advocates seek DC's help to restrain FBI","The FBI is seeking authority to file warrants that are vague, secretive, patently unconstitutional and potentially crippling to security.

At least that’s what civil liberties advocates and computer scientists told a little-known regulatory committee at a Wednesday meeting.

The FBI wants to get warrants to search mobile devices, even if law enforcement officials can’t physically locate the device. It’s also seeking the ability to file one warrant to search an entire network that might be located in multiple jurisdictions.

ADVERTISEMENT

Judges are restricted to issuing warrants for searches on devices only within their jurisdiction.

The request has pitted law enforcement against privacy advocates and technologists while raising serious questions about how criminal investigations and the Constitution coexist in the digital world.

The committee — known as the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules — indicated it is not the correct authority to weigh these complex issues. The panel just sets the rules on where law enforcement can seek a warrant, said member Reena Raggi, a federal appeals court judge in New York City.

“We are trying to tell people what courthouse they have to go to,” she said, not intrude on Congress or the court’s ability to determine what constitutional requirements are needed to obtain certain search warrants.

“To create that rule, you need to first assume that such a warrant would be constitutional,” countered Kevin Bankston, policy director of the New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute, which promotes Internet privacy.

The committee should let Congress rule first on the structural limits for remote digital investigations, argued the proposal's detractors.

In lieu of those restraints, the FBI's proposal could allow searches that target every single person visiting a website, or any computer whose Internet traffic is routed through a specific server.

That’s thousands, perhaps millions of people dragged into a search based on one warrant, said Amie Stepanovich, senior policy counsel at digital rights advocate Accessnow.org.

The proposal includes few requirements to notify search subjects, no need to disclose search methods to the courts and no prohibition of destructive search tactics — all major flaws, the advocates argued.

The FBI has been secretly hacking computers for well over a decade, explained Chris Soghoian, the principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

It recently surfaced that the FBI in 2007 wrote a fake news story and planted it on a bogus Seattle Times website in order to infiltrate a suspect’s computer and plant tracking software.

Soghoian read the warrant granting that search.

“I still struggle to figure out what the government is asking the courts to approve,” said Soghoian, whose PhD focused on law enforcement surveillance techniques.

Once the FBI publicly releases malware ""it's difficult to control where it ends up,"" said Nathan Freed Wessler, an ACLU staff attorney.

But committee members consistently pushed back.

Their role is not to dictate what searches are legal, or how the FBI should construct a warrant, simply to set the process for filing a warrant, they insisted. Without a rule change, what is the FBI to do? Simply shut down its remote digital searches?

“That’s a wonderful question to be debated in a policy arena,” Bankston said.","2014-11-05 14:44:23","1","38.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","215.0","213.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","33.0","23","523","94.21","64.90","10.81","32.33","21.79","33.27","74.00","40.34","6.88","1.53","0.19","0.19","0.19","0.19","0.76","5.35","9.75","12.24","5.93","3.06","3.25","1.34","11.47","4.02","0.57","2.49","1.72","1.53","3.06","1.72","1.34","0.19","0.57","0.00","7.07","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","9.56","2.29","1.34","1.72","2.49","1.15","2.10","3.44","2.29","1.15","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.19","10.71","0.76","2.29","7.27","0.76","0.38","2.49","7.65","0.57","10.90","0.76","7.46","2.68","7.84","0.00","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","15.11","4.40","5.74","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.19","1.91","2.10","0.38","0.00","2762","9.51","22.25","849","524","24","49.35","14.6","11.8","14.62","15.4","159","7.666666666666666","22.857404580152675","309","20.71","12","0.39","0","11","3","60","0","42","41","0","1","7","85","51","1","41","1","0","12","3","20","0","0","4","26","0","33","19","12","13","11","20","5","6","2","4"
"http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/227609-what-should-sony-do","What should Sony do?","Now that Sony Pictures has pulled its controversial comedy “The Interview,” it has a multimillion dollar decision to make: What next?

Sony has dumped considerable money into the film, which came under fire after cyberattackers — possibly backed by North Korea — threatened 9/11-style attacks on any theater screening the comedy, which depicts the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

Published reports suggest Sony sunk $40 million to $45 million toward producing the film, plus another $30 million to 40 million marketing it.

If the movie never sees the light of day, Sony eats those costs and loses any potential revenue.

And that’s to say nothing of the negative public relations hit for Sony over backlash from its decision to pull the movie. Everyone from the Hollywood elite to lawmakers in Washington have chastised the company for its capitulation.

So what do they do?

“I think that they are going to have to bite the bullet and let this one stay on the shelf frankly,” said Jonathan Handel, an entertainment law professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law.

Sony has said it has no immediate plans to release the film in any format.

The legal risks are too high to release the film in theaters, Handel said. If any violent activity occurred at a screening, even by copycat attackers, Sony would be doomed legally.

The company was warned, Handel explained, which creates a solid lawsuit foundation.

“You can imagine how that would look to a jury,” he said. “Really at the end of the day, they don’t have any option.”

Gene Del Vecchio, a marketing professor at University of Southern California Marshall School of Business, disagrees.

He argued that the sunk costs are too much to do nothing.

“I think in Hollywood that’s ultimately going to be unacceptable,” he said.

Many have floated the idea of releasing the movie via some streaming option — Netflix, for instance — or straight to DVD. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney urged the movie studio to put the movie up online for free and ask for voluntary donations to help fight the Ebola crisis.

“That can be worthwhile to help defray some of the costs,” Del Vecchio said.

He argues Sony should reverse course and release the film to capitalize on its publicity.

“It’s almost as though it’s the 1920s and the U.S. government has decided to have prohibition,” he said. “The allure of alcohol now that you can’t have it greatly increases.”

Doug Stone, president of film industry newsletter Box Office Analyst, predicted “The Interview” would have raked in $120 million at the box office before it was pulled.

A reversal “greatly increases the box office potential,” Del Vecchio said.

He believes Sony has a small window — perhaps only a week or two — to capitalize on the intense focus surrounding the film.

To go back on its decision, though, Sony would need at least one of the major theater chains on board. The top five chains in North America, with Sony’s permission, jointly decided to withdraw “The Interview” from their lineups.

If one theater chain reverses, there’s a “great probably the others will follow,” Del Vecchio said.

All parties would also need some conclusive statement from the government that there are no credible threats against moviegoers. The Department of Homeland Security has said it currently has no direct evidence, but that the agency is still investigating the matter.

Even if Sony chooses to stick by its decision, all is not lost, said Kathryn Arnold, a veteran film producer.

Sony can file an insurance claim for its sunk costs, she said. In fact, that claim gets easier if the film has no revenue.

“If they don’t put the film out at all, it’s a total loss and you can be very specific about the costs,” she said. This would allow Sony to maximize potential returns.

If the studio goes with a DVD or streaming release to recoup costs, “it muddies the waters,” Arnold said, on how much Sony could request on an insurance claim.

A decision to bury the movie and file an insurance claim could set up another, perhaps unprecedented, decision.

After the claim is settled, “Who owns that asset?” Arnold wondered.

If it’s the insurance company, it may have the option to release the movie itself to recoup its losses.

So while the storm may bury “The Interview,” even an unreleased film could eventually find its way into the light of day.","2014-12-18 15:54:10","1","50.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","217.0","213.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","32.0","21","745","88.77","61.63","9.95","11.77","17.74","22.95","82.82","46.71","8.72","2.42","0.27","0.00","0.40","1.07","0.67","6.31","10.07","12.89","8.19","3.89","4.03","1.61","14.36","2.28","1.07","1.07","2.28","2.42","3.76","1.34","2.42","0.40","1.07","0.67","6.98","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.81","12.48","3.09","0.94","2.68","4.43","1.48","2.55","2.95","0.81","2.01","0.13","0.27","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.27","6.71","0.67","1.61","4.03","0.40","1.34","3.49","8.99","1.48","11.14","2.42","6.17","2.82","5.77","6.04","0.40","2.68","0.13","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.79","5.50","6.04","0.13","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.27","4.30","1.48","0.00","0.67","3482","7.94","19.41025641025641","1090","748","43","62.27","11.9","8.9","11.02","10.5","163","12.75","17.67657754010695","364","18.1","9","0.44","0","13","18","96","0","85","36","1","1","18","125","78","0","30","0","0","30","10","31","0","0","3","28","0","49","30","10","12","15","28","4","2","0","2"

The attack is unprecedented, the FBI said in a release.

“The destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart.”

The hack has been referred to as the first successful, large-scale destructive cyberattack on a U.S. company (Sony Pictures Entertainment is an American subsidy of a Japanese multinational conglomerate, Sony). The hackers not only stole data, but permanently deleted files on Sony’s servers. They later threatened 9/11-style attacks on any theater that screened “The Interview,” which depicts a fictional assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

The FBI confirmed rampant speculation that the attack’s methods tied it back to the reclusive East Asian regime.

“Technical analysis of the data deletion malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed,” the bureau said in a release.

“The FBI also observed significant overlap between the infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea,” it said.

Specifically, the FBI linked the tools used in the Sony hit to a round of North Korean cyberattacks on South Korean bands and media companies in March 2013.

While the bureau stopped short of calling the action a terrorist attack or act of war — as many lawmakers have over the past few days — it did have strong words for Pyongyang.

“North Korea’s actions were intended to inflict significant harm on a U.S. business and suppress the right of American citizens to express themselves,” the FBI said. “Such acts of intimidation fall outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior.”","2014-12-19 12:07:33","1","28.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","221.0","213.0","0.0","142.0","0.0","45.0","23","309","98.55","60.23","37.53","1.00","23.77","29.77","72.49","39.16","6.47","0.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.65","5.83","12.62","12.62","3.24","1.62","3.24","0.32","7.12","3.56","0.97","0.32","1.62","0.97","7.44","1.94","5.50","0.65","4.21","0.32","4.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.12","2.59","1.62","0.00","0.65","0.65","1.94","2.91","1.62","1.29","0.32","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","7.12","0.00","0.97","5.83","0.65","0.97","5.18","2.59","0.00","14.56","1.29","10.36","2.91","4.53","3.56","0.00","0.97","0.00","0.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.45","6.15","4.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.97","4.53","1.29","0.65","0.32","1592","9.22","28.727272727272727","501","307","16","51.99","13.9","10.8","14.27","13.8","90","8.833333333333334","21.406384364820852","181","25.73","14","0.4","0","6","3","43","0","34","39","0","0","0","51","36","1","23","0","0","8","2","11","0","0","1","8","0","5","20","4","9","1","8","3","0","0","0"

Hours later, the former Massachusetts governor tweeted at Sony.

It’s the start of what’s sure to be a range of reactions from lawmakers and U.S. officials to what is a largely unprecedented event.

Rep. Steve Israel Steven (Steve) J. IsraelThe 'Teen Party' can change Congress like the Tea Party Choose your spin of the Pennsylvania election Our leaders must end the hate before they burn America down MORE (D-N.Y.) called for Sony to release the film straight to DVD.

He tweeted: “Dear @SonyPictures - please make #TheInterviewMovie available in DVD so I can decide whether to see it, not N. Korea.”

Newt Gingrich, former Speaker and GOP presidential candidate, tweeted that the decision doesn't bode well for America.

""No one should kid themselves. With the Sony collapse America has lost its first cyberwar. This is a very very dangerous precedent.""

President Obama simply advised Americans, “Go to the movies,” during a Wednesday interview with ABC News.

Sony decided to withdraw the film shortly after major theaters backed out of showing the film Wednesday afternoon.

Theater chains were spooked by a Tuesday message from the hackers threatening Sept. 11-style attacks on any theater screening “The Interview.”

U.S. officials are reportedly close to attributing the attack to North Korea. Pyongyang has denied involvement, but over the summer called the film “an act of war.”

"http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/208545-house-panel-to-vote-on-drug-rules-autism-research","House panel to vote on drug rules, autism research","The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to vote next week on legislation dealing with prescription drug abuse and federal funding for autism research.

One of the bills, H.R. 4299, would require the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to schedule prescription drugs with potential for abuse within 45 days of being approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and finalize the scheduling within 180 days.

ADVERTISEMENT

The DEA ranks drugs based on their potential for abuse into five categories from Schedule I to Schedule V. Moving hydrocodone from a Schedule III to Schedule II would further restrict who can prescribe the drug and how much of the drug patients would have access to at any given time.

Last year the FDA approved Zogenix’s controversial painkiller Zohydro ER, which is made of pure hydrocodone. At the time, the agency recommended all hydrocodone products be moved from Schedule III to Schedule II to further limit access to such drugs because of their high potential for abuse.

However, the DEA has still not finalized the rescheduling.

“The existing delays are the result of a flaw in the Controlled Substances Act, which requires new FDA-approved medicines with the potential for abuse to undergo a controlled substance ‘scheduling’ by the DEA before they can be marketed,” said Philip Gattone, CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation and a proponent of the House bill. “Access to new therapies is particularly important for the 20 to 30 percent of people living with epilepsy who experience intractable or uncontrolled seizures or have significant adverse effects to existing medicines.”

Another bill up for consideration, H.R. 4709, would require makers of abused drugs and their distributors to register with the DEA to ensure criminal background checks of their employees. It would also create a Combating Prescription Drug Abuse working group of public law enforcement and private stakeholders to find ways to reduce prescription drug abuse.

One provision in the bill would give pharmacies that have in some way violated the DEA’s rules the opportunity to try correct their mistakes before the agency suspends their license to practice.

Besides the prescription drug bills, the House committee will also take up H.R. 4631, which would continue federal funding for autism research.","2014-06-06 16:34:26","1","27.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","223.0","213.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","32.0","22","370","98.46","60.66","5.91","9.26","23.12","28.92","81.62","40.81","4.32","2.16","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.89","2.16","8.92","17.03","5.41","1.89","4.05","0.27","8.38","2.16","1.08","1.62","2.70","1.89","5.14","1.89","3.24","0.27","2.43","0.00","4.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.27","1.08","2.97","2.43","2.43","1.08","1.08","0.54","0.00","0.27","0.00","6.76","0.00","6.49","0.00","0.27","9.19","0.27","3.78","4.05","1.35","0.00","1.08","4.59","1.62","11.62","0.54","4.59","6.49","8.65","0.00","0.81","2.16","0.00","0.00","1.08","0.00","0.81","0.00","0.27","0.00","11.62","5.14","3.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.27","1.35","0.81","0.54","0.00","1889","8.83","26.571428571428573","557","366","16","56.69","13.4","11.0","13.93","15.1","94","8.7","21.43322404371585","204","23.36","23","0.38","0","10","10","37","0","45","23","0","0","10","60","53","0","27","0","0","3","6","7","0","0","2","18","0","21","6","8","7","5","7","4","2","0","1"
"http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/220823-ebola-patient-flew-from-cleveland-day-before-diagnosis","CDC: Second Ebola-infected nurse 'should not have' traveled","Federal officials acknowledged Wednesday that there had been holes in the nation’s response to Ebola after revealing that a Dallas healthcare worker had flown across the country after “extensive contact” with an infected patient.

Amber Vinson, a 29-year-old nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital, flew from Cleveland to Dallas just hours before she began displaying symptoms of Ebola, which potentially exposed 132 people to the virus.

The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the nurse “should not have been allowed to travel” and vowed to prevent other exposed healthcare workers from doing so.

“We will, from this moment forward, ensure that no other individual who’s being monitored for exposure undergoes travel in any way other than in 'controlled movement,’” Dr. Tom Frieden said during a press briefing. He added that the risk of transmission was “extremely low,” though Vinson had reported a slight fever at the time of the flight.

Separately, White House spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged “shortcomings” in the federal response to the Ebola outbreak as criticism of the CDC and the administration mounted.

Reps. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) and Rep. Tom Marino (Pa.) on Wednesday became the first members of Congress to call on Frieden to resign.

When asked why Vinson had been allowed to fly, federal officials said they did not yet have answers. Under current CDC protocols, individuals who have been exposed to Ebola are instructed not to travel on commercial airplanes, ships or trains.

Earnest said the CDC is reviewing all procedures at the Dallas hospital.

“It’s not clear exactly what protocols were in place and how those protocols were implemented,” Earnest said during a briefing Wednesday.

Vinson was one of about 50 healthcare workers who helped treat the country’s first Ebola patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died last week. Unlike the 48 people who have been actively monitored after potential contact with Duncan, the hospital staff were told to “self-monitor” for symptoms.

The first healthcare worker to become infected, Nina Pham, was diagnosed late Saturday after she took herself to the hospital for a fever. Both Vinson and Pham cared for Duncan on a daily basis when he had “extensive production of body fluids,” Frieden said Wednesday.

He said that contact took place before the CDC arrived on site. Duncan hadn’t tested positive until Sept. 30, five days after he reported symptoms.

The CDC has an amplified role in the Dallas hospital’s day-to-day care since Pham became infected this weekend. Frieden said Tuesday that if the CDC had been “more hands-on with the hospital,” it could have prevented the spread among the healthcare workers.

The Dallas hospital’s error-ridden response has drawn a firestorm of criticism, including accusations from a national nursing union claiming that workers were unprepared for Ebola.

In an interview with “The Today Show” on Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell skirted two questions about whether she had confidence in the hospital.

She added that the federal government could have provided “much better” oversight at the hospital, which has come under scathing criticism from a national union representing nurses.

To ensure that Ebola is not spread through Vinson’s flight, the CDC is reaching out to all 132 passengers.

That approach marks a departure from the administration's previous response to the potential spread of Ebola on airplanes. After reports showed that Duncan had taken three separate flights

“It is important for people to have access to that information so they can get the facts about what kind of risks they are facing,” Earnest said Wednesday.

Each passenger will be interviewed by a public health expert to determine whether they had potential contact with the infected woman, who has not yet been identified.

Federal health officials have previously said that individuals infected with Ebola cannot pass along the virus unless they are exhibiting symptoms. Crew members did not notice any “signs or symptoms of illness” while she was on the flight, the CDC said.

Airlines with routes through West Africa have already been on high alert for Ebola. The new travel warning is likely to complicate the ongoing debate over international Ebola-related travel restrictions.

Duncan, the first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola outside of Africa, had also flown into the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. It was not one of the five U.S. airports picked to have additional screening for Ebola, though several Texas lawmakers have requested extra oversight there.

"http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/201461-gop-governor-medicaid-expansion-is-conservative-ideal","GOP governor: Medicaid expansion is a conservative ideal","Ohio GOP Gov. John Kasich is defending his decision to expand Medicaid in the state, saying the move is a logical reflection of conservative values.

""I think it's entirely consistent with conservative and Republican philosophy, and I'm really pleased we're doing it,"" Kasich, who's often mentioned as a possible 2016 presidential contender, said in an interview on the ""Fox News Sunday"" program.

ADVERTISEMENT

Kasich's assessment runs starkly counter to that coming from many conservatives – including many members of Ohio's Republican legislature – who characterize ObamaCare's broad Medicaid expansion as a case of big-government overreach that will add to deficits and discourage work on the part of beneficiaries. Many Republican governors have simply declined to adopt the expansion.

Kasich rejected their arguments this weekend. Adopting a Democratic line, he emphasized that the expansion of the low-income health insurance program will bring billions of dollars to Ohio while benefiting some of the state's most vulnerable people.

""I have a chance to bring back $14 billion … back to Ohio to do what? To strengthen our local communities as they treat the most significant problem of drug addiction and the problem of mental illness,"" he said. ""We must help people who live in the shadows. The people who have drug addictions, we have to get them rehabbed. The people who have mental illness. Those two groups of people should not be sitting in our jails and our prisons. That's unconscionable in our state.""

Kasich also pushed back against the notion that his adoption of the Medicaid expansion defied the wishes of Ohio's Republican legislature.

""Had there been a vote, I think it would have passed,"" he said.

Kasich had rejected another central provision of ObamaCare's coverage expansion, refusing to create a state-based insurance exchange. But the Medicaid expansion was a different animal, he suggested, because it will help those most in need.

""It's a two-prong strategy: Continue to grow the state, … and help to lift people out of the ditch where they are, bring them into the mainstream and give them an opportunity to realize their God-given purpose,"" he said. ""Because there are many people in Ohio now whose lives, frankly, will be in a position of being able to move forward.""","2014-03-23 11:11:43","1","27.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","217.0","213.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","32.0","22","372","85.13","90.14","5.79","17.90","18.60","26.88","80.65","47.31","12.37","6.72","1.08","1.88","0.00","1.88","1.88","5.65","8.60","13.17","8.06","2.96","4.03","0.27","16.40","2.96","1.88","2.15","1.61","3.49","4.30","1.88","2.42","0.27","0.27","1.08","13.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.88","8.60","1.61","1.34","1.88","1.88","0.81","1.34","1.34","0.00","1.34","0.00","3.76","0.00","3.76","0.00","0.00","9.68","3.49","1.61","4.03","0.81","0.81","2.69","10.22","1.61","11.29","2.96","6.99","2.69","2.42","0.27","0.00","1.34","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.62","5.65","4.84","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.00","1.34","3.76","3.23","0.00","0.27","1853","8.6","19.2","581","371","20","52.6","13.5","10.5","13.17","12.6","95","13.625","19.68258760107817","209","17.45","6","0.47","0","8","5","38","0","39","31","0","0","7","56","30","0","25","0","0","22","8","11","0","3","1","15","0","20","14","11","7","18","4","1","6","1","1"
"http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/other/214193-secret-drug-might-have-saved-ebola-patients-lives","Secret drug might have saved Ebola patients","A top-secret experimental drug was flown to Liberia last week and likely saved the lives of U.S. missionary workers who have contracted Ebola, CNN reported Monday.

The drug, called ZMapp, was sent by a representative from the National Institutes of Health to Samaritan’s Purse, the aid organization Dr. Kent Brantly works for in Liberia. Nancy Writebol works for SIM USA, which partners with Samaritan’s Purse.

Mapp Biopharmaceutical, a biotechnology firm, manufactured the drug and had only tested it in monkeys, with promising results, CNN said.

CNN said the company’s documents indicate the drug was given to four monkeys infected with Ebola within 24 hours. Two of the four monkeys that took the drug within 48 hours of contracting the disease survived and one untreated monkey died within five days of being infected with Ebola.

Brantly was flown to the U.S. and taken to Emory University Hospital on Saturday, where he will continue receiving treatment. Writebol is expected to be flown to the U.S. for treatment on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press.

They both served on the same mission team in Liberia tasked with treating Ebola victims.

No cure exists for Ebola, which causes hemorrhagic fever and kills at least 60 percent of the people who contract it in Africa, the AP noted.

Last week, the Centers for Disease Control issued the agency’s most serious travel alert, a Level 3 Warning, and advised people in the U.S. not to travel to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia amid an outbreak of the deadly disease.

A U.S.-Africa summit in Washington this week, which will bring more than 50 heads of state has also sparked new worries about the virus spreading.

President Obama said last week that the U.S. was taking precautions and summit attendees would get screenings both in their home countries and here.","2014-08-04 09:45:40","1","28.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","223.0","213.0","0.0","137.0","0.0","31.0","20","304","98.51","66.56","15.07","9.56","23.38","23.68","72.04","38.49","4.28","0.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.66","3.29","9.21","15.46","4.61","1.64","3.29","0.66","11.51","3.29","1.97","1.97","3.29","1.97","1.97","0.33","1.64","0.33","0.33","0.00","5.59","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.33","3.29","0.33","0.99","0.66","0.66","0.00","0.66","1.32","0.00","0.99","0.33","5.26","0.33","4.93","0.00","0.00","4.93","0.66","1.97","1.64","1.32","0.33","6.25","4.28","1.32","14.80","2.63","7.24","5.26","4.28","0.99","0.33","0.00","1.64","0.66","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.45","8.55","5.92","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.66","0.00","1.32","0.00","0.00","1471","8.66","24.153846153846153","446","302","19","63.8","10.8","8.3","12.0","10.5","81","6.357142857142857","19.088476821192053","188","22.77","20","0.4","0","9","10","30","0","38","14","1","1","3","38","65","2","20","0","0","4","1","5","0","1","0","10","0","5","21","7","12","3","7","4","2","0","1"
"http://thehill.com/policy/international/194597-royce-slams-rodman-for-north-korea-propaganda-win","Royce slams Rodman for North Korea 'propaganda win'","The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs panel slammed former basketball star Dennis Rodman's latest trip to North Korea as an ill-timed “propaganda win” for Kim Jong Un's repressive regime.

“The trip comes at the worst possible time — after Kim Jong-un brutally solidified his grip on power — and with no progress towards denuclearization,” Rep. Ed Royce Edward (Ed) Randall RoyceFacebook is complicit, not a victim, in the abuse and misuse of personal data Trump rolls the dice on North Korea Tom Steyer announces M effort to bring out young voters in Florida, California MORE (R-Calif.) told Breitbart News. “This basketball game will do nothing to improve the abysmal human rights conditions in North Korea. It's a propaganda win for the regime.”

Rodman's trip follows reports that Kim recently had his own uncle, a former mentor, executed. Rodman is accompanied by several former NBA players — including Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson, Vin Baker, Craig Hodges, Doug Christie and Charles D. Smith — on his fourth visit to the reclusive communist country. The group is scheduled to play in an exhibition game on Wednesday to mark Kim's 31st birthday.

The State Department has declined to directly criticize Rodman's latest trip.

“We haven’t been contacted by Mr. Rodman about his trip. We obviously recommend against all travel to North Korea by U.S. citizens,” spokeswoman Marie Harf said Monday.

“Dennis Rodman is technically right. He’s not there as a representative of the U.S. Government trying to affect anything. We weren’t contacted by him, and he’s not there representing us.”

Rodman told reporters on Monday that the proceeds from the trip would go to a North Korean charity for the deaf, but Think Progress was unable to find any evidence of its existence.

“I think what’s most reprehensible is his implication that Kenneth Bae, an American detainee on very spurious charges, who deserves to come home, might be guilty,” Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico, said on CNN’s “New Day.”

“Basketball diplomacy, out-of-the-box diplomacy, special envoys, nontraditional diplomats can do a lot of good,” Richardson said. “But now because of Rodman’s comments, even some NBA players who were probably just there seriously for basketball diplomacy have been compromised.”

Rodman has made headlines by visiting North Korea, where he has been seen with that country's leader, Kim Jong Un.

During a Tuesday interview on CNN, he suggested Bae deserved imprisonment when he was questioned about whether he would seek Bae's release.

The outburst has drawn criticism across the political spectrum. Richardson tried to rescue Bae last year during a trip to North Korea with Google Chairman Eric Schmidt.

"http://thehill.com/policy/international/203816-obama-ukraine-deal-promising-but-russia-must-follow-through","Obama: Ukraine deal 'promising,' but Russia must follow through","President Obama offered cautious optimism Thursday about a framework agreement designed to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine, but warned the U.S. is ready to move forward with additional penalties if the situation on the ground does not improve.



""There was a promising public statement that indicated the need to disarm all irregular forces and militias and groups,"" Obama said of the deal announced earlier in the day by Secretary of State John Kerry John Forbes KerryHillary Clinton fires back at critics: No one told a man who lost an election to shut up Budowsky: Students march on the midterms Former Georgia senator and governor Zell Miller dies MORE.



But Obama cautioned that ""we're not going to know whether in fact they'll follow through on these statements for several days.""



""We have put in place additional consequences we can impose on the Russians if we do not see actual improvement on the ground,"" Obama said.



“My hope is that we actually do see follow-through over the next several days, but I don't think, given past performance, that we can count on that, and we have to be prepared to potentially respond to what continue to be ... efforts of interference by the Russians in Eastern and Southern Ukraine.”



A joint statement issued by the foreign ministers of the U.S., Russia, Ukraine, and the European Union called on pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine to vacate the government buildings, streets and squares they have occupied.



In return, the Ukrainian government has offered amnesty to pro-Russian militants, with the exception of those who committed capital crimes. Ukraine has also pledged to open up a review of its constitution, which will include consideration of amendments that could give Ukraine's eastern regions greater autonomy.



The U.S. and Europeans have also agreed to hold off on additional sanctions as the pro-Russian forces withdraw.



Obama said he hoped that domestic pressure on Russian president Vladimir Putin would help push Russia to comply with the agreement.



""This whole exercise by the Russians is not good for Russia either … an economy that was already stuck in the mud is further deteriorating because of these actions,"" Obama said.","2014-04-17 16:11:51","1","38.0","0.0","13.0","1.0","5.0","0.0","222.0","213.0","0.0","143.0","0.0","32.0","21","361","93.60","61.99","41.23","72.45","30.08","30.19","77.01","45.71","8.03","3.32","0.55","1.94","0.00","0.28","0.55","4.71","8.31","15.79","6.65","1.94","4.99","1.66","13.85","3.32","1.94","1.39","0.28","1.94","4.16","3.32","0.83","0.28","0.00","0.28","7.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.55","9.42","1.66","1.39","1.94","1.39","0.83","3.88","1.66","0.55","1.11","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","9.97","2.77","1.39","4.16","0.55","1.39","4.43","9.14","1.94","15.79","2.22","10.53","3.60","3.32","0.28","0.28","0.28","0.28","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.79","5.82","4.16","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.39","2.77","1.11","0.00","0.00","1778","8.75","36.8","529","357","14","54.05","13.0","12.1","13.41","16.0","87","17.333333333333332","21.947899159663866","222","32.2","9","0.45","0","12","0","36","0","48","30","1","0","5","38","46","4","24","0","0","11","2","11","1","0","3","14","0","26","17","2","10","10","9","4","3","0","0"

""It's hard for me, given the Russian secret service presence there, given how many of the people are carrying Russian arms, operating according to a Russian playbook, that Russia doesn't have a greater say in telling them to stand down,"" he said.The agreement reached last week called for the U.S., European Union, Ukraine and Russia to refrain from any violence, intimidation or provocative actions, and for ""illegal armed groups"" to be disarmed. It also called for illegally seized buildings and occupied public spaces to be returned to their owners.However, there were more clashes between Ukraine forces and the armed protestors over the weekend, breaking an Easter holiday truce

Schiff, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, called last week's agreement ""a pause to take a breath"" and ""a positive, but probably a small positive.""



""I think we still need to prepare for the worst, which means that we need to try to line up our European allies for very strong sector-wide sanctions if Russia moves,"" he said.



Schiff also called for the U.S. to base more U.S. assets in the reion, in addition to holding military exercises, to reassure NATO allies.



""The military exercises are a very good idea,"" he said. ""They're not so large that they're going to cause the Russians to escalate, but I think we will need to do more along those lines.""

"http://thehill.com/policy/international/204020-biden-in-ukraine-we-want-to-stand-with-you","Biden in Ukraine: 'We want to stand with you'","Vice President Biden said Tuesday in Ukraine the United States wants to help as the nation prepares for one of the most important elections in its history.

Meeting with nine members of the Ukrainian parliament on the trip, Biden said Kiev must fight the ""cancer of corruption"" that is endemic in its system, mentioning the courts as an example.

“You never tell another man or woman what their interests is … So I want to make clear we don’t pretend to have the answers for you,"" Biden said. ""But we want to stand with you.”

In separate remarks, Biden said, “It’s time for Russia to stop talking and start acting"" on its agreement to deescalate tension in the country.

Biden met with the members of parliament, which included three presidential candidates, after privately sitting down with Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov. He gave separate remarks later after his meeting with Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk.

Biden said the U.S. is prepared to help with the country's economy and, to the extent it can, assist with what ""may be the most important election in Ukraine history"" on May 25.

He noted many of the constitutional reforms being considered, including the decentralization of power in Kiev, have been opposed by some members in the past.

“You face very daunting problems and, some might say, humiliating threats … But the opportunity to generate a united Ukraine, getting it right, is within your grasp,"" Biden said. ""And we want to be your partner and friend in the project. We want to assist.”

Biden on Monday met with a congressional delegation, which is also in the country to evaluate the situation there.

The vice president unveiled an energy and economic package aimed at helping Ukraine's economy, totaling $50 million. The U.S. will help secure a short-term supply of natural gas for Ukraine from European neighbors so it is not vulnerable to manipulation from Russia. Teams will also help administer financial aid approved by the International Monetary Fund.

The U.S. is giving $11.4 to help ensure the integrity and monitor Ukraine's elections next month. The administration also detailed an $8 million package of non-lethal military assistance.

The U.S. has already offered a $1 billion loan guarantee and has worked to secure the IMF loan.

Biden said the U.S. and Ukraine are similar in terms of the ethnic diversity in the two countries, however, ""We're not sitting against the border of another powerful nation,"" referring to Russia.

The U.S., Russia, Ukraine and the European Union came to an interim agreement last week to halt the violence there and remove pro-Russian protesters from government buildings and public spaces, in exchange for amnesty. However, the agreement seemed in doubt after a shooting that killed three people over the weekend at a Russian separatist checkpoint, which both sides have blamed on one another.

The vice president called on Russia to ""stop supporting men in masks in unmarked uniforms"" who have seized government buildings in Ukraine. He also called for Russia to pull its troops back from the eastern border.

“No nation has the right to simply grab land from another nation -- no nation has that right … And we will never recognize Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea and neither will the world,” Biden said in remarks after meeting with the prime minister.

The State Department has urged Russia to hold up its end of the bargain partly by assigning Russians officials to team with staff from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on the ground in Ukraine to make clear to pro-Russian protesters occupying government buildings that they do not have the backing of Moscow.

The U.S. has said it is prepared to offer further sanctions if Russia does not follow through with the interim deal. The U.S ambassador to Ukraine, Gregory Pyatt, said the U.S. would be making its determination in days.

A new round of violent clashes in eastern Ukraine left as many as five pro-Russian separatists dead on Thursday as President Obama threatened to impose a new round of sanctions on Moscow.

According to multiple media reports, Ukrainian soldiers moved to dismantle checkpoints established by pro-Russian militants in the city of Slovyansk. Kiev said one Ukrainian soldier was also wounded in fighting, which spread to an arms depot and government building in the area.

The violence came a day after interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov announced that Kiev would resume ""counter-terrorism"" efforts in the eastern region of the country. Those efforts have been backed by the United States.

The Ukrainian military suspended its crackdown against the pro-Russian separatists last week, after it signed an agreement with Russia, the United States and the European Union offering amnesty to any militants who laid down their arms.

But militants have not disassembled checkpoints or left occupied buildings, prompting the U.S. and Ukraine to complain that Moscow had reneged on the agreement.

At a press conference earlier Thursday in Japan, President Obama said Russia had failed to ""abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva.""

""Instead, we continue to see militias and armed men taking over buildings, harassing folks who are disagreeing with them, and destabilizing the region, and we haven’t seen Russia step up and discourage that,"" Obama said.

The president warned that the U.S. had “teed up” additional sanctions against Russia, and said Moscow had “days, not weeks” to publicly renounce the actions of “malicious and armed” pro-Russian separatists who continue to hold government buildings in eastern Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, in turn, denounced the military action undertaken by Kiev.

“If the Kiev regime has started to use the army against the population inside the country, it, beyond any doubt, is a very serious crime,” Putin said at a media forum in St. Petersburg, according to The Washington Post.

Putin also warned the Ukrainian action would have ""consequences"" and said that the effort was ""proof that we have acted correctly and on time"" in taking over Crimea. Moscow's annexation of the ethnically Russian peninsula has been widely denounced as a violation of international law by international powers, including the United States.

Russia's defense minister also announced a new set of military exercises along the Ukrainian border following the clashes in Slovyansk.

""We have to react to these developments somehow,"" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said according to The Associated Press.","2014-04-24 11:11:33","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","150.0","149.0","0.0","70.0","0.0","16.0","2","454","97.68","62.12","33.85","2.48","21.62","31.28","72.03","41.41","5.29","1.32","0.00","0.88","0.00","0.00","0.44","3.96","10.13","15.42","5.29","1.76","5.07","0.66","10.35","3.52","1.54","1.10","0.44","0.88","4.85","1.10","3.74","0.66","1.10","0.44","5.95","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.22","5.95","0.00","0.88","0.66","1.76","0.44","3.08","3.52","1.54","1.54","0.88","0.88","0.44","0.44","0.00","0.00","9.91","1.54","1.32","5.51","0.44","1.76","5.29","4.19","0.22","16.08","1.98","9.69","4.19","3.74","0.88","0.00","0.00","0.66","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.40","5.51","5.51","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.10","4.41","0.66","0.00","0.00","2340","8.62","22.95","696","449","22","50.77","12.9","11.2","14.33","14.4","113","6.833333333333333","20.22681514476615","244","21.0","6","0.4","0","14","2","52","0","52","44","0","0","3","55","60","3","34","0","0","9","2","13","1","0","4","17","0","15","26","14","17","11","6","1","3","0","1"
"http://thehill.com/policy/international/212586-obama-pledges-any-assitance-we-can","Obama pledges 'any assistance we can'","At the top of an infrastructure speech in Delaware Thursday, President Obama offered ""any assistance we can"" with the investigation into a crashed passenger airline near the Ukraine-Russia border.

""Obviously, the world is watching reports of a downed passenger jet near the Russia-Ukraine border,"" Obama said. ""It looks like it may be a terrible tragedy.""

ADVERTISEMENT

The president said he had directed his national security team to ""stay in close contact"" with Ukrainian authorities investigating the crash, and offered U.S. aid ""to help to determine what happened and why.""

Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a Boeing 777 traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lampur, had 280 passengers and 15 crew members on board. Ukrainian authorities have accused pro-Russian separatists battling government forces in the country's eastern regions of shooting down the plane, although the U.S. has said it cannot confirm reports on the cause of the crash.

The president said the nation's ""first priority"" was ""working to determine whether or not there were American citizens on board.""

""Our thoughts and prayers are with all the families of the passengers, wherever they call home,"" Obama added.

Earlier Thursday, the White House said Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed reports of the crash during a telephone call to discuss new sections announced by the U.S. on Wednesday.

Press secretary Josh Earnest said the conversation occurred near the end of the call, requested by Moscow.

The Kremlin said Putin ""informed the U.S. president of the report from air traffic controllers that the Malaysian plane had crashed on Ukrainian territory, which had arrived immediately before the phone call"" in a statement posted to its website.

President Obama also called Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Thursdsay to express condolences to the people of Malaysia for the terrible loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine and the families who lost loved ones, according to a White House statement.

"http://thehill.com/policy/international/195921-bae-admits-serious-crime-begs-for-release","Bae admits 'serious crime,' begs for release","Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen imprisoned in North Korea, said Monday in a Pyongyang press conference that he had committed a “serious crime” against North Korea, and urged the U.S. to cooperate with the country to secure his release.

Flanked by military officials, Bae apologized to North Korea's government and said the country's government does not commit human rights abuses, according to the Chinese news agency Xinhua

“Thanks to the humanitarian treatment from the DPRK side, I could maintain contacts with my family through phone calls and mail, with the help of the Swedish embassy,” Bae said.

Bae's confession is similar to that given by Korean War veteran Merrill Newman in December. The 85-year-old, who was arrested while visiting North Korea, confessed that he had committed numerous war crimes during the conflict, but repudiated the confession as false once he was released and returned to the U.S.

Arrested in November, 2012, Bae has been held longer by North Korea than any U.S. citizen since the end of the Korean War. Prior to his arrest, he operated a company out of China specializing in tours of North Korea. According to his supporters at the site FreeKenNow.com, Bae is a devout Christian who believed in “showing compassion to the North Korea people by contributing to their economy in the form of tourism.”

In April, 2013, Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for the crime of “state subversion.” According to his sister, the hours of labor each day in prison took a severe toll on his health, and he was hospitalized in August. Bae suffers from several health problems, including diabetes.

“As we have said before, we remain very concerned about Kenneth Bae’s health,” State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement. “We continue to urge the DPRK authorities to grant Bae amnesty and immediate release.

“We continue to work actively to secure Mr. Bae’s release, including through regular, close consultation with the Swedish Embassy,” she added.

“The protection of U.S. citizens overseas is one of the Department of State’s highest priorities.”

"http://thehill.com/policy/international/196334-report-obama-administration-investigating-rodman-trip-to","Report: Rodman under investigation for North Korea trip","The State and Treasury departments are investigating whether Dennis Rodman broke the law on his most recent trip to North Korea, The Daily Beast reports.

The former basketball star reportedly offered luxury gifts to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un for his 31st birthday, including expensive whiskey and a fur coat for his wife. The gifts would violate the 2010 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as well as several United Nations sanctions.

Rodman has entered rehab following his return from North Korea and has not been heard from since.

The trip, billed as an effort to help build better relations with North Korea through sports diplomacy, is widely seen as having been a PR disaster for Rodman, especially after he suggested imprisoned American Kenneth Bae had violated North Korean law and deserved to be in jail.

"http://thehill.com/policy/international/203740-putin-denies-russian-troops-are-in-eastern-ukraine","Putin denies troops are in eastern Ukraine","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said he hoped Russia would not have to send troops into eastern Ukraine, calling Kiev's decision to employ military force to break up protests there a ""grave concern.""

According to the Associated Press, Putin again denied Russian forces have been employed in the region.

""It's all nonsense, there are no special units, special forces or instructors in the east of Ukraine,"" Putin said.

However, Putin acknowledged for the first time Russian forces were deployed in Crimea ahead of the referendum vote to break off from Ukraine and join Russia last month.

""Our servicemen stood behind the back of Crimea's self-defense forces. They acted politely, but resolutely and professionally,"" he said. ""There was no other way to hold the referendum in an open, honest and honorable way and allow the people to express their opinion.""

Putin described talks in Geneva on Thursday between Russia, Ukraine, the United States and European countries as ""very important.” Only through dialogue can order be imposed, he said.

""I think the start of today's talks is very important, as it's very important now to think together about how to overcome this situation and offer a real dialogue to the people,"" Putin said.

Putin's words during a televised call-in show come as Ukraine and the west have accused pro-Russian separatists, backed by Putin’s government, of taking over at least 10 government buildings in eastern Ukraine. Russia has massed nearly 40,000 troops along the eastern border of the country as well, according to the U.S.

A Ukrainian National Guard unit reportedly killed three protesters and injured more than a dozen others Thursday while holding back an attack at a port near the Black Sea in the country.

During an interview Wednesday night, President Obama said Russia does not want a war with the U.S.

""Mr. Putin's decisions are not just bad for Ukraine; over the long term, they're gonna be bad for Russia,"" Obama said. ""Now, we want to give diplomacy a chance as long as ultimately the decisions are being made by Ukrainians. Not by Russians, not by Americans, not by other European nations, but by Ukrainians themselves.""

The White House has levied sanctions on a number of officials associated with the annexation of Crimea last month. The White House said Wednesday it has additional sanctions prepared if the situation escalates.","2014-04-17 07:26:20","1","31.0","1.0","13.0","1.0","4.0","0.0","223.0","213.0","0.0","141.0","0.0","33.0","23","395","96.02","58.02","56.80","34.56","23.24","25.06","79.24","44.81","4.05","2.28","0.25","0.51","0.00","0.76","0.76","1.77","9.11","16.71","5.57","4.81","5.32","2.03","12.41","4.05","2.28","0.25","1.52","0.76","4.56","2.53","2.03","0.00","1.01","0.25","7.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.76","10.63","2.28","2.03","1.27","1.77","0.25","4.05","3.29","1.01","2.03","0.25","0.51","0.25","0.25","0.00","0.25","9.62","1.52","1.01","5.82","0.25","1.27","3.80","8.35","0.76","17.47","0.76","10.38","6.08","3.54","0.25","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.76","0.51","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","19.24","5.57","6.33","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.76","4.05","2.28","0.00","0.00","1932","7.89","25.375","570","391","19","59.03","12.0","10.1","12.88","13.4","80","12.5","18.424143222506395","230","22.88","7","0.44","0","11","4","39","1","50","33","1","1","2","50","56","3","27","0","0","11","2","28","0","0","4","12","0","15","20","6","12","8","7","0","0","0","1"

Russia's ambassador to the U.S. on Sunday decried the overnight attack on a pro-Russian checkpoint in Ukraine that has broken a fragile Easter truce.

“We are outraged by the attack on the checkpoint,” Ambassador Sergey Kislyak said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

At least two people were killed near Slaviansk in Eastern Ukraine, Reuters reported

Kislyak said the attack suggests Ukraine is not doing enough to implement a deal signed in Geneva aimed at ending tensions with Russia.

“Unless they do so in a faithful way, there will be no solution to this crisis,” he said, adding that only when Ukraine disarms anti-Russia militiamen will pro-Russian groups stand down.

ADVERTISEMENT The ambassador said new statements by Ukrainian Prime Minster Arseniy Yatsenyuk suggesting Vladimir Putin is trying to recreate the Soviet Union were “false.”

Yatsenyuk made the comments in an interview to be broadcast on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" later on Sunday, according to a transcript.

“That is a false notion,” Kislyak said. “We are not going anywhere.”

He said Russia just wants Ukraine to resolve internal problems in a way that is fair to the Russian-speaking minority and that Russia wants a “friendly neighbor.”

The ambassador said the U.S. should drop talk of increasing sanctions because that will not serve to encourage cooperation from Russia.

“We don't believe the language of sanctions is a good one to talk in the 21st century,” he said. “We can withstand pressures.""","2014-04-20 09:40:48","0","4.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","155.0","149.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","10.0","4","249","95.73","84.24","16.94","10.54","20.75","27.31","71.89","42.97","6.02","3.21","0.00","1.61","0.00","1.20","0.40","2.81","10.04","14.06","8.03","2.41","2.01","2.01","14.06","2.41","1.20","0.40","0.80","1.20","5.62","2.01","3.21","0.80","2.01","0.00","12.05","0.00","0.80","0.00","1.20","6.43","1.61","1.20","1.61","0.80","0.00","1.61","5.62","1.20","3.61","0.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.84","4.42","1.20","1.61","0.80","0.80","4.42","8.03","2.41","14.86","1.20","10.04","3.61","1.20","0.80","0.40","0.00","0.40","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.29","7.23","3.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.61","8.03","1.20","0.00","0.00","1207","8.47","28.22222222222222","348","243","15","71.95","10.2","7.2","13.05","11.5","62","7.166666666666666","18.68576131687243","153","25.11","6","0.43","0","1","2","29","0","25","21","0","2","5","26","43","0","11","0","0","8","0","9","0","0","1","10","0","12","14","8","5","7","10","3","0","0","1"

President Obama said Thursday that Moscow was not abiding by “the spirit or the letter” of an agreement struck by foreign ministers last week in Geneva designed to deescalate unrest in Ukraine.

The president warned that the U.S. had “teed up” additional sanctions against Russia, and said Moscow had “days, not weeks” to publicly renounce the actions of “malicious and armed” pro-Russian separatists who continue to hold government buildings in eastern Ukraine.

“There’s always the possibility Russia tomorrow or the next day reverses course and takes a different approach ... it wouldn’t require a radical shift,” Obama said at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shnizo Abe in Tokyo.

But the president said he was not “overly optimistic” that Russia would encourage separatists to disarm.

“So far the evidence doesn’t make me hopeful,” he continued.

At the same time, Obama acknowledged “that additional sanctions may not change [Russian President Valdimir] Putin’s calculus” when it came to Ukraine.

But he vowed that “over the medium and long term, this is going to hurt Russia as much as it hurts Ukraine.”

The president also stressed that there were “technical” issues that complicated his ability to immediately move forward with sanctions, and said the U.S. wanted to coordinate any additional steps with its allies. He said their effectiveness depended partially “on the cooperation of other countries.”

Obama’s comments came hours after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the RT network that Moscow would “respond” if its interests were attacked in Ukraine.

""If our interests, our legitimate interests, the interests of Russians have been attacked directly, like they were in South Ossetia for example, I do not see any other way but to respond in accordance with international law,"" he said.

Lavrov also accused the U.S. of offering ineffective “ready-made solutions” to the crisis and said Washington was “running the show.”

Earlier in the day, interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov ordered Kiev security forces to resume a crackdown against separatists who had established checkpoints and seized government buildings in the country’s eastern regions.","2014-04-24 00:51:05","0","31.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","217.0","213.0","0.0","142.0","0.0","45.0","23","377","87.72","55.27","42.68","50.53","20.94","31.56","76.66","41.91","8.75","3.18","0.53","0.53","0.00","1.59","0.53","5.57","7.96","12.20","6.10","2.12","5.57","1.86","12.20","3.98","1.86","1.06","0.00","0.80","5.04","3.18","1.86","0.27","0.53","0.53","8.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.59","11.14","1.33","2.12","1.86","2.65","0.53","5.31","4.24","1.33","2.12","0.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.55","1.86","1.33","4.51","1.06","0.80","6.90","3.71","1.33","16.18","2.92","7.96","5.84","3.71","1.06","0.00","0.00","1.06","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","22.28","6.90","4.24","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.53","7.96","1.59","0.00","0.80","1949","9.12","27.571428571428573","595","375","20","52.39","13.3","10.6","14.62","13.9","108","7.0","21.04","236","25.36","9","0.42","0","12","0","34","0","40","35","0","1","4","47","48","1","28","0","0","13","6","18","1","0","1","13","0","17","32","5","9","4","9","2","2","0","2"
"http://thehill.com/policy/international/203767-putin-jokes-alaska-is-too-cold-to-annex","Putin jokes Alaska too cold to annex","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday jokingly implied that Alaska wasn't worth reunifying with Russia because it was too cold.

At a nearly four-hour, question-and-answer event, one submitted question for Putin asked if, following the annexation of Crimea, he had designs for the largest of the United States.

“Are there any plans to annex Alaska to Russia? We would be very happy [about that],” said Faina Ivanovna, drawing laughter from the crowd.

“What would you need Alaska for?” Putin said with a smile.

“We are a northern country … 70 percent of our territory is in the north and far north. You think Alaska is in the Southern Hemisphere? It’s quite cold there, too,” Putin said. “Let’s not be overly enthusiastic about it because if we have our people there, we will have to pay extra to our employees there because they live in the north.”

Putin remarked that Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million in gold, which he said wasn’t that expensive.

A petition on the White House website calls for Alaska to secede from the U.S. and rejoin Russia. Since it was created in late March, nearly 42,500 people have signed it.

In the 19th century, some in the U.S. criticized Secretary of State William Seward's purchase of Alaska, calling it “Seward’s folly.”

Thirty years later, however, a gold rush hit Alaska and it was seen as a valuable addition to the U.S. The sale has since been a sore spot for Russians.","2014-04-17 10:56:04","1","28.0","0.0","13.0","1.0","4.0","0.0","220.0","213.0","0.0","141.0","0.0","33.0","23","255","85.82","84.61","11.28","62.94","17.00","18.43","76.86","49.02","10.20","5.10","0.00","3.14","0.78","0.78","0.39","5.10","8.24","14.90","8.24","4.71","4.31","1.18","14.12","4.31","1.18","0.78","3.53","1.57","2.75","2.35","0.39","0.00","0.39","0.00","9.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.78","9.80","1.57","2.75","1.96","3.53","0.00","2.35","3.92","0.78","2.35","0.78","0.78","0.00","0.78","0.00","0.00","5.88","3.14","0.78","1.57","0.39","0.00","5.88","5.88","0.78","12.55","0.78","7.84","3.53","1.57","0.00","0.39","2.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.53","7.45","6.27","0.00","0.00","1.18","0.00","1.18","3.92","2.35","0.00","1.18","1145","7.12","20.384615384615383","344","252","19","74.9","8.8","6.1","10.02","8.1","45","6.714285714285714","14.462857142857144","157","18.08","8","0.48","0","4","9","24","0","38","16","0","1","3","23","44","3","6","0","0","17","3","16","0","0","0","7","0","9","16","4","6","7","5","2","1","0","0"
"http://www.newsweek.com/footprint-deepwater-horizon-spill-bigger-we-thought-261901","Footprint of Deepwater Horizon Spill Is Bigger Than We Thought","Four years after the largest marine oil spill in history, biologists continue to discover its victims on the ocean floor.

Transocean Ltd. and BP’s drilling rig, the Deepwater Horizon, exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, killing 11 crewmen and igniting a fire that could be seen from the Louisiana shore over 40 miles away. Two days later, the rig sank 5,000 feet to the ocean floor, gushing oil out into the water at a rate of roughly 60,000 barrels a day for 87 days. By the time the well was capped that September, it had released nearly 5 million barrels (210 million gallons) of oil and gas into the ocean. Covering an area of nearly 30,000 square miles, the oil slick on the water’s surface was almost the size of South Carolina.

Cleanup efforts were primarily surface-level. The slick was dissipated with the help of 1.8 million gallons of Corexit dispersants, which change the chemical and physical properties of oil but do not reduce the total amount of oil entering the environment. After these dispersants were pumped into the water and applied aerially to the slick, booms contained the remaining oil so it could be siphoned off or burned.

Far beneath the surface, the effects of the spill and the cleanup strategies have been difficult to gauge. “Things happen slowly in the deep sea,” says Charles Fisher, the Pennsylvania State University biology professor who led a study published Monday in the online Early Edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper reports the discovery of five previously unknown coral communities near the wellhead, two of which show signs of damage resulting from the spill.

Prior to the study published Monday, only one known coral site was visibly affected by the spill. Discovered eight miles southwest of the wellhead, it was one of 14 coral communities that Fisher’s team visited in the fall of 2010 and was the only one that “clearly suffered a recent severe adverse impact,” according to the report. Using oil forensics, the team determined that hydrocarbons found on the corals at that site originated from the Deepwater Horizon.

Now they know it was not an isolated incident. Of the five newly discovered coral communities, two show the same signs of degradation that the team’s 2010 discovery reflected. And since one of the new sites is nearly 14 miles southeast of the wellhead—almost twice as far and in 50 percent deeper water than the first discovery—these findings considerably expand the spill’s known area of impact.

“It is important to remember that this isn’t just about corals,” Fisher tells Newsweek. For one thing, these communities are among the most biologically diverse and productive on the planet, and it could spell disaster if their destruction reduces biodiversity and ocean productivity. What’s more, since they are one of the oldest living animals on Earth, corals serve as excellent indicators of man’s impact on marine ecosystems. Natural death of deep-sea coral is a rare event, with some species living thousands of years. Furthermore, when a colony dies, its skeleton remains attached to the seafloor for years, slowly losing branches as it continues to provide a record of its existence and death.

“If fish or crabs or shrimp were swimming around in those areas [in 2010], we wouldn’t have known,” Fisher says. “But these corals stay there.” Looking at them can give us an idea of what ocean conditions have been like throughout time.

What the three coral communities affected by the Deepwater Horizon spill all have in common is a characteristically patchy dispersion of dead coral skeleton covered with hydrozoans (a.k.a. “immortal jellyfish”), which grow on any substrate, dead or alive, and resemble either mutant jellyfish or soft coral, depending on their stage in life. These hydrozoans and the dead spots they cover are randomly scattered not only across the site but also on individual coral colonies.

“This pattern suggests that the impacting agent was not evenly dispersed in the bottom water, but rather present as microdroplets or particles,” according to the report. “Whether this represents small droplets of oil/dispersant or oil-containing marine snow is not known.”

Marine snow is a natural process, in which organic materials rain down from the upper layers of the water column to the ocean depths below. Fisher says marine snow could have become toxic four years ago, as globs of oil or dispersant or byproducts from the oil fires began to sink. But toxic marine snow is just one theory. The mechanism that carried the hydrocarbons so far and so deep to speckle the coral where they were found is unknown, but Fisher’s team is certain that their origin was either the Deepwater Horizon spill or the cleanup.

And they’re surprised because “the models all said the plumes didn’t go that deep,” Fisher says. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration models, to which he is referring, suggested that the deep-water plume of hydrocarbons from the spill moved predominantly to the southwest, whereas these new corals were found to the southeast. Furthermore, the old models capped their depth predictions at 1,300 meters (0.8 mile), and the one found almost 14 miles from the wellhead was 1,900 meters (1.2 miles) deep.

Two of the other five newly discovered coral communities were also damaged, but not by the events of 2010. They were fouled by commercial fishing lines, the report found, adding to the “large cumulative effect” of harmful human activities on the corals in the deep Gulf of Mexico.

“Although far removed from surface and coastal waters, and from the consciousness of most people, deep-sea environments play numerous roles,” the authors of the study write. “Many species of fishes and sharks use deep corals as spawning grounds or sites for deposition of eggs. Healthy deep-sea sediments are remarkably high in biodiversity and important in global carbon and nitrogen cycling, decomposition processes, and energy flow to higher trophic-level consumers. Perhaps most importantly, the full spectrum of ecosystem services derived from deep-sea biota and habitats is largely unknown.”

In other words, the full damage of the Deepwater Horizon spill may still be unknown.","2014-07-29 11:46:53","0","32.0","4.0","7.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","88.0","50.0","0.0","177.0","6.0","24.0","23","1050","95.93","49.24","57.25","21.39","23.33","23.33","75.71","43.14","5.71","1.24","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.10","0.95","4.48","10.38","14.00","5.33","2.67","5.90","0.86","9.14","6.38","2.38","1.14","5.05","1.62","2.57","1.14","1.43","0.00","0.19","0.29","4.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.19","10.57","2.57","1.71","0.76","3.14","0.67","3.52","2.86","0.76","0.67","0.29","1.90","0.29","0.67","0.00","0.67","3.81","1.24","1.05","1.81","0.19","0.29","4.29","4.76","0.19","16.86","1.52","11.14","4.29","3.14","0.67","0.00","0.19","0.10","0.86","0.19","0.00","0.10","0.10","0.10","0.00","15.52","4.48","5.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.76","2.29","1.14","0.76","0.29","5085","8.38","25.975609756097562","1539","1032","47","57.61","12.8","10.7","12.42","13.7","239","12.25","20.06356589147287","499","22.88","1","0.41","0","46","52","126","0","142","91","3","5","6","164","55","1","99","0","0","17","7","58","0","2","1","18","0","13","39","19","33","30","24","8","4","0","2"
"http://www.newsweek.com/could-second-hand-pot-smoke-make-you-fail-marijuana-test-278913","Could Second-Hand Pot Smoke Make You Fail a Marijuana Test?","Many people assume that simply being around pot-smokers and marijuana smoke isn’t likely to result in trouble during a drug test, and that has been the general scientific consensus.

But as weed has gotten more potent, scientists decided to investigate if secondhand smoke from strong strains of cannabis could lead to positive drug test results.

Urine tests look for a metabolite, or bodily by-product of THC, the chemical that accounts for many of marijuana’s psychoactive properties. In recent years, many strains of marijuana have been bred to contain more THC.

So researchers paired several regular pot smokers and nonsmokers and put them in a sealed compartment together for an hour, while one smoked a joint containing a relatively strong strain of marijuana.

The 12 nonsmoking participants were then tasked with peeing into a cup 13 times over the next 34 hours. Their urine was tested for 9-carboxy-THC, the marijuana metabolite commonly measured in standard drug tests.

The results, published this month in the Journal of Analytical Toxicology, gives nonsmokers with weed-using friends reason to breathe easy. The scientists found urine levels of this metabolite surpassed typically detectable levels (50 nanogram per milliliter) in only one experiment participant, and this happened during a brief window four to six hours after exposure.

Using a more sensitive test, however, which is not usually employed in the workplace, scientists could detect blood THC levels above the 20 nanogram per milliliter in several participants in the hours after exposure. But these concentrations dipped below this threshold for all participants within 24 hours, according to the study, conducted by researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and elsewhere.

Positive tests are “likely to be rare” from secondhand smoke, the authors concluded, “limited to the hours immediately post-exposure, and occurring only under environmental circumstances where exposure is obvious.” Like, for example, sealing yourself in a car with several smokers for several hours and then peeing in a cup shortly thereafter.

When researchers ventilated the smoking chamber, thus making the smoke fumes less concentrated, the urine levels of THC’s metabolite did not come close to reaching the 50 nanogram per milliliter threshold for any participant.","2014-10-21 15:16:00","1","26.0","2.0","7.0","1.0","16.0","6.0","88.0","50.0","0.0","186.0","9.0","24.0","23","377","97.55","52.12","40.98","30.24","26.93","30.24","79.58","41.11","3.45","0.80","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.53","2.65","8.49","16.45","4.24","4.24","5.04","0.80","7.69","5.31","2.92","0.80","3.18","3.71","2.92","1.59","1.33","0.80","0.27","0.00","3.18","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","10.08","2.12","2.92","0.80","2.12","1.33","2.12","0.80","0.80","0.00","0.00","5.57","1.86","1.33","0.00","2.39","4.24","0.53","1.06","2.12","1.33","0.27","2.65","3.18","0.80","16.18","1.33","8.49","6.37","6.10","1.33","0.27","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.53","3.71","5.84","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.59","1.06","0.80","0.53","0.00","1979","9.08","29.23076923076923","611","371","14","44.58","16.1","13.6","15.03","17.8","97","10.1","23.058221024258764","220","26.85","5","0.39","0","11","12","42","1","58","40","1","1","2","54","17","0","41","0","0","2","1","22","3","0","0","10","0","8","16","11","10","6","7","2","0","0","2"

The incident happened during a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Both officials had been introduced to the Committee as representatives of their respective departments. The video was first posted by Foreign Policy.

The two officials are Nisha Biswal, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia at the U.S. Department of State, and Arun Kumar, Director General of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service and Assistant Secretary for Global Markets at the U.S. Department of Commerce. Bishwal was born in the United States and attended the University of Virginia. Kumar was born in India and has a bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of Kerala and a master’s in management from the Sloan School of Business at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Neither represents the government of India; both are of Indian descent.

Bishwal and Kumar appear to have handled the incident with remarkable grace and restraint.

Representative Clawson attended Purdue University and Harvard Business School, and should therefore know better.","2014-07-25 17:28:58","1","21.0","3.0","6.0","2.0","16.0","6.0","86.0","50.0","0.0","178.0","9.0","24.0","23","198","99.00","56.02","8.15","34.54","19.80","34.85","76.77","39.90","1.01","1.01","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","0.00","9.60","16.67","5.05","0.51","7.07","0.51","9.09","2.53","1.52","0.00","1.52","1.01","1.52","1.01","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.51","4.55","1.01","1.01","1.01","1.01","0.00","1.01","3.03","2.02","1.01","0.00","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.51","0.00","6.06","0.00","1.01","5.05","0.51","0.00","5.56","3.03","0.00","11.62","1.52","6.57","3.54","16.16","1.01","0.51","2.02","0.00","0.00","0.51","0.00","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.66","9.09","4.04","0.00","0.51","0.00","0.00","1.01","0.00","1.01","0.00","0.00","1071","9.41","18.545454545454547","340","196","14","48.81","13.4","9.9","14.9","12.2","63","4.125","20.45714285714286","114","15.45","10","0.42","0","13","2","20","0","30","8","1","0","1","15","73","2","8","0","0","0","2","2","0","0","0","3","0","2","7","2","6","3","4","0","0","0","0"
"http://www.newsweek.com/2014/04/04/cia-doesnt-want-you-know-how-badly-it-botched-torture-248033.html","The CIA Doesn’t Want You to Know How Badly It Botched Torture","The hotel bar TVs were all flashing clips of Senate intelligence committee chair Dianne Feinstein denouncing the CIA for spying on her staff, when I met an agency operative for drinks last week. He flashed a wan smile, gestured at the TV and volunteered that he'd narrowly escaped being assigned to interrogate Al-Qaida suspects at a secret site years ago.

""I guess I would've done it,"" he said, implying you either took orders or quit. But everybody in the counterterrorism program knew what was going on in those places, he said, and he was glad the agency found something else for him to do at the last minute. ""Look what's happened.""

Four years after Feinstein launched her probe of that interrogation program, her committee and the CIA are locked in a death-struggle over what can be released from the panel's 6,300-page, still-classified report. The impasse is bringing renewed attention to statements by former CIA and FBI agents that buttress the committee's all-but-official conclusion that the agency exaggerated the interrogation program's successes and minimized its abuses.

In early 2008, for example, the committee heard from Ali Soufan, one of the FBI's top former counterterrorism agents, who has since gone public with his criticism of the enhanced interrogation techniques, or EITs, that CIA contractors had used on top Al-Qaida captive Abu Zubaydah. ""The staffers present were shocked,"" he wrote in his memoir, The Black Banners. ""What I told them contradicted everything they had been told by Bush administration and CIA officials. When the discussion turned to whether I could prove everything I was saying, I told them, 'Remember, an FBI agent always keep his notes.' ""

A Lebanese-American who was decorated by both the FBI and Defense Department for his counterterrorism work, Soufan laid out a case for the committee that CIA officials, chiefly Jose Rodriguez, the former CIA counterterrorism boss who ordered the destruction of interrogation videotapes, lied about the value of torturing detainees—to the point of altering the dates on documents to show a cause-and-effect that didn't exist.

""In this area, it's not a question of memory but of factual record,"" he later told the New Yorker's Amy Davidson. ""There are now thousands of pages of declassified memos and reports that thoroughly rebut what Mr. Rodriguez and others are now claiming. For example, one of the successes of the EITs claimed in the now declassified memos is that after the program began in August 2002, Abu Zubaydah provided intelligence that prevented José Padilla from detonating a dirty bomb on U.S. soil, and identified Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Mr. Rodriguez has been repeating this claim.

""The reality,"" Soufan continued, ""is that both of those pieces of intelligence were gained by my partner and me, with CIA colleagues, in early April 2002—months before the August 2002 start of the EIT program. But in the memos they were able to promote false facts, even altering dates, to make their claims work."" An internal CIA memo claimed that Padilla was arrested in May 2003,"" Soufan told the committee. ""In reality, he was arrested in May 2002. But saying 2003 fits with the waterboarding narrative.""

Soufan also dismissed claims by Rodriguez and his allies that complaints about the value of harsh interrogations came solely from the FBI, a law enforcement agency that pulled out of the secret sites in 2002. ""I totally disagree with this assertion..."" Soufan told the Judiciary Committee in separate open testimony in 2009. ""They""—CIA interrogators he worked with—""were one hundred percent supportive"" of using nonphysical elicitation techniques that had worked for decades on hardened criminals. ""Actually, the chief psychologist of the CIA, the forensic psychologist, objected to these [torture] techniques and he even left the location before I did,"" Soufan testified. ""Their top interrogator was, I think, 100 percent in sync with our view, the FBI view, because he's a professional interrogator.

""Almost all the agency officials I worked with on these issues were good people, who felt as I did about the use of enhanced techniques as un-American, ineffective and harmful to our national security,"" Soufan added. Abu Zubaydah, he underscored, was waterboarded even before the technique was authorized.

For reasons that remain mysterious, the Senate intelligence committee has not taken the testimony of Glenn Carle, a senior high-ranking CIA officer who has gone public with his criticism of the interrogation program. Carle, who retired in 2007 as the CIA's Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Transnational Threats, was dispatched to interrogate an Afghan billed as an ""Al-Qaida banker"" at a secret site, later identified as Morocco, in 2002. A spy-operations veteran, Carle soon decided the detainee was nothing more than a lowly merchant with a passing connection to the terrorist group. But even after higher-ups knew they had the wrong man, he recounted in his memoir, The Interrogator: An Education, they held onto him.

""Some in the agency might not have wanted him released because so much of his case was based on erroneous assessments, that to have released him would have shown the operation to have been a house of cards, like so much of the war on terrorism,"" he told Harper's magazine.

Other CIA interrogators have told the intelligence committee similar tales. And then there is the matter of the records gathered by the committee—the ""notes"" Soufan referenced, as well as internal agency documents, that directly contradict the assurances CIA officials gave the committee that waterboarding was not only safe, effective and non-habit-forming, but integral to getting top Al-Qaida figures to talk.

To those who have followed the issue closely, the ""revelations"" in the committee report will come as no surprise: To a large extent, they've been out there all along. All's left is the reckoning-and that's the sum of all the CIA's fears.

"http://www.newsweek.com/gary-shteyngart-finally-tells-truth-225443","Gary Shteyngart Finally Tells the Truth","Gary Shteyngart is a liar. For a good decade now he has been writing novels under that name, never once revealing that it is a nom de plume – he was born Igor Semyonovich Shteyngart in 1972 at the Otto Birthing House, in what was then the Soviet city of Leningrad. He only became Gary later, in Queens, “so that I would suffer one or two fewer beatings” at the hands of his suspicious American classmates. Well, what he gained in bodily security back then he today loses in this reader’s faith. Igor!

Shteyngart has been quite skilled at the artful form of lying known as fiction ever since his debut novel, The Russian Debutante’s Handbook, was published in 2002. That immigrant picaresque earned the sort of effusive reviews that can cause a writer to lose friends, though in his second novel, Absurdistan – a dark post-Soviet romp – he dismissed his debut as The Russian Arriviste’s Handjob, suggesting some restlessness about his writerly persona. His third effort, Super Sad True Love Story, is probably his finest; the dystopian novel even converted skeptics like The New Republic’s whipsmart Ruth Franklin, who called it “a satire that strikes painfully at many of our culture’s weakest spots.”

Now, finally, Shteyngart is ready to tell the truth. I met him at the 2nd Ave Deli in Manhattan, where we feasted on brisket and pastrami, drank Dr. Brown’s Cel-Ray sodas and talked about his new memoir, Little Failure, the only recent book I can think of dedicated in all seriousness to an author’s psychotherapist.

As we split a latke the size of Azerbaijan, Shteyngart reminisced about his first novel’s success: He was an Oberlin graduate working toward a master’s degree in creative writing when Riverhead Books pulled him out of anonymity, gave him a lot of money and agreed to publish what he now calls his “silly book.”

“It was 11 years ago,” the famously hirsute Shteyngart says, “but it seems like it was 150 years ago. Back then, being a writer, there was nothing better than that. Now you’re just a farm team for some bigger parts of the cultural industry.” He says that what little’s left of American high culture shifted away from literature with The Sopranos, which he argues was television’s first serious bid for sophistication. Now, like the rest of us, he watches Mad Men. Reading a book these days, he says, requires almost-impossible focus in the face of endless distraction. He recently finished Middlemarch – getting through it was “like going to the North Pole.”

At the same time, Shteyngart readily admits that his trajectory has been “as good as it gets in literary fiction.” A decade ago, I saw him share a reading with another novelist in the KGB Bar in the East Village, where smoke occluded walls covered in Soviet kitsch. Shteyngart was drunk, ribald, loquacious. It was a literary comedy show, especially when he laid on the Russian accent. The other novelist approached the lectern to share a lesson he’d learned the hard way: “Never f**cking read after Gary Shteyngart.”

Back then, Shteyngart was still an unknown. Today, he is as close to stardom as any American writer can hope to be. The video trailer for Little Failure features James Franco, whom Shteyngart taught at Columbia, and Jonathan Franzen – whose critiques of American society have a hint of hostility absent from Shteyngart’s own fiction – oh, and Alex Karpovsky and Rashida Jones.

See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows

Shteyngart may have it pretty easy, living with his wife and son near Gramercy Park, swimming daily at the Equinox gym, visiting his therapist “only” four times a week and spending long stretches of the year at a house in the bucolic Hudson River Valley. But it was not always so. When the tides of Soviet-Jewish immigration deposited him in Queens, he was a “short, dark and furry” creature lost in a world of “pure Technicolor.” Little Failure is about the struggles of a “strange salami-smelling boy with some aptitude in math” – though, luckily, a lot more aptitude with language. It may be true, as Norman Podhoretz wrote in his memoir, Making It, that “one of the longest journeys in the world is the journey from Brooklyn to Manhattan.” But the journey from Kew Gardens in Queens is even longer.

And that journey – chronicled to some extent in all of Shteyngart’s work, whose irrepressible humor disguises a Nabokovian love of the English language and an astute grasp of human psychology – has left Shteyngart longing for an earlier version of New York. He bemoans the sanitized, bike-laned metropolis of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, so unlike the snarling, scruffy city he prowled while a student at Stuyvesant High School in the bad old days of the late 1980s. I jokingly suggest that then mayor-elect Bill de Blasio could resurrect those times, as some Manhattanites fear. Shteyngart lights up with a devilish grin. “Let’s hope he drives the city into the ground.”

Shteyngart is in a tricky situation: He is popular not only for his writing, but for the role he occupies within the literary community – the hairy prankster, the vodka-loving Russian, the neurotic Jew. These are all stereotypes, but they have helped sell books. His ludicrously effusive blurbing of other writers’ books – the subject of a 2012 documentary, in which I make one flip remark – is both a comment on the self-importance of the literary community and a clever way to stay relevant in that gang. Shteyngart could occupy his cozy literary niche forever, but he clearly wants to transcend it.

Having finally told his own story in Little Failure, he intends to write a book “that doesn’t have a Russian-Jewish protagonist at its center."" That’s almost inconceivable, since Shteyngart has mined the psyche of our troubled peoples as thoroughly as Philip Roth has of Newark’s native Jews. And yet he says his next book will be a thriller “with a strong female character.”

Strength isn’t a quality the hero of Little Failure seems to possess. Shteyngart was born in 1972, thrust almost at once into “the strange, unbidden beauty of being a sickly child.” Reflecting on a picture of himself at about 2 years of age, he notes that his face in the photograph is that “of a mother in 1943 who just received a fateful telegram from the front.” He asks his mother today why he had looked so terrified back then, and she answers with brutal simplicity: “Because you were born a Jewish person.”

Every successful immigrant is a shape-shifter. By the age of 5, Shteyngart had decided he would be a writer, inspired in good part by the Swedish book The Wonderful Adventures of Nils and the Wild Geese. By 10, in America, he was a Republican who read the National Review, by 16 a “terrible student” at Stuyvesant, from there he headed to Oberlin College, which “would allow me to lose my virginity to an equally hirsute, stoned and unhappy person in the least humiliating way possible,” as he writes in Little Failure. There, in the oddly progressive hinterlands of Ohio, he became a stoner known as “Scary Gary” who wasn’t exactly taxed academically: his most intense assignment during freshman year apparently involving a viewing of Blade Runner. (Shteyngart claims that he is persona non grata at the college he routinely excoriates in his fiction.)

After doing a halfhearted postgraduate imitation of Bartleby the Scrivener, Shteyngart landed at the creative writing program at Hunter College, where he quickly earned the praise of novelist Chang-Rae Lee. This was 2000, when it was “still possible to woo a girl with a book deal.” That book came out shortly after 9/11, when many New Yorkers were just about ready to laugh at their city again. Shteyngart and his hero, Vladimir Girshkin of the Emma Lazarus Immigrant Absorption Society, left them with no other choice.

And though Shteyngart is often joking, a surprisingly somber side comes across both in person and in Little Failure. The book is forthright about Shteyngart’s fraught relationship with his father and his equally fraught relationship with Russia. The dedication to the psychotherapist does not seem nearly so funny when you finish reading this memoir.

As we dispense with our sandwiches, Shteyngart freely admits that his life has been governed by an “overwhelming sense of anxiety,” a long-standing lineage of Hebraic dread that he would like to not pass on to his son. “Fatherhood is great: I’m very cuddly, he’s very cuddly.

"http://www.newsweek.com/gaza-ceasefire-holds-netanyahu-faces-demands-clearer-victory-266894","Gaza Ceasefire Holds but Netanyahu Faces Demands for Clearer Victory","An open-ended ceasefire in the Gaza war between Israel and the Palestinians held on Wednesday as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced strong criticism in his country's newspapers over a campaign in which no clear victor emerged.

On the streets of the battered, Hamas-run Palestinian enclave, people headed to shops and banks, trying to resume the normal pace of life after seven weeks of fighting.

In Israel, sirens warning of incoming rocket fire from the Gaza Strip fell silent, but media commentators voiced deep disappointment over Netanyahu's leadership during the most prolonged bout of Israeli-Palestinian violence in a decade.

""After 50 days of warfare in which a terror organization killed dozens of soldiers and civilians, destroyed the daily routine (and) placed the country in a state of economic distress...we could have expected much more than an announcement of a ceasefire,"" analyst Shimon Shiffer wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel's biggest-selling newspaper.

""We could have expected the prime minister to go to the President’s Residence and inform him of his decision to resign his post.""

Netanyahu, who has faced constant sniping from far-right members of his coalition government demanding military action to topple Hamas, made no immediate comment on the Egyptian-mediated truce deal that took effect on Tuesday evening.

Palestinian health officials say 2,139 people, most of them civilians, including more than 490 children, have been killed in the enclave since July 8, when Israel launched an offensive with the declared aim of ending rocket salvoes.

Israel's death toll stood at 64 soldiers and six civilians.

Israel said it dealt a strong blow to Hamas, killing several of its military leaders and destroying the Islamist group's cross-border infiltration tunnels.

But Israel also faced persistent rocket fire for nearly two months that caused an exodus from a number of border communities and became part of daily life in its commercial heartland.

The ceasefire agreement called for an indefinite halt to hostilities, the immediate opening of Gaza's blockaded crossings with Israel and Egypt, and a widening of the territory's fishing zone in the Mediterranean.

A senior Hamas official voiced willingness for the security forces of Western-backed Palestinian PresidentMahmoud Abbas and the unity government he formed in June to control the passage points.

Both Israel and Egypt view Hamas as a security threat and are seeking guarantees that weapons will not enter the territory of 1.8 million people.

Under a second stage of the truce that would begin a month later, Israel and the Palestinians would discuss the construction of a Gaza sea port and Israel's release of Hamas prisoners in the occupied West Bank, possibly in a trade for the remains of two Israeli soldiers believed held by Hamas, the officials said.

DESTRUCTION

Thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or damaged, and the United Nations has named a panel to investigate possible war crimes committed by both sides.

The Palestinian Center for Human Rights said 540,000 people had been displaced in the Gaza Strip. Israel has saidHamas bears responsibility for civilian casualties because it operates among non-combatants and uses schools and mosques to store weapons and as launch sites for rockets.

""Today we declare the victory of the resistance, today we declare the victory of Gaza,"" Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said after the truce was announced.

Many of the thousands of rockets fired at Israel were intercepted by the Iron Dome anti-missile system, a partly U.S.-funded project hailed by many Israelis as an example of their nation's high-tech capabilities.

But short-range mortar bombs rained down on farming communities and towns near the Gaza border.

Israel gave a low-key response to the ceasefire, saying it would facilitate the flow of civilian goods and humanitarian and reconstruction aid into the impoverished territory if the truce was honored.

""We have no problem with civilian support for Gaza,"" said Mark Regev, a spokesman for Netanyahu. ""We don’t want to see Hamas rebuild its military machine.""

Nahum Barnea, one of Israel's most popular columnists, expressed concern ""that instead of paving the way to removing the threat from Gaza, we are paving the road to the next round, in Lebanon or in Gaza"".

""The Israelis expected a leader, a statesman who knows what he wants to achieve, someone who makes decisions and engages in a sincere and real dialogue with his public,"" he wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth. ""They received a seasoned spokesperson, and very little beyond that.""

Ben Caspit, writing in the Maariv daily, said there was no victory for Israel in a conflict that resulted in ""a collapsed tourism industry (and) an economy approaching recession"".

But defending Netanyahu, Alex Fishman, Yedioth Ahronoth's military affairs correspondent, wrote: ""It can be said to the credit of the prime minister and the defense minister that they discerned the pointlessness of this confrontation from the first moment, and seized every opportunity for a ceasefire.""

And Housing Minister Uri Ariel, a member of the far-right Jewish Home party in Netanyahu's cabinet, said he did not think the coalition was in any immediate danger of fracturing over the Gaza war.

The United States and United Nations urged both sides to comply with the terms of the agreement.

""We are all aware that this is an opportunity, not a certainty,"" said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.

"http://www.newsweek.com/gmail-blocked-china-after-months-disruptions-295594","Gmail Blocked in China After Months of Disruptions","BEIJING (Reuters) - Google Inc's Gmail was blocked in China after months of disruptions to the world's biggest email service, with an anti-censorship advocate suggesting the Great Firewall was to blame.

Large numbers of Gmail Web addresses were cut off in China on Friday, said GreatFire.org, a China-based freedom of speech advocacy group. Users said the service was still down on Monday.

""I think the government is just trying to further eliminate Google's presence in China and even weaken its market overseas,"" said a member of GreatFire.org, who uses a pseudonym.

Google's own Transparency Report, which shows real-time traffic to Google services, displayed a sharp drop-off in traffic to Gmail from China on Friday.

""We've checked and there's nothing wrong on our end,"" a Singapore-based spokesman for Google said in an email.

In Washington, the U.S. State Department expressed concern over China's actions.

""We encourage China to be transparent in its dealings with international companies and to consider the market signal it sends with such acts,"" State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said.

Almost all of Google's services have been heavily disrupted in China since June this year, but until last week Gmail users could still access emails downloaded via protocols like IMAP, SMTP and POP3. These had let people communicate using Gmail on apps like the Apple iPhone's Mail and Microsoft Outlook.

China maintains tight control over the Internet, nipping in the bud any signs of dissent or challenges to the ruling Communist Party's leadership.

The country is host to the world's most sophisticated internet censorship mechanism, known as the Great Firewall of China. Critics say China has stepped up its disruption of foreign online services like Google over the past year to create an Internet cut off from the rest of the world.

The Google disruption began in the run-up to the 25th anniversary of the government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.

Gmail's setback could make email communication difficult for companies operating in China, said GreatFire.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she did not know anything about Gmail being blocked, adding that the government was committed to providing a good business environment for foreign investors.

""China has consistently had a welcoming and supportive attitude toward foreign investors doing legitimate business here,"" she said. ""We will, as always, provide an open, transparent and good environment for foreign companies in China.""

One popular way to get around China's internet censorship is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which allows unhindered access to blocked sites and services.

""Using a VPN seems to be the only answer to doing anything these days online in China,"" said Zach Smith, a Beijing-based digital products manager at City Weekend magazine.","2014-12-29 15:49:40","1","33.0","2.0","6.0","1.0","18.0","7.0","86.0","51.0","0.0","180.0","12.0","24.0","23","476","98.37","80.54","26.47","53.41","23.80","28.36","72.06","39.08","4.41","1.47","0.21","0.84","0.00","0.42","0.00","2.94","7.98","17.23","5.46","2.52","2.73","0.42","12.82","3.78","2.10","0.63","0.63","1.26","3.99","2.73","1.26","0.00","0.21","0.00","9.24","0.00","0.21","0.42","0.00","7.35","1.26","2.73","0.42","1.68","1.05","0.63","4.41","1.05","2.94","0.42","0.84","0.21","0.42","0.00","0.21","9.87","2.73","1.05","4.20","1.89","0.63","5.25","4.83","0.21","15.97","1.05","9.87","5.04","6.30","0.84","0.00","1.26","0.21","0.00","0.42","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.49","5.04","5.04","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.89","2.52","3.15","0.84","0.00","2421","8.85","24.6","711","466","23","59.33","13.0","10.0","14.33","14.4","124","5.785714285714286","20.763776824034338","274","23.0","9","0.39","0","10","2","45","1","60","37","0","2","3","79","92","0","27","0","0","7","4","12","0","1","4","17","0","13","27","11","13","9","12","2","1","0","0"
"http://www.newsweek.com/columbia-overhauls-sexual-assault-policy-activists-say-its-not-enough-265120","Columbia Overhauls Sexual Assault Policy, But Activists Say It’s Not Enough","Following months of student outcry regarding campus handling of sexual assault, Columbia University has unveiled a new gender-based misconduct policy. Thankfully, it does more than simply canceling a concert.

Included in the new policy are provisions mandating an education program for students found responsible of sexual misconduct, allowing attorneys to represent complainants or respondents during the on-campus reporting process, barring students from serving on sexual violence hearing panels, and outlining the guidelines under which reports of gender-based misconduct can and cannot remain confidential.

These changes are “based on recent guidance from the White House and the U.S. Department of Education,” according to a statement from Robert Hornsby, a vice president for media relations for the school.

But, student activists say, they don’t go far enough—and don’t adequately take their suggestions into account.

“It’s really unbelievable to me that they misled us about when the decision process would be happening [and] went behind our backs,” said Zoe Ridolfi-Starr, senior next year and member of the activist group No Red Tape. “They’re not releasing the data about the sanctioning decisions in the past. They’re refusing to do it even though they said they would. [The new policy] doesn’t indicate to me that they intend to do anything differently.”

Ridolfi-Starr said she was one of about ten involved students who were called into a “secret meeting” on Tuesday, informed that the changes would be announced later in the week, and allowed about half an hour to ask questions about it.

In a statement, No Red Tape, along with four similarly focused student groups, criticized the policy for ignoring students’ input and demands.

“It is clear from both the content of the new policy and the process by which it was developed that this revision was largely an effort to ensure their baseline compliance with the recently enacted Campus SaVE Act and D.O.E. regulations,” the statement says. “This policy does not reflect students’ needs, and changes made are not adequate to ensure student safety.” It goes on to detail what is missing:

For example, this policy does not guarantee accommodations like housing and academic changes for survivors, it does not establish clear or useful sanctioning guidelines, it does not sufficiently improve the training for staff members who interact with survivors, and it leaves the appeals process in the hands of Deans with no expertise, inadequate training, and a clear bias. Students have been raising these concerns and many others for months, yet this policy does nothing to address them.

Suzanne B. Goldberg, a law professor who serves as Special Advisor to President Bollinger on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and helped draft the document, disputed the charge that students input wasn’t taken into account.

“Many of the policies’ provisions were direct responses to student concerns and suggestions raised throughout the last academic year,” Goldberg told Newsweek.

Though she conceded that certain accommodations aren’t “guaranteed” survivors, “if a student needs ongoing assistance during their time at Columbia after having experienced gender-based misconduct, they can get those accommodations as appropriate.” The distinction is more than semantic—it requires a campus authority, or several, to determine what is an “appropriate” accommodation.

Goldberg added, “This policy builds on the strengths of the old policy and provides enhanced protections and processes for the entire community.”","2014-08-17 13:47:49","1","30.0","4.0","6.0","1.0","16.0","6.0","88.0","50.0","0.0","191.0","9.0","24.0","23","565","87.20","55.62","16.77","25.77","25.68","31.50","82.65","45.84","9.03","2.83","0.35","0.35","0.00","0.35","1.77","6.19","7.96","14.16","7.08","2.30","5.49","2.83","12.39","5.31","2.30","1.42","0.71","1.95","2.83","1.42","1.42","0.18","0.53","0.35","8.14","0.00","0.00","0.35","0.00","11.68","2.12","3.01","1.24","1.06","1.59","3.89","2.65","1.06","1.24","0.18","0.88","0.18","0.00","0.71","0.00","12.39","1.59","1.59","8.14","0.71","0.53","3.72","7.61","0.00","10.44","1.59","4.07","4.78","9.73","0.18","0.53","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.23","4.60","5.84","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.06","3.89","1.95","0.00","0.71","2957","9.58","31.88888888888889","913","555","22","45.9","15.9","13.1","15.26","17.4","165","7.4","23.971891891891893","320","28.06","6","0.44","0","26","2","55","0","70","41","3","0","5","90","45","1","52","1","0","25","4","22","0","0","1","14","0","21","18","18","16","15","20","3","5","0","1"
"http://www.newsweek.com/google-accuses-mpaa-over-secretive-anti-piracy-campaign-293436","Google Accuses MPAA Over Secretive Anti-Piracy Campaign","A public row has erupted between Google and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) after a top Google executive accused the group of leading a “coordinated campaign” to attack the internet search giant after leaked documents revealed that Sony and other media companies were attempting to pass anti-piracy measures outside of the conventional legal system.

""We are deeply concerned about recent reports that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) led a secret, coordinated campaign to revive the failed SOPA legislation through other means,"" Kent Walker, Google’s senior VP and general counsel wrote in a blog post on Thursday.

SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act legislation, was aimed at requiring search engines to remove links to piracy sites but the bill never made it through Congress and was eventually shelved in 2012.

Since then, Google has said that media companies like Sony have been attempting to achieve anti-piracy measures through other, non-legitimate means.

“At the beginning of this year, the MPAA and six studios… joined together to begin a new campaign” to determine how it could “secretly revive SOPA”, Walker said.

Citing emails leaked over the past three weeks by the hackers who stole thousands of emails and other data from Sony in one of the worst corporate cyber attacks in history, Google has accused Sony and other members of the MPAA of joining a campaign known as ‘Project Goliath’, as well as lobbying attorneys general to file legal action against the company. The campaign, which is aimed at blocking piracy sites from appearing online, appeared after the failure of SOPA.

""While we of course have serious legal concerns about all of this, one disappointing part of this story is what this all means for the MPAA itself, an organization founded in part 'to promote and defend the First Amendment and artists' right to free expression,” he continued. ""Why, then, is it trying to secretly censor the internet?""

The MPAA hit back at Google, accusing them of aiding a range of criminal activities. “Google’s effort to position itself as a defender of free speech is shameful,” it said in a statement. “Freedom of speech should never be used as a shield for unlawful activities and the internet is not a license to steal. Google’s blog post today is a transparent attempt to deflect focus from its own conduct and to shift attention from legitimate and important ongoing investigations by state attorneys general into the role of Google Search in enabling and facilitating illegal conduct — including illicit drug purchases, human trafficking and fraudulent documents as well as theft of intellectual property. We will seek the assistance of any and all government agencies, whether federal, state or local, to protect the rights of all involved in creative activities”.

The leaked documents also show that Sony aggressively tried to mount legal cases against Google, which it sees as allowing piracy.

According to Walker, the movie studios “budgeted $500,000 a year towards providing legal support”, and the MPAA later sought up to $1.175 million for this campaign according to the hacked email messages obtained by the so-called ‘Guardians of Peace’.","2014-12-19 07:57:08","0","27.0","2.0","6.0","1.0","18.0","7.0","89.0","51.0","0.0","180.0","12.0","24.0","23","532","97.62","63.97","20.14","20.11","33.25","27.44","76.50","42.86","6.02","0.94","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.19","0.19","5.08","8.46","18.05","3.76","2.44","6.39","0.56","8.83","4.89","3.20","1.32","2.07","1.69","4.32","1.88","2.26","0.19","0.56","0.56","5.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.19","8.46","2.07","2.07","0.38","0.94","1.13","2.07","3.01","2.07","0.94","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.19","9.96","2.07","2.63","4.51","0.94","1.50","3.95","4.51","0.75","12.41","1.32","5.64","5.26","6.39","1.88","0.38","1.13","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.00","15.41","3.01","5.26","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.75","3.76","1.32","0.75","0.38","2640","9.25","33.5","826","528","17","39.91","15.4","15.4","13.47","18.6","136","27.0","24.743030303030306","290","29.75","13","0.42","0","19","10","56","0","77","49","1","1","3","72","53","1","39","0","0","13","1","22","0","0","0","21","0","21","21","19","15","5","11","2","2","0","2"
"http://www.newsweek.com/google-reveals-content-governments-asked-remove-latest-transparency-report-294857","Google Reveals Content Governments Asked Be Removed in Latest Transparency Report","Google released on Monday its semiannual transparency report, which for the first time included nearly 30 examples of content that dozens of governments have asked the search engine giant to remove.

Within the United States, Google revealed that the Georgia Department of Corrections asked for a YouTube video depicting inmate abuse be removed, a court requested that articles related to a Tampa pharmacist’s arrest for soliciting sex from a minor be removed and local law enforcement agencies sought the removal of YouTube videos allegedly defaming officers, to name a few. None of the above requests for content removal were granted.

Another example included 20 countries that called for the removal of YouTube video clips from the movie ""Innocence of Muslims.” Google ultimately decided to restrict viewing in Indonesia, India, Jordan, Malaysia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Turkey, and temporarily restrict the videos in Egypt and Libya.

Overall, Google received 3,105 requests from world governments between July 2013 and December 2013 to wipe 14,367 pieces of content. In the previous 6-month allotment, from December 2012 to July 2013, 3,846 requests were made—the highest number since Google began releasing transparency reports in 2010. Overall, 2013 saw a 60 percent increase in takedown requests from 2012.

Google explained that the spike in requests in the first half of 2013 aligns with a burst of requests from Turkey, which later slowed. During the latter half of the year, requests from Italy and Thailand rose. Overall, Russia saw a 25 percent increase in requests in 2013.

Google also revealed that between July 2013 and December 2013, governments mostly requested content be removed from blogs (1,066 requests), searches (841 requests) and YouTube (765 requests). During this period, 38 percent of governments cited defamation as a reason for their request, 16 percent cited obscenity or nudity and 11 percent cited privacy or security.

“Our Transparency Report is certainly not a comprehensive view of censorship online,” Google explained in an accompanying blog post. “However, it does provide a lens on the things that governments and courts ask us to remove, underscoring the importance of transparency around the processes governing such requests.”

"http://www.newsweek.com/greece-rejects-eu-and-imf-demands-tax-rises-and-income-cuts-288849","Greece Rejects EU and IMF Demands for Tax Rises and Income Cuts","Greece has rejected its international lenders' demands for tax rises and income cuts next year, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said on Tuesday, arguing such measures would be disastrous for the country which has emerged from a deep economic recession.

Talks with EU/IMF inspectors have dragged on for weeks without agreement on next year's budget, leaving Athens short of time to wrap up its final bailout review by a Dec. 8 deadline and pave the way for an early exit from the bailout by the end of the year.

""Greece has done a lot already,"" Samaras said during an economic conference.

""As we are negotiating our final review, several conditions have been set including tax rises and income cuts but we have rejected them,"" he said, adding that the government had accepted some other measures instead, without providing details.

A rise in the value-added tax rate for hotels and pension reforms are among the measures which are being discussed with lenders, government officials have said.

The finance ministry acknowledged on Tuesday that lenders had been demanding additional measures in the belief that Greece would fall short of its budget target next year. It said Athens disagreed with the assumption of a shortfall.

If the government's estimates for a balanced 2015 budget were wrong, Greece would take extra measures within the year, Samaras said, adding that political uncertainty was weighing on the negotiations and was the country's biggest problem.

Greece could face early elections next year, depending on the outcome of a separate vote to elect a president. The latest opinion poll by the Pulse agency showed the main opposition, the radical leftist Syriza party, would win with 29.5 percent of the vote if national elections were held now.

Speaking at the same conference earlier on the day, Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras promised that if elected, he would swiftly scrap the country's EU/IMF bailout without waiting for the outcome of talks with lenders.

""We will replace the bailout with (Syriza's) program from the initial days of our government, before and regardless of the outcome of the negotiation,"" Tsipras said.

""This program aimed at healing our wounds and restarting the economy will be implemented irrespective of, and beyond, the process of tough negotiations, which we know won't be easy.""

Syriza's plan to reverse austerity cuts includes hiking the minimum wage and reinstating Christmas pension bonuses.","2014-12-03 10:27:44","1","29.0","2.0","6.0","1.0","18.0","7.0","87.0","51.0","0.0","180.0","12.0","24.0","23","405","96.37","71.50","22.88","34.33","27.00","30.12","80.99","43.70","6.17","2.47","0.00","1.73","0.00","0.49","0.25","3.70","10.37","14.57","7.90","1.48","3.70","0.99","12.84","6.17","1.73","0.74","0.74","2.22","4.20","2.22","1.73","0.25","0.25","0.49","7.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.49","7.90","1.23","0.99","2.72","2.22","0.25","2.47","2.22","0.25","1.98","0.00","1.23","0.49","0.49","0.00","0.25","8.40","1.98","0.99","4.44","1.48","0.49","5.43","5.19","0.99","16.05","1.73","7.65","7.41","7.90","0.74","0.00","5.19","0.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.32","3.70","5.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","1.98","1.98","0.49","0.49","2027","8.73","29.5","604","402","16","54.46","13.1","11.9","13.47","15.9","98","11.75","21.79124378109453","222","26.86","5","0.41","0","11","4","45","0","62","31","1","2","8","79","31","0","31","0","0","8","6","7","1","0","1","3","0","13","21","18","14","9","4","3","0","0","0"
"http://www.newsweek.com/cocaine-usage-way-down-marijuana-picks-slack-231554","Cocaine Usage Way Down, but Marijuana Picks Up the Slack","Americans more than doubled their use of marijuana from 2000 to 2010 and halved their cocaine use over the same period, according to new estimates generated by the RAND Corp. for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. In 2000, much more money was spent on cocaine than marijuana in the U.S., and by 2010, the opposite was true.

RAND estimates about 18 million Americans smoked pot four or more times a month in 2010, 6 million of whom smoked daily or near daily. That’s a huge uptick from 2000, when the report estimates there were 11 million people in the U.S. who smoked pot four or more times a month, 2.5 million of whom smoked daily or near daily.

The report also details interesting changes in how much Americans are paying for drugs: Every year, Americans spent upwards of $100 billion on marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin. Most of that amount is spent by what the report identifies as the “minority of very heavy users,” who get high 21 or more days per month. By comparison, Americans spent a comparatively paltry $21 billion on bars in 2010.

But gathering data on undocumented dollar amounts spent on illegal drugs is extremely difficult. RAND’s numbers acknowledge a significant amount of uncertainty. For example, RAND’s best estimate of marijuana spending in 2010 is $41 billion, but it pegs the possible range of spending at $30 billion to $60 billion. For cocaine (crack and powder) RAND’s best estimate is $28 billion, with a range of $18 billion to $44 billion.

“Since there are many other sources of uncertainty, readers should not consider these as lower or upper bounds or as 95-percent confidence intervals,” the report reads. “The range should be considered plausible, but not extreme.”

RAND estimates 1.5 million Americans were “chronic heroin users” in 2010, meaning they took heroin four or more days in a month. But without data for the years following 2010, the report doesn’t account for the recent uptick in heroin use sweeping parts of the U.S. right now.

The estimates for cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine use are based on data from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring program, which has recently been cut off from federal funding. The report’s authors say the lack of funding for the program will make it “considerably harder” to generate numbers like this in the future.

Correction: An earlier version of this article said the RAND report estimates 18 million Americans used marijuana in 2010. That figure actually corresponds to what the report calls ""chronic users"" who smoked pot four or more times in the past month.

"http://www.newsweek.com/healthcare-workers-fighting-ebola-biggest-battle-staying-healthy-282821","For Health Care Workers Fighting Ebola, the Biggest Battle Is Staying Healthy","For doctors and nurses battling Ebola in West Africa, the anxiety can be exhausting.

Monitoring the health of their patients is a basic requirement of their work. But as the virus has spread through villages and cities, killing 5,000 and infecting over 13,000, another task quickly became critical: monitoring their own health just as carefully.

“You remain anxious all day. You can relax a bit when you get home. Then in the morning it starts again,” Dr. Gino Strada, the founder of Emergency, a Milan, Italy-based international medical organization, tells Newsweek. Strada has been working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone since October.

While the effect of the Ebola outbreak has been devastating to the region’s communities and the economy, health experts are increasingly recognizing that caring for Ebola health workers might be as essential to stopping the disease as any other measure or protocol.

On Friday, a 25-bed hospital built by the U.S. military and staffed by the U.S. Public Health Service will open in Liberia’s capital, Monrovia. Dedicated to the care of health workers, the field hospital is part of an effort to assure those traveling to the region to assist with Ebola patients that they will be cared for if they get infected.

By the end of October, more than 500 health care workers had been diagnosed with Ebola, with almost 300 succumbing to the disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. As many as 5,000 additional health care workers are still needed in the region to effectively fight the disease, according to the World Bank.

Health workers aren’t the only people critical to management of the outbreak, The New York Times pointed out this week. Caregivers and people performing outreach and burials “could be considered equally important,” reporter Sheri Fink writes.

But various factors contribute to the argument that health workers care should be prioritized, according to Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics Director Ruth Faden, including the key role they play in outbreaks and the higher level of risk they face.

“This is a disease that comes along and disproportionately affects health care workers,” says Dr. Josh Mugele, an emergency physician and assistant professor of clinical emergency medicine at Indiana University's School of Medicine, who returned from Monrovia in June.

“You’re killing nurses and you’re killing doctors through this crisis,” says Mugele, who fears what will happen once the outbreak is controlled and international aid organizations leave the region. “You’re going to be left with an even more depleted health care system with even fewer doctors and nurses than the beginning, which will leave routine care even more difficult to do,” he says.

And in the countries where the virus has hit hardest, the stakes are high. There are approximately 98 nurses for every 10,000 patients in the U.S. For the same number of patients in Sierra Leone, there are an estimated two nurses, and in Liberia there are three.

‘A Critical Piece of the Puzzle’

For Rear Admiral Scott Giberson, acting deputy surgeon general in the U.S., the health worker hospital opening in Monrovia Friday is “a critical piece of the puzzle” in the Ebola outbreak response.

The hospital is part of a ramp-up in U.S. commitment six months after Ebola began to emerge in West Africa. In September, President Barack Obama announced the deployment of 3,000 troops to the region to help train health care workers and set up treatment centers. By then, thousands in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone had become infected and more than 2,400 had died. Six weeks later, the number of dead had doubled.

Members of the U.S. Public Health Service, part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), were dispatched to manage and staff the 25-bed hospital. The U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is the only U.S. uniformed service solely focused on health crises and the only one providing direct care to Ebola patients.

The hospital is being built and funded by the Department of Defense, which has about $30 million approved for Ebola response, according to a statement. Sixty-nine staffers from the Commissioned Corps’ 6,800 members have been sent to the region, HHS says.

Kate Migliaccio/U.S Public Health Service

Liberia had 2.8 health care workers for every 10,000 people and 51 medical doctors for a population of 4.29 million before the Ebola outbreak, according to an October Lancet study.

The need for more health care workers is crucial, Giberson says.

“If we ensure that there’s a high-quality facility to come to that will [provide] treatment for Ebola-related care at a level that they would need to feel that confidence and ensure that safety, we hopefully will make sure that Liberian national and international health care workers will come to Liberia to take care of others,” he says.

The Politics of Ebola

In the U.S., the treatment of health care workers returning from West Africa, as well as caring for Ebola patients here, has become as much about politics as it is about health care.

Mugele arrived back in the U.S. in June from Monrovia three months before Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to become infected with Ebola in the U.S., was admitted to a hospital in Dallas. Duncan’s treatment, which resulted in two nurses getting infected, sparked a wave of panic and a scramble over what constituted the best quarantine and infection control procedures.

National Nurses United criticized insufficient training and practice for nurses using personal protective equipment (PPE), while some states issued mandatory quarantines after Craig Spencer, a doctor who worked with Doctors Without Borders treating patients in Guinea, fell ill with the virus after his return to New York. Dr. Kaci Hickox, a Maine nurse who returned to the U.S. after working in Sierra Leone, has fought New Jersey’s strict quarantine rules following her experience in isolation after flying into Newark Liberty International Airport.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has its own guidelines for those returning from the region, which include medical examination, a temperature check and check-ins over 21 days, the limit of Ebola’s incubation period.

Amid debate over mandatory quarantines, treatment protocol and travel bans involving the African region, Obama called American health care workers “heroes” and stressed that the best way to protect Americans from Ebola was to allow the workers to travel to try to stop the outbreak in West Africa.

In Monrovia in June, Mugele was having trouble with training and PPE. Stationed in Monrovia’s John F. Kennedy Hospital, he was helping staff with emergency response preparedness when the first Ebola cases began appearing in the bustling city of 421,000. The hospital was reluctant to take any Ebola patients, and Mugele assisted in treating just one, a man in his 40s.

“It was scary,” he says. “We knew the hospital had purchased some personal protective equipment, and we knew we could kind of get it, but nobody at that point had trained on it, nobody had practiced putting it on or taking it off. We didn’t even know exactly where it was. That was fairly nerve-racking.”

The Liberian doctors Mugele assisted took steps to protect him from getting too close to the infected patient. Later, three of the doctors contracted the disease, and two of them died, he says. There was no time to get tired, but it was “very frightening for everyone involved,” he adds.

With relentlessly high rates of infection from Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, death is a daily reality for the area’s nurses and doctors—and the latest traumatic illness to follow the devastating impact of diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis

“Even before Ebola, they’d just recently lived through a civil war, they’re dealing with horrible, horrible resource depletion on a day-to-day basis,” Mugele says. This is a “traumatic work environment,” he says.

Staff Shortages in Sierra Leone

In countries with already depleted health care systems, and with health care workers on the front lines of dealing with a deadly infectious disease, staffing treatment centers and caring for those staff members are key.

“Because of the escalation of the Ebola crisis, the health care workers are either employed, sick with Ebola or have died from Ebola,” Eric Talbert, executive director of Emergency USA, the U.S.-based arm of the Emergency nonprofit, told Newsweek. “We are running out of being able to hire anybody locally.”

In September, Emergency, which works primarily in war zones, opened a 22-bed Ebola treatment center in Lakka, near Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. That center filled up quickly, Talbert says. Five survivors have since left.

Eric Talbert/EMERGENCY USA

Construction on a new 100-bed center has started, and Talbert predicts it will be completed by November 27, with a cost of around $1 million a month to operate.

“The challenge with that is staffing,” says Talbert. “That’s going to fill up quickly too, but not within two or three weeks, hopefully.”

While Liberia has suffered the highest human loss from the virus, with 4,665 cases and 2,705 deaths, Sierra Leone and Guinea also have infection numbers in the thousands.

At least 25 doctors and 100 nurses are needed for the new center in the Freetown neighborhood of Goderich, and Emergency says it will have to rely on international doctors and nurses to travel to Sierra Leone to provide care. Talbert says Emergency USA is hiring 60 nurses and seven doctors from outside Sierra Leone for paid positions for two to three-month missions.

Strada, a surgeon, hopes treatment for civilians and health care workers at the new center can start in early December. He has put his surgeries on hold to treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone.

Like Mugele, Strada worries about the effect of the crisis on Sierra Leone’s health care system. He says the Ebola outbreak has forced many of Sierra Leone’s hospitals to be abandoned in recent months because of the high rates of health care worker infections and staffers’ refusal to resume work before being adequately trained and protected.

Doctors Without Borders has had to stop work at a maternal and pediatric health center near Bo, Sierra Leone, due to the risk of health care workers and patients becoming infected.

The French medical aid organization has suffered its own losses: 23 staffers have been infected with Ebola, and 13 have died.

This week, Obama spoke with staff members at the Monrovia Medical Unit, commending them for their work, and on Wednesday he asked Congress for nearly $6.2 million in new emergency funding to help fight the disease in West Africa, and the United States.

For now, doctors and nurses in the region have to put their anxieties aside, despite often having to work “in a makeshift setting” and facing limited resources and searing heat, Mugele says.

“You’re not going through the rigor of what you’d go through in an American hospital,” he adds. “So you just do the best you can.”","2014-11-07 05:15:30","0","64.0","9.0","6.0","1.0","20.0","16.0","113.0","50.0","0.0","229.0","15.0","24.0","23","1848","95.99","70.59","16.93","32.26","24.97","24.95","78.30","42.37","5.68","2.54","0.00","0.38","0.60","0.87","0.70","3.14","7.90","16.18","6.44","2.44","5.03","0.49","12.99","4.38","2.54","0.92","3.79","1.73","5.14","2.71","2.33","0.70","0.81","0.43","6.22","0.05","0.05","0.11","0.87","5.52","1.03","1.19","0.70","1.46","0.60","1.30","1.19","0.05","0.97","0.11","6.55","0.16","6.39","0.05","0.00","8.77","0.87","2.65","4.87","0.87","1.24","3.25","8.60","1.03","14.50","1.57","8.17","4.98","5.57","0.38","0.32","0.38","0.00","0.70","0.11","0.00","0.05","0.00","0.05","0.00","17.86","5.74","6.98","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.81","2.22","1.30","0.32","0.38","8928","7.79","26.957142857142856","2706","1819","91","59.64","11.8","9.9","12.53","12.8","364","5.3125","18.0043980208906","720","23.77","42","0.42","0","70","66","169","0","246","94","6","6","19","269","286","5","121","1","0","49","11","57","2","0","6","58","0","59","56","60","54","37","58","6","7","0","4"
"http://www.newsweek.com/holocaust-survivor-hedy-epstein-arrested-ferguson-protest-says-racism-alive-265703","Holocaust Survivor Hedy Epstein, Arrested in Ferguson Protest, Says Racism Is Alive in America","Hedy Epstein turned 90 on August 15, and she spent much of last week celebrating. Friends and family traveled to her home in St. Louis, Missouri, to join in the festivities—so many of them, in fact, that it wasn’t until yesterday that she finally had a day to herself. Epstein left her home in the afternoon, accidentally leaving her cell phone behind. By around 4:30pm, she’d been arrested.

A human rights activist and Holocaust survivor, Epstein had been following the unrest in nearby Ferguson, where an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, was shot and killed by police on August 9. Ever since, tensions have escalated. Protesters have taken to the streets for nine consecutive nights. Reporters have been arrested and threatened. There have been scattered reports of gunshots, looting and fires, plus countless photos and videos showing an over-militarized police force firing rubber bullets and tear gas into the crowds.

On Monday, Epstein decided to do something about it.

She knew about a gathering in downtown St. Louis to protest Missouri Governor Jay Nixon’s decision to activate the National Guard. As she and her fellow protesters peacefully marched towards the Wainwright Building, where Nixon keeps an office, they chanted “Hey, hey! Ho, ho! National Guard has got to go!” and “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” according to The Nation. Some people gave speeches. Others held signs. Epstein says she and her fellow protesters aimed to walk into Nixon’s office and formally ask him to de-escalate the situation in Ferguson. But police and security officers blocked the door, preventing them from entering.

“I really didn’t think about being arrested or doing anything like that,” Epstein told Newsweek. “I was just going to be somebody in the crowd. I guess maybe I was impulsive: Someone said, ‘Who is willing to be arrested if that happens?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’m willing.’”

A police officer informed the crowd that Nixon and his staff were not in the building, Epstein says, and urged them to leave. When she and eight other protesters refused, they were arrested for failure to disperse. Police handcuffed Epstein behind her back and took her to a nearby police substation. She was booked, given a court date of October 21, and then told she could leave.

“I’m deeply, deeply troubled by what’s going on in Ferguson,” says Epstein. “It’s a matter of racism and injustice, and it’s not only in Ferguson…. Racism is alive and well in the United States. The power structure looks at anyone who’s different as the other, as less worthy, and so you treat the other as someone who is less human and who needs to be controlled and who is not trusted.”

Epstein knows about injustice.

Born in Freiburg, Germany, in 1924, she was just eight years old when Adolf Hitler rose to power. Her father ran a dry-goods business and her mother was a housewife; her family was Jewish, and so she grew up witnessing anti-Semitism, boycotts and her family’s fears for their own safety. When Epstein was 14 years old, her parents put her on a Kindertransport ship to England, the British rescue operation that saved 10,000 children from the Nazis. She never saw her parents or relatives again. They likely perished in Auschwitz.

“I’m Jewish and I was born in Germany, so I think I can understand what it feels like to be African American in this country,” Epstein says. “I was a child living under the Nazi regime and I lived in a village so everybody knew who I was and that I was Jewish. I remember feeling uncomfortable walking down the street, seeing people cross to the other side of the street, or seeing a Nazi I didn’t want to pass by.”

In the aftermath of the war, Epstein worked as a research analyst for U.S. prosecutors during the Nuremberg Medical Trial. In May 1948, she arrived in New York City and immediately started working at the New York Association for New Americans, an agency that brought Holocaust survivors to the U.S. On the first day of her job, an African American woman showed her the ropes at the office and explained that she could take an hour for lunch each day. Epstein’s new colleague offered her a list of lunch spots in the neighborhood.

“I said, ‘Could we go together?’” Epstein recalls. “She said no, but I didn’t think anything of it. I was asking her one minute before lunch, so I said, ‘Maybe tomorrow?’ She said no! I wasn’t sure what that meant. A few days later, I asked her again and she said no. I was beginning to feel uncomfortable. I said, ‘Is there something about me that troubles you? Is that why you don’t want to have lunch with me?’ She said, ‘You know why.’ And I said, ‘No, I don’t.’”

After the woman explained why they couldn’t eat at the same restaurant, Epstein remembers thinking, “Wait a minute. Lincoln freed the slaves. This is 1948. You can’t go to eat where I go? Isn’t someone doing something about this?”

Epstein hasn’t stopped fighting for justice and civil rights ever since. She has fought for abortion rights, anti-war efforts and fair housing. She is also an active supporter of the Free Gaza Movement and has traveled to the West Bank five times. In 2004, she says she was detained at an airport in Tel Aviv, where she was strip-searched and internally searched. A couple of years later, during a peaceful demonstration in the community of Biilin, near Ramallah, she was tear gassed. Sound bombs went off next to her, and she lost some of her hearing.

“The basis of who I am today was what my parents taught me and what I saw. They were examples to me of how one lives and how one does not persecute other people,” says Epstein. “I would like to think that they’re proud of me.”

Since her arrest yesterday, she has received countless emails and phone calls. “I usually go to bed around 11:00 but last night I was still on the phone and still answering emails. I got to bed sometime after midnight. At 6:20 this morning, the first phone call came in.”

“I’m a bit concerned that I’m the focus of what happened, but the focus should be the violence in the streets and the violence by the police,” she says. As she told The Nation while being escorted to the police van, “I’ve been doing this since I was a teenager. I didn’t think I would have to do it when I was 90. We need to stand up today so that people won’t have to do this when they’re 90.”","2014-08-19 15:17:12","0","35.0","4.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","91.0","48.0","0.0","188.0","6.0","24.0","23","1161","61.39","73.24","39.90","24.40","14.16","20.07","83.12","52.20","15.07","9.99","4.05","0.17","0.43","4.57","0.78","5.08","6.72","13.52","8.53","4.39","6.72","1.98","18.26","2.93","1.55","2.33","2.58","0.95","3.27","1.46","1.55","0.43","0.69","0.17","14.21","0.69","0.52","4.74","0.43","8.87","2.15","1.12","1.03","1.89","0.52","2.58","3.88","1.29","2.15","0.43","1.29","0.09","0.60","0.09","0.60","6.98","1.55","1.03","3.10","0.69","0.95","8.35","8.01","0.60","16.28","2.33","7.15","6.89","2.76","0.86","0.86","0.34","0.26","0.60","0.52","0.00","0.17","0.09","0.09","0.00","22.22","6.55","6.46","0.34","0.09","0.60","0.52","0.60","3.36","3.27","0.17","0.26","5111","6.94","18.03030303030303","1570","1146","82","74.19","9.2","6.4","9.5","7.8","189","7.416666666666666","14.196858638743457","542","16.14","49","0.51","1","53","29","91","1","126","67","3","1","7","137","117","3","54","0","0","105","18","47","0","0","5","36","1","37","92","31","30","37","31","3","13","0","14"
"http://www.newsweek.com/housing-comes-back-single-family-starts-rise-285490","Housing Comes Back as Single-Family Starts Rise","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Starts for U.S. single-family homes rose for a second straight month in October and building permits neared a 6-1/2-year high, suggesting the housing market was still on a recovery path.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday groundbreaking for single-family homes, which account for more than two-thirds of the market, increased 4.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted 696,000-unit annual pace, the highest since last November.

At the same time, permits for single- and multi-family housing jumped 4.8 percent to a 1.08 million-unit pace, the highest since June 2008. It also was the second straight monthly gain.

""Housing activity continues to recover, although the pace of the recovery remains slower than in the previous couple of years, owing to the decline in housing affordability,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at Barclays in New York.

A 15.4 percent plunge in starts for the volatile multi-family homes portion of the market, however, caused overall groundbreaking to fall 2.8 percent to a 1.009 million-unit pace.

Housing remains constrained by sluggish wage growth and still-stringent lending practices, but the housing starts data bolstered views that home building would contribute to economic growth this quarter after being neutral in the third quarter.

With the labor market gradually tightening, wages should accelerate and support further housing gains. Declining mortgage rates, which have seen the fixed 30-year rate hit a 17-month low, should also provide a boost.

"http://www.newsweek.com/are-revenge-porn-laws-going-too-far-268292","Are Revenge Porn Laws Going Too Far?","If you have spent any time on the internet in the past few days you have probably heard that over the weekend, anonymous hackers leaked stolen images of over 100 female celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Kirsten Dunst. While some commentators are shaming women for snapping explicit photographs of themselves, having simple passwords and/or trusting a flawed technological infrastructure, others are more focused on the perpetrators of the crime.

As smartphones increasingly become a staple in our digital lives, their use during intimate moments will only become more prevalent. According to a new Pew study, 20 percent of users reported having received a nude photograph. If the other factors at play here, like the fascination with the female body and the existence of savvy hackers remain constant (and why wouldn’t they?), it’s safe to assume more leaks are on the way. So what is being done to stop this from happening? One emphasis is on prosecution.

According to the Daily Mail, the chief hacker who orchestrated the current cyberattack is on the run. The FBI confirmed late Monday that they have begun an investigation, and history suggests that if the perpetrators are located, they will be prosecuted.

In 2011, the FBI arrested a Florida man named Christopher Chaney for hacking the email accounts of 50 celebrities, including Scarlett Johansson, and posting the nude images he discovered online. Chaney was charged with 26 counts of identity theft, unauthorized access to a protected computer and wiretapping, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

But the legal tools available at that time did not help all victims of what is sometimes called “revenge porn.”

In “Criminalizing Revenge Porn,” Danielle Keats Citron and Mary Anne Franks share a story of “Jane,” a woman who allowed her boyfriend to take a nude photograph of her, assuring her that it would remain private. After the couple’s split, Jane’s ex-boyfriend posted the image and her contact information on a popular “revenge porn” website. After being messaged by strangers, many of whom were soliciting sex, she realized what had happened and contacted the police. Officers informed Jane that the details of her case rendered them unable to help. Since it was an isolated incident, her ex- could not be found guilty under that state’s criminal harassment law and because he took the image with her consent, it was legally obtained and belonged to him.

Situations like this led 11 states to enact new laws aimed at better tackling revenge porn. But opinion is split, and not along the typical ideological fault line, as to whether such legislation will impinge on First Amendment rights.

See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows

Privacy advocates suggest these laws represent a step toward properly protecting the public and that some free speech sacrifices are necessary collateral damage. But free speech advocates argue existing laws are sufficient and the potential First Amendment infringements outweigh the privacy gains.

In 2013, California decided that taking an intimate and confidential picture or video and distributing it with the intention of causing serious emotional distress to the victim is “disorderly conduct.” In reaction, Lee Rowland of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project told NPR “the reality is that revenge porn laws tend to criminalize the sharing of nude images that people lawfully own.… That treads on very thin ice constitutionally.”

Privacy advocates, however, criticized the law for failing to cover a large portion of the population—those who have taken pictures of themselves, but had them disseminated without their consent. California updated its law last week to include selfies.

As these state laws broaden in scope, and an anti-revenge porn bill awaits introduction on the national level, critics worry that the definition of revenge porn will become increasingly unclear. Is a Facebook user who stumbles upon the images and posts them on his wall guilty? Lawrence’s reps hope so, saying in a statement, ""The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.""","2014-09-03 15:47:16","1","29.0","4.0","6.0","1.0","16.0","6.0","101.0","50.0","0.0","188.0","9.0","24.0","23","674","90.04","75.73","8.88","8.21","24.07","28.93","78.04","44.81","9.20","3.71","0.00","0.15","0.30","1.78","1.48","5.49","9.05","12.76","7.12","1.34","5.93","0.74","11.57","4.90","1.78","1.63","1.63","1.63","5.04","1.78","3.26","0.59","1.48","0.30","10.09","0.00","0.45","1.78","0.89","8.75","1.78","1.48","1.04","2.37","0.74","2.82","3.26","2.37","0.89","0.00","2.08","0.74","0.15","1.78","0.00","8.61","1.34","1.48","4.90","1.34","1.04","4.30","5.49","1.04","11.13","1.04","5.49","4.75","3.26","1.19","0.00","0.89","0.30","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.09","4.15","5.49","0.00","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.45","2.08","1.04","0.30","0.15","3419","9.12","26.23076923076923","1052","671","30","48.74","13.7","12.0","13.58","14.6","186","12.875","22.047928464977645","398","23.73","4","0.44","0","28","9","75","0","85","60","2","1","7","108","52","0","47","0","0","19","12","16","2","0","0","15","0","16","27","24","25","23","18","1","9","0","1"
"http://www.newsweek.com/how-put-end-lgbt-discrimination-behind-bars-294492","How To Put an End to LGBT Discrimination Behind Bars","Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or LGBT, youth continue to be significantly over-represented in the nation’s juvenile justice system, even as overall rates of youth incarceration are on the decline.

It is estimated that 300,000 LGBT youth are arrested and/or detained each year, more than 60 percent of whom are black or Latino. While LGBT youth represent just 5 percent to 7 percent of the nation’s overall youth population, they comprise 13 percent to 15 percent of those currently in the juvenile justice system.

These high rates of contact with the juvenile justice system are partly due to the compounding of challenges faced by LGBT youth, including family rejection, homelessness, bullying and harassment, biased school discipline policies and failed safety net programs.

Through both policy and practice, the Obama administration has made unprecedented strides to address these drivers of incarceration. Yet far less attention has been paid to the unjust experiences and poor conditions that LGBT youth encounter within the system, and much more needs to be done to ensure that these youth are treated fairly, feel safe in their surroundings and have equal access to all available services.

Fortunately, a blueprint for supporting LGBT youth under the supervision of the juvenile justice system already exists. Over the past few years, several states and jurisdictions have enacted comprehensive non-discrimination policies that serve as a model for how to treat LGBT youth with dignity and respect. This brief reviews these policies and finds that each contains similar themes and provisions, which, when taken together, reflect best practice guidelines that have long been promoted by experts in the field.

It is important to note that these policies are working for the few individuals who fall under their purview, but the current patchwork of practices around the country still leaves most LGBT youth within the system vulnerable and without recourse. The federal government can and should bridge this gap.

To do so, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the U.S. Department of Justice should facilitate widespread adoption of LGBT-supportive juvenile justice policies and procedures and should advise all jurisdictions to include practice guidelines regarding the following:

This brief lifts up what works for LGBT youth by outlining the critical components of model juvenile justice policies that are already being implemented around the country and offers sample language that all jurisdictions can adopt.

LGBT youth experience high rates of discrimination and abuse

LGBT youth across the country face significant bias, harassment and unfair treatment throughout the course of their delinquency cases and are confronted with a range of issues within the juvenile justice system. These include unsafe detention settings, inadequate medical and mental health resources and blatant disrespect and disregard for their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.

Eighty percent of juvenile justice professionals who responded to an Equity Project survey indicated that a lack of safety in detention was a serious issue for LGBT youth, and more than half of detention workers surveyed reported having personal knowledge of situations where LGBT youth were mistreated because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

For example, LGBT youth are often singled out and punished for engaging in the same, consensual, age-appropriate behaviors as their heterosexual peers, such as hugging and kissing; reprimanded and banned from dressing or presenting in a manner consistent with their gender identity; and denied access to adequate sexual and mental health care services.

What’s more, even well-meaning juvenile justice professionals lack an understanding of the unique challenges LGBT youth face, as well as the training and resources to support them. This limits their ability to fulfill their professional and ethical responsibility to foster safe and supportive environments for these youth.

Model policies exist and are working

Fortunately, more than a dozen states and jurisdictions around the country are actively addressing the disproportionate representation and discriminatory treatment of LGBT youth in the juvenile justice system. These programs and policies work against the systemic inequities that undermine fair and just treatment of these youth and derail their transition back into their communities.

It is important to note that while some LGBT juvenile justice policies are facility specific and apply only to youth in secure confinement, the best policies will apply across social service and juvenile justice agencies and protect any youth in the juvenile justice system, meaning any youth under any type of supervision of the state, whether that is in nonsecure, out-of-home placement; pre-adjudication or post-adjudication secure confinement; or at home and on probation.

Based on the authors’ review, the following states and jurisdictions have at least one type of written policy that applies to LGBT youth in the juvenile justice system: California; Cook County, Illinois; Hawaii; Louisiana; Washington, D.C.; Massachusetts; Michigan; New Jersey; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York City, New York; Ohio; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

While there are variances across policies, each contains similar key elements that reflect the best thinking and practices from experts in the field. In fact, these policies include many of the recommendations from two exemplary sources.

The first is the Model Non-Discriminatory Services Policy from “Hidden Injustice,” an in-depth report about the experiences of LGBT youth in the juvenile justice system.

The second, “A Roadmap for Change,” is one of the first comprehensive publications to offer federal policy recommendations to address the myriad criminal justice issues that impact LGBT people and people living with HIV, or PLWH, including LGBT youth.

Taken together, these existing policies form the blueprint for supporting LGBT youth and serve as a real-time case study in what works. Each of the critical components of a model juvenile justice policy is outlined below, and sample language has been pulled directly from the text of the various jurisdictional policies and statutes noted above.

Nondiscrimination provisions

A strong and comprehensive non-discrimination clause—one that mandates that staff maintain and promote a facility that provides the highest quality of services to youth regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity—must be the foundation of all juvenile justice policies. Yet only 10 states currently protect youth on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity.

Policies should underscore the responsibility of staff to model fair, respectful and nonjudgmental behaviors and to protect LGBT youth from discrimination and harassment—physical, verbal, sexual, or otherwise—by their peers.

Additionally, clothing, grooming, and gender presentation are often defining characteristics for all adolescents, including LGBT youth who may be gender nonconforming. Staff should respect LGBT youth’s self-expression and allow them to dress and present themselves in a manner consistent with their gender identity and/or expression.

Similarly, grooming rules and restrictions regarding hair, makeup, shaving, etc. should be the same across male and female facilities and all youth should be held to the same dress code standards.

The following are a sample of nondiscrimination provisions that are inclusive of LGBT youth:

Nondiscrimination provisions

Employees, volunteers, and contract providers that offer services under the supervision of [name of the system] shall not discriminate against or harass, physically or verbally, any youth in their care because the youth is LGBT or because the employee perceives a youth to be LGBT.

Staff shall work to meet the diverse needs of youth in care and shall provide a safe, healthy, and accepting environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity.

Staff shall provide LGBT youth with access to educational, rehabilitative, recreational, and other programming on the same basis as other residents.

Staff shall provide fair and equal treatment to all youth in care and custody and shall protect youth from harassment and discrimination.

Gender presentation

Youth should not be required to maintain hairstyles or to dress in keeping with a style perceived to be appropriate for one gender or the other.

All youth should be permitted personal freedom in personal grooming as long as their appearance does not conflict with the facility’s requirements for safety, identification, and hygiene.

Transgender and gender nonconforming youth may possess items necessary to present their gender identity consistent with safety and security procedures, including binders, packers, girdles, breast inserts, bras, and other items as requested.

Screening and intake

The intake process presents an initial opportunity for staff to identify the unique needs of LGBT youth and concerns the youth might have about their safety. Policies and procedures should foster safe and supportive environments where LGBT youth feel comfortable disclosing their sexual orientation and gender identity at their own pace.

Staff should be aware of the stages of development of a youth’s sexual orientation and gender identity and not assume that a youth is LGBT unless the young person voluntarily identifies as such.

At intake, interviewers must take care to sensitively inquire without judgment about any fears that youth may have of being harassed or ostracized in the facility or placement. Youth may voluntarily disclose their sexual orientation and/or gender identity when and if they feel ready and when and if a safe environment and trusting relationship has been established, but no youth should be compelled to disclose.

Sample screening and intake provisions include:

Some youth will disclose that they are LGBT. If a youth discloses their sexual orientation or gender identity, the intake worker should talk with the youth about it in an open and nonjudgmental fashion and determine if the youth has particular concerns or needs related to being LGBT.

Upon conducting an intake of a youth, staff shall ask the youth how they identify by gender, and the youth shall receive placement and services, as appropriate, in accordance with their gender identity.

Classification and housing placement

As a general rule, LGBT youth should be classified and housed in accordance with their gender identity. This includes placement in sex-segregated rooms that reflect their gender identity, as well as access to appropriate gender-specific facilities, such as showers and restrooms. Youth should not be isolated as a means of keeping them safe nor prohibited from having a roommate based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation.

However, decisions on placement should be individualized based on a youth’s physical and emotional well-being and their own perspective about where they will be most secure.

Sample classification and placement provisions include:

Limits on isolation and segregation of LGBT youth

In accordance with the guidelines of the Prison Rape Elimination Act, or PREA, LGBT youth shall not be placed in isolation or segregation as a means of keeping them safe from discrimination, harassment, or abuse except under court order or for medical reasons.

Any youth who report feeling safer sleeping in individual quarters shall be allowed to do so when available at that placement. No youth shall be forced into individual sleeping quarters.

Placement decisions based on gender identity

Youth who identify as transgender should be placed in a location consistent with the stated gender identity, absent a safety-based objection.

LGBT youth should not be placed in particular housing, bed, or other assignments solely on the basis of such status nor should being LGBT be considered an indicator of likelihood of being sexually abusive.

Classification decisions based on individualized assessment

In order to make decisions for specific residents, a multidisciplinary team of trained, experienced professionals from diverse disciplines should be convened to provide a comprehensive assessment within 48 hours of the resident’s arrival.

Placement decisions for youth, especially transgender youth, should be reassessed at least monthly to review any threats to safety experienced by the youth.

Confidentiality

As noted above, LGBT youth will disclose their sexuality and gender identity at their own discretion. Staff should never disclose this information to any outside parties, including health care or social service providers or a youth’s family and friends, without explicit consent of the young person, unless otherwise required by the law. Even when personnel are compelled to share youth’s confidential information, they should first notify youth that this information will be shared and why.

Privacy and safety of transgender youth

Simply put, all youth have a right to privacy, and no one should be subject to physical exposure in any setting that would invade their privacy, render them vulnerable to abuse, and/or humiliate or degrade them.

Sample privacy and safety provisions include:

Transgender youth should be provided with safety and privacy when using the shower and bathroom and when dressing and undressing. Transgender youth should not be required to shower or dress in front of other youth and should be permitted to use a single occupancy bathroom and shower if available.

Staff shall not physically search youth in any manner that is humiliating or degrading or for the purpose of determining the youth’s physical anatomy. Transgender youth may request that either a male or female staff member conduct a strip search when such searches are required.

Respectful communication

Communication with youth is an essential function of any adult working in the juvenile justice system. It is imperative that juvenile justice professionals use appropriate, welcoming language in their communication with all youth. Such communication is particularly important for establishing trust with LGBT youth, who may shut down when they see red flags—such as presumptions that the youth is heterosexual or indications of what they perceive to be homophobia—and may censor what and how they communicate based on their feelings of safety.

Sample communication provisions of any juvenile justice policy include:

No demeaning language

Staff must use respectful language and terminology and must not use terms that convey prejudice or discrimination toward LGBT youth.

Staff must promptly and consistently intervene to stop other youth from using terms that convey prejudice or discrimination toward LGBT youth.

Staff must not imply or tell LGBT youth that they are abnormal, deviant, or sinful or that they can or should change their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Preferred name and pronoun use

Youth’s chosen names and pronouns that reflect their gender identity must be used and respected, even if their name has not been legally changed.

A request by youth to use gender-neutral pronouns should be honored as well.

Youth may indicate whether they want their chosen names to be used in writing and whether they want them shared with anyone else.

Access to LGBT supports

In addition, facilities should provide access to supportive age-appropriate materials, such as LGBT-inclusive magazines and books, and allow access to advocacy groups that provide information to youth about LGBT issues.

Sample presentation access provisions include:

LGBT literature and other visible signs should be available in the common areas, office, etc. that indicate staff are knowledgeable and open to communication on these topics.

Libraries shall include LGBT-affirming books, magazines, and other materials, and all youth should be made aware of these resources and have access to them.

Medical and mental health services and treatment

Youth under supervision of the state, particularly youth in confinement, must receive, at a minimum, constitutionally adequate health care. Denying appropriate treatment to transgender youth so they can live in line with their gender identity poses serious risk of negative health and social consequences, including depression and suicide attempts. Both the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association have adopted public statements recognizing the necessity for transition-related medical care and have called for improved access to these treatments. In addition, these and other reputable health organizations have adopted statements regarding the need for transgender-specific care in institutional settings. All juvenile justice professionals play an important role in ensuring that youth in the custody or under supervision of the court have access to adequate medical and mental health care.

Transgender youth who receive appropriate medical care have more-positive outcomes. For example, in one case study, “an attorney achieved a groundbreaking victory for her 15-year-old transgender client” when a court-ordered assessment resulted in a successful argument for her client to receive transition-related health care treatment. The attorney stated:

[The order] has been pivotal for [her] client’s development and well-being. It has allowed her to receive the standard transition-related medical and mental health treatment she needs, and it has given her hope that the courts and foster care system are capable of affirming and respecting her identity.’

In addition to particular medical care for transgender youth, it is also important to note that LGBT youth may suffer psychological abuse through inappropriate treatment and/or services, such as so-called “conversion” therapy. Also known as “reparative” therapy or “sexual-orientation change efforts,” conversion therapy is a dangerous practice that attempts to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity—literally to convert an individual from gay to straight. Conversion therapy has been discredited and highly criticized by virtually all major American medical, psychiatric, psychological, and professional counseling organizations.In addition to being ineffective, conversion therapy has been found to actually cause harm. People who have undergone conversion therapy have reported increased anxiety, depression, and in some cases, thoughts of suicide.It is important to note that even if not officially called reparative or conversion therapy, there may be other counseling efforts aimed at changing a young person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Whether these efforts come from a licensed therapist, a school counselor, a priest or minister, or some other advocate, they are still just as harmful and should be prohibited.

Although ill equipped to do so, the juvenile justice system has become a de facto mental health provider for many youth. While not all LGBT youth require mental health services, for those who do, it is critical to have providers competent in working with LGBT youth.

Sample health-care-related provisions of any juvenile justice policy include:

Specific medical and mental health care needs of transgender youth

If a transgender youth has been receiving hormone treatment prior to juvenile justice system involvement, they should continue to be provided with access to that care.

If a transgender youth requests assessment or treatment, the agency should provide access to medical and mental health care providers who are knowledgeable about the health care needs of transgender youth.

Counseling should not try to change LGBT identity

Agencies shall not employ or contract with mental health providers who attempt to change a youth’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression

If they request counseling, LGBT youth must be offered counseling by nonjudgmental individuals who are knowledgeable about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Sex-offender treatment

If LGBT youth require sex-offender treatment—only if court ordered and they have been adjudicated delinquent of a sex offense—such treatment must not discriminate based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression and should not criminalize or pathologize LGBT identity.

Provide appropriate medical and mental health care

Mental health providers should offer appropriate counseling and information to support LGBT youth related to any questions about their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, if needed. However, they should not assume that LGBT youth who present mental health issues are struggling with their identity or that their identity is the sole cause for their concerns.

Medical providers should provide appropriate medical information and health services education for all youth that is inclusive of issues pertinent to LGBT youth.

Staff training and policy dissemination

While the creation and implementation of enforceable written policies is imperative, policy development alone is not enough. Juvenile justice professionals need training to serve LGBT youth in a culturally and linguistically competent manner. Without nondiscrimination policies and training, even the most well-meaning juvenile justice professionals are often ill equipped to provide competent and equitable services to LGBT youth.

When facilitating interviews about lessons learned in the Equity Project model sites, where hundreds of juvenile justice professionals have been trained over the past three years, there was a strong sentiment from participants that training is key and must be continuous. Participants in those model sites stated that in order for training to be effective, it must be ongoing due to high turnover rates. Training also must be mandated within an agency’s written policy.

Notably, many of the jurisdictions with inclusive nondiscrimination policies on the books have assigned dedicated staff to serve as LGBT liaisons who aid in the ongoing training, dissemination, and implementation of these policies—from Massachusetts’ regional directors to Cook County, Illinois’, multidisciplinary team.

Sample staff training policy provisions include:

Training

All agency employees, volunteers, and contractors must be trained on ensuring dignity, respect, and fairness for LGBT youth in their care. These trainings may include, but are not limited to:

- How to create and maintain a safe and accepting environment

- How to work with LGBT youth in a respectful and nondiscriminatory manner

- How to communicate effectively and professionally with LGBT youth

- How to draft and implement effective grievance procedures for youth to report discrimination or harassment based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression

- The content of any policy put forth at the facility

Policy dissemination

All agency employees must receive a copy of the policy with any orientation materials and acknowledge receipt and understanding of this policy with their signature and the date.

Youth education and policy dissemination

In addition to staff training, youth should be apprised of all of their rights when entering the juvenile justice system. This includes education about the system’s nondiscrimination policies and practices and information on how to file complaints.

Sample youth education and policy provisions include:

Youth must be told that an agency will provide an inclusive organizational culture where all youth are respected and safe. Youth must be told that name-calling and other harassment, based on any characteristics, will not be accepted

Youth should be informed of all of their rights and responsibilities under the agency policy.

Youth should be informed of the procedures for reporting complaints.

Enforcement

A policy is only effective if there are mechanisms in place to ensure that it is enforced consistently. Each juvenile justice policy should outline disciplinary actions for those who violate the policy with specific accountability provisions for staff. A clear grievance process through which LGBT youth can report and seek recourse for incidents of bias, harassment, and abuse must also be included.

Sample enforcement provisions include:

Discrimination against or harassment of youth by staff, volunteers, contractors, or other youth on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression shall not be tolerated.

Supervisors and managers shall promptly address and investigate any reported incident of alleged discrimination and/or harassment.

Conclusion

These policy guidelines reflect the best practices already in place around the country. All jurisdictions should adopt similar measures to ensure that LGBT youth under the supervision of the juvenile justice system are treated fairly, are free from harm, and receive the supportive treatment and services they deserve.

"http://www.newsweek.com/hustlers-con-men-dupes-cashing-war-terror-278503","Hustlers, Con Men & Dupes Cashing in on the War on Terror","At long last we can retire Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as the icons of investigative reporting. With his second book probing the dark tunnels of the so-called war on terror, James Risen has established himself as the finest national security reporter of this generation, a field crowded with first-rank talent at The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Reuters, McClatchy Newspapers and the New York Times, his employer and sometimes bane.

Bane, because in 2004, the executive editor of the Times, cowed by Bush administration officials, twice spiked Risen’s story revealing that the National Security Agency had launched a massive, covert wiretapping program that was riffling through the personal communications of hundreds of millions of Americans without even a secret court order. Unbowed, Risen got a contract for a book that would reveal the NSA’s extralegal program. Only when the publication of State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration appeared imminent did his editors, cornered, allow Risen to publish a version of it (co-authored with his colleague Eric Lichtblau) in the paper. And that disturbing saga provides the backdrop to Risen’s new book, Pay Any Price: Greed, Power and Endless War.

After turning the last page of his latest volume, one might wonder what other important stories the Times has spiked in recent years. Although parts of Risen’s new revelations have been published in the Times or elsewhere, here they are fleshed out in richly reported chapters studded with eye-popping new charges. Read together, they offer an original and deeply disturbing perspective on the war on terror. It is, Risen writes, a story of “how greed and the hunt for cash have all too often become the main objects of the war on terror.”

In fine detail, he demonstrates how the courts, Congress and the national security and law enforcement agencies of the executive branches – aided and abetted by the high priests of the media – have been corrupted in the hugely profitable business of pursuing terrorists. “[T]he search for money and power have become the hallmarks of the war on terror,” Risen writes of one of the many unsavory episodes in the book. “The story,” he says of another episode, “shows how, during the war on terror, greed and ambition have been married to unlimited rivers of cash in the sudden deregulation of American national security to create a climate in which clever men could seemingly create rogue intelligence operations with little or no adult supervision.”

The U.S.-led war in Iraq, as we already know, was rife with lax supervision and thievery. But Risen adds an astonishing new chapter to that reprehensible folly. He tells the story of how billions of dollars intended to rebuild Iraq, shrink-wrapped in packets of $100 bills, were shipped out of a Federal Reserve warehouse in New Jersey to Baghdad and eventually made their way to secret Lebanese bunkers (an account excerpted by the Times last week).

“Approximately $2 billion of the money that was flown from the United States to Baghdad” to prop up the Iraqi government after Saddam Hussein was toppled, “was stolen and secretly transported out of Iraq in what may be one of the largest robberies in modern history,” he writes. “...In addition to cash, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of gold was stolen from the Iraqi government and is also being hidden in Lebanon, current and former U.S. officials have said.”

One might assume that U.S. officials would be deeply interested in finding out what happened to that money, not to mention eager to get it back. But, no. “The CIA and FBI, along with the Pentagon and State Department, have all been told about the theft of the cash, and have received evidence about the bunker in Lebanon and other locations where the cash is believed to be hidden,” he writes. “But the agencies have not tried to retrieve the money. Nobody went after it during the Bush administration, nor has the Obama administration tried. Instead, the US government has kept the entire matter secret.”

Why? Too many hands are dirty. “Like so many things about the Iraq war, the cash flights from New York started with good intentions. But ideology, chaos, and finally greed all got in the way.”

Stuart Bowen, a U.S Treasury official who tried to get to the bottom of those stolen billions, is one of the rare good guys in Risen’s book. Most of the stories feature hustlers who conned gullible White House, Pentagon and intelligence officials into backing multi-million dollar counterterrorism scams.

Take, for example, Dennis Montgomery, a habitué of the gambling tables in Reno, who “saw the post-9/11 age for what it was, a time to make money.” Montgomery scammed investors and CIA Director George Tenet into believing he had invented software that could detect hidden messages in al Qaeda videos broadcast on Al Jazeera. In late 2003, Montgomery’s scam stampeded the White House into grounding European U.S.-bound airliners and thinking about shooting them down.

In the war on terror, Risen shows again and again, anything goes, no matter how monkey-brained the scheme, especially if huge sums can be made. One of his chief culprits is the U.S. Special Operations Command, which emerges in Risen’s telling as a kind of slow witted younger brother to James Bond. “U.S. Special operations command, the military command involved in the raid to get Osama bin Laden, experienced rapid growth in power and status within the Pentagon after 9/11…. “ he writes. “With an expanded global role, [it] began to think that it needed its own version of the CIA. One idea was to set up front companies through which to conduct intelligence operations.”

All sorts of opportunists and oddballs show up in these operations. One of the most intriguing is Mike Asimos, a 1984 West Point graduate and former stockbroker with a criminal past who pops up in several wacky Pentagon spy schemes, one of which funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to front companies to gather intelligence and carry out assassinations in the Middle East. “In that, Asimos was hardly alone in the post 9/11 world,” Risen writes. “He was one of many dream weavers who flourished in Washington's global war on terror, cashing in on the counterterrorism gold rush. What the stock market in the Internet bubble were to the 1990s, the counterterrorism bubble was for the first years of the new millennium, and there was a cadre of men willing and able to take advantage.”

One of them was a Jordan-based Palestinian by the name of Nazem Houchaimi, a con man Asimos helped set up as an intelligence front with $600,000, no matter that Houchaimi ran the company “as a family enterprise, bringing in his father… as a paid intelligence asset and his sister… to manage the business.” Houchaimi ended up, “right in the middle of what appeared to be a runaway covert action program that had triggered a top-secret criminal investigation by counterintelligence agents from the FBI, amid allegations of attempted money laundering, illicit arms dealing, and other questionable activities.” Meanwhile, such operations produced tons of “intelligence” reports that “languished” because the Special Operations Command “had not yet developed the infrastructure needed to process and analyze the information once it began to come in.”

And so on, and on and on... Not even the American Psychological Association, whose internal emails obtained by Risen reveal its complicity in spurious CIA torture methods, is beyond the financial blandishments of the war on terror.

Risen’s journey down this rabbit hole was propelled by the sad story of Diane Roark, “perhaps the most courageous whistleblower of the post-9/11 era… who fought a lonely battle against the most powerful forces unleashed in Washington in the global war on terror, yet her story has never been fully told.”

In the mid-1990s Roark, a Republican staffer on the House intelligence committee with particular responsibility for oversight of the NSA, became concerned that the super-secret, hide-bound agency, then headed by Air Force Gen. Michael V. Hayden (later to become CIA director) was ignoring the kind of technological advances sweeping through Silicon Valley. One eavesdropping program in particular, code-named Trailblazer, was an outdated and massive waste of money, she thought. “A massive computer crash that lasted for three days at the NSA in January 2000 only increased her skepticism, and made her realize that the agency had to undergo fundamental change,” Risen writes.

Meanwhile, “her doubts made Roark a natural ally for a brilliant maverick like Bill Binney,” a senior NSA manager who had championed a cheaper, better rival to Trailblazer that had the added virtue of built-in privacy protections to shield U.S. citizens from the NSA’s robotic spies.

“After listening to Binney, Roark believed that [NSA spying operations] violated the Constitution.” So did two other NSA officials, Kirk Wiebe and Thomas Drake, who also tried to reform the program from within. In the end, however, their efforts to derail Trailblazer and other wasteful and reckless spying programs not only failed, but ended in career suicide and government retaliation (including the prosecution of Drake on espionage charges--later dropped). But as in many such cases, their concerns finally found an outlet with Risen (who has had to spend the last several years fighting off Justice Department threats to jail him for refusing to reveal his sources on another CIA fiasco in Iran).

As he fearlessly recounts here once again, however, the Times spiked his stories on the NSA misdeeds. This time around, he writes, he wasn’t going to be dissuaded. Indeed, the closing paragraphs of “Pay Any Price” amounts to a bitter “J’Accuse” against the paper’s editors, who so often set the news agenda for the rest of the American media.

“I was frustrated and deeply concerned that the truth about the war on terror was being covered up. Before the invasion of Iraq, my stories that revealed that CIA analysts had doubts about the prewar intelligence on Iraq were held, cut and buried deep inside the Times,” he writes, “even as stories by other reporters loudly proclaiming the purported existence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were garnering banner headlines on page one.”

No such weapons, of course, were ever found. But the invasion of Iraq, enabled by phony intelligence reports trumpeted by the credulous media, quickly spiralled into chaos, eventually giving birth to the fractured nation's Rosemary’s Baby, the Islamic State.

“I decided,” he says of his decision to reveal the NSA spying, “I wasn't going to let that happen again.”

"http://www.newsweek.com/imf-chief-under-investigation-france-266911","IMF Chief Lagarde Under Investigation in French Fraud Case","IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been put under formal investigation by French magistrates for negligence in a political fraud affair dating from 2008 when she was finance minister.

Lagarde, who this week was questioned by magistrates in Paris for a fourth time under her existing status as a witness in the long-running saga, said she would contest the decision.

""I have asked my lawyer to use all recourse against this decision which I consider to be completely unfounded,"" she said on BFMTV. ""I am returning to work in Washington this afternoon.""

Under French law, magistrates place someone under formal investigation when they believe there are indications of wrongdoing, but that does not always lead to a trial.

Lagarde's lawyer, Yves Repiquet, told Reuters he would appeal the magistrates' decision and so the matter would not prevent Lagarde from doing her job at the head of the International Monetary Fund in the meantime.

""She is now on her way back to Washington and will, of course, brief the (IMF) Board as soon as possible,"" IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said. ""Until then, we have no further comment.""

The inquiry relates to allegations tycoon Bernard Tapie, a supporter of conservative ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy, was improperly awarded 403 million euros ($531 million) in an arbitration to settle a dispute with now defunct, state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais.

The inquiry has already embroiled several of Sarkozy's cabinet members and France Telecom CEO Stephane Richard, who was an aide to Lagarde when she was Sarkozy's finance minister.

In previous rounds of questioning, Lagarde has not recognized as her own the pre-printed signature to sign off on a document facilitating the payment, Repiquet told Reuters by telephone. However Richard has stated that Lagarde was fully briefed on the matter.

The offence of negligence by a person charged with public responsibility in France carries a maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment and a 15,000-euro fine.

Lagarde was a star in Sarkozy's cabinet and well-respected by peers, pushing through many of the high-profile initiatives in France's presidency of the G20 group of nations.

She has been managing director of the IMF since 2011 after her predecessor at the IMF, Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn, resigned over sexual assault charges that were later dropped.

A spokesman said last year the global lender's board had discussed possible consequences of the Tapie case and determined that she would still be able to lead the fund.

Tapie, a colorful and often controversial character in the French business and sports world, sued the state for compensation after selling his stake in sports company Adidas to Credit Lyonnais in 1993.

He claimed the bank had defrauded him after it later resold his stake for a much higher sum. Credit Lyonnais, now part of Credit Agricole, has denied wrongdoing.

Investigators are trying to determine whether Tapie's political connections played a role in the government's decision to resort to arbitration that won him a huge pay-out. He has denied any wrongdoing.","2014-08-27 06:12:27","1","33.0","2.0","6.0","1.0","16.0","6.0","85.0","50.0","0.0","193.0","9.0","24.0","23","511","94.23","76.55","19.55","47.48","24.33","29.55","74.36","45.40","7.63","4.89","0.78","0.20","0.00","3.72","0.20","2.74","8.41","16.05","6.65","3.52","4.31","0.78","11.74","3.13","2.35","1.37","2.15","1.57","3.52","2.35","1.17","0.00","0.39","0.20","9.98","0.00","0.00","2.35","1.37","7.83","2.74","1.17","0.78","1.57","0.59","1.37","1.57","0.20","1.37","0.00","0.59","0.20","0.00","0.20","0.20","8.41","0.78","1.76","5.87","0.39","0.39","5.48","5.28","0.59","15.46","1.37","8.22","6.26","6.46","0.78","0.00","4.11","0.39","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","15.26","4.11","4.89","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.76","1.57","1.96","0.78","0.20","2539","8.76","24.761904761904763","769","501","21","55.68","14.1","11.4","13.7","15.4","125","8.3","21.540039920159682","293","22.71","12","0.44","0","10","10","51","2","68","33","2","0","5","93","60","0","19","0","0","18","8","25","0","0","2","14","0","15","26","12","17","9","12","2","2","0","3"
"http://www.newsweek.com/illinois-now-one-only-states-protecting-interns-sexual-harassment-268576","Illinois Is Now One of the Only States Protecting Interns From Sexual Harassment","Illinois has become one of the only states to pass legislation protecting unpaid interns from sexual harassment in the workplace.

A new bill, signed into law last week by Governor Patrick Quinn, amends the Illinois Human Rights Act to include “unpaid intern” in its definition of an “employee.” That gives unpaid workers legal recourse to file suit in instances of sexual harassment or discrimination—a right they could otherwise be legally denied in favor of paid employees.

“Because unpaid internships are a widespread form of employment for young professionals, it is bewildering to think that laws in Illinois do not protect the unpaid intern,” wrote state Representative Maria A. Berrios in a statement provided to Newsweek. “Every person has the right to feel safe and secure in their workplace, and with this new law, unpaid interns will have the same protections as other employees to seek justice in cases of sexual harassment.”

The bill’s sponsor, state Senator Iris Martinez, added that interns can be especially vulnerable to harassment, given their relative youth and low ranking in office environments.

The loophole came to national attention after a 2013 lawsuit was thrown out of court when a New York City judge found that an intern alleging sexual harassment was not protected by the city’s workplace discrimination protections. In April, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an amendment clarifying that interns “are guaranteed the full protections guaranteed to employees under the human rights law,” and in July, New York state followed suit.

But most states still don’t have laws on the books extending protections to interns, making Illinois one of the first in the nation, along with Oregon and Washington, D.C.","2014-09-05 10:28:12","1","22.0","3.0","6.0","1.0","18.0","7.0","89.0","51.0","0.0","185.0","12.0","24.0","23","281","97.68","47.15","49.98","8.68","28.10","25.62","75.44","39.86","4.27","1.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.07","3.20","8.54","15.66","6.05","1.42","3.91","1.07","10.32","4.63","1.42","0.36","1.42","1.07","3.56","1.07","2.49","0.36","1.78","0.36","2.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.83","2.85","0.71","0.36","0.71","1.42","2.14","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.36","1.42","0.00","0.00","1.42","0.00","12.10","0.00","1.07","7.83","0.36","3.20","4.27","6.41","0.36","16.37","1.42","8.90","5.69","6.76","0.36","0.00","1.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.88","3.91","5.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.56","1.07","0.00","0.00","1422","9.15","40.57142857142857","440","279","10","43.16","15.1","14.2","13.64","17.4","73","12.625","23.625949820788534","174","36.43","4","0.39","0","7","3","24","0","38","31","0","0","3","46","37","0","24","0","0","2","3","6","0","1","0","11","0","12","10","5","9","5","5","1","0","0","1"
"http://www.newsweek.com/intelligence-panel-chief-urges-us-aid-ukraine-231110","Intelligence Panel Chief Urges U.S. Aid for Ukraine","Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said today that the United States should help beef up Ukraine’s security forces to combat Russia’s evident designs on the former Soviet state.

The Michigan Republican said Washington should undertake a range of military, police and intelligence assistance in concert with European allies, and suggested Poland is best positioned to get assistance to Ukraine fastest. ""I do think that between us and the Europeans, they're going to have to do something,” Rogers said in an interview with Newsweek. Gary Cameron/Reuters

“But it needs to be full and robust,” the former FBI special agent added. “It cannot be tepid. If the E.U. is tepid and the U.S. is tepid, I think Putin is going to have his way all across the Ukraine, and I think certainly one of his primary interests is securing the Crimean peninsula and I think he's done that.”

The West has threatened sanctions against Moscow for its virtual takeover of Ukraine’s largely Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula, but not military action. The interim Ukraine government in Kiev has been careful so far to prevent its forces from firing on Russian security troops in Crimea and giving Moscow a pretext for a full invasion of the country’s east.

”I would be careful about how we engage there,” said Rogers, who is launching a review of U.S. intelligence reporting on Ukraine. “I would certainly offer training packages so they can understand what their counterintelligence threat is and offer advice on what a counter-insurgency program would look like—that's certainly something that we ought to offer as a package. Reuters

""Poland is in a great position to do that,” Rogers added. “They’ve got some exceptionally good soldiers that could offer rapid training on those kinds of issues … “ The goal would be “to keep trouble at bay without military exchanges” with Russian-backed forces “or military-on-civilian violence, that kind of thing.”

Poland’s embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.

A spokesman for the Senate Intelligence committee said he was unaware of any discussions about security aid to Ukraine, but the panel has been distracted over reports that the CIA was monitoring its computers.

The FBI, which works on counterterrorism programs abroad and has a legal attaché in the American embassy in Kiev, declined to comment, as did the CIA.

The Pentagon has had a wide range of joint training and operations programs with Ukraine over the years, including annual ground forces and naval exercises.

"http://www.newsweek.com/intelligence-source-turks-launched-bombing-strikes-isis-263483","Intelligence Source: Turks Launch Bombing Strikes on ISIS","A former high ranking CIA official in Baghdad tells Newsweek that Turkish jets carried out airstrikes on Islamic State (I.S.) militants threatening Kurdish refugees--an assertion that Ankara denies.

The White House, meanwhile, said it had launched humanitarian air drops to the beleaguered Kurds trapped by advancing I.S. forces in the northern part of Iraq and was considering air strikes to fend off an expected assault.

U.S. forces were placed “on a hair trigger,” according to NBC News, with a twofold priority: to provide humanitarian relief for refugees from Islamic State aggression and to protect U.S. officials on the ground.

I.S. forces were reported to be advancing on Irbil, where the U.S. has a consulate manned by 30 to 50 State Department officials and a significant number of U.S. military advisers. NBC News reported an unnamed senior U.S. official saying, “We're not going to let them take Irbil.”

Kurdish TV claimed earlier in a day of conflicting reports that American jets had carried out the strikes on Islamic State position outside the town of Kalak, 25 miles northwest of Irbil, the capital of Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish region.

“The Turks are doing it,” said the former CIA officer, who maintains close contacts in Iraq, especially with Kurdish authorities. “There’s no question about it,” he said on condition of anonymity until he could gather more corroboration from his sources in the region. “But certainly we are giving them targeting data.”

The CIA did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.

A resident of of Kalak told McClatchy News that “she had seen the aircraft and had heard the explosions coming from behind Islamic State lines, which are slightly more than a mile away."" The resident said because it was dark she could not see any markings on the aircraft.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby emphatically denied U.S. jets had carried out the strikes, calling reports of such “completely false.”

“No such action was taken,” Kirby said in a tweet.

The Turkish military denied local Kurdish media reports that Turkish planes entered Iraqi airspace to track the extremist movement’s forces, Bloomberg reported, citing a one-sentence statement on its web site.

A Turkish official told the New York Times that the country’s air force had not conducted any operations. “There is no such thing,” he said, referring to airstrikes.

Turkey’s Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said earlier Thursday that “Turkish aid supplies had been dropped in the mountains near Sinjar in northern Iraq, where about 50,000 Yezidis have taken shelter after militants from the Islamic State drove them from their homes during the group’s latest advance,” Bloomberg reported. “He did not say whether Turkish aircraft carried out the operation.”

Turkish F-16s were said to be patrolling the skies over the area.

After an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council Thursday afternoon, Iraq’s U.N. ambassador, Mohamed Ali Alhakim, said Baghdad had not asked Turkey for any “interference.”","2014-08-07 20:49:41","0","32.0","4.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","82.0","48.0","0.0","187.0","6.0","24.0","23","500","95.86","72.57","29.68","29.10","19.23","30.60","71.00","41.40","6.80","3.60","0.60","0.40","0.40","1.40","0.80","3.20","8.80","14.20","6.00","2.80","1.80","1.80","13.40","2.80","2.20","1.00","1.20","1.60","1.40","0.80","0.60","0.20","0.60","0.00","9.40","0.00","0.20","0.40","1.00","6.40","1.00","1.80","0.60","0.80","0.60","1.80","3.40","0.80","2.60","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","7.80","1.00","1.00","5.00","1.20","0.60","9.40","3.60","0.60","16.40","2.80","9.80","3.80","2.80","0.20","0.80","0.00","1.20","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.40","8.60","5.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.80","4.80","1.60","0.40","0.00","2466","8.01","25.7","741","491","29","62.78","12.0","8.7","13.16","12.0","110","7.166666666666666","17.721303462321796","273","23.85","32","0.42","0","7","7","49","0","61","29","3","1","2","62","92","1","40","0","0","18","3","15","2","0","5","12","0","13","39","18","15","8","5","2","1","0","2"
"http://www.newsweek.com/internet-slowdown-day-are-websites-conceding-net-neutrality-dead-269658","On Internet Slowdown Day, Are Websites Conceding That Net Neutrality is Dead?","The “loading” wheel.

It’s the modern symbol of frustration but an image 76 major websites and more than 10,000 sites overall are voluntarily embracing and proudly displaying for today’s Internet Slowdown Day—an online protest for stronger net neutrality protections. (Don’t worry. They aren’t actually slowing down their sites).

Websites have incorporated the spinning icon in different ways. Kickstarter has “Stop Internet Slow Lanes” splashed across its home screen in bold letters demanding readers’ attention. But the vast majority, like Netflix, have an unassuming box—easily missed among the many clickable items on front pages. Does the small nod most participating websites gave to today’s action mean they have given up on net neutrality?

Organizers say no.“[The loading wheel] explains what is at stake,” says Evan Greer, Campaign Manager at Fight for the Future, one of the groups that organized today’s online action. “And it’s something we will see a lot more of if the FCC does not use its Title II authority.”

Greer is referring to the latest strategy to rescue net neutrality—urging the FCC to reclassify the internet from an information service (Title I) to a telecommunications service (Title II). This would give the FCC the same authority over the internet it currently has over phone companies, and allow it to establish robust net neutrality rules.

Some of the Internet Slowdown Day organizers, including Greer, were also responsible for the “Internet Blackout Day” on January 18, 2012—an online campaign to protest SOPA and PIPA. Not only did over 115,000 websites take part in Internet Blackout Day, but sites made their participation obvious. To highlight the campaign, some sites dramatically changed their front page, while others made their content inaccessible to visitors.

With such a quiet-in-comparison campaign, is it the internet activists that have given up on net neutrality?

“Comparing every online protest to the SOPA blackout is a bit like comparing every racial protest to the March on Washington,” Greer said, “we have to keep changing tactics to reach new people.”

When asked about websites’ level of participation, he said, “We wanted to give options so everyone could get on board.”

Greer says the size of the “loading” wheel doesn’t matter, and offered a different metric of the campaign’s success. “We've already pushed 367,000+ comments to the FCC and done more than 64,000 phone calls to Congress,” he said.

"http://www.newsweek.com/iran-loses-big-again-beirut-bombing-case-277810","Iran Loses Big Again in Beirut Bombing Case","In yet another demonstration that the wheels of justice grind so slowly that it’s sometimes hard to see that they are moving, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. has slapped Iran with another whopping financial penalty for the 1983 Marine Corps barracks bombing in Beirut.

Calling it “an evil and cruel attack, intended to cause death, destruction, and emotional devastation,” Judge Royce Lamberth awarded the 62 relatives of six Marines and two Navy corpsmen $454 million, the latest setback for Iran in a flurry of cases dating back to 2001. Since 2007, D.C. courts have awarded more than $10 billion to victims and their families of the 1983 suicide bombing, which killed 241 Marines and Navy medics, known as corpsmen, and wounded many others.

“The Court applauds plaintiffs’ persistent efforts to hold Iran accountable for its cowardly support of terrorism,” Lamberth wrote in the Oct. 14 judgment, saying “Iran must be punished to the fullest extent legally possible for the bombing in Beirut on October 23, 1983.""

“This horrific act harmed countless individuals and their families, a number of whom receive awards in this lawsuit,” Lambeth added. “This Court hopes that the victims and their families may find some measure of solace from this final judgment.”

Joseph Peter Drennan, an Alexandria, Va. attorney for the plaintiffs, said the judgment “stands as a testament to the rule of law.

“It’s an alternative way of dealing with the scourge of state-sponsored terrorism,” Drennan told Newsweek in a brief telephone interview Wednesday. “It puts them on notice that whatever Iran gained from terrorism is far outweighed by the cost to them.”

Drennan said Iran was “totally unrepentant” about the bombing, noting that a Tehran cemetery has a memorial to the suicide bomber, dispatched by the Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah.

The next hurdle will be actually collecting money from Iran. Last year a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled that Iranian central bank money held in a New York Citibank account should be turned over to victims’ families to help satisfy a $2.65 billion default judgment against Iran in 2007.

"http://www.newsweek.com/irans-supreme-leader-calls-more-uranium-enrichment-capacity-257628","Iran's Supreme Leader Calls for More Uranium Enrichment Capacity","DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said his country needs to significantly increase its number of centrifuges, underlining a gap in positions between Tehran and world powers as they hold talks aimed at clinching a nuclear accord.

Iran and world powers have less than two weeks to reach an agreement on the future scope of Iran's uranium enrichment programme and other issues if they are to meet a self-imposed July 20 deadline for a deal.

Iran's enrichment capacity lies at the centre of the nuclear stalemate and is seen as the hardest issue to resolve. Iran insists it needs to expand its capacity to refine uranium to fuel a planned network of atomic energy plants. The powers say Tehran must sharply reduce the capacity to prevent it being able to quickly produce a nuclear bomb.

""Their aim is that we accept a capacity of 10,000 separative work units (SWUs), which is equivalent to 10,000 centrifuges of the older type that we already have. Our officials say we need 190,000 centrifuges. Perhaps this is not a need this year or in two years or five years, but this is the country's absolute need,"" Khamenei said in a statement published on his website late on Monday.

""The P5+1 started bargaining with 500 SWUs, then 1,000 SWUs enrichment capacity. Now they want to convince us to (accept) 10,000 SWUs,"" he added.

Tehran says its programme is solely for civilian purposes such as electricity generation and denies any plan to build an atomic bomb.

Iran now has more than 19,000 installed enrichment centrifuges, mostly old-generation IR-1 machines, with about 10,000 of them operating to increase the concentration of uranium's fissile isotope U-235.

In 2006, when the U.N. Security Council imposed its first sanctions resolution against the country, Iran had a few hundred centrifuges that it was testing.

It's expected that followers of #Jesus follow him in his fight against arrogants and in his support for the oppressed. #BlackLivesMatter â€” Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) December 28, 2014

The #BlackLivesMatter hashtag was originally started by US activist groups in 2012, in protest of the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin by a neighbourhood watch volunteer. Since then it has continued to be used to voice outrage at other similar cases such as the recent deaths of Mike Brown and Antonio Martin in the town of Ferguson, St. Louis.

The Khamenei account also jumped on the trend, with a series of posts alleging that US “arrogants” do not follow the true path of Jesus and conversely praising the Islamic prophet Muhammad’s racial tolerance.

The account has tweeted criticism of the US treatment of clashes in Ferguson in the past and it also frequently tweets about US “crimes against Iran” and compares Israel and the Nazis.

That’s the message Sheikh Ali Hatem al-Suleiman, leader of Iraq’s biggest Sunni tribe, gave John R. Maguire, a retired former CIA deputy station chief in Baghdad, when he visited Iraq three weeks ago to talk about future oil deals in the region.

And Maguire, a veteran senior CIA paramilitary official, believes it. The tribes that once worked with the Americans to defeat Al-Qaeda in Iraq, he insists, will again rise up again to oust its spawn, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria [ISIS]—a movement so extreme it was denounced by Osama bin Laden’s successor.

“They're already drawing lines around how this is going to work, to get rid of these guys,” Maguire tells Newsweek. “So the fight is coming, but they can't do it until they're sure they have disrupted Maliki and they've got some breathing space to create a different government in Baghdad.”

For now, Maguire says, the Sunni leaders are furnishing tribesmen to fight with the ISIS in hopes that their collaboration will accomplish something they couldn’t do on their own—topple Maliki, who they call “a corrupt puppet of Iran [who] has amassed staggering personal wealth,” and for whom “people are not interested in fighting.”

The Sunnis are using ISIS like a crowbar to oust Maliki, Maguire says, and then they’ll turn on the invaders. Iraq as we know it will cease to exist, splitting into three new proto-states: Sunnistan in the west, Kurdistan in the north and an Iranian Shiite protectorate stretching from Baghdad east to the Arabian Sea and oil port of Basra. ISIS, in this optimistic scenario, will be pounded into oblivion.

""Iraq is righting itself"" along tribal and ethnic lines, says Maguire, who now runs a Virginia-based oil consulting business with two other CIA veterans of the Iraq war. He says he’s advised Sunni tribal leaders to spiff up their image. “I just had a conversation last night about this with some Sunni guys from Anbar,” Maguire said by telephone Tuesday. “I told them, ‘You guys have to do something to change the perception of what you're doing. Your image is that of a guy in a black turban on YouTube. You can't have that. You got to get your message out, and you've got to put some smart Sunnis on TV wearing suits explaining what the hell's going on in Iraq.’""

What’s “going on,” he says, is that the Sunnis leaders are lying in wait, waiting for the right moment to spring their treacherous trap on ISIS, just like it did with Al-Qaeda in Iraq during the U.S. occupation. “There's no question that ISIS is a huge problem and a very dangerous tool, but it's a tool that Sunni officers know how to use and handle,” maintains Maguire, whose 23-year CIA career included several senior operational assignments in the Middle East. “They're using [ISIS] guys as disposable assets...and when they don't need them anymore, they'll invite them to return to Syria or wherever they came from, and if they don't, they will kill them.”

A number of signs point to Maliki’s imminent downfall, Maguire says: mass desertions from the Iraqi army, nervous regime officials looking to get cash out of the country and the lukewarm response of young Shia to calls from the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to rally to the defense of the nation. “When al-Sistani gave his great call to arms for the Shia to rise up, they did not respond in great numbers,” says Maguire, contradicting the dramatic images of youths signing up to fight. “It just fizzled out.” Indeed, Sistani was back again last week calling for something far less, the formation of a new government that would unite the nation. On Tuesday, Maliki rejected that idea.

It may be too late for that. The major roads leading north and west out of Baghdad are under ISIS control, and the south may be closed off soon, too, Maguire says. “There is an increasing risk in the next day or two that ISIS will open the Haditha Dam,” a five-mile-wide structure on the Euphrates northwest of Baghdad. “If they open the dam, they can flood the area south of Baghdad as far as Karbala,” Shiite Islam’s the third holiest city.

“Remember, Ramadan starts on Saturday,” says Maguire. “Picture thousands of Shia pilgrims washing down the canals from the flood. If the Haditha Dam is opened, the roads to flee Baghdad from the south will be impassable, leaving the only way out to the east, to Iran.”

Maliki’s praetorian guard is starting to buckle, Maguire says. The prime minister senses it, and he ""issued an order that no VIP travel is authorized, so he's strapped all the inner-circle Iraqis to the deck of his ship. I've been contacted by people in his inner circle asking for my help with getting money out of Baghdad,” Maguire adds. “His money guys are looking to get out. They're scared. They don't think this is going to hold, and they don't want to be the last guys in Baghdad with no money on the outside and no way out.""

Maliki and his Iranian backers might be so desperate to rouse Shiites to fight that they’ll blow up one of the sect’s own holy sites and blame it on ISIS, Maguire and other intelligence sources say. ""We are at a very dangerous period, because when al-Sistani gave his great call to arms for the Shia to rise up, they did not respond in great numbers, so they have to do something to scare the Shia into action,” Maguire says. “And I'm afraid that Maliki and Iran will create an incident, an atrocity of some sort, maybe blow up Shia shrines or have some atrocious event in Baghdad that will drive people into the streets.

""The Shia have got to do something to wake people up,” Maguire explains. “People are just not motivated. The desertions from the army are so bad that Maliki doesn't even know what units he has that are still operationally viable.""

Other experts say Maguire’s prediction that pro-West Sunni tribal leaders want—and can—muscle ISIS aside after they take down Maliki is far too rosy. “That's what they are telling everyone,” Ken Pollack, a former CIA and White House National Security Council expert on Iraq, told Newsweek. “I have heard it from multiple sources. I think it accurately reflects their suspicion/antipathy to ISIS and the other militant groups,” Pollack added by email. “But there is a huge question regarding whether they can (1) take Baghdad, (2) get rid of Maliki, and (3) beat ISIS, even if they can do 1 and 2.

“ISIS and the other Sunni militant groups are actually a lot more dangerous than [Al-Qaeda in Iraq] was in 2007, and back then, the tribes needed a huge amount of U.S. combat power—like 50,000 ground combat troops—to get rid of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. We will not be providing the same level of combat power, no matter what happens” this time, Pollack added.

Pollack doesn’t doubt the Sunni tribes would like to turn on the ISIS, whose extreme brand of Islam doesn’t go down well with the country’s secular, liquor-loving Sunnis. “But I think it would be foolish,” Pollack said, “to assume that they can defeat the radicals as easily as they claim.”

Malcolm Nance, a former Navy and CIA counterterrorism operative, says Iraq’s Sunnis “have just committed suicide.” He tells Newsweek he had been planning to write a piece called “The Sunni Tribes Drink Antifreeze.”

“The Awakening could never happen again the way it did in 2007–2009,” says Nance, referring to the wartime U.S. operation that turned Sunnis insurgents away from fighting the Americans and onto attacking Al-Qaeda in Iraq. “At that time, the Sunnis were the heart of the insurgency. They had 25,000 active combatants and as many as 88,000 part-time and support insurgents. When they came over to the Awakening councils, they brought with them a lot of manpower and weapons and could push Al-Qaeda in Iraq out. Now that [Al-Qaeda] has [evolved into] the more combat-experienced ISIS and has many more foreign jihadis than it did in its peak of 2006, it is the insurgency. Everyone else is just a witness.

“ISIS...” adds Nance, “will…exact a painful level of control over the Sunni population that will make them regret the very moment they fooled themselves into believing Maliki was worse than Saddam. I was there last year for a month and all I kept hearing was that Maliki was a tyrant. They overestimate every political difficulty, but this time the Sunnis have signed their own death warrants.”

Former State Department officer Peter Van Buren calls Maguire’s scenario a ""surge fantasy.""

“Without much of a plan otherwise, it is not surprising for someone [from the] CIA to fall back on the narrative that, just [as with] Al-Qaeda, the tribes will kick ISIS out,” says Van Buren, who wrote a lacerating memoir of his time in Iraq, We Meant Well. “What else do they have to hope for?”

Such criticisms, Maguire counters, don’t “take into account the evolution of events since 2007. The battle space has changed completely in six-plus years. A new generation of Sunni leaders has emerged [who] have been treated like rubbish and been punished for six-plus years. That is a factor that changes their commitment.” Just recently in Rutba, he points out, along a highway 90 miles east of the Jordanian border, the Sunnis “killed about 30 ISIS guys, because they came in there with a sharia proclamation.”

Life by the Quran won’t sit well in a region that has “one of the highest consumptions of beer a year in Iraq,” Maguire says. The highway through the area “is like the Teamster redneck trucker corridor of Iraq.”

“When they make the decision that they have had enough of radical Islam,” Maguire argues, “they'll just jettison them. It'll be a horrible fight, but the outcome is not in doubt. The Sunni tribes will come out on top. It’s their country. They have something to fight for.”

"http://www.newsweek.com/cia-torture-report-vietcong-vietnam-war-292041","When Torture Backfires: What the Vietcong Learned and the CIA Didn’t","The CIA is hardly the only spy service to grapple with blowback from making prisoners scream. Even leaders of Communist Vietnam’s wartime intelligence agency, notorious for torturing American POWs, privately knew that “enhanced interrogation techniques,” as the CIA calls them, could create more problems than solutions, according to internal Vietnamese documents reviewed by Newsweek.

In many cases, torturing people wrongly suspected of being enemy spies caused “extremely regrettable losses and damage,” says one of the documents, released to little notice in 1993 by Hanoi’s all-powerful Public Security Service (PSS). But unlike the CIA, Vietnam’s security service constantly engaged in Marxist-style “self-criticism” to review its mistakes, particularly those caused by relying on confessions extracted by torture, the recently translated Communist documents show.

The documents were obtained and translated by Christopher E. Goscha, a history professor at the University of Montreal and one of the leading international scholars on Indochina during the French colonial period. He included them in his book, Historical Dictionary of the Indochina War (1945-1954): An International and Interdisciplinary Approach, which was published to little notice in Denmark in 2011. “Torture and intelligence gathering in a time of war are a tricky combination,” he told Newsweek, “and the [Communists’] policing and military intelligence services were no exception to the rule.”

Some of the papers Goscha found delve into intelligence errors dating back to the late 1940s, when Ho Chi Minh—prime minister of the nascent Democratic Republic of Vietnam—and his fellow revolutionaries were in a life-and-death struggle to oust French colonial forces from the country. One document recounts how, in early July 1949, agents from the PSS gathered secretly in an underground three-day conference outside of Saigon and “analyzed the service’s organizational and professional weaknesses, especially those involving the work of arresting and interrogating suspects.”

The main topic: a successful operation by French intelligence that planted a false document inside the organization, which suggested that some of the PSS cadres were double agents.

Four decades later, the Vietnamese agency’s review of the affair, obtained by Goscha, concluded that its counterespionage wing had overreacted and forced false confessions from many innocent people. It describes “waves of arrests...that caused us extremely regrettable losses and damage,” which were the result of “physical violence and torture, forcing people to make statements, putting words in their mouths, and then arresting everyone implicated by the suspects during torture.”

The PSS blamed the excesses on “professional immaturity,” according to the documents. Interrogators were driven by desperation to get quick results and to get ahead. “In almost every case,” the papers said, “there was...a personal motivating factor, because in all cases the erring cadre wanted to achieve a success for his own personal benefit.”

The Vietnamese agency’s review cited numerous examples, and unlike the White House-censored report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, named names. In one part, it described how a deputy PSS chief “conducted waves of arrests, using brutal torture, rape, and murder...that caused unjust suffering for 86 families of innocent civilians.”

In another part, the report explains how the agency eventually began to arrest its own people, and before long, false confessions began destroying the PSS itself. “A reconnaissance team member who one day went out to arrest someone would suddenly be arrested the very next day,” the documents said. “An investigating officer who one day was sitting in his chair conducting interrogations would the next day be forced to stand in that same office to be interrogated himself.”

Unlike the CIA, however, the PSS constantly reviewed its errors. “The [Vietcong] continually learned from their mistakes, and their political officers wrote up these long boring papers at least once a week, recounting their strong and weak points,” Walter McIntosh, a former CIA chief of Vietnam operations, told Newsweek. “Had the U.S. been as diligent in reviewing each operation and overall strategy as did the Communists, we would not have kept making the same mistakes over and over again.”

Not everyone agrees. Merle Pribbenow, a former CIA operations officer who spent five years in Vietnam and has devoted much of the past decade since his retirement translating and analyzing internal Communist documents, said the PSS’s attempts at self-criticism were often perfunctory. “As a result of bitter experience, the Vietnamese [PSS] came to realize the dangers inherent in the use of torture,” he said. “But they, like us, frequently then ignored their own restrictions. Because of the existential dangers that they faced, they decided to take shortcuts around their own restrictions—shortcuts for which they paid dearly.”

Indeed, in 1951 the PSS had banned using physical violence during interrogations. “The ban theoretically remained in effect throughout the American phase of the Vietnam War,"" Pribbenow said. But “clearly, that ban was honored in the breach more than anything else.”

Case in point: Arizona Senator John McCain, a former Navy aviator and the most well-known victim of the Communists’ brutal interrogation techniques. McCain’s plane was shot down over North Vietnam, and he endured nearly six years of torture at what the POWs sarcastically called “the Hanoi Hilton.”

The “Hilton” was a PSS prison. But as the Communists captured more and more Americans, Pribbenow said, the intelligence agency turned over part of the facility to the army, which brought in its own interrogators. As with the infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, the former CIA officer said, the worst abuses in the Hanoi Hilton were carried out by army personnel, not the intelligence professionals, though some of them were guilty as well.

Hard measures often work, Pribbenow concedes, but they’re also problematic. “I am not one of those who assert that torture is ineffective,” he told Newsweek. “I do, however, maintain that it is unreliable, that it does much more harm than good, and that it is simply incompatible with American ideals and values.”

Much like the American experience in Iraq and elsewhere, the PSS ultimately punished lower-level cadres who brutalized prisoners but let senior officials off scot-free. In his research, Pribbenow found a bitter account in the memoir of former senior North Vietnamese officer Colonel Bui Tin. During the Communist occupation of Cambodia in 1983, Bui Tin recounted, torture once again led Hanoi’s intelligence officers to believe that there were traitors in their ranks, in this case pro-Vietnamese Cambodian officials in Siem Reap province.

“The greatest error had been made by Vietnamese military intelligence, which out of a desire to make a name for themselves had put words into the mouths of the prisoners they were interrogating,” Bui Tin wrote. “The ‘professional methods’ they had used were torture and sophisticated physical abuse: not allowing the prisoners to sleep, questioning the prisoners around the clock to put them under extreme psychological tension; forcing them to go without food and water and then telling them that they would not be given anything to eat or drink until they confessed, etc.”

These techniques are akin to the mildest tactics used by the CIA. And the result for the Vietnamese was an abundance of false confessions—with calamitous consequences. The “purge prompted thousands of Cambodians to head for the border, many of them arriving at refugee camps and accusing Vietnam of ‘colonialism,’” according to an account by Evan Gottesman in his 2002 book, Cambodia After the Khmer Rouge. (Gottesman, incidentally, went on to work on the Senate Intelligence Committee’s CIA interrogations report.)

Meanwhile, according to Bui Tin’s 1994 memoir, the men directly responsible for the chaos that followed were relieved of their command, but not the top officials overseeing the security operations.

"http://www.newsweek.com/cia-vaults-woman-top-spy-ranks-263323","CIA Vaults a Woman into Top Spy Ranks","Move over, boys. Continuing its appointment of women across its senior ranks, the CIA has promoted a veteran female operative into the number two slot in its espionage and dirty tricks division, Newsweek has learned.

The woman, whom Newsweek is not naming because she remains under cover, is the second female in a row to become deputy chief of the National Clandestine Service, the home of the spies. Its previous occupant also served briefly as acting NCS chief until her connection with the CIA’s detention and interrogation program doomed her chances for holding on to the job. After accepting a demotion back to deputy earlier this year, she was compensated with a transfer to London.

The new number two, said to be fluent in French, has held senior operational posts in plush European CIA stations, in New York, and at headquarters, but not the Middle East or other hardship posts, multiple sources said. The hole in her post-9/11 resume has provoked some grumbling among CIA veterans who have spent much of their careers in places like Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan.

“We need people willing to do hard things in hard places and she hasn’t done that,” said one former operative, on condition of anonymity. “If you’re going to ask young people to put their lives on the line, you’d better have done that yourself.”

But another former intelligence official called such a view outdated. “You don’t need to serve in tough places. That’s old-agency bullshit.”

The woman is no stranger to the CIA’s seventh floor executive suites. In 1999, then-CIA Deputy Director for Operations James Pavitt, who had been a Luxembourg station chief, made her his executive assistant. In 2002, “he moved her into the Counterterrorism Center in a very high-profile job,” the former operative said, “for which she had no experience whatsoever.”

“It's very clear that he did this because the person in that job got visibility in places like the situation room at the White House,” the operative maintained. “She couldn't have found Afghanistan with a map and a flashlight.” Her new boss, the current head of the National Clandestine Service, Frank Archibald, “was her deputy” then, he said.

The number two NCS slot will give her a lot of sway over the CIA’s far-flung stations, but it isn’t as important a job as it was during the storied years of the Cold War, when the agency’s operations director lorded over U.S. spy missions. In a post-9/11 shake-up, the CIA’s wings were clipped by a new national intelligence director, but its clandestine service still runs the spies.

In the 1990s, the new number two was a protégé of Mary Margaret Graham, who held several senior intelligence jobs before retiring in 2008, Intelligence sources said. But it was Archibald, who does have Pakistan experience, who gave her the job.

“She’s a very hard worker,” the former U.S. intelligence official said of the woman. “She’s not a dilettante.”

CIA veterans believe the agency has been looking hard for a woman to run the NCS, a notion officials strenuously deny. Women already hold several top jobs at the spy agency including general counsel, chief of staff, deputy director, executive director and chief of intelligence. But a women has yet to be picked for arguably its most prestigious job--chief of the spies.

CIA Director John Brennan’s practice is to let division and branch chiefs choose their own deputies. But he chooses who runs the directorates, and it’s not likely this one will ascend to the top spot in the National Clandestine Service, well-placed sources said.

“She’s broken a lot of pottery along the way,” a former superior of hers said, on condition of anonymity. “She would go over the head of station chiefs,” he alleged. “It rubbed some people the wrong way.”

One dispute involved a field assignment she botched in Europe and blamed on a colleague, according to the former operative. And many of the spies she recruited during a European posting, the operative said, “turned out to be worthless” Her successor was given the assignment of cutting them loose.

The CIA declined comment for the record.

"http://www.newsweek.com/israel-brink-passing-divisive-jewish-nation-state-bill-286944","Israel On Brink of Passing Divisive 'Jewish Nation-State' Bill","Israel is poised to pass one of the most divisive laws in its 66-year history, a bill that would declare it the homeland of the Jewishpeople only -- and further alienate its Arab minority.

Political infighting over the measure is already threatening to tear apart Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition.

The legislation, which is seen as compromising equality by differentiating between Jewish and non-Jewish citizens in enshrining some symbolic rights to theJewish people, could also have long-term practical ramifications for Israeli democracy and jurisprudence.

Netanyahu, along with other right-wing politicians pushing the law, say it is essential to protecting Israel's identity against those questioning its right to exist.

Some commentators say Netanyahu is going ahead now to court a key constituency of right-wing voters he has been losing to far-right parties in his already shaky coalition, with an eye to a possible early election next year should cracks within the government widen.

Centrists in his government argue such legislation is unnecessary, noting the 1948 Declaration of Independence already proclaimed a Jewish state. They accuse him of pandering to hardliners in his Likud party.

""There are many who are challenging Israel's character as the national state of the Jewish people,"" Netanyahu said on Sunday at a cabinet meeting. ""The Palestinians refuse to recognize this and there is also opposition from within.""

Palestinians say accepting Netanyahu's call could deny Palestinian refugees of past wars any right of return.

""The discussion on the nation-state (bill) puts obstacles in the way of peace,"" Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Tuesday. ""It has met fierce opposition inside the Israeli government, Knesset and among the Israeli people.""

The bill was approved by Netanyahu's cabinet on Sunday, but political bickering has pushed back by a week, to next Wednesday, a preliminary ratification vote in parliament.

His draft of the bill -- two other versions are being considered and no final wording has been agreed -- pledges to ""uphold the individual rights of all of Israel's citizens"".

But it also says only the Jewish people have ""national rights"" -- the right to self-determination in Israel and to a flag, an anthem and free immigration. One draft proposed by a Likud legislator would remove Arabic as an official state language.

""With this law, the state will be less democratic and more racist,"" said Arab legislator Jamal Zahalka.

Israeli Arabs make up 20 percent of the population of 8.2 million and have long complained of being treated a second-class citizens. Law professor Mordechai Kremnitzer of The Israel Democracy Institute said the bill could open the courtroom door to discrimination.

""Judges could learn from this bill that the Jewish foundation overrides the democratic foundation and draw inspiration from it to hurt equal rights all citizens are entitled to, including the minorities,"" Kremnitzer said.

ARAB OPPOSITION

In the Arab town of Kafr Qassem, whose Arabic- and Hebrew-signed shops and garages are frequented by Israeli Jews, residents, some of whom saw themselves as Arab-Israeli or as Palestinian citizens of Israel, united against the bill.

""This is our country, our land,"" said Rasha, a 27-year-old teacher and mother of two at the local market. ""Israel is a democracy for Jews only, not for Arabs.""

Sitting outside a mosque, as the call for prayer sounded over loudspeakers, Ibrahim Issa, 68, said: ""Israel is a strong state, what does it need all this for? Who are they afraid of? The Israeli Arabs?""

The controversy comes at a time of high tensions in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, where a dispute over access to a religious site sacred to Jews and Muslims has ignited Palestinian streets protests and lethal attacks on Jews.

Violence has risen in Jerusalem since June, when Hamas militants abducted and killed three Israeli youths in the West Bank, triggering the murder by Jews of a Palestinian teenager.

Lawmaker Ayelet Shaked of the far-right Jewish Home party said the proposed law would not hurt minorities' rights. It is needed, she said, to ensure rulings of theSupreme Court -- often criticized by the right-wing as being left-leaning -- are balanced.

Shaked, who authored one of the drafts, said that once Israel's status as a Jewish nation-state was anchored in law, the court would be able to take into accountJewish values and national considerations in passing judgment.

""When the Supreme Court rules on whether a law is constitutional or not today, it only has the democratic leg to stand on,"" she said. ""It does not have a Jewishfoundation in its legal toolbox.""

Rabbi Michael Melchior, a former cabinet minister from the Labour Party, said the law would distort both the Jewish and democratic nature of Israel. ""It's one of the worst things ever done in Israel,"" he said.","2014-11-25 11:19:47","1","42.0","2.0","6.0","1.0","18.0","7.0","86.0","51.0","0.0","205.0","12.0","24.0","23","806","95.80","71.59","16.42","18.46","23.03","25.31","76.18","43.42","5.96","1.74","0.00","0.25","0.00","1.12","0.37","4.22","9.18","15.26","6.70","2.61","4.84","0.62","11.91","4.59","2.11","1.36","1.99","1.99","4.22","1.86","2.36","0.74","0.99","0.37","7.94","0.12","0.00","0.37","0.87","6.45","0.87","0.62","1.49","1.36","0.62","1.86","2.85","0.37","2.23","0.25","0.37","0.37","0.12","0.00","0.00","7.57","0.99","0.62","5.46","0.25","0.50","3.60","6.45","0.50","15.01","1.36","9.43","4.47","3.85","0.74","0.50","1.61","2.98","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.61","3.97","5.58","0.12","0.00","0.37","0.00","3.72","3.47","1.12","0.25","0.00","4009","8.65","23.285714285714285","1220","789","36","57.71","13.5","10.7","13.69","14.7","196","12.25","20.69662864385298","404","21.54","2","0.42","0","25","15","89","0","104","71","1","1","11","119","101","3","45","1","0","18","10","24","2","1","2","22","0","24","25","25","24","15","24","2","5","1","3"

"http://www.newsweek.com/israel-chickenshit-comments-makes-netanyahu-stronger-280991","In Israel, 'Chickenshit' Comments Makes Netanyahu Stronger","When was the last time the United States called the leader of another nation “chickenshit?” While I cannot be sure, my guess is never. That was the slur Israelis woke up to this morning—unnamed sources in the White House were calling Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu “chickenshit.” Of course, Israeli media could not use the phrase “chickenshit,” since an equivalent does not exist in the Hebrew. So they chose the term “scared coward,” not nearly as colorful (but it got its point across).

Prime Minister Netanyahu used the attack to his political advantage. He declared that he was being attacked “for defending the security of Israel.” Netanyahu went on to say that he risked his life a number of times for Israel, but that he will never risk the security of Israelis just because others think he should take risks that are not in Israel’s interest.

By this afternoon, the White House was walking back the remarks, saying that the statement was unhelpful and did not reflect the opinion of the administration. One thing was clear: Israeli officials decried the insulting words, asking when were such strong words used against “model world citizens” such as Assad of Syria.

Many Israelis agree with the characterization of Prime Minister Netanyahu, if not the words. There can be no question that Netanyahu is one of the most risk-averse Israeli prime ministers. He is one of the few prime ministers not to launch any significant military action. This summer’s war in Gaza was without question not launched by Netanyahu. He did all he could to avoid it—every step of the way, merely responding to actions by Hamas. At the same time, Netanyahu is also risk-averse when it comes to achieving peace. He truly will not take any risks—not in war, and not in peace. But what Israel’s critics, both in the U.S. administration and elsewhere fail to understand is that Netanyahu’s unwillingness to take risks reflects the views of the Israeli public, a public that has been stung by a series of concessions (perceived by many as risks for peace), which has resulted in anything but peace.

When the average Israeli looks around the Middle East today and hears the U.S. administration declaring that Israel should be “taking more risks for peace,” they just shake their heads in disbelief. That comment was made by the administration that allowed nearly 200,000 Syrians to die without even imposing a no fly zone? The same administration that does not seem to be able to stop ISIS from expanding its control in Iraq and Syria? Is that the administration that wants Israel to take further risks for peace?

Israelis never had a great deal of faith in President Obama’s foreign policy. From the time of his first speech in Cairo before the beginning of the Arab Spring, Israelis felt the president didn't understand the Middle East. That belief has only been strengthened by events across the Middle East this past two years, and America's failure to act. Still, Israelis have never referred to President Obama as “chickenshit.” If there was one word that Israelis have probably have used to describe President Obama it is probably naive. However, tonight, though Israelis both on the right and left may agree with part of the criticism of Netanyahu, most Israelis would likely want to tell the White House that “people who live in glass houses should not throw stones.”

If the goal of that unnamed White House source of sources who spoke to Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic and called Netanyahu “chickenshit” was to weaken Prime Minister Netanyahu, the view tonight from Tel Aviv is that their actions backfired, and their verbal attack just strengthened him instead.

"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-pollution/china-to-declare-war-on-pollution-premier-says-idUKBREA2405W20140305","China to 'declare war' on pollution, premier says","BEIJING (Reuters) - China is to “declare war” on pollution, Premier Li Keqiang said on Wednesday at the opening of the annual meeting of parliament, with the government unveiling detailed measures to tackle what has become a hot-button social issue.

It is not uncommon for air pollution in parts of China to breach levels considered by some experts to be hazardous. That has drawn much public ire and is a worry for the government, which fears any discontent that might compromise stability.

“We will resolutely declare war against pollution as we declared war against poverty,” Li told the almost 3,000 delegates to the country’s largely rubber-stamp legislature in a wide-ranging address carried live on state television.

Curbing pollution has become a key part of efforts to upgrade the economy, shift the focus away from heavy industry and tackle the perennial problem of overcapacity, with Li describing smog as “nature’s red-light warning against inefficient and blind development”.

“This is an acknowledgement at the highest level that there is a crisis,” said Craig Hart, expert on Chinese environmental policy and associate professor at China’s Renmin University.

“Their approach is going to have to be pro-economy. I think they will pump money into upgrading plants. This could be another green stimulus although it is not being packaged that way.”

China has published a series of policies and plans aimed at addressing environmental problems but it has long struggled to bring big polluting industries and growth-obsessed local governments to heel.

Li said efforts would focus first on reducing hazardous particulate matter known as PM 2.5 and PM 10 and would also be aimed at eliminating outdated energy producers and industrial plants, the source of much air pollution.

China will cut outdated steel production capacity by a total of 27 million tonnes this year, slash cement production by 42 million tonnes, and also shut down 50,000 small coal-fired furnaces across the country, Li said.

The 27 million tonnes of steel, equivalent to Italy’s production capacity, amounts to less than 2.5 percent of China’s total, and industry officials have warned that plants with another 30 million tonnes of annual output went into construction last year.

The targeted cement closures amount to less than 2 percent of last year’s total production.

The battle against pollution will also be waged via reforms in energy pricing to boost non-fossil fuel power. Li promised change in “the way energy is consumed and produced” through the development of nuclear and renewables, the deployment of smart power transmission grids, and the promotion of green and low-carbon technology.

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country’s economic planner, said in its report that new guidelines would be issued on relocating key industries away from urban centers to help tackle smog.

NOT JUST SMOG

China does not just suffer from smog, which has once again this winter enveloped large parts of the heavily populated east, and will this year also aim to tackle severe water and soil pollution.

The NDRC said it would also take action this year to tackle agricultural pollution, including the contamination of farmland by heavy metals, with 3.33 million hectares (8 million acres) believed to be too polluted to grow crops.

Last month, the government said it would spend 2 trillion yuan ($330 billion) on tackling pollution of scarce water resources.

Li said China would also aim to convert 333,300 hectares of marginal farmland to forest and grassland and would continue to fight desertification and recover wetlands.

The NDRC said China would seek to ensure that polluters pay by establishing a new mechanism to compensate victims of environmental damage and by holding local officials accountable.

Parliament is also mulling amendments to environmental protection legislation that will grant new powers to fine and punish offenders.

In a separate report on Wednesday, the Ministry of Finance said China would spend 21.1 billion yuan on energy conservation and environmental protection in 2014, up 7.1 percent on 2013. It said 64.9 billion yuan would be allocated to agriculture, forestry and water conservation, up 8.6 percent.","2014-03-05 03:20:02","1","27.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","43.0","36.0","0.0","99.0","0.0","6.0","0","721","94.97","52.77","16.34","3.93","27.73","28.57","71.57","38.00","4.30","0.69","0.14","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.28","3.61","5.69","15.26","6.52","1.80","5.13","0.69","10.68","4.30","1.25","0.42","5.27","2.77","4.44","1.11","3.33","0.55","0.97","0.28","3.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.35","1.11","1.25","1.80","0.69","0.55","1.94","3.05","0.97","1.53","0.42","0.83","0.14","0.28","0.00","0.42","8.18","0.83","0.83","4.85","0.55","1.39","2.22","5.41","1.39","13.73","1.25","9.15","3.33","5.55","0.28","0.28","2.08","0.28","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.01","3.61","4.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.53","1.66","0.97","1.39","0.42","3652","8.94","29.4","1134","706","32","49.04","14.1","11.9","13.98","15.0","188","11.125","21.491558073654392","384","27.0","11","0.35","0","26","43","53","1","83","66","2","1","18","139","62","0","43","0","0","10","1","25","0","0","0","27","0","44","23","15","19","5","23","4","1","0","0"

These inventions and developing technologies are some of the projects that excite top military officials and defense company executives when they contemplate advances for national security.

But when they dream of the next generation of weapons and other defense products, their visions are clouded by U.S. budget realities.

Military funding for research and development has already been cut by a fourth, and faces further erosion should lawmakers let stand the sequestration law that sets up automatic cuts in defense spending for the rest of the decade.

“Cuts in the government R&D budget are very worrisome, and it is not a long-term sustainable trend for the country,” Boeing Co (BA.N) President and Chief Operating Officer Dennis Muilenburg told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit this week.

Sequestration will be “devastating to industry in the long term,” he added, and should it lead to research cuts, in the long run it “will turn into a security issue for our country.”

The Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, Frank Kendall, last week told a defense conference that the U.S. Department of Defense’s research budget is $60 billion, down $20 billion from its peak, which he described as a major cut that threatens to delay modernization of military systems.

U.S. officials have vowed to protect research in several key areas but say that funding levels were ultimately up to lawmakers, whose reluctance to allow base closures, changes in military pay, or retirement of specific aircraft fleets has put disproportionate pressure on R&D and procurement.

“What you need to jump-start innovation is to spend more money,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute, a think tank based in Arlington, Virginia.

“From Thomas Edison to Elon Musk, the thing that got people out and innovating was the prospect of making money,” Thompson told the summit. “So if they’re not going to add any money, and right now the Budget Control Act won’t let them, then chances are we’re not going to get much more innovation.”

One risk from lower R&D spending is failing to attract talented workers by limiting the research projects that could draw them to the industry, said Marion Blakey, president of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group.

“For the first time ever, we do not have a military aircraft in development,” Blakey said. “If you are a young engineer, you want to take your talents where you’re going to see results and you’re going to see great opportunities.”

Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said the government has been trying to protect weapons funding, and is “scrubbing the research budget pretty hard” to weed out spending on projects that have little bearing on national defense.

“What we’re also trying to do is look across research and development ... to see OK, if this works, if this matures, if this comes to pass, is it going to help us?” Mabus said.

For example, Mabus pointed to new naval technologies, such as a laser weapon on the warship Ponce in the Gulf designed to deter drones or small boats.

“You shoot a missile, it costs you a million bucks or so. You shoot a laser, and it costs you about 50 cents,” Mabus said.

Boeing’s Muilenburg said that despite the government pressures, his company has increased its spending on defense research, choosing instead to cut overhead in its defense business. He eagerly ticked off a number of advances in Boeing’s defense and space business, including an unmanned liquid hydrogen-powered vehicle with water vapor emissions that he called “the ultimate clean airplane.”

Precision-guided weapons ranked as among the new technologies that excite Jerry DeMuro, who leads the U.S. operations of Britain’s BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L).

But DeMuro said the company plans to maintain its research and defense spending at its current percentage of revenue, noting the uncertainty of defense spending and where sequestration cuts will hit.

Orlando Carvalho, who leads Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) $15 billion aeronautics division, said his company had several important projects in the works, including its SR-72, an unmanned aircraft that would fly at up to six times the speed of sound. But he declined to provide any further details since those programs are classified.

“Unfortunately, not a lot I can say about it,” he told the summit.","2014-09-12 20:11:44","1","26.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","18.0","0.0","46.0","37.0","0.0","116.0","0.0","6.0","0","795","89.72","71.85","12.04","3.28","24.84","29.06","76.48","40.88","8.93","3.77","0.13","0.63","1.26","1.13","0.63","5.16","6.79","13.08","5.28","2.01","5.66","0.75","12.83","2.77","1.13","1.26","2.14","1.64","5.66","1.64","4.03","0.75","0.88","0.38","7.42","0.00","0.13","0.00","1.13","6.54","0.38","1.38","1.38","2.01","0.38","2.64","2.26","0.50","1.64","0.13","0.75","0.13","0.38","0.13","0.13","11.82","1.13","2.26","5.66","1.51","2.77","2.89","7.17","1.51","13.33","2.52","6.54","4.28","7.42","0.13","0.00","3.52","0.00","0.00","0.63","0.00","0.50","0.13","0.00","0.00","19.62","5.53","6.29","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.88","3.27","1.51","1.01","1.01","3921","8.14","31.192307692307693","1189","781","37","58.52","12.6","10.3","13.34","14.0","171","7.75","19.198002560819464","408","27.96","27","0.41","0","31","15","63","1","79","53","4","0","8","128","119","1","55","0","0","32","12","21","0","0","4","28","0","34","26","19","11","23","26","9","4","1","4"

“We don’t have enough women in either the Navy or the Marine Corps,” Mabus told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit on Wednesday as he kicked off a drive to expand the number of women in the Navy.

Women represent 18 percent of the Navy and 8 percent of the Marine Corps, Mabus said.

“I don’t know exactly what the goal ought to be, but I know those are too low,” he said.

About 200,000 women serve in the entire active duty military, or about 15 percent of that force, according to Navy Lieutenant Commander Nate Christensen. More than 280,000 women have deployed in support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past decade, Christensen said.

The military services have until January 2016 to assess which jobs are open to women after a January 2013 decision by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to allow women to serve in combat, Christensen said.

About 80,000 of an estimated 250,000 additional jobs have already been opened to women as result of those reviews.

Indeed, some of the Pentagon’s biggest programs also have fewer women than the average across the force.

Women account for 12 percent of the Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program office, but some hold very senior jobs, said spokesman Joe DellaVedova. For instance, the civilian deputy program director, Steffanie Easter, has the civilian rank equivalent to the three-star general who runs the program.

Mabus, a former Mississippi governor who has served as Navy secretary since 2009, cited the importance of a diverse force as the reason for bringing more women to the service.

“The more diverse input you have into something, the better the organization is,” Mabus said.

The Navy is developing measures it can take on its own and some that would need congressional approval, Mabus said.

For example, Mabus pointed to a pilot program that allows service members to take up to three years off without any harm to their careers, and said it might boost the retention of women.

He said the Navy would ask Congress to make the program permanent since people still fear it could be withdrawn.

“We’re looking at how ... we can retain people past 4 years or 8 years, how we can be more flexible in terms of how we manage people,” Mabus said. “So that if you need to take time off, that your career will not be harmed.”

Vice Admiral Bill Moran, chief of naval personnel, recently said the Navy was re-evaluating its recruiting, training and career management programs, including possible changes to make the current promotion system more flexible.

Mabus said the Navy was also looking more skeptically at uniforms that distinguish men from women.

“We’re not moving to put women in men’s uniforms. We’re moving to the term ‘uniform’,” he said. “We don’t want to segregate women or anybody else in any way in the military.”

Mabus has made promoting diversity a hallmark of his tenure as secretary, which included the 2011 christening of a Navy resupply ship after civil rights leader Medgar Evers.

He also cited the establishment of Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps programs at Arizona State University and Rutgers University in New Jersey, which he described as “two of the most diverse campuses in our country.”

“The force that protects a democracy should reflect the population that it protects much more than we do today,” he added.

U.S. lawmakers this week signaled support for President Barack Obama’s plan to take action against Islamic State extremists in Syria and Iraq.

For now, the Pentagon is working on the assumption that the fiscal 2016 budget will include deep spending cuts that were partially offset in 2014 and 2015, and further reductions in personnel.

But executives from Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and Boeing (BA.N), government officials and industry analysts told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit this week that more lawmakers now recognize that current global crises meant a different approach was needed - in part because of relentless lobbying by the industry.

Military leaders have warned that lower troop numbers pose a bigger security risk and could even force the abandonment of elements of Obama’s defense strategy.

“The more peaceful world that the Obama administration anticipated when their second term began has disappeared,” said Loren Thompson, analyst with the Lexington Institute think tank.

“It’s one thing to cut technology when you’re fighting enemies that have no planes and no tanks,” Thompson told the Reuters summit in Washington. “It’s quite another when your concerns have been refocused on countries like Russia and China (which) are rapidly expanding their investment in nuclear and conventional weapons, not to mention cyber.”

The Lockheed and Boeing executives, as well as government officials and industry analysts, told the Reuters Summit that resumption of the cuts would mean new business risks to major defense companies and the hundreds of firms in their supply chains.

Marion Blakey, chief executive of the Aerospace Industries Association, the industry’s largest trade group, said budget reductions and uncertainty about future funding resulted in a loss of 97,000 jobs from the U.S. defense industry between 2010 and 2013, or 11 percent. Cuts hit smaller companies particularly hard, she said.

But fiscal conservatives in Congress - the Tea Party wing that led the drive to sequestration - have started to realize that spending on defense, and on weapons systems in particular, has been cut too much, Blakey said.

“There was a lot of wishful thinking in 2010 that we could drive the budget down and still maintain a strong defense, and that’s just proven to be untrue,” she said. “Many of those members are going to have to make some tougher choices.”

Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief operating officer, said lower military spending had forced Boeing to cut about 15,000 workers in its defense and space division over three years, with more to come. The cuts were part of a drive to lower overhead by $4 billion, with another $2 billion still to come, he said.

Analyst Richard Aboulafia with the Virginia-based Teal Group said the tide was shifting away from the deficit hawks clamoring for unending military spending cuts.

“Current events are strong enough to remind people that the defense budget can’t just go back to where it was in the 1990s. Even the Tea Party is starting to lose traction with its ‘deficit first’ message,” he said.

Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of Lockheed’s aeronautics division, said his company continued to push for the repeal of the mandatory budget cuts, and hoped that U.S. lawmakers would find a way to do so.","2014-09-12 20:28:03","1","20.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","46.0","37.0","0.0","111.0","0.0","6.0","0","607","91.46","68.94","15.17","1.00","28.90","30.15","75.12","39.54","6.26","1.81","0.00","0.16","0.33","0.82","0.49","4.45","6.43","13.67","5.60","3.62","5.27","0.66","12.52","4.12","2.80","0.82","4.61","2.31","6.43","1.48","4.94","0.66","0.82","0.99","6.26","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.49","6.59","2.31","1.15","0.99","1.32","0.33","1.15","2.31","0.33","1.81","0.16","0.66","0.00","0.16","0.16","0.33","11.70","1.48","1.32","6.26","0.33","2.97","4.78","6.10","0.82","13.18","2.31","6.75","4.45","6.75","0.33","0.00","2.14","0.16","0.16","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","17.63","4.78","5.44","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.99","2.14","1.81","1.65","0.66","3077","8.73","32.63157894736842","929","600","26","56.49","14.0","11.1","14.1","15.4","150","10.625","21.240000000000002","342","29.63","19","0.39","0","25","25","48","0","73","31","7","1","6","90","91","2","49","0","0","9","7","24","1","0","0","19","0","26","30","12","14","13","8","4","0","0","4"

Boeing President and Chief Operating Officer Dennis Muilenburg rebutted the European planemaker’s view that U.S. export finance is more favorable than what European credit agencies offer.

The Ex-Im Bank “is something that’s for all industry,” he said at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit.

The Ex-Im Bank provides loans or loan guarantees for any export largely manufactured in the United States, worth up to 85 percent of its value. On Wednesday, Ex-Im Bank Chairman Fred Hochberg told Reuters that the bank would support foreign sales of U.S.-manufactured Airbus jets if they qualified with sufficient domestic content.

Muilenburg said on Thursday that Boeing fully supports the domestic content rules. “We live by them, and we are more than willing to compete on a fair and level playing field.”

Airbus is building a production complex in Mobile, Alabama, that is due to begin delivering planes in 2016.

The jets are not intended for foreign sale, so Airbus doesn’t plan to seek U.S. Ex-Im Bank support, Airbus Americas President and Chief Executive Officer Barry Eccleston told Reuters.

“Although we welcome what Chairman Hochberg said, and it kind of confirms what we had assumed, we’re not expecting in practice (to receive Ex-Im financing,)” Eccleston said.

Congress is debating whether to reauthorize the U.S. Ex-Im Bank’s charter. Boeing and others argue that the U.S. institution is crucial to their ability to compete with other nations that back their exporters. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and others have argued that U.S. Ex-Im Bank financing should not be offered to wealthy foreign carriers, since it places U.S. airlines at a competitive disadvantage.

Eccleston also said the U.S. Ex-Im Bank more actively supports Boeing than European export credit agencies support Airbus.

“We are very happy with what (European credit agencies) do for us, (but) we find that Ex-Im generally is more creative with the terms and conditions that they offer,” he said.

But Boeing’s Muilenburg said international export lending rules ensure that the credit is essentially the same in various countries.

Many companies can currently find market-rate financing that is cheaper than export-credit loans or loan guarantees. But even so, failure by Congress to reauthorize the U.S. Ex-Im Bank would put U.S. exporters at a disadvantage by removing that financing as a last resort if markets worsen, Muilenburg said.

“If we have a customer who’s evaluating options from both companies, and he can have the confidence of backstop financing from one and not the other - which is what would occur if Ex-Im is not reauthorized - then that unbalances the competition,” Muilenburg said.","2014-09-12 01:20:06","1","19.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","18.0","0.0","47.0","37.0","0.0","118.0","0.0","6.0","0","503","67.57","64.73","13.25","67.12","25.15","29.62","76.34","40.95","12.13","5.77","2.19","1.79","0.20","0.60","0.99","6.36","5.37","9.74","7.95","1.79","5.96","1.39","12.92","3.78","2.58","1.59","1.19","1.99","5.57","3.78","1.59","0.00","0.40","0.20","10.34","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.80","9.74","0.99","0.80","2.19","2.58","0.80","4.97","2.58","0.60","1.99","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","10.34","2.19","2.19","6.56","0.40","1.19","2.98","9.74","0.60","8.95","1.19","5.17","3.18","10.93","0.20","0.40","6.96","0.00","0.00","2.39","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.46","9.15","3.78","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.78","1.99","1.39","3.18","0.20","2494","8.44","27.473684210526315","775","483","35","57.47","11.4","8.7","13.85","11.2","126","4.222222222222222","17.954782608695652","249","25.68","33","0.39","0","18","6","30","0","57","30","2","0","7","53","134","3","30","0","0","18","4","19","3","0","0","10","0","16","21","7","6","17","20","5","6","0","0"

Speaking at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit, Muilenburg said the company plans to make 600 777s in the six years before it begins delivering the 777Xs, a revised version of the best-selling wide-body jet. Boeing already has booked 300 firm orders and has options for 150. So far this year, it has sold 43.

Investors have been concerned that Boeing may need to reduce its 777 production rate from the current 100 a year if it cannot sell the remaining planes.

But Muilenburg said that although the company has work to do to sell the remaining jets, a production cut during the transition, also known as a bridge, is unlikely.

“We will fill that bridge over the next six years, when the 777X comes into the market,” he said on the online Reuters Global Markets Forum. “We have made great progress this year with 43 777 sales already, and are confident we will build the full bridge.”","2014-09-11 21:02:22","1","11.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","43.0","37.0","0.0","107.0","0.0","6.0","0","238","91.05","59.96","24.22","19.50","26.44","23.11","73.11","40.34","6.72","1.68","0.00","1.26","0.00","0.42","0.00","5.04","9.66","10.92","6.72","2.10","5.88","0.84","14.29","4.62","1.68","0.42","5.88","0.84","3.36","1.26","1.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.42","8.40","0.42","2.94","1.26","1.68","0.42","2.52","2.52","0.42","2.10","0.00","0.84","0.42","0.42","0.00","0.00","8.40","1.26","2.10","4.62","1.26","0.84","4.20","8.82","2.52","15.55","1.68","5.88","7.98","6.72","0.42","0.00","3.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.13","4.20","4.20","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.68","1.68","0.00","2.52","0.42","1120","8.24","26.444444444444443","333","234","10","64.64","11.8","10.1","11.9","13.7","51","11.375","20.07794871794872","148","24.44","12","0.38","0","7","18","26","0","23","10","0","1","4","28","45","3","8","0","0","8","3","6","0","0","1","6","0","10","4","4","8","3","11","0","0","0","1"

The government was also trying to meet a budget deficit target of 5 percent of gross domestic product in 2013/14 - down from 6.2 percent the previous year - but he said it would be tough due to an expected 6 percent shortfall in revenues.

“We have a target of getting to 5 percent this year. We are working hard towards that but of course it’s a tall order, but we are determined to get there,” he said, speaking in Dar es Salam as part of the Reuters Africa Investment Summit.

Tanzania’s economy has been growing steadily at about 7 percent a year, one of the fastest in the region, but it breached last year’s deficit target of 5.5 percent - a level that had been agreed with the International Monetary Fund.

Economists suggest the government may be loosening the reins on spending because of the looming 2015 presidential and parliamentary elections. Kikwete is not allowed to run for a third term, but his CCM party is determined to continue an unbroken spell in power since independence from Britain in 1961.

How Tanzania fares in controlling the deficit will be watched closely ahead of plans for a Eurobond worth at least $700 million. The president said the debut issue planned for fiscal 2014/15 could be delayed if it proved to expensive.

“We have been working on $700 million (for the Eurobond), we will see if we can go higher than that,” he said, although he added: “We cannot say let’s borrow at any cost.”

Pricing for emerging market issuers has been climbing since the United States scaled back its bond buying programme that had prompted investors to rush into higher-yielding developing markets, including other African nations such as Rwanda.

Tanzania, where many in the nation of 45 million are still mired in poverty, could see its fortunes change in a few years because of huge offshore gas finds. Several major energy firms are involved such as BG Group BG.L, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Statoil (STL.OL), although production has yet to start.

In preparation, the government has drawn up a new gas policy that outlines plans for a sovereign wealth fund to manage any windfall. The policy also aims to balance demands by energy firms to export gas with the needs of the domestic market.

Legislation for the new fund would be presented to a new parliamentary session in October, the president said.

“We have been trying to press upon the industry that they should also think of the local market. Not all the gas should be exported,” he added, citing gas needs for power plants and factories. But he said Tanzania was not setting quotas for use.

The government, which relies on aid, is trying to become a more attractive investment destination, after it slipped further down the World Bank’s rankings on the ease of doing business. It dropped nine places to 145 in 2014 out of 189 countries.

As well as seeking to cut red tape and address other bureaucratic obstacles, the president said the authorities were working on raising the limit for foreign ownership of listed companies, now set at 60 percent.

“We are working on it,” he said, adding he expected the level to increase by 2015 although he did not say by how much.

Siam Cement, which also produces chemicals and paper, has been building cement factories in the fast-emerging economies of Cambodia, Indonesia and Myanmar where an infrastructure bonanza has pushed up demand for construction materials.

At home in Thailand, sales have slowed because of a decline in rebuilding demand after widespread flooding in 2011, and have been exacerbated by the prospect of clashes between supporters of the prime minister and protesters who allege corruption.

Siam Cement projects domestic cement demand growth of 2 percent to 3 percent this year, from 7 percent last year. That compares with the annual growth it projects in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) of 7 percent to 8 percent.

“If political crisis is prolonged, Thai cement demand is likely to be negative,” Chief Executive Kan Trakulhoon said at the Reuters ASEAN Summit on Thursday.

“ASEAN will be a growth platform for the world economy. Its attractiveness has increased significantly after Myanmar was included,” Kan said at the summit.

Myanmar is emerging from decades of military rule and isolating sanctions and has been looking to attract foreign investment since a quasi-civilian government took office in 2011. This year, the country is chairing ASEAN for the first time.

Siam Cement’s ASEAN assets reached $2.2 billion last year, or 16 percent of the total from 5 percent in 2008. The company aims for ASEAN sales to reach 30 percent from 20 percent by 2018, Kan said.

ASEAN is made up of Thailand and the hosts of its three new factories, plus Brunei, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam.

Siam Cement aims to begin production at the new factories over the next two years, raising overall capacity by 20 percent from 24 million tonnes now, Kan said.

The company then plans to double capacity in Indonesia and Myanmar within five years of beginning production, Kan said.

“We are investing more in ASEAN and less in Thailand, where we focus on high value-added products,” Kan said.

Capital expenditure could be as high as 60 billion baht ($1.84 billion) this year, beyond the 40 billion baht to 50 billion baht range previously announced, Kan said. That would compare with last year’s record 50 billion baht.

A large chunk of those funds is destined for ASEAN countries, Kan said. In Vietnam, for instance, the company expects to start building a $4.5 billion petrochemical complex in early 2015, to be completed in 2018.

Siam Cement is a century old and 30 percent owned by the Thai royal family’s Crown Property Bureau investment arm.

The company is ASEAN’s second-largest cement maker by capacity after Swiss Holcim Ltd HOLN.VX, and is the region’s biggest producer of downstream chemicals for plastics.

Shares of Siam Cement, valued at $15 billion, have fallen 12 percent over the past 12 months, versus an 11 percent fall in the benchmark index .SETI..

The widest measure of the flow of goods, services and money in and out the country is seen at around 2 percent, compared with a deficit of 1.98 percent in the previous quarter and a record of 4.4 percent in the second quarter of 2013.

“In general, we are lucky. Because the February and March, according to my BI colleague, will be a straight (trade) surplus,” Deputy Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said at the Reuters Summit on Thursday.

The natural resources based country, he added, was boosted by the recent recovery in commodity prices like crude palm oil, coal, processed nickel, as well as stronger manufacturing industry.

The G20 economy has been struggling to push down its current-account deficit to a sustainable level, as imports ramp up to meet demand of its growing middle class consumers.

Between June and November, Bank Indonesia lifted its key reference rate by 175 basis point to calm anxious investors from selling Indonesian assets on growing fears about the country’s ability to fund the economy.

Some analysts and offshore investors then raised concerns on the possibility of better trade performance after the government in January imposed a ban on ore exports.

“The effect of the export ban is on the ore and not on processed minerals (which) can still be exported on export fees,” Brodjonegoro said, adding that the new policy will slash the country’s annual trade value by $5 billion.

The ministry also projected that the consumer price index will rise at a much slower pace in March, against the previous month, due to the start of harvest season.

Bank Indonesia forecast annual inflation will be at around 3.5-5.5 percent this year, easing from 7.75 percent a year ago.

The statistics bureau will announce inflation and trade data on April 1.

Freeport and fellow U.S. miner Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N) have halted copper concentrate shipments since January, refusing to pay an escalating export tax that they say breaches their contracts.

“We have solved the problem,” Deputy Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said at the Reuters ASEAN Summit. “We will link the export tax, which is more like an export fee, on to the progress of the smelter development.”

The final government regulation is expected to be published in the next few weeks, allowing Freeport to resume copper exports by the end of next month, he said.","2014-03-27 12:42:16","1","10.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","44.0","37.0","0.0","102.0","0.0","6.0","0","133","97.70","83.59","10.68","15.24","26.60","28.57","67.67","33.08","6.02","3.76","0.00","1.50","0.00","0.75","1.50","2.26","9.02","11.28","6.02","0.00","0.75","0.00","9.77","5.26","1.50","1.50","0.00","1.50","0.75","0.00","0.75","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.27","0.00","0.75","0.00","1.50","6.02","2.26","2.26","2.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.26","0.00","2.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.53","1.50","1.50","6.77","0.00","0.75","3.01","5.26","1.50","14.29","0.00","5.26","9.02","12.03","0.00","0.00","5.26","1.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","24.81","8.27","6.02","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.50","3.01","0.75","4.51","0.75","670","8.72","34.0","199","130","9","65.32","10.5","7.7","13.74","11.5","36","5.125","18.836923076923078","99","30.75","10","0.35","0","1","0","12","0","12","8","0","0","2","28","31","1","7","0","0","4","1","0","1","0","0","4","0","5","3","3","5","3","3","2","0","0","0"

With global use of yuan exploding in trade and investment in recent years, ICBC hopes to be the bank that clears yuan trades in the Americas, said Wu Bin, general manager at ICBC’s International Banking Department.

“The overseas renminbi business cannot be overlooked,” Wu said in an interview at the Reuters China Summit. “We will try to be selected as the yuan clearing bank in more countries.”

Already the authorized bank for clearing yuan trades in Luxembourg and Singapore, ICBC plans to set up new branches in about another 10 countries in regions including north Africa, southeast Asia and central and eastern Europe, Wu said.

Underscoring the rising importance of the yuan, business related to the currency accounted for more than a fifth of ICBC’s overseas profits so far this year, Wu said.

In the first nine months of this year, ICBC’s overseas units saw profits surge by nearly 50 percent compared with the same period in 2013.

Driven by China’s ambitions to grow the yuan into a global currency to temper the dollar’s dominance and reduce the foreign exchange risks faced by Chinese companies, worldwide usage of the renminbi has spiked in recent years.

It overtook the euro to become the second-most-used currency in trade finance in 2013, spurring big Chinese banks to fight for a bigger share of the booming trade.

VENTURING ABROAD

Wu said ICBC would focus on providing financing support and services to Chinese companies looking to venture abroad and to multinational firms that want to do business in China.”One of our main priorities is to follow Chinese firms and venture abroad,” he said.

China’s non-financial direct outbound investment jumped about 22 percent to $75 billion in the first nine months this year compared with the year-ago period, and is projected to rise at least 10 percent annually for the next five years.

While there are barriers today with regards to global usage of the yuan, which cannot be freely transferred in and out of China, Wu was confident that things would change over time.

“We all understand that the process of yuan internationalization is gradual, and it will move toward greater freedom as China opens up,” Wu said.","2014-10-29 08:30:18","1","19.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","42.0","36.0","0.0","98.0","0.0","6.0","0","438","98.77","65.96","39.52","51.40","31.29","24.89","76.71","38.81","4.11","1.14","0.00","0.68","0.00","0.46","0.00","2.97","7.53","18.26","4.34","1.37","4.34","0.46","9.59","4.79","3.65","0.23","4.11","2.28","3.20","2.28","0.91","0.23","0.68","0.00","4.57","0.23","0.00","0.23","0.68","4.34","0.68","0.68","1.14","0.91","0.46","0.68","2.51","0.46","2.05","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.48","0.91","2.28","2.28","0.68","0.23","3.42","6.16","1.14","19.63","2.28","11.64","5.94","9.36","0.23","0.00","9.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.84","3.42","5.02","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.14","1.83","1.60","1.37","0.46","2090","8.35","34.23076923076923","637","432","15","50.7","13.9","13.3","12.6","16.8","90","17.333333333333332","21.85333333333334","228","29.92","13","0.39","0","15","14","37","1","64","40","5","2","4","65","54","2","30","0","0","6","2","10","0","1","2","18","0","20","15","11","9","6","9","2","0","0","0"

The Stock Connect scheme, considered a milestone in the liberalization of China’s capital markets, would allow global investors for the first time to trade China shares via Hong Kong, while giving mainland investors access to Hong Kong-listed stocks.

Despite huge foreign appetite for Chinese stocks, and estimates that the scheme could generate more than $3 billion of additional trade a day, banks and brokers had complained to regulators last week about the lack of clarity over the scheme rules.

On Sunday Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (0388.HK), said it had not received regulatory approval but was unable to say why, or when it might get the green light.

While investors remain hopeful that the link-up will eventually go ahead, market professionals speaking at a Reuters China Summit said resolving the capital gains tax issue was critical.

Hong Kong does not charge capital gains tax, but China levies 10 percent, as well as 5.6 percent tax on business profits, and it is not clear how gains would be treated under the proposed scheme.

“This is a significant issue that perhaps was underestimated,” said Brian Ingram, Chief Investment Officer at Russell Ping An Investment.

“If you don’t understand the cost of liquidity, i.e. the capital gains tax you are expected to pay, your ability to weigh the benefits of those decisions, to decide what type of arbitrage trades to place, and, just as importantly, your ability to try to hedge that tax exposure, is very, very limited.”

That would hit trading volumes, said Mark Austen, Chief Executive Officer of the Asia Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA), an industry body.

“A lot of investors will be reluctant to use the link because they are not sure what their tax liability will be and how it will be calculated,” he said.

ASIFMA had said back in August in a letter sent to China’s State Administration of Taxation that lack of transparency on the tax issue would limit participation.

For the Chinese government, however, an exemption from capital gains tax for Stock Connect could undermine other cross-border investment schemes.

And though China’s 10 percent gains tax on non-resident institutions is low compared with other major financial centers, collecting the tax could be complicated.

Xiaofeng Zhong, CEO for North Asia at Amundi Asset Management, said his fund managers were interested in the program but would want to monitor operations before using the trading system.

Shelly Painter, Regional Managing Director for Asia at Vanguard, said that once the tax regime was known, investors could make an informed decision: “It’s the uncertainty that is a problem.”

Some banks had been hiring traders in anticipation of the extra business, but were now having to temper their expectations.

Lee Cook, head of cash equity for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), which was among those hiring in recent months, said: “What irks me, and the rest of industry, is the lack of a roadmap towards a launch date.”

Cook said the bank had trained people for the stock connect and they were now being directed to work on other things.","2014-10-28 11:35:10","1","23.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","18.0","0.0","46.0","37.0","0.0","117.0","0.0","6.0","0","597","90.45","58.61","12.41","28.56","31.42","25.13","79.40","41.88","6.20","1.84","0.17","0.00","0.67","0.34","0.67","4.36","7.37","13.40","8.21","3.02","4.69","0.84","14.74","2.51","1.51","1.51","1.84","1.34","3.85","2.01","1.84","0.34","0.50","0.50","5.86","0.17","0.17","0.00","0.50","12.56","2.51","2.01","3.35","1.68","0.34","3.35","3.52","1.34","2.18","0.00","1.17","0.34","0.17","0.00","0.67","9.72","0.50","2.85","4.52","1.84","1.34","4.86","6.20","2.01","11.73","0.84","7.20","4.02","13.07","0.50","0.34","8.71","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","17.42","3.85","7.20","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.17","1.68","1.01","1.68","0.50","2912","8.56","35.529411764705884","895","588","23","53.95","14.1","12.1","13.18","15.8","136","15.666666666666666","21.49170068027211","345","31.94","10","0.39","0","16","10","49","0","66","35","1","0","14","107","90","3","40","0","0","11","6","21","0","0","1","19","0","30","30","11","15","7","12","2","3","0","5"

About 15 percent China’s trade was settled in yuan in the first nine months of 2014, up from less than 1 percent in 2009, when internationalization was seen as a way for firms to reduce currency risks and challenge the U.S. dollar as the key reserve currency.

But the pace of growth is steadying as interest among overseas investors in holding yuan wanes due to the absence of a deep offshore yuan market, and capital controls that restrict access to onshore investment, said Cheng Jun, general manager of global trade services department at Bank of China.

“Future renminbi (yuan) internationalization hinges on government policy on capital account opening. How far it could go and how fast it could go is related to this,” Cheng said in an interview at the Reuters China Summit.

“Renminbi internationalization is bringing about big opportunities for Chinese financial institutions,” he said.

China’s main foreign exchange bank is vying for more revenues from increased use of the yuan in settlements of trade and investment deals, he added.

The bank aims to maintain its lead in yuan settlements in China’s trade, with a nearly 30 percent share, Cheng said.

The bank is also keen to be the authorized bank for clearing yuan trade in more countries, after winning that status in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Paris and Frankfurt, Cheng said.

But it may take some time for New York to become an offshore yuan trading center given the reluctance among U.S. firms to accept the yuan as a settlement currency, he said.

“The US dollar remains a dominant currency and US companies certainly want to use the dollar. Pushing RMB settlements in the United States could be more difficult than other countries,” he said.

CAPITAL CONTROLS

Deputy central bank head Hu Xiaolian said earlier this month that China aims to quicken the process of making the yuan convertible on the capital account and will allow foreign investors to use the currency to invest in Chinese financial institutions.

But Cheng expects the government to take a “step-by-step” approach in easing capital curbs. Analysts have long warned that any rush to dismantle capital curbs could expose the world’s second-largest to currency speculators.

While the yuan is already convertible under the current account for trade in goods and services, the capital account, which covers portfolio investment and borrowing, is still closely managed by the government.

“If we cannot create a proper channel under the capital account for money to flow in and out (China) and allow (investors) to convert their money, it could hamper further development of the offshore RMB market,” Cheng said.

“The offshore RMB market is not liquid and deep enough. Investors need to see whether the currency is stable and whether they have proper investment channels and get returns.”

China has never set a hard target for a freely traded yuan, although the central bank had outlined a goal of making it ‘basically convertible’ by 2015. That rhetoric has been toned down and now analysts are looking to 2020.

Overseas investors, including selected foreign central banks, can only invest their yuan holdings in China’s sheltered stock and debt market via a qualified investor scheme. A stock connect scheme linking the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges was put on hold without explanation earlier this week.","2014-10-29 10:45:27","1","23.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","44.0","36.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","6.0","0","611","96.67","57.78","23.65","46.91","25.46","27.00","77.41","39.77","4.58","1.64","0.00","0.49","0.00","0.65","0.49","2.95","8.02","15.55","5.24","2.13","5.73","0.65","10.97","3.76","2.45","0.98","1.96","1.64","2.78","1.96","0.82","0.33","0.16","0.00","4.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.82","8.02","1.15","2.29","1.64","0.82","0.33","2.13","2.45","0.49","1.64","0.33","0.16","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.53","0.98","1.31","3.93","1.47","0.98","3.60","5.89","0.65","15.71","2.45","9.49","3.93","10.97","0.33","0.00","12.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.57","4.58","4.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.82","2.13","1.15","1.31","0.16","2996","8.41","26.91304347826087","922","606","26","56.29","12.9","11.2","12.89","14.5","139","17.5","20.494917491749177","309","24.43","15","0.38","0","22","10","53","1","77","50","3","1","8","122","63","1","36","0","0","11","5","15","4","0","1","22","0","33","19","15","15","7","20","3","0","0","2"

But this year there’s a major stumbling block to concerted global action. The most vocal climate change skeptic in the Group of 20 leading industrialized nations is its current host, Australia.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has tempered his public rhetoric since 2009 when he said the science behind climate change was “crap”. But he has left the issue off the agenda for the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Brisbane on Nov. 15-16.

Abbott has dismayed environmentalists, renewable energy companies and countries with a string of decisions since his conservative government came to power last year, including scrapping a carbon tax introduced by the previous Labor government.

His treasurer, Joe Hockey, drew derision earlier this week when he told a reporter that claims Australia is one of the dirtiest countries were “absolutely ridiculous”. Yet data shows Australia is the developed world’s highest carbon emitter per capita.

“The problem for Australia is that the rest of the world is now moving forward,” Mark Butler, member of parliament and environment spokesman for the opposition Labor Party, told the Reuters Global Climate Change Summit.

Australia’s stance, particularly attempts by the government to cut the country’s renewable energy target, would have a “devastating impact” on investment in Australia’s sustainable power generation industry, he said.

“The U.S. and China in particular seem determined to do everything they can to ... sign an ambitious global agreement,” Butler said.

“Australia really does run the risk of being left in the room with Canada ... and a pretty small group of nations that stubbornly hold out on participating in a broad process, and that’s going to be politically very damaging for Australia.”

Abbott’s office did not respond to repeated telephone calls from Reuters seeking comment.

FISCAL IMPACT

The United States and several European countries have pressured Australia to put climate change on the G20 Summit agenda, but Abbott has repeatedly said the issue does not fit the meeting’s economic focus - a stance supported by Canada.

“The focus of the G20 will overwhelmingly be our economic security, our financial stabilization, the importance of private sector-led growth,” Abbott told reporters earlier this year.

He has agreed to put energy efficiency on the agenda following discussions with U.S. president Barack Obama. Whether other countries hijack sessions to cover climate change or talk in the corridors remains to be seen.

The United States says climate change is inextricably intertwined with economic and financial issues such as those highlighted by Abbott.

Shaun Donovan, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, told the Reuters summit that combating climate change was imperative for fiscal reasons.

Speaking in Washington, Donovan said the cost of climate change-related events on the federal budget is enormous.

Among other incidences, he noted a drought in the United States in 2012 that was the most severe since the 1930s, and the roughly $65 billion spent after Hurricane Sandy struck in the same year.

In Australia, climate change is a major threat to food security in a country that has talked about becoming a “food bowl” for Asia. It also complicates a government plan to increase agricultural production to meet an expected doubling in global food demand by 2050.

As the only developed nation dominated by an arid climate, Australia faces more variability in rainfall, prolonged droughts and a greater incidence of extreme weather events, the country’s flagship scientific body CSIRO said.

“As a country that’s very, very vulnerable in an ecosystem sense to climate change, we have to be seen to do our part because we expect relatively poorer countries like China and much poorer countries like India to do something as well,” Labor’s Butler said.

TARGET TALKS

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Environment at a Glance 2013 report found Australia had the highest per-capita emissions among developed nations, emitting nearly 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person in 2010.

Furthermore, a report last month from consultancy PwC found that major economies are falling behind every year in terms of meeting the rate of carbon emission reductions needed to stop temperatures rising more than 2 degrees this century.

Against that backdrop, Abbott in July repealed a tax on climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions for its 350 biggest companies, saying the scheme was too costly while achieving little in terms of emission cuts.

He also cut funding to the CSIRO and abolished the independent Climate Commission, a body created by the previous government to provide public information on the effects of global warming.

The government is now negotiating with the opposition to cut Australia’s renewable energy target (RET). Electricity use has fallen in the past five years because of rising bills and cheaper renewable energy options such as rooftop solar. That, the government says, renders outdated an RET of 20 percent of projected energy use in 2020.

Changing the target, however, would have a “devastating impact,” said Labor’s Butler. “It would largely kill any chance of significant new investment.”

Australian Climate Change Minister Greg Hunt initially accepted an invitation to the Reuters summit, but pulled out citing other engagements.

Speaking at the Reuters commodities summit, Trafigura’s chief financial officer Pierre Lorinet said supply cuts were likely if the prices remained around current depressed levels.

Until now, large miners have kept output at high levels despite a slump in demand. Major producers have mitigated the impact of falling prices by increasing production, but Lorinet said at some point in 2015 this would change.

“We haven’t seen out of the two main exporters, Indonesia and Australia, any significant supply side cuts but eventually that will start coming and I think Indonesia is the first market where we’re going to see some reduction in exports,” Lorinet said.

“In Indonesia a lot of the producers have got a significant amount of debt so it’s still today better for them to keep running and try to cut costs by increasing production rather than stopping outright but that might change at some point if it continues at that price level.”

Lorinet added that there was no sign coal prices would move higher “anytime soon.”

Mercuria’s chief executive Marco Dunand shared this view.

“I’m not seeing any particular sign of production being curtailed so I think it’s going to take a bit longer than people originally thought and it’s difficult to see a strong price recovery, if any, before 2016.”

Prices for Australian thermal coal cargoes for delivery next month from the Newcastle export terminal, a benchmark for the Asia-Pacific region, have more than halved since 2011, hitting 5-year lows of $62 per ton at the end of October as rising output has been met by stalling demand.

DARK CLOUD

Mercuria’s Dunand added that China’s push to reduce pollution was “not very supportive of coal.”

China, the world’s largest consumer and importer of coal, has said it will restrict imports and the sale of coal with high ash and high sulfur content starting from January 2015, in a bid to tackle air pollution.

Vitol’s chief executive Ian Taylor said a key question for energy traders was how quickly China could shift to a gas driven energy economy.

“There are some genuine environmental issues which I think the Chinese want to solve and want to sort out. That’s got to have an impact on fossil fuel demand,” Taylor said.

Gunvor’s chief executive Torbjorn Tornqvist also said he was not optimistic about the short term outlook for coal, partly due to China’s environmental concerns, and he expected prices could stay at current levels or dip further.

“I get depressed myself thinking about coal,” Tornqvist said.","2014-11-04 15:24:41","1","21.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","43.0","36.0","0.0","100.0","0.0","6.0","0","464","89.68","44.01","59.31","41.35","25.78","22.63","74.14","38.58","5.39","2.37","1.29","0.43","0.00","0.43","0.22","3.02","5.17","14.44","6.68","3.88","5.17","1.29","16.16","4.96","2.59","0.65","2.16","3.23","3.02","1.94","1.08","0.00","0.00","0.65","4.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.43","12.07","1.72","2.37","2.37","4.09","0.00","3.66","3.88","1.72","2.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.41","0.86","1.29","4.31","1.72","0.43","4.96","8.41","1.94","18.53","3.45","9.27","6.03","3.66","0.22","0.00","3.66","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.16","3.88","4.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.65","3.02","3.23","0.43","0.43","2261","8.5","34.214285714285715","681","461","18","53.95","13.1","12.1","12.83","15.6","105","8.2","21.350629067245123","276","30.93","9","0.39","0","14","9","38","0","61","37","3","1","7","86","46","1","28","0","0","16","0","18","1","0","1","12","0","19","23","16","12","15","9","1","0","0","2"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-summit-realestate/no-silver-bullet-to-tackle-building-emissions-cbre-idUSKCN0I531120141017","No silver bullet to tackle building emissions: CBRE","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tackling carbon emissions in U.S. commercial buildings will require a range of everyday measures, not technology, as a solution, said an executive at CBRE CBG.N, the world’s largest commercial real estate services company.

Since most buildings are currently being operated less efficiently than when they were built, changing day-to-day operations plays a big role in addressing inefficient energy use, David Pogue, global director of corporate responsibility, said in at interview at Reuters Global Climate Change Summit.

CBRE manages more than 3.5 billion square feet of space globally.

Residential and commercial buildings account for almost 39 percent of total U.S. energy consumption and 38 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to the Department of Energy.

But Pogue said it is difficult to target emissions from buildings as a monolithic sector, because it is fragmented by nature, with a variety of different building owners and tenants.

“We are looking for this silver bullet - this one thing we could just do - but we can’t,” said Pogue.

“What we can do is to go back and evaluate where you are, benchmark the building, get it back to original design specifications and work with the tenant base.”

Unlike places such as Shanghai and Dubai, where there is a rush of construction of state-of-the-art, energy efficient buildings, the bulk of building stock in the United States is older.

In the United States, Pogue said, the expectation 10 years ago had been that replacing the existing building stock with new green-oriented buildings would make a major dent in commercial and residential emissions.

After the economic downturn, he said, the rate of replacing old building stock with new, greener buildings fell to 0.6 percent per year from 2 percent.

“What was going to be the panacea to this was that we were going to build our way out of it,” Pogue said. “We need to turn our focus on existing building stock.”

Many held signs calling for an end to fracking.

Environmental activists see the U.S. natural gas and oil production boom, spurred by fracking, as a major contributor to global warming. Obama has lauded the country’s shale boom as an economic boon and a geopolitical lever.

But Obama administration officials told the Reuters Global Climate Change Summit this week that the United States can be an energy superpower and still provide global leadership on climate.

“Whatever you do, you have people who are going to drive their cars,” said Jonathan Pershing, the Energy Department’s deputy assistant secretary for climate change policy. “You have people who want to heat their homes and you’re not going to turn those things off.”

Since it is impossible to immediately stop all use of fossil fuels use, the administration has focused on developing the country’s energy resources while also moving toward a lower-carbon economy, he said.

The White House’s goal is to “make that transition work in a way that maintains reliability and reduces emissions,” Pershing said.

U.S. oil and gas production has soared as drilling techniques including hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, unlocked access to massive shale reserves.

Surging shale output has put the United States on track to pass Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest producer of crude oil and to become a major exporter of natural gas.

The Environmental Protection Agency is working to cut carbon emissions from the country’s largest source, power plants. Still, green groups warn that those gains could vanish without reductions in methane emissions from oil and gas production.

Environmentalists have urged the EPA to issue mandatory curbs on the industry’s emissions of the potent greenhouse gas.

“We don’t want to see the continuation of the high levels of (methane) leakage that erode the benefit of the power plant standard,” David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said last month after a coalition of green groups sent a letter to the White House calling for federal methane standards.

Shaun Donovan, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, said methane is now a “significant focus” of the administration.

“We are looking very, very closely at this issue and studying it in detail,” Donovan said at the summit, held at Reuters’ offices in Washington.

Janet McCabe, acting assistant administrator for air and radiation at the EPA, who would oversee any potential rule making on methane, said the agency expects to release recommendations later this fall.

She did not say whether the agency is leaning toward a voluntary or regulatory approach, but expressed confidence that the government and the gas industry would be able to bring methane leaks under control.

“EPA is convinced that development of natural gas can and should be done in a way that’s safe and captures to a significant degree methane emissions,” said McCabe.

European Commissioner for Climate Action Connie Hedegaard gestures as she gives a lecture in Tsinghua University in Beijing, April 23, 2014.REUTERS/China Daily

European Union leaders have set themselves a deadline of the end of October to agree on green energy goals for 2030 to follow on from 2020 policy.

Provided they agree, the EU will be the first major bloc to set out its position ahead of a U.N. conference in Paris in 2015 to negotiate an international pact on curbing global warming.

“There should not be problems that could not be overcome,” European Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Deauville, northern France.

“It should be feasible to agree on a 40 percent domestic greenhouse gas target and a very strong signal on efficiency and renewables,” she said.

“A lot of details will follow, but then we will have the skeleton on which we can build.”

If the EU leaders do not agree, Hedegaard said they would be responsible for destroying momentum toward a new global deal, which she said would still be “tremendously difficult” to reach.

Looking back to the failed Copenhagen U.N. summit in 2009, Hedegaard said the U.N. Paris conference was “going to be yet another nightmare but hopefully this time it could end well” as the United States and China edge toward action and pressure from citizens demanding change builds.

TRIPLE GOALS

The European Commission, the EU executive, has outlined three targets for 2030 - to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent versus 1990 levels, to improve energy efficiency to 30 percent compared with business as usual and to increase the share of renewable energy in the mix to 27 percent.

Poland, which depends on coal for most of its energy, has been prominent in complaining about the cost of increasing the emissions cutting target to 40 percent from a 20 percent goal for 2020.

Other EU states also have “legitimate concerns,” Hedegaard said.

A briefing paper, seen by Reuters, prepared ahead of a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Oct. 23-24, showed Britain had concerns about increasing energy efficiency, while Germany said a deal should not be done at any price.

For Hedegaard, energy efficiency is the most logical step, especially as the crisis between Russia and Ukraine focuses the EU on the need to reduce dependency on imported Russian gas.

Environment campaigners say Britain’s issue with energy saving is partly because it has committed to a major investment in nuclear power, which needs high demand to justify it.

The European Commission earlier this month approved Britain’s plans to finance the new nuclear plant to be built at Hinkley Point in southwest England and operated by French utility EDF. (EDF.PA)

EDF will receive a guaranteed power price of 92.50 pounds($149) per megawatt-hour for 35 years, more than twice the current market rate.

Hedegaard was one of five out of 28 commissioners who voted against the Commission’s approval.

“It’s no secret that I was not in favor of that decision,” Hedegaard said. “I just think at a time when we are heading toward a system where we want subsidies for renewables to be cut, it is not the right signal,” she said. “I would also be concerned about prices for the energy consumers in Britain.”

BEWG, China’s biggest water company, said water treatment plants in cities have mostly been built up and there is limited scope for new developments going forward, unlike in rural areas.

At the end of 2010, more than 400 million residents in China’s rural area, or nearly 30 percent of the population, had no access to a centralized public water supply. More than 20 percent of them drew water directly from rivers and ponds, according to a government report.

“Water infrastructure in rural residential areas is in serious shortage, and that will be a great opportunity for Chinese water companies and private investment,” Zhang Zhenpeng, managing director of BEWG International, the Singapore-based unit of the company in charge of its overseas operations.

There are abundant challenges to building proper water infrastructure in rural areas and small towns. Residential clusters are often scattered, the cost of running small water treatment plants is high, while residents and government are often incapable of paying to build plants and pipes.

China is home to a fifth of the world’s population but has just 7 percent of its water resources. Besides poor infrastructure in rural areas, its limited natural water supply has been diminished by poor management.

China said last month that almost 60 percent of its groundwater was polluted, following earlier reports of river and lake water blighted by algae blooms, bubbling chemical spills and untreated sewage discharge.

BEWG is also doing research and development on water plants specifically designed for small towns, which will boast features such as automated operation. It is also looking into establishing feasible business models for expanding into rural areas, Zhang said.

Hong Kong-listed BEWG, valued at $5.9 billion, has an estimated 4 percent of China’s water market based on treatment capacity. Almost all its operations are in urban areas, he said.","2014-10-16 14:50:36","1","14.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","44.0","37.0","0.0","103.0","0.0","6.0","0","347","91.32","57.99","22.30","35.86","24.79","27.09","70.89","37.46","3.75","0.86","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.58","2.88","4.03","14.41","6.63","3.75","5.48","0.29","9.80","6.05","2.02","0.29","3.46","2.59","2.31","1.44","0.86","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.75","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.29","5.76","0.00","1.15","0.29","2.31","0.86","1.44","1.44","0.29","1.15","0.00","5.19","0.00","0.86","0.00","4.32","7.78","0.29","1.73","5.48","1.15","0.00","2.88","4.61","1.15","15.56","1.44","11.82","2.88","7.49","0.29","1.44","2.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.70","4.32","6.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.86","0.58","1.15","1.15","0.29","1800","9.11","25.142857142857142","581","344","16","41.19","13.6","12.9","14.21","14.9","96","13.5","21.76279069767442","205","23.43","6","0.36","0","14","12","17","0","48","40","3","1","2","65","31","1","35","0","0","3","6","11","0","0","1","5","0","3","11","12","12","6","10","1","0","0","0"

After the failure of other strategies, like its purchase of an African uranium mine, it has had to sell assets and slash investment to cut net debt of 4.7 billion euros - which narrowly escaped a downgrade to junk status last week.

Frustrated by Areva’s mistakes, the French government plans to impose a new governance structure by the end of the year. Critics say many of the company’s problems stem from the size, cost and complexity of its huge 1650 megawatt EPR reactor, ill suited to the small grids and budgets of developing countries that are the main source of market growth.

In an interview as part of the Reuters Global Climate Change Summit, Oursel stuck to his company’s current strategy, saying big reactors still made more sense because they were safer, provided more capacity on the same surface area, and offered economies of scale.

“Once you have a site, you have an interest in installing as much capacity on it as possible,” Oursel said.

The EPR - the sole model Areva is building at the moment - is so huge because of its multiple safety features, such as a 1.8 metre thick plane-crash resistant second hull, aimed at containing the consequences of a major accident like Fukushima or a 9/11-style attack.

The company is currently working on a proposal to build six EPRs in Jaitapur, India, which has been delayed by local protest and the run-up to elections in May. Areva is negotiating with the state-owned Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL). No other competitors are in the running for this site.

“We waited for the election, now discussion can restart,” Oursel said.

Areva also hopes to sell more EPRs in China, where two EPRs are under construction in southern Taishan. It is set to sell two more to Britain as part of a 16 billion pounds (25.61 billion US dollar) deal to build two reactors in Hinkley Point, Britain.

Two further EPRs under construction in France and Finland have been plagued by multi-year delays and cost overruns as the company underestimated the complexity of building a completely new reactor model.

Against that background, Areva has been working on a smaller reactor in an attempt to broaden its offer. It is now waiting for approval from the Turkish parliament in order to go ahead with a $22 billion build of 4 1100MW ‘Atmea1’ reactors that it developed with Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T).

If that project proves successful it hopes to sell more of this kind of reactor to Vietnam.

BUSINESS MODEL CRITICISED

Areva also mines uranium, produces and recycles nuclear fuel, and services its own and other vendors’ reactors.

France’s public auditor has criticised Areva for this integrated business model, saying it saw few synergies between the firm’s different activities, though it did not specify why.

Oursel said the strategy was valid because fuel sales provide a steady income when new construction projects are slow.

Referring to the new reactors being built around the world, he said: “Those 70 reactors under construction will consume uranium,” and added that some 80 percent of Areva’s revenue comes from servicing existing plants, including those built by other vendors.

Areva services some 300 of the 440 reactors in operation around the world.

Oursel shot down the idea of a merger with EDF to create a single French nuclear player, a suggestion mooted by outgoing EDF chief executive Henri Progli. Progli will be replaced by the current head of defence electronics firm Thales Jean-Bernard Levy next month.

“It is a sound business principle not to get into your client’s business,” he said, pointing out that other utilities companies would be reluctant to negotiate fuel supply contracts with a combined EDF-Areva group because it would give EDF insight in their business requirements.

EDF and Areva have had a difficult relationship as Proglio and Oursel’s predecessor Anne Lauvergeon did not get along, and EDF has bought more nuclear fuel from foreign suppliers.

In an attempt to control future strategy at Areva, the government has said it will replace the company’s current supervisory board, to which Oursel reports, with an executive board that would have more power to vet decisions by the chief executive, who would report to it.

Industry and government sources have told Reuters that Oursel may not survive that reshuffle. A top corporate source with close government connections told Reuters this month he thought Oursel had a less than 50 percent chance to hang on to his job.

Oursel declined to discuss the topic of his succession.","2014-10-16 14:15:31","1","29.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","44.0","37.0","0.0","109.0","0.0","6.0","0","861","95.80","61.44","14.43","25.77","26.91","26.95","74.22","40.53","6.62","1.74","0.12","0.23","0.35","0.81","0.23","4.88","7.78","15.21","5.81","2.09","4.07","0.70","9.87","5.46","2.90","0.81","3.83","2.56","3.02","1.51","1.51","0.23","0.58","0.12","4.99","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.93","8.36","1.16","3.48","1.05","1.28","0.23","1.86","1.63","0.12","1.16","0.23","0.35","0.12","0.23","0.00","0.00","7.90","0.58","1.86","4.65","0.58","1.05","3.02","6.16","1.05","13.36","1.39","7.78","4.18","6.74","0.12","0.00","3.02","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.52","3.95","4.76","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.74","1.05","1.39","1.16","0.35","4166","8.49","27.34375","1280","847","36","56.08","13.7","11.3","12.77","14.5","198","8.3","20.75064935064935","446","24.94","21","0.4","0","18","34","76","0","108","79","9","0","10","154","108","2","47","0","0","19","12","21","1","0","2","27","0","31","29","20","21","14","23","6","1","0","3"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commodities-summit-freepoint-metals/freepoint-starts-base-metals-trading-focus-on-asia-idUSKBN0IQ2ME20141106","Freepoint starts base metals trading, focus on Asia","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Freepoint Commodities has started trading physical base metals betting on growing demand in China, a senior executive said, as a financing scam forces some banks to scale back business in the world’s top consumer.

Just over two years after the upstart commodities merchant’s first foray into the niche copper and zinc concentrates markets, global metals trading chief Philip Bacon has launched a push into handling refined metals, he told the Reuters Commodities Summit this week.

The emphasis is on Asia, in particular China, he said.

The move marks the latest expansion by the Stamford, Connecticut-based firm to build a physical commodities business since it was set up four years ago by former Sempra oil executives.

Freepoint entered the metals trading in 2012 when it bought JPMorgan Chase & Co’s (JPM.N) metals concentrates trading unit which was run by Bacon. Concentrates are a type of intermediate product that smelters use as raw material to make refined metals.

That deal reunited Bacon with his former Sempra compatriots and former Sempra boss David Messer, who is now Freepoint chief.

Out of the firm’s 250 staff, about 30 full-time employees are in the base metals business, which includes the structured finance and trading operations.

The move also comes as the metal industry reels from the high-profile financing scam in China’s Qingdao port that involved metal being used multiple times as collateral for loans.

The scandal has tightened credit and left some banks and trading firms exposed to more than $1.2 billion in losses, forcing some to wind up or stop financing deals altogether.

Freepoint was not involved in those so-called repo deals which give companies access to short-term credit in exchange for goods, and is not affected by the Qingdao scandal, Bacon said.

“(Qingdao) has repercussions right across the board. I think the banks have withdrawn because of the fear factor,” he said.

The retreat has deflated copper premiums, which were bolstered for years by the buying interest from these financing deals.

“That model of financing is coming to an end. It will return the market more to the fundamentals,” he said.","2014-11-06 22:25:33","1","19.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","43.0","37.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","6.0","0","356","96.26","59.99","27.52","30.52","22.25","24.72","72.19","37.64","5.90","1.69","0.28","0.00","0.00","1.40","0.00","4.21","8.43","13.76","5.06","1.97","4.21","0.56","13.76","5.90","3.93","1.69","2.25","1.69","1.40","0.84","0.56","0.28","0.00","0.28","4.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.40","7.02","1.12","3.09","0.00","1.40","0.56","1.12","1.69","0.00","1.40","0.00","1.97","0.00","0.84","0.00","1.12","6.18","0.28","0.84","4.49","0.56","0.56","5.90","6.18","0.56","16.29","2.53","7.30","6.74","9.27","0.00","0.00","8.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.73","4.78","4.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.69","1.12","1.40","1.69","0.56","1761","8.57","22.625","535","350","18","60.24","12.1","9.7","13.23","13.1","88","12.25","19.81714285714286","216","21.12","5","0.39","0","7","8","37","0","40","21","2","1","1","66","38","0","35","0","0","8","1","8","0","0","3","8","0","7","17","10","13","9","14","6","1","0","1"

Near term, low stocks and changing shipping regulations in the United States and Europe are likely to boost refinery runs, as buyers globally fill winter demand and seek what analysts estimate will be an extra 250,000 barrels per day in distillates for the shipping industry.

“The refineries are going to run hard,” Vitol [VITOLV.UL] Chief Executive Ian Taylor said. “We do need to get a lot of distillates into stock ... We don’t see high stock levels throughout the world.”

In recent weeks the United States and China, products exporters in recent years, have imported distillates, the former due to low heating oil stocks and an extended maintenance season and the latter to take advantage of low prices.

A delay in diesel output from the Petrobras Abreu e Lima refinery in Brazil will also help offset new production from what Taylor called monster refineries, such as Saudi Arabia’s two 400,000 barrel-per-day Yanbu and Satorp complexes.

Yet some bank analysts, including from Deutsche Bank, predict refining margins will begin to fall in the fourth quarter following a maintenance-related surge in the three months through September.

DISTILLATE OPPORTUNITIES

Executives from trading houses Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] and Gunvor [GGL.UL] were circumspect about the extent of the support to prices, but both saw opportunities for distillates in the near term.

“Any changes in regulations, new rules, will effectively disrupt flows and create opportunities,” said Trafigura Chief Financial Officer Pierre Lorinet. “It’s more about the arbitrage it generates.”

Yet the reprieve may not be enough to save European refining, and Taylor and Lorinet, along with bosses from Mercuria and Gunvor, all said there is at best anaemic investment potential.

“I’m not sure there are great opportunities,” Taylor said. “You can never say never, because you never know what type of deals are on the table. But I would be surprised.”

Gunvor Chief Executive Torbjorn Tornqvist said newly opened refineries in the Middle East and even the United States have “absolutely no sensitivity to margins” and will crush smaller European operations in the coming two years.

Vitol, through its joint venture Varo, and Gunvor each run two European refineries, but said roughly 750,000 to 1 million barrels per day of capacity has to close in Europe in the coming two years.

Asked if Europe should press the United States to abolish a long-standing crude export ban, which effectively helps the U.S. sector, Tornqvist said: “Europe needs to live up to its own responsibilities and rationalize.”

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-croatia-banks-pbz/slow-reforms-hamper-banks-profits-in-croatia-idUSKCN0HQ3ML20141001","Slow reforms hamper banks' profits in Croatia","ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia’s banks have enough capital and liquidity but their profits will remain subdued until the government cuts spending and loosens curbs on the private sector, the head of a major local bank told Reuters.

Croatia’s banking sector - more than 90 percent of it in foreign hands - posted a pre-tax profit of 695 million kuna ($115 million) in 2013.

That was sharply down from 3.5 billion kuna a year before, largely due to stricter rules on provisions for bad loans, while return on capital fell to just 1.3 percent at the end of last year, reflecting years of economic decline in the European Union’s newest member state.

“The key conditions for better profitability are fiscal adjustments and structural reforms that would pave the way for more vibrant private sector activity and less state presence in the economy,” Bozo Prka, CEO of the second biggest Croatian bank, Privredna Banka Zagreb (PBZ), said at the Reuters Eastern Europe Investment Summit on Wednesday.

PBZ is majority owned by Italy’s banking group Intesa Sanpaolo.

Banks’ profitability recovered somewhat in the first six months of this year but Prka said no major progress was possible unless the economy returned to growth. Croatia has had no growth since 2008 and prospects for 2015 are around zero.

“There are some indications, like an increase in exports, that we could see mild growth in 2015, but no major breakthrough is possible without bringing the fiscal gap in line with the European Union rules and boosting the private sector,” Prka said.

Rigid labor market rules, expensive and inefficient public administration, a high tax bite and frequently changing regulations are largely blamed for Croatia’s economic decline, comparable in duration only to that of Greece.

Brussels wants Zagreb to cut the budget gap to below three percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2016 from the current level of close to five percent.

Prka said Croatia’s banking sector had ample funds to finance the economy and did not expect any problems in passing the recent EU-wide stress test and asset quality review (AQR), which included four top Croatian banks.

“I expect only minor corrections in capital requirements for the banking sector following the AQR. The average capital adequacy in Croatian banks is above 20 percent and the banks are well funded to support the recovery, if reforms take place,” he said.

He also said the banking sector can still withstand the pressure of the rising level of bad loans, which will begin to taper only with economic growth. The overall level of bad loans is close to 17 percent and close to 30 percent in corporate sector loans.

“Some 35-40 percent of bad loans can turn back into performing loans in a year or two if economic recovery gains pace. That is why it is so important for the banks and the economy as a whole to see fast fiscal and structural changes,” Prka said.

PBZ has a three-year plan to handle its bad loan portfolio as part of a wider strategy put forward by its majority owner.

Croatia has 30 banks, but the three biggest lenders, PBZ, Zagrebacka Banka, a unit of Unicredit, and Austria’s Erste Bank, control almost 60 percent of the market.

Several speakers at the summit have predicted a spate of bank mergers and acquisitions once the current asset quality review of European lenders is complete.

Prka said some small Croatian banks, which account for less than 10 percent of the market, would face growing pressure from bigger local competitors.

“I think consolidation is quite possible but I don’t expect new foreign players in the local banking sector,” Prka said.

The MSCI Latin American stock index fell 2.37 percent to 2,910.06, its lowest level since July 2009. Emerging markets stocks and currencies, and to a lesser extent bonds, have been pummeled in recent sessions as investors fret over issues including slower growth in China and a decline in U.S. monetary stimulus. Brazil's currency, the real, has also weakened sharply in recent days, partly due to a rapid currency devaluation in neighboring Argentina, which could sap trade. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index dropped 1.62 percent to 47,535.88, a level it has not closed below in over five months. ""The swing is a reflection of fear over investing in Brazil and the exit of capital, with investors leaving the country,"" said Fausto Gouveia, an economist with Brazil's Legan Asset. Shares of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA , known as Petrobras, fell 2.3 percent, while Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Brazil's largest non-government bank, dropped 1.6 percent. Brazil's Bovespa has fallen 20 percent in the past 12 months, compared with an 8.6 percent loss in Mexico's IPC index and a 22.3 percent gain in the S&P 500 over the same period. Most investors have blamed the fall on broad concerns over economic fundamentals, erratic policy implementation and heavy-handed government meddling in the private sector. Mexico's IPC index sank its most in over two months, losing 1.58 percent to 40,876.87. Shares of lender Grupo Financiero Banorte fell 2.6 percent, while bottling firm Femsa lost 1.9 percent. Chile's IPSA index posted its biggest one-day drop in over four months, falling 1.77 percent to 3,608.29 as only four out of 40 stocks in the index hung onto gains.

By Asher Levine

SAO PAULO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Global emerging market stocks plunged on Friday as a worldwide currency selloff, worries over slower growth in China and a roll-back of U.S. monetary stimulus took Latin American stocks to a 4-1/2-year low.

The MSCI global emerging equities index fell for the second consecutive day, losing 1.46 percent to close at its lowest level in more than four months.

Key emerging market currencies have been battered recently with the Turkish lira plunging to record lows against the dollar, the Argentine peso suffering its largest one-day decline in more than a decade and the South African rand falling to a five-year low.

The MSCI Latin American stock index fell 2.14 percent to 2,916.73, its lowest level since July 2009.

In Latin America, Brazil’s real slid to a five-month trough, thanks in part to currency woes in neighboring Argentina, whose rapid currency devaluation points to weaker trade with Brazil.

The emerging-market selloff, which also led to a big day of losses in U.S. equity markets, hurt Latin American stocks.

Emerging markets stocks and currencies, and to a lesser extent bonds, have been pummeled in recent sessions as investors fret over issues including slower growth in China and a decline in U.S. monetary stimulus.

Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index dropped 1.1 percent to 47,787.38, a level it has not closed below since last August.

“The swing is a reflection of fear over investing in Brazil and the exit of capital, with investors leaving the country,” said Fausto Gouveia, an economist with Brazil’s Legan Asset.

Shares of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA , known as Petrobras, fell 2.39 percent, while Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Brazil’s largest non-government bank, dropped 1.32 percent.

Brazil’s Bovespa lost nearly 16 percent last year, compared with a 2.23 percent loss in Mexico’s IPC index and a 29.6 percent gain in the S&P 500 over the same period.

Most investors have blamed the fall on broad concerns over economic fundamentals, erratic policy implementation and heavy-handed government meddling in the private sector.

Mexico’s IPC index fell 1.33 percent to its lowest level since November.

Shares of lender Grupo Financiero Banorte fell 1.35 percent, while bottling firm Femsa lost 1.7 percent.

Chile’s IPSA index posted its biggest one-day drop since last August, falling 2.05 percent to 3,597.98 as only four out of 40 stocks in the index hung onto gains.

Shares of retailer Falabella slid 2.43 percent, while rival Cencosud fell 5.85 percent.","2014-01-24 23:37:25","1","24.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","43.0","36.0","0.0","91.0","0.0","6.0","0","435","99.00","53.68","73.83","1.67","27.19","25.06","66.90","29.43","1.84","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.84","6.90","15.40","1.61","0.92","3.68","0.23","6.21","5.98","5.06","0.46","8.28","4.14","4.83","0.92","3.91","0.46","0.23","2.99","2.07","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","3.68","0.46","1.61","0.00","0.46","0.23","0.92","1.38","0.00","0.23","0.46","0.23","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","7.36","0.92","1.61","4.60","0.69","0.69","3.91","2.76","0.00","23.45","5.29","11.72","7.13","6.90","0.00","0.23","7.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.16","5.06","6.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.76","0.46","1.84","0.46","0.92","2082","7.96","29.0","620","419","33","67.04","9.9","7.1","12.57","9.9","98","5.785714285714286","16.435608591885444","251","26.44","18","0.29","0","8","53","30","0","57","30","4","7","0","91","70","0","27","0","0","1","5","8","1","0","0","13","0","4","19","15","9","6","4","1","0","1","0"

Mexico's IPC index fell for the third session in four, while Chile's bourse edged lower. After initial gains of as much as 0.8 percent, Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index was down 0.46 percent by mid-afternoon, hitting its lowest level in over five months. Shares of CSN, or Companhia Siderurgica Nacional SA , plunged over 7 percent, their biggest one-day drop since Sept. 2012, pushing the index into negative territory. Local newswire Agencia Estado, citing unidentified sources with knowledge of the situation, reported that an agreement between CSN and a group of Asian trading companies and steel mills over Namisa's ownership was taking longer than expected. Investors are worried that CSN, which has been struggling with weak trends in its steel and iron ore units and rising debt, would have to compensate partners for problems with Namisa. Itochu Corp and other partners could exercise an option to sell their stake to CSN worth as much as $3 billion. CSN did not respond immediately to a request for comments. Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Brazil's largest non-government bank, rose 1.7 percent, helping support the index, while rival Banco Bradesco SA advanced 1.3 percent. Consumer delinquencies in Brazil fell in 2013 for the first time in 14 years, research firm Serasa Experian said on Tuesday. The numbers could at first glance spell a brighter outlook for private-sector lenders, which have seen quarterly profit recover recently thanks to prudent credit disbursement policies. Shares of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA , known as Petrobras, advanced for the first session in four, rising 0.6 percent. ""Petrobras is bouncing back with strength after recent losses, but the stock is still dealing with the impact of recommendations from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs that investors sell off emerging market assets,"" said Pablo Spyer, a director with Mirae Securities in Sao Paulo. Petrobras shares, which due to their high liquidity tend to attract foreign investors looking for exposure to Brazil's market, are down 15 percent over the past three months. Part of that flight is due to the perception that developed markets offer better investment prospects as Brazil deals with higher interest rates, government meddling in the private sector and lower expectations for economic growth. Spyer, along with a number of local banks and brokers including BB Investimentos and Grupo BTG Pactual, have remained bullish on the local market, however. ""I think the pullback in Brazil stocks is basically over,"" he said. ""Brazil is at a good price. Yes, the government creates some difficulties here, there have been a lot of interventions, but it's all priced in now."" Mexico's IPC index nearly erased the previous session's gains, losing 0.16 percent to 41,907.68. Mining firm Grupo Mexico lost 1.8 percent, contributing most to the index's losses, while cement manufacturer Cemex advanced 1.5 percent. Chile's IPSA index gave up slight morning gains, returning to negative territory for a second straight session. Retailer Falabella slipped 0.7 percent, while Banco de Chile advanced 0.78 percent.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deportations-and-deadly-d_b_5544701.html","Deportations and ""Deadly Diseases""","This week as President Obama asks Congress to provide $2 billion to help control an influx of Central American children crossing the South Texas border, many are voicing a prominent concern that children entering from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras will introduce infectious diseases across the southern United States. Politicians and even some physicians have even labeled these children a threat to homeland security because of their potential to create a public health crisis.



However, the reality of Texas (as well as adjacent areas of the US Gulf Coast) is that tropical infectious diseases are already here and many of them have been here for decades or centuries. Rather than immigration it is the convergence of extreme poverty and warm climate that make this region vulnerable to a group of illnesses known as the neglected tropical diseases or 'NTDs'. Texas and the Gulf Coast states rank among the poorest in our nation, and the pervasive low-quality housing and environmental degradation, together with long, hot, and humid summers create the perfect conditions for NTDs to flourish.

For example, the Aedes aegypti mosquito that transmits a variety of arboviruses such as dengue fever, yellow fever, and Chikungunya has been in Houston and other southern cities for at least a decade, after causing frequent and sometimes catastrophic epidemics in the continental US up until the late 1800s. Houston experienced outbreaks of dengue fever between 2003 and 2005, and continues to be at risk for other arbovirus infections including yellow fever and Chikungunya. Chagas disease is a serious and debilitating heart disease caused by parasitic microorganisms known as trypanosomes and transmitted by kissing bugs.Hundreds of thousands of people live with Chagas disease in the US, and many dogs are also infected. Millions of African Americans living in poverty in the southern US suffer from other parasitic infections such as toxocariasis and trichomoniasis. Additional NTDs in Texas include cysticercosis, murine typhus, West Nile virus infection, and an interesting syndrome of tuberculosis in patients with underlying diabetes.

A key point is that Texas and surrounding regions are vulnerable to NTDs for the same reasons as poorer parts of Mexico and Central America. Indeed in a recent paper in Public Library of Science Neglected Tropical Diseases I listed Texas and Mesoamerica as one of ten ""global hotspots"" of NTDs, along with areas in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. We established our National School of Tropical Medicine in Houston because it is the epicenter of America's NTDs.

For all these reasons, the current wave of Central American children entering the US pose little, if any, added threat in terms of disease. With very few exceptions, if these children have diseases they are ones that previously gained a foothold in the US a long time ago. At least one - Chagas disease - has been detected in prehistoric mummified remains from the Rio Grande Valley.

Perhaps one exception is the fact that many of Central America's children, unlike most US children, live with intestinal worms. We can do something about that by giving them an inexpensive deworming tablet. The only problem is that worm eggs and larvae are so widespread in the soil of Central America that we will need a vaccine to prevent them from becoming reinfected upon returning. Our laboratories are working on that problem, with the hope that one day we can create a pan-anthelminthic vaccine that could benefit children living in poverty everywhere.

NTDs are a major homeland security threat to Texas and the US Gulf Coast. They have been a threat for quite a while and yet our government and government officials have mostly ignored the problem - until now. New legislation, known as the ""End Neglected Tropical Diseases Act"" (H.R. 4847), was just introduced in the House of Representatives specifically identifies the problems of NTDs in the US. This bill could begin to turn things around for the poorest and most vulnerable people in our nation.

Christie, chairman of the Republican Governors Association and a possible 2016 candidate for president, said he was gratified by GOP wins in Democratic-leaning states such as Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois, as well as victories in key swing states like Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio. Christie said voters ""elect and re-elect governors to get things done."" Christie, who campaigned for GOP candidates across the country, said the winners deserve the credit, not him.

Michael Grimm, a Republican facing a 20-count indictment won in New York and another known for outbursts of rage and killing a beagle, Mike Bost, won a seat in President Barack Obama's home state of Illinois that had been Democratic for 70 years. Down in Tennessee, Rep. Scott DesJarlais' past infidelities and pushing of abortion on a mistress continued to not matter to voters, who handed him a landslide victory. There were a couple of bright spots for Democrats, or at least the more moderate crowd. Florida Rep. Steve Southerland lost to Democrat Gwen Graham after holding an all-male fundraiser and joking about Graham in lingerie. And in Louisiana, GOP Rep.

11/05/2014 5:07 AM EST Alaska Becomes 4th State To Legalize Recreational Marijuana In yet another major pushback against the war on drugs, Alaska legalized recreational marijuana on Tuesday, joining Oregon and Washington, D.C. -- both of which legalized cannabis only hours before. Alaska becomes the fourth state in the U.S. to legalize retail marijuana, along with Oregon, Colorado and Washington state. Voters approved Measure 2, which legalizes the possession, use and sale of recreational marijuana. Adults, age 21 and older, may possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants (with no more than three being mature) for personal use. The measure also legalizes the manufacture, sale and possession of marijuana paraphernalia, such as devices used for smoking or storing the plant. “The folks trying to keep marijuana illegal are relying on the same scare tactics today that they have relied on for decades, but voters just aren’t falling for it anymore,"" Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement early Wednesday morning. ""The results are particularly encouraging since voter turnout during a midterm election is typically smaller, older, and more conservative. Clearly, support for ending marijuana prohibition spans the political and ideological spectrums."" Read more here. -- Matt Ferner

The Democrats got mauled today, deservedly so. To prohibit that from happening to the GOP in 2016, it must learn the lesson from the last time Republicans held the Senate majority. This time they must not retreat, and it's our responsibility to hold them accountable.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-alison-lundergan-grimes_n_5744312.html","Mitch McConnell Widens Lead Over Alison Lundergan Grimes In New Poll","A Saturday Bluegrass Poll gives Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) the edge in one of the tightest Senate races in the nation, with just over two months left before the November midterm election.

The incumbent McConnell leads Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D) by 4 points in the race to represent Kentucky in the U.S. Senate, according to the poll, in which 569 likely Kentucky voters were surveyed. Grimes was leading in Bluegrass Polls until a July release had McConnell ahead by 2 percentage points.

The Senate minority leader's 4-point lead falls within the poll's 4.2-point margin of error.

Unsurprisingly, McConnell is largely favored in rural parts of the state, while Grimes carries a safe lead in bluer areas like Louisville, where she's ahead by 7 points. Grimes does better among poor and middle-class voters, maintaining double-digit margins: Of those polled, likely voters with an income of less than $40,000 favored Grimes by 17 points. McConnell, by comparison, has a 12-point lead among voters earning more than $80,000.

The incumbent and challenger are in a dead heat for women's support. The Democratic challenger is ahead by only 1 percentage point among female voters, and McConnell leads among male voters by 10 points. When asked which candidate would improve the lives of women, respondents chose Grimes by a 21-point margin.

The Grimes campaign expressed continued confidence in its candidate's chances come November, highlighting Grimes' resilience in the face of major spending by the opposing campaign. Her campaign also noted that the poll was conducted prior to news of McConnell campaign manager Jesse Benton's resignation amid revelations of possible ties to a bribery scandal, and the release of audio from a secret Koch brothers gathering.

""After facing a barrage of more than $30 million in spending from Mitch McConnell and his allies, our campaign remains well within the margin of error against the 30-year Washington incumbent,"" the campaign said in a statement Saturday. ""Today's poll reflects how close we are to winning the race, however it does not reflect the tornado of bad news that has upended Senator McConnell's campaign this week, including a secret tape and a bribery scandal that resulted in the resignation of his campaign manager. We remain strongly positioned to win due to our superior candidate and first-class grassroots organization.""

McConnell's campaign saw good news in the results, pointing to the uptick in support for the senator as the election approaches.

""It's becoming more clear the closer we get to the election that voters want a proven leader like Senator McConnell who delivers for Kentucky rather than an inexperienced liberal who is just another vote for the Obama agenda,"" McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore told the Courier-Journal in a statement.

The Kentucky congressman made the comments during an appearance on Fox News' ""The Kelly File."" Paul also announced on Tuesday that he would be seeking a second term as senator in 2016.

When host Megyn Kelly asked how a Kentucky law preventing candidates from being on the ballot for two offices at the same time could affect his decision on a presidential run, Paul suggested a loophole -- turning Kentucky's primary into a caucus since most don't require a printed ballot.

""I think there are many different ways it could be done,"" Paul said. ""Probably the simplest way is that the primaries in Kentucky are controlled by the party and we could simply move up our primary, make it a caucus. We would be more relevant, and then the law wouldn't apply. So that's probably the easiest way to fix things should I decide to run.""

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-alison-grimes_n_5951050.html","Mitch vs. Alison Isn't Over Yet","WASHINGTON -- Coal miners used to take canaries with them underground, where a dying bird would signal the presence of poison gases.

In Kentucky’s Senate race, Democrats think the “canary in the coal mine” for Mitch McConnell might be the arrival of right-wing activist James O’Keefe.

A proudly unscrupulous provocateur, O’Keefe uses hidden cameras and fraudulent identities to try to entrap liberals in compromising videos. He recently sent a crew to search for dirt on the Republican senator’s challenger, Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.

O’Keefe didn’t find much: a bland, secretly recorded video of low-level Grimes organizers chatting cynically about whether their candidate really was committed to the coal industry.

Neither Grimes not any of her top aides are on the tape or anywhere near it. It’s not a smoking gun; it's not really even a gun.

McConnell top aide Josh Holmes told The Huffington Post that his boss’s campaign did not know O’Keefe’s team was in the state, let alone coordinate with them in any way. “No and no,” he said.

But Democrats suggested out loud that the videographer's presence was a sign of desperation on the other side.

“They are going to try every trick in the book,” said Grimes campaign manager Jonathan Hurst. “This is a dead-even race, and McConnell and his people know that it is.”

That is open to debate.

McConnell has history, big-data geeks and the Beltway pundits on his side as he enters this stretch of the race against Grimes. Everyone says that McConnell remains a relative lock to win on Nov. 4 -- a victory that could enable him to achieve his long-held dream of becoming majority leader of the U.S. Senate.

In fact, he’s won five races in a row and has the number-crunched historical stats with him. President Barack Obama lost big in Kentucky in 2012. Grimes has not impressed observers with the depth of her knowledge of the issues.

So the Kentucky contest is off most lists of pivotal races that will decide which party wins the chamber, in favor of tossups such as Colorado, Alaska and Iowa and other races such as Louisiana, Arkansas, New Hampshire and North Carolina.

But a month until Election Day, the reality on the ground in Kentucky isn’t aligned with a narrative of sleepy inevitability.

McConnell is slightly ahead in composites of the public polls, but the senator has not opened up the expected late, large lead in the race that would cause donors to write it off.

With a sense of urgency if not desperation, the senator and his “independent” big spending allies are dumping huge amounts of cash into the race, with six new ads going up in the last week and a megaton of buys aimed at dominating TV, cable and radio airwaves from Pikeville to Paducah.

Having outspent Grimes and her allies by more than 2-1, anti-Grimes forces may well double that margin between now and Nov. 4.

McConnell’s advertising, and that of his allies, has focused almost entirely on the unpopularity in Kentucky of Obama, who lost the state in 2012 by 18 points.

The latest GOP ads throw standard-issue xenophobia into the mix, conflating Grimes and Obama on immigration policy -- even though she has had nothing to do with it as secretary of state, and even though there is no flood of undocumented immigrants inundating the Bluegrass State.

And yet Grimes refuses to go away, largely because there seems to be a low ceiling on McConnell’s support as a 30-year incumbent who has never been personally popular nor stood for much besides opposing Democratic ideas.

“Mitch can’t get above 47 percent, and that means he can’t win if Alison can make the sale about why she should replace him,” said Rep. John Yarmuth of Louisville, a close Democratic ally of and adviser to Secretary Grimes.

Although McConnell has pounded away on themes designed to secure the vote of white men in Eastern and Western Kentucky, he hasn’t built huge margins among them, according to Al Cross, a veteran political reporter who now teaches at the University of Kentucky.

Recent polls suggest that Grimes has closed some of the gap among men in rural, small-city Eastern and Western Kentucky, said Cross, who has studied crosstabs of recent polls.

One reason is a widely run ad showing a ruddy-cheeked Grimes confidently shooting skeet and condescendingly lecturing her rival on how to handle a gun. The ad played up Grimes’ sales pitch as an outdoorsy Kentucky thoroughbred who grew up with horses, rifles and basketball -- running against a pallid habitué of Washington meeting rooms and big-donor corporate ballrooms.

“It’s that gun ad,” said Yarmuth. “A lot of her supporters in Louisville didn’t want her to run it, but that is who she is,” he said.

Cultural marketing aside, Grimes has aimed most of her campaign messaging at women, focusing on issues such as gender equality in pay, reproductive rights and health care. Perhaps her No. 1 issue is raising the minimum wage -- a clear and popular message in a poor state.

The pay equity and minimum wage issues appeal to men as well, since most of them live in two-income homes.

Whether any of that will put Grimes over the top -- still a long climb -- is unclear. Perhaps her last clear chance comes next Monday in Lexington, where she’ll take part in an hour-long “conversation” with McConnell moderated by the state’s public TV station.

Grimes will enter that event with a better chance to pull off the upset of the year than most would have thought possible.

“The other side has pounded us for months and we are still here, right up there with Mitch,” said Grimes manager Hurst.

That may not be enough in the end, but it is enough for now.","2014-10-08 08:23:42","1","36.0","2.0","0.0","3.0","16.0","0.0","114.0","91.0","0.0","228.0","0.0","59.0","19","982","90.50","58.46","26.94","34.61","21.82","20.98","74.95","46.54","7.84","3.87","0.10","0.20","0.00","2.95","0.61","3.97","7.84","15.68","6.42","3.56","5.60","2.24","11.81","4.68","2.55","1.32","1.53","2.04","3.56","2.04","1.53","0.31","0.41","0.51","8.25","0.00","0.20","1.43","1.93","10.69","1.43","1.32","1.02","2.65","1.12","3.87","2.14","1.02","1.02","0.00","0.61","0.20","0.31","0.00","0.10","7.84","1.43","2.44","4.79","1.12","0.10","2.65","7.43","1.12","15.89","1.93","10.49","3.26","3.36","1.43","0.20","1.32","0.00","0.20","0.71","0.10","0.41","0.00","0.20","0.00","17.41","4.79","4.99","0.10","0.10","0.00","0.00","2.95","2.04","2.44","0.00","0.00","4492","8.0","24.4390243902439","1373","963","44","66.17","12.1","9.5","11.2","12.6","200","8.5","19.067372793354103","504","22.61","12","0.45","0","36","14","90","0","138","75","2","5","14","161","119","2","55","0","0","30","16","45","0","0","8","21","0","35","32","18","18","15","36","5","6","0","4"

Michael Grimm, a Republican facing a 20-count indictment won in New York and another known for outbursts of rage and killing a beagle, Mike Bost, won a seat in President Barack Obama's home state of Illinois that had been Democratic for 70 years. Down in Tennessee, Rep. Scott DesJarlais' past infidelities and pushing of abortion on a mistress continued to not matter to voters, who handed him a landslide victory. There were a couple of bright spots for Democrats, or at least the more moderate crowd. Florida Rep.

11/05/2014 5:07 AM EST Alaska Becomes 4th State To Legalize Recreational Marijuana In yet another major pushback against the war on drugs, Alaska legalized recreational marijuana on Tuesday, joining Oregon and Washington, D.C. -- both of which legalized cannabis only hours before. Alaska becomes the fourth state in the U.S. to legalize retail marijuana, along with Oregon, Colorado and Washington state. Voters approved Measure 2, which legalizes the possession, use and sale of recreational marijuana. Adults, age 21 and older, may possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants (with no more than three being mature) for personal use. The measure also legalizes the manufacture, sale and possession of marijuana paraphernalia, such as devices used for smoking or storing the plant. “The folks trying to keep marijuana illegal are relying on the same scare tactics today that they have relied on for decades, but voters just aren’t falling for it anymore,"" Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement early Wednesday morning. ""The results are particularly encouraging since voter turnout during a midterm election is typically smaller, older, and more conservative. Clearly, support for ending marijuana prohibition spans the political and ideological spectrums."" Read more here. -- Matt Ferner

Tonight is a big victory for We the People! Credit is due to the victorious candidates. Your message to President Obama is undeniably received, though he'll try to ignore it. ... The Democrats got mauled today, deservedly so. To prohibit that from happening to the GOP in 2016, it must learn the lesson from the last time Republicans held the Senate majority. This time they must not retreat, and it's our responsibility to hold them accountable. Will they fight for reform that aligns with the limited government planks of the Republican platform, or will they return to the big government cronyism and status quo favored by the permanent political class? Will they drain the swamp or decide the D.C. cesspool is really just a jacuzzi they can't wait to jump on into and shake us off?

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/millennials-need-to-turno_b_6297052.html","Millennials Need to Turnout Every Day, Not Just Election Day","A recent podcast by The Economist asserted that young people do not turn out in non-Presidential years because they do not have ""skin in the game."" They're wrong. We most certainly do. While there is recorded disinvestment in midterm elections by young people, many factors contribute to lower youth turnout in midterm elections: unstable voting addresses, ill-targeting by campaign teams, and voter access restrictions, to name a few.

However, a hard reality is often overlooked: This generation wants to find meaningful ways of democratic participation. We have disengaged from our crumbling civic institutions; yet, we have the energy and ideas to rebuild them. The midterm election was the opposite of the kind of politics we value; there were no new ideas, endless fear-mongering, and blaming the other for the political challenges our country faces, not to mention increased restrictions on voting in many key states. As a result, voters between the ages of 18 to 29 voted at a very low rate on Nov. 4. With this kind of atmosphere roiling in our electoral process, it is no wonder we do not see voting as a meaningful avenue of participation, even though we should.

There was a bright spot in this past election. When big issues and big ideas were on the ballot, voters turned out in higher numbers. The Center for Civic Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement estimates a five-percentage point increase over the national youth turnout average in states with competitive ballot initiatives. When on the ballot at the state and local level, ideas including paid sick leave, minimum wage, and background checks, were a powerful motivator for participation.

Americans have opinions on the direction of this country and are passionate about ideas and solutions to move us forward. However, our political leaders do not focus enough on building opportunities for everyday people to do this in a meaningful way before the elections. Their ask is always ""to vote"" instead of ""to engage."" Thus, we end up with elections that are often just bickering and pandering to a politically active base rather than a real debate about policy. Policy debates should happen in communities across the country every year, not just once every four years. Voting should be the culminating act of voicing an opinion in our political participation, not a fight over partisan power.

As the National Director of the Roosevelt Institute | Campus Network, a 120-chapter nationwide student policy organization, I work everyday with young people who engage in a participatory form of politics and see how it drives their engagement. Students in our network run participatory discussions on their campuses, they research and propose local policy ideas, and they connect to stakeholders around their schools. Participation is a meaningful part of their lives and voting is one of the ways they inject their voice into decision-making in government.

Ultimately, the post-election question for youth participation is not ""How do we turnout more young people by 2016?"" But, ""How do we involve more young people in civic life?"" Millennials are not just looking to be brought to the polls; we want to be involved in the process.","2014-12-09 15:51:08","0","9.0","2.0","0.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","111.0","87.0","0.0","164.0","0.0","55.0","17","528","89.13","82.33","66.08","42.98","20.31","26.52","83.33","47.92","7.95","5.49","0.19","3.22","0.00","0.00","2.08","2.46","7.77","15.91","6.44","4.92","5.49","2.08","11.17","6.44","2.08","1.14","1.70","2.27","3.60","2.27","1.33","0.19","0.38","0.38","11.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.55","3.41","1.89","1.14","1.52","1.14","3.41","1.52","0.76","0.38","0.38","1.33","0.38","0.76","0.19","0.00","10.61","3.79","1.89","5.30","0.38","0.19","1.89","7.77","0.19","17.61","1.89","10.23","5.68","6.63","0.57","0.00","0.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.58","4.55","5.11","0.38","0.57","0.38","0.00","1.33","1.89","0.19","0.00","0.19","2614","8.67","21.24","828","523","24","49.35","13.7","11.8","12.65","13.8","131","10.4","20.739120458891012","290","19.68","2","0.46","0","16","8","50","0","71","53","2","1","3","80","19","1","52","0","0","20","12","29","2","0","3","15","0","21","7","13","9","24","11","1","1","0","4"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-passes-tax-extenders_b_6351732.html","Congress Passes Tax Extenders: What You Need to Know","Now that holiday festivities are in full swing, it's no surprise that taxes are likely the last thing on your mind. But yesterday, the much-anticipated tax law called the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was passed by Congress, temporarily and retroactively extending more than 50 tax breaks that expired on December 31, 2013, meaning you and other taxpayers out there may receive a little extra holiday cheer this season.

So what exactly are tax extenders, anyway? Tax extenders are a broad set of temporary tax breaks that can impact how you're taxed on everything from your mortgage and tuition to your business. Whether you're a teacher spending your own money on craft supplies for your class, a student buried in tuition and book costs, a homeowner who sprang for energy efficient improvements to your home or splurged on an expensive purchase, yesterday's vote could mean more money in your pocket come tax-filing time.

Let's dig into some of the tax breaks that passed that may help you keep more money in your pocket.

The Educator Expense Deduction - As a teacher you likely spend hundreds of dollars of your own money in order to improve your classroom and create the best learning environment for your students. This could end up being a big burden on your wallet, but with the Educator Expense Deduction, you can claim up to $250 of classroom expenses for supplies, materials, books and software.

Tuition and Fees Deduction - Any student (or parent!) knows that college costs a pretty penny. With the Tuition and Fees Deduction, you can once again deduct expenses related to education, including tuition, books and other supplies, up to $4,000. Pro tip: Don't procrastinate on paying next quarter's tuition. If you pay before December 31st you may be able to get a valuable education tax deduction or credit.

Mortgage Debt Relief - Without the mortgage debt relief tax break, taxpayers who have mortgage debt canceled or forgiven on their principal residence would normally be required to pay taxes on the forgiven debt. Under the extended tax law, up to $2 million dollars of forgiven debt on your principal residence is eligible to be excluded from your income in 2014.

Mortgage Insurance Premiums - Did you buy your dream home this year? If your lender required you to buy mortgage insurance when you purchased your home, now you may be able to deduct the amount you paid for the insurance.

Energy Tax Breaks - You went ""green"" and made energy efficient improvements to your home. The environment thanks you, and now so does your wallet. Homeowners who made energy efficient improvements to their homes in 2014 will still be able to claim the Residential Energy Property Credit. This credit could mean as much as $500.

State and Local General Sales Taxes - If you happen to live in a state like Florida or Texas that doesn't collect state income tax, or if you happened to make some large purchases and paid substantial local sales tax, you may be in luck. Under this law, you still have the option to choose between deducting state and local income tax or state and local general sales tax.

Qualified Charitable Distributions - Individuals at least 70-1/2 years of age can continue to exclude from income, qualified charitable distributions made from an IRA directly to a qualified charity. This tax law can be a huge tax savings for those very established taxpayers who no longer have bigger tax deductions like home mortgage interest since their homes are paid off.

Achieving a Better Life Experience Act - This new tax law creates tax-favored savings accounts for individuals with disabilities along with tax-related offsets.","2014-12-19 16:34:51","1","14.0","9.0","0.0","2.0","17.0","0.0","113.0","91.0","0.0","208.0","0.0","52.0","19","614","82.06","88.58","31.32","97.43","23.62","24.43","87.46","43.32","11.24","7.00","0.00","0.16","6.35","0.00","0.49","4.23","5.05","13.84","6.51","2.12","5.86","0.81","10.59","4.07","2.44","1.30","2.93","1.79","5.54","5.37","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.61","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.40","3.26","2.77","1.47","4.07","0.49","3.26","0.33","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.00","8.47","0.49","2.44","4.72","0.81","0.81","2.77","7.33","1.14","13.03","1.14","7.17","4.56","10.59","1.14","2.77","15.31","0.00","0.16","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.16","13.52","3.75","4.23","0.16","0.00","0.33","0.16","2.12","0.33","1.30","0.33","0.81","2950","8.1","23.923076923076923","932","607","26","56.29","14.0","11.2","12.19","13.9","127","11.875","19.689028006589787","309","21.62","1","0.42","0","24","16","44","1","66","45","4","2","15","125","47","1","46","0","0","21","22","23","0","0","2","20","0","32","13","6","15","16","5","4","5","0","2"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-republican-partys-cyn_b_6079056.html","The Republican Party's Cynical Electoral Philosophy","Last week, the Supreme Court upheld a law that could disenfranchise 600,000 Texans. But the effects of the law won't fall equally: African-Americans and Latinos are 305 percent and 195 percent less likely (respectively) to have the necessary forms of identification than whites. The Republican party is increasingly unpopular, and relies almost exclusively on white voters. The charts below show the 2008 if only white men voted and if only people of color voted ( source ). Since 2008, people of color become a growing share of the voting population while the GOP has, if anything, moved further to the right. It has further alienated voters of color with racist attacks and laws. But as they say: if you can't beat 'em, make sure they don't vote. Over the last four years the Republicans have gone through elaborate attempts to make sure populations that don't support them don't get a chance to vote.

Since 2006, Republicans have pushed through voter ID laws in 34 states. Such laws did not exist before 2006, when Indiana passed the first voter ID law. The laws were ostensibly aimed at preventing voter fraud, but a News21 investigation finds only 2,068 instance of alleged fraud since 2000 (that is out of over 146 million voters). They estimate that there is one accusation of voter fraud for every 15 million voters. As Mother Jones notes, instances of voter fraud are more rare than UFO sightings. There have been only 13 instances of in-person voter fraud (the sorts that a voter ID law would reduce), while 47,000 people claim to have seen a UFO.

On the other hand, research by the Brennan Center for Justice finds that, ""as many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have government-issued photo ID."" Those who do not have ID are most likely to be ""seniors, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students"" -- i.e. people who vote Democratic (chart source).

There is now a large literature studying the effects of voter ID laws. James Avery and Mark Peffley find, ""states with restrictive voter registration laws are much more likely to be biased toward upper-class turnout."" The GAO finds that, voter ID laws reduce turnout among those between ages 18-23 and African-Americans (two key Democratic constituencies). A 2013 study finds that the proposal and passage of voter ID laws are, ""highly partisan, strategic, and racialized affairs."" They write, ""Our findings confirm that Democrats are justified in their concern that restrictive voter legislation takes aim along racial lines with strategic partisan intent."" [Italics in original] The authors also find that increases in low-income voter turnout triggered voter ID laws. A more recent study finds, ""where elections are competitive, the furtherance of restrictive voter ID laws is a means of maintaining Republican support while curtailing Democratic electoral gains."" That is, not all Republican legislatures propose voter ID laws -- only those that face strong competition from Democrats. If Republicans are concerned about election integrity, why do they only pass voter ID laws when they're about to lose an election? Because they're using these laws for partisan advantage.

Voter ID laws are also racially motivated. A recent study finds that voters are significantly more likely to support a voter ID law when they are shown pictures of black people voting than when shown white people voting. In Minnesota, Take Action Minnesota showed that a pro-voter ID group had a picture on their website showing a black inmate voting and a man wearing a mariachi outfit - clearly playing off racial stereotypes.

But this isn't the only time Republicans have tried to leverage state-level advantages into federal gains. After the 2010 walloping, Republicans decided they would need to tilt the odds in their favor. Using their control of state legislatures, they gerrymandered districts to ensure their victory. In 2012, Democrats actually had a larger share of the popular vote for the House of Representatives, while Republicans gained their largest House majority in 60 years. Cook Political Report noted, ""House GOP Won 49 Percent of Votes, 54 Percent of Seats."" How? They changed the rules of the game. Karl Rove came out and said it in an op-ed, writing, ""He who controls redistricting can control Congress."" They won in districts that were drawn specifically to allow them to win. There were certainly other factors at play, but it's hard to image Republicans winning as many seats without their nifty swindle.

As Tim Dickinson points out, this isn't the end:

In a project with the explicit blessing of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, a half-dozen Republican-dominated legislatures in states that swing blue in presidential elections have advanced proposals to abandon the winner-take-all standard in the Electoral College ... Thanks to the GOP's gerrymandering, such a change would all but guarantee that a Democratic presidential candidate in a big, diverse state like Michigan would lose the split of electoral votes even if he or she won in a popular landslide.

If Republicans have their way, we'll eventually be back to the days of the poll tax and the literacy test, where the votes of blacks, youth and the poor simply don't count. We're already half-way there; one study finds that the indirect costs of obtaining a voter ID are higher than the cost of a poll tax was. The Senate, with its antiquated system of two Senators per state means that the largely rural, old, white and conservative Midwest and South have far more sway than liberal metropolitan areas. By one estimate, 0.59% of the U.S. population will decide control of the Senate this election. This gives Republicans a strong advantage in the Senate, something to remember if they win it this election.

Republicans have also made use of felony disenfranchisement to boost their electoral success. Some 5.85 million Americans are denied the vote due to felony disenfranchisement. Because of the racial bias in our criminal justice system and the war on drugs, a disproportionate share of these voters are black. One study finds that because felons are more likely to be poor and people of color, disenfranchisement benefits Republicans. The authors estimate that, ""at least one Republican presidential victory would have been reversed if former felons had been allowed to vote."" Further, they find that such laws may have impacted control of the Senate, and even more state and local elections. It's no surprise that in Florida, a state where 10% of voters can't vote because of a felony conviction, one of Rick Scott's first moves as governor was to tighten rules for felons trying to gain voting rights. To add insult to injury, some 2 million incarcerated citizens are often counted as residents of the place where they are incarcerated, rather than their home. This allows districts where prisons are built to gain disproportionate influence because districts will often include large, non-voting prison populations. In Ward 6 of Rhode Island, prisoners represented 25% of the population.

The radicalism of the Tea Party and the Republican party at-large is partially due to the fact that they don't represent the whole population -- they represent a primarily white and middle to high income voting bloc. And that's how Republicans want to keep it -- they know they can't win in fair race, so like Dick Dasterdly and Muttley, they set all sorts of obstacles in their opponent's way. Hopefully, much like Dick Dasterdly and Muttley, their plan will blow up in their faces. Voters will be so angry about Republican attempts to suppress the vote that they'll turn out in even higher numbers. Evidence suggests that a shift in turnout would have important effects on policy. Sadly, convicted felons, undocumented immigrants and many citizens without ID will still be denied the vote. In the cartoons, cheaters never win, for Republicans it's been a successful electoral strategy for three decades running.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-africa-ebola-epidemic-underlying-cracks-in-health-system_b_5678180.html","In Africa: Ebola Epidemic Exposes Underlying Cracks in the Health System","With the number of cases exceeding 2,200 and the death toll surpassing 1,200, Ebola has captured news headlines for the last few weeks, and with good reason. The health emergency has hit some of the world's most impoverished nations, none of which has sufficient resources to control the outbreak. This crisis should not be a surprise to anyone, as it only exposes well-known vulnerabilities in weak public health infrastructures and over-taxed health systems. These are critical concerns as Africa continues to battle a multitude of other health challenges, not the least of which is a growing chronic disease epidemic.

But it is important to keep in mind that Africa as a whole is on the upswing, and widely considered by many in the business community as an important set of emerging markets. To realize its potential fully in the long run, we need to mobilize public and private investments in Africa, and continue to facilitate creative partnerships to tackle some of the continent's continuing challenges.

The Ebola emergency has shone a bright light on underlying problems of the African health system, opening a Pandora's box of neglected issues that need priority attention. The outbreak demonstrates the critical need to strengthen health systems overall and dramatically increase the number of health workers, particularly in poor and rural areas where diseases can thrive undetected. Weak health infrastructures lack the capacity and resilience to support a swift response to public health crises because they lack the mechanisms, money and manpower to do so. Nor are they equipped sufficiently to tackle both acute crises like Ebola and the on-going health needs of other infectious diseases (including HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria), maternal mortality, child survival and chronic illness. This often translates to higher disease transmission and lower patient survival rates. Health workers who do not have the tools to protect themselves from harm are at consequently greater risk of getting infected, further depleting an already sparse health workforce.

The primary risk factor for ill health in Africa is still poverty. This fact is best illustrated by the pervasiveness of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in the region. Often referred to as diseases of poverty, NTDs such as river blindness, lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis and Guinea Worm are the result of poor living conditions and inadequate access to clean water. By nature, NTDs cause tremendous disability and prevent adult patients from working and children from going to school. With an estimated 90% of the 1 billion people affected by an NTD living in Africa, these diseases pose a barrier to economic growth.

Likewise, Africa is facing an explosion of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma. The burden of chronic illness in the region is anticipated to increase by 27% in the next decade, claiming 28 million lives over the course of the next 10 years. Cancer rates in Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to rise by 85% by 2030, and estimates indicate that there will be 41.5 million diabetics living in Africa by 2035. Aside from the direct health costs of treating NCDs, the indirect economic toll of chronic diseases on countries is immense, further challenging broader development goals.

The intersection of health and economic development was one theme of the recent U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C., which reiterated that the region's success was contingent upon the well-being of its people. U.S.-based corporations have long made significant contributions to improve health in Africa. Chief among these have been robust drug donation programs to control NTDs, which have helped treat nearly half a billion people in the last seven years alone. Likewise, public-private partnerships such as Together for Girls and Saving Mothers, Giving Life are strong examples of how companies are contributing to multisectoral collaborations toward empowering and improving the health of women and girls.

U.S. Government institutions such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief work collaboratively with a host of other organizations by providing funding and technical support and advancing research and polices to launch initiatives and scale-up programs to reduce the burden of disease in Africa. The response to the Ebola outbreak is an excellent example of U.S.-Africa collaboration, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the front lines of combating the epidemic in West Africa, working side-by-side with local public health officials, the World Health Organization, Doctors without Borders and others.

But we need to think more critically about the role that companies, NGOs, academe and research institutions can play in supporting countries as they seek to provide effective means for providing greater health equity. For example, governments can leverage the knowledge of U.S. industry on growing programs, developing efficient mechanisms to improve performance, reducing duplication and building the workforce. African Ministries of Health can collaborate with organizations funded by USAID, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and others to expand the breadth and reach of programs as well as strengthen health systems. Research centers in Africa can also tap the knowledge banks of American think tanks and academic institutions to advance discourse on major challenges.

In the two decades I've worked in Africa, I have seen important and encouraging progress in strengthening the public health response and saving lives. But more must be done to sustain gains in both health and economic development. Ensuring the success of African countries is crucial for overall global economic growth, and safeguarding the health of its people is critical to achieving that goal. The Ebola crisis has heightened awareness of these concerns. Let's work together to learn from the experience - and not have to replay it the hard way the next time the virus strikes.","2014-08-19 14:09:03","1","12.0","2.0","0.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","117.0","87.0","0.0","164.0","0.0","55.0","17","955","97.36","58.69","12.63","53.32","26.53","31.20","79.90","41.05","4.08","0.94","0.21","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.42","3.14","8.17","16.65","5.03","1.99","6.28","0.73","8.48","4.19","2.62","0.73","2.20","1.26","5.65","3.56","2.09","0.42","0.42","0.52","4.29","0.21","0.21","0.52","0.00","7.54","1.36","2.09","1.26","1.36","0.31","1.47","0.63","0.42","0.00","0.10","7.33","0.00","7.23","0.31","0.10","9.95","1.26","3.56","3.87","1.36","1.36","1.26","6.70","0.63","12.36","1.36","8.69","2.41","7.02","0.21","0.10","2.41","0.10","0.42","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.00","13.40","5.24","4.92","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.36","0.00","0.73","0.63","0.52","5022","9.25","26.944444444444443","1543","940","42","48.74","14.1","12.0","14.92","15.7","268","12.375","22.36425531914894","482","24.17","22","0.4","0","45","21","90","0","123","95","6","1","8","156","92","1","89","1","0","12","3","26","2","2","1","36","0","43","5","39","19","21","23","6","1","0","2"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-ways-to-actively-parti_b_5645854.html","10 Ways to Actively Participate in Your Medical Care","As a physician I have seen first-hand the different ways people face very similar diagnoses. Some face the challenges head on, in a very proactive and determined manner, while others succumb to the burden of their chronic illness. As a patient I recognize how easy it is to follow the second path and how much effort and planning it takes to forge the former. My challenge has been Young Onset Parkinson's disease, a diagnosis I received over 16 years ago. Regardless of our diagnosis, the fundamental approach is the same -- we must be active participants in our medical care if we are to learn to optimize our quality of life despite chronic disease. These are 10 ways to make yourself an active participant in the management of your chronic medical illness.

1. Educate yourself. You don't need a medical degree to become an informed patient. And being an informed patient will help optimize the management of your disease. Become familiar with the potential symptoms of your illness, what treatments are available and forthcoming, how your medications work and possible side effects. This way you are prepared not only for the course your illness takes but you are better able to ask relevant questions, understand the suggestions and information relayed by your physicians and coordinate your medical care.

2. Choose the right medical professional. Of course it is important to choose a physician who is qualified and experienced, but it is also important to be under the care of someone with whom you have great rapport. The physician-patient relationship can be a long-term one and one that is only successful if you not only have trust in their medical expertise but also feel your concerns are being heard and addressed.

3. Be prepared for your appointments. As a physician I know too well the time constraints that are built into a normal patient encounter. And there are many medical issues that need to be addressed during that short appointment time. We all have experienced that feeling as we leave our physician's office having forgotten to discuss one or more issues that were of primary concern to us, knowing that they will likely go unanswered until our next follow-up appointment. That is why it is important to prepare any questions or concerns you may have ahead of time, write them down so that those issues are sure to be addressed. And if memory is a problem, consider taking someone with you.

4. Be consistent. When dealing with a chronic illness, routine is paramount. You will do better if you adhere to a strict schedule with regards to your medications, sleep, exercise, meals and so forth. It is also important to make regular appointments for medical follow up and treatments.

5. Build your care team. We are not islands unto ourselves, and we do best when surrounded by a team of caring individuals who work with us to optimize how we live with this disease. Along with your physician, this team may consist of other health professionals in the areas of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, nutrition, counseling or others. The team will vary for every individual and will depend on age, stage of life, illness and life circumstances. But in every case, you must lead that team because only you know how this disease is impacting your life and in what areas you require assistance.

6. Determine your quality-of-life goals. It is of course important to adhere to certain routines, restrictions or medications in order to successfully manage your illness and those hallmark symptoms that define your disease. It is also important to maintain your quality of life, to address those symptoms or side effects of treatment that are interfering with your ability to enjoy life. Because what defines quality of life is such a subjective determination that varies from individual to individual, you must be clear in your communication of those goals to your medical team. Once they are aware of what aspect of your disease is the most bothersome, then they can address that issue specifically. Until the day we find a cure, we need to, as physicians and as patients, concentrate on improving quality of life -- improve daily existence, increase productivity, improve interpersonal relationships. It really is all about quality of life.

7. Optimize your health in every other way. Just because you are dealing with a chronic disease does not make you immune to other health problems. So it's important not to neglect your general health. Keep up with your annual physical exams, relevant screening tests (mammograms, prostate exams, routine blood work, etc.). And most importantly make those lifestyle changes that will give you the best possible health outcomes -- exercise regularly, make good food choices, sleep well, manage your stress. By optimizing your health, you will be better prepared to face the challenges of your chronic disease.

8. Extreme self-care is paramount. Taking the time daily to nurture your physical, emotional and spiritual needs will allow you to live better with your illness. If you neglect yourself, your life experience will suffer as will your ability to care for others and to remain productive.

9. Become your own advocate. In order to successfully navigate the medical system, you must be comfortable advocating for yourself in a productive manner. Only you know if the care you are receiving is helping you to achieve the quality of life you are seeking. If there are issue that are not being addressed either because your concerns are not being heard or there are logistical issues such as calls not being returned or tests not being booked, then you must follow up and express your concerns in a respectful manner. Addressing those concerns in a respectful way is important as it avoids putting others in a defensive position by your demeanor.

10. Participate in clinical research. The drug development process to get a medication from the lab counter to the pharmacy shelf can take decades and a staggering amount of funding. About half of that time is spent in clinical trials. The issue is that very few of us actually participate in clinical trials. In fact, approximately 85 percent of all clinical trials are delayed due to recruitment issues and a staggering 30 percent fail to recruit a single participant. What an incredible waste of resources and, most importantly, time. Time, which is something that those of us facing chronic illness, just don't have. The truth is that the only way to discover better treatments and ultimately a cure for any disease is through clinical trials. Therefore we as a patient community have to recognize our critical importance in this process and participate, fundraise and promote clinical research.

You must be actively involved in the management of your disease in order to live well with a chronic illness, actively seeking solutions to problems that arise and take on a proactive approach to life in general.

Articles pondered whether all the money spent even mattered. Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer's funds were widely deemed wasted, as were the millions spent by Mayday PAC, led by campaign finance reformer Lawrence Lessig. Meanwhile, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce crowed in a blog post, ""Out of the 15 primary races, runoffs, and special elections the U.S. Chamber invested in, we were successful in 14."" And each outside group's return on investment on Nov. 4 was ranked.

Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the leading House proponent of campaign finance reform, thinks much of this coverage missed the mark. While the Election Day results matter, they are only a means to the real end -- the legislation and regulation that does and does not move in the next Congress.

""A lot of the moneyed impact,"" said Sarbanes, ""and in some ways, the most sinister is on the governing that happens after.""

The impact of the money spent on the 2014 election is already evident in the governing agenda outlined by the incoming Republican leadership. These policies hew remarkably closely to the proposals long advanced by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- which was instrumental in helping the GOP finally win control of the Senate.

Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), likely the next Senate majority leader, pointed to free trade pacts and corporate tax reform as possible areas of bipartisan action. The Chamber of Commerce has been a leading advocate of corporate tax reform that would reduce rates on businesses and provide a tax holiday for repatriated funds from overseas.

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who chairs the Senate Republican Conference, similarly told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, ""I would love to see us do something in the area of tax reform."" On ""Fox New Sunday,"" Sen.-elect Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) also endorsed action on tax reform, as well as the Keystone XL pipeline and transportation -- all areas in which the chamber has been pushing for movement.

The Chamber of Commerce spent $35 million in independent funds from undisclosed donors to help the GOP take control of the Senate. While it dropped a lot of money to defeat Democrats in the general election, the role it played in Republican primaries fighting off tea party challengers of the ilk that sunk Republican's Senate hopes in the past two elections was absolutely critical.

The chamber is the nation's largest business lobby, but it was not the only industry group investing millions in the 2014 election in order to prime Congress for passage of its agenda. The American Chemistry Council, the trade association for the chemicals and plastics industry, spent $2.4 million on direct electoral ads to help elect Republican senators this year.

""We had a strong interest in seeing the leadership of the Senate change hands,"" American Chemistry Council spokeswoman Anne Kolton said. Asked if the surge in the group's election spending was tied to its legislative agenda, she added, ""Sure, yeah.""

The lobby group's main priority in the next Congress is an update of the Toxic Substances Control Act. Kolton identified Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, as the key obstacle to moving that legislation.

Ending the Democratic Senate majority takes the gavel out of Boxer's hand next year. Those in the industry predict that Republicans will pursue reform of the Toxic Substances Control Act.

Spending by corporate trade groups to elect a more amenable Congress dovetails with a broader shift in campaign finance this electoral cycle. While the 2014 election is projected to set a record for overall spending for midterm contests, it is doing so with far fewer donors than past cycles.

As the Center for Responsive Politics wrote days before the election, ""The 2014 midterms may well mark the election cycle in which the small donor got left behind."" It added, ""[O]utside money will have played an outsized role. And the number of identified individual donors will shrink, meaning more money will have come from fewer people.""

The increasing inequality in campaign funding stems from the Supreme Court's decisions in the 2010 Citizens United and 2014 McCutcheon cases. The former, along with a subsequent lower court decision, allowed unlimited independent spending by corporations, unions and wealthy individuals -- a boon for groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the American Chemistry Council. The latter eliminated limits on the aggregate amount a single donor could give to campaigns in one election cycle. The result overall has been a radical empowerment of the most deep-pocketed interests.

The first wave of mega-donors contributing to as many candidates and party committees as they desired was largely made up of members of the nation's corporate class, including casino magnates Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn and energy billionaires Charles and David Koch. A large portion of the outside spending that overtook many of this year's most important Senate races came from the political network run by the Kochs. Their political machine spent at least $77 million on electoral and issue ads targeting Democratic candidates and tens of millions more on efforts to get out the vote among conservatives.

As such political spending increases while the number of donors drops, congressional lawmakers needing money for their races and their allies become more beholden to the wealthiest Americans -- which often means their corporate interests. Legislative politics skews to the benefit of big business.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2014-midterm-lessons-for_b_6191072.html","2014 Midterm Lessons for Republicans: Ostensible GOP 'Inroads' With Latino Voters in 2014 Are Misleading, and Won't Be Repeated in 2016","At first glance, the 2014 midterm elections appear to have been an overwhelming success story for the Republican Party. Among Republican trophies, some commentators have highlighted how the GOP appears to have made significant ""inroads"" with Latino voters in this election cycle -- see articles in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and elsewhere.

This apparent increase in the GOP's share of Latino voters in 2014, however, does not hold up under close examination. Any Republican ""inroads"" cited by the media are based on flawed exit polling. If the supposed successes of 2014 cause the GOP to become complacent in its Latino outreach, Republicans will fail to recapture the White House in 2016, and possibly lose the Senate as well.

Let's consider the numbers. The nation's preeminent Hispanic polling firm, Latino Decisions, has pointed out that most exit polls use a flawed methodology when it comes to Hispanic voters, leading to an oversampling of Republican Latino voters that inflates the Republican share of the Hispanic vote. Latino Decisions' own election eve poll of Latino voters -- conducted in collaboration with NCLR (National Council of La Raza) and other partners -- gives a more accurate portrait of Latino voters in 2014. According to that poll, the GOP did capture a moderately larger share of the Hispanic vote in 2014 versus 2010, but nowhere near the margins suggested by the exit polls. And the reason the GOP moderately increased its share likely has more to do with which Latino voters turned out in a very low turnout election, with fewer Democrat-leaning Latino voters showing up on Election Day.

The fact remains that the overwhelming majority of Latino voters still do not trust the Republican party to deliver on Hispanic priorities. Latino Decisions' election eve poll shows only 22 percent of Latino voters who turned out on Election Day believe the Republican Party truly cares about the Hispanic community. For registered Hispanics who stayed home, that figure is an abysmal 12 percent. If these numbers represent ""inroads"" with Latino voters, the GOP must have been starting from an incredibly low baseline.

When Latino turnout inevitably increases in the 2016 elections, such low levels of Hispanic support will not be enough for the GOP to take back the White House -- and perhaps not even to hold on to their majority in the Senate, considering that Senate contests in 2016 will take place in states with large Latino populations such as Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, and Nevada. To win in the 2016 electoral landscape, Republicans must field candidates who bring strong support for Latino priorities and who will therefore be competitive in these races; anti-immigrant positioning will inevitably drive Hispanics away from the party.

Unfortunately, it seems that the GOP is set on taking exactly that course of action. Barely a week after their sweeping victory in the midterm elections, some Republican lawmakers were once again proving their readiness to further alienate Latino voters by threatening to shut down the government if President Obama takes executive action on immigration -- despite polling showing that 61 percent of Latino voters would be less enthusiastic for the Republican Party if it attempts to block administrative action on immigration. Last week, 59 House Republicans signed onto a letter drafted by Representative Matt Salmon (R-AZ) demanding that House leadership refuse to fund any administrative immigration fixes, potentially setting up a shutdown like we witnessed in the fall of 2013. Although GOP leaders such as Mitch McConnell are insistent that another government shutdown is off the table, Speaker Boehner has repeatedly warned President Obama that taking executive action on immigration will ""get [Obama] burned"" by killing any remaining chance of Congress working with the president on immigration reform or other issues.

Until the Republican Party abandons this rhetoric, fields candidates who show strong support for the issues that Latino voters care about, and disavows the extreme elements of its party who are willing to shut down the government rather than see our broken immigration system fixed, they cannot be said to have made any real inroads with the Hispanic community. President Obama's historic 71 percent share of the Latino vote in the 2012 elections wasn't due to his personality or his party affiliation. He won Hispanic voters because he pledged to deliver on the issues that they cared about -- while his opponent Mitt Romney endorsed the callous and unworkable policy of ""self-deportation"" as the solution for our broken immigration system.

Millions of Latino voters have parents, siblings, and friends who would benefit from administrative relief. Yet at this moment, elements of the GOP are threatening that they will shut down the government if President Obama takes action to put an end to senseless deportations.

If only 22 percent of Latino voters who participated in these midterm elections trust the GOP to deliver on Hispanic priorities, what new lows of Latino support will Republicans see in 2016 if they choose to block President Obama from granting relief to millions of immigrant families?","2014-11-20 07:27:50","1","12.0","3.0","0.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","115.0","87.0","0.0","168.0","0.0","56.0","17","833","96.37","64.52","23.61","74.89","32.04","28.33","70.35","41.90","6.84","1.92","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.60","0.84","4.92","7.80","16.33","5.04","2.88","3.84","0.84","10.32","3.48","1.68","1.56","2.76","2.40","5.88","4.20","1.56","0.48","0.36","0.96","6.96","0.36","0.24","0.00","0.60","9.00","1.68","1.32","1.44","3.12","1.32","2.88","1.92","1.56","0.24","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.16","3.12","1.80","5.52","1.80","0.84","1.68","6.84","1.08","14.17","2.40","8.52","3.36","4.08","1.08","0.84","0.12","0.00","0.12","0.24","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.12","0.00","12.24","3.00","4.32","0.00","0.12","0.12","0.00","1.92","1.20","0.84","0.48","0.24","4298","8.72","32.23076923076923","1360","829","26","39.1","15.9","15.7","14.23","19.6","184","10.6","23.638166465621232","386","28.62","14","0.4","0","13","19","79","1","121","57","3","1","12","112","112","6","66","0","0","11","11","33","2","0","10","26","0","37","17","19","14","21","20","3","9","0","3"

Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn and Republican Bruce Rauner have both tried to convince voters that the other is the worst thing that could happen to the state. The negativity is enough to make you want to stay away from the poll all together. But Reboot Illinois' Madeleine Doubek reminds us why it's still important to vote, even when we might not want to.

From Doubek:

1. One of these men will be the next governor. To achieve anything, the winner will have to figure out a way to work with House Speaker Michael Madigan, as well as Illinois Senate President John Cullerton. 2. This election isn't just about Rauner's or Quinn's future. It's about ours. We each have a lot at stake. 3. Got children or grandchildren? The next governor will have significant say in how our schools get funded, and therefore, how we help our children. That will play out in every grade and high school. It also will affect what happens with tuition and fees at our colleges.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-things-we-could-do-with_b_6147712.html","3 Things We Could Do With the Money Spent on the 2014 Midterm Elections","This year's mid-term election in the United States has been this nation's most expensive yet, costing an estimated $4 billion. Compared to national and state budgets, it's a small amount, but that kind of money can still make a huge impact on issues that affect our health, well-being and security.

For those who would argue democracy has a price and absurdly inflated campaign finance is part of the cost of free and fair elections, consider this: the United Kingdom spent an estimated £113,225,271 (around $173 million in US dollars at the time) on parliamentary elections in 2010.

Also in 2010, Australia held its House of Representatives and half-senate elections, with a price tag of $161,342,861 Australian dollars or about $143.5 million U.S. dollars at the time. The cost of the U.S. mid-term in the same year? Over $3.6 billion. With a B. These figures also point to the fallacy in equating money with fair process: both the U.K. and Australia out-rank the United States in a number of published democracy and electoral freedom indices.

So, imagine for a minute that all those corporate donations, Super PACs, individual contributions and public money wasn't spent on persuading us why one politician is better than another -- what could $4 billion buy? Here are three ideas at the top of our wish list:

1) Controlling Ebola AND Eradicating Measles:

With seven confirmed cases in the United States by the time Election Day rolled around, Ebola was quickly politicized and used in campaigning. To date, the U.S. has committed an impressive $377 million towards the response effort, which the United Nations estimates will cost, in total, just over $1 billion over the next six months. With mid-term money, we could have funded the entire international relief effort almost four times over. Moreover, the U.S. Ebola pledge is a mere 9 percent of the amount which we willingly spent on the mid-terms - that's a pretty clear indication of priorities.

If we chose to focus on the next six months of Ebola response, we'd have a handy $3 billion or so left over, which could be used for a longer term, yet extremely high impact, issue: eradicating measles. The upper range of the estimate for eliminating measles entirely from our planet is $3.1 billion -- easily achievable with our midterm budget. More to the point, the returns on this investment are staggering - saving up to 350 million disability-adjusted life years by 2050, for a cost of approximately $7.8 billion.

2) Honor the U.S. Commitment to the Global Fund:

While tackling a single disease issue is laudable, what about providing funding support to the international institutions that tackle, holistically, the most pressing infectious disease challenges? Coincidentally, $4 billion is the amount the Obama administration pledged to support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for the period 2011-2013, and roughly equal to the contributions committed for 2014-2016. In the wake of the 2011 budget cuts, the Administration considered reneging on this promise.

The threat of reduced funding forced the Global Fund to cease providing new grants, denying anti-retroviral therapies, antibiotics, and bednets to those who needed them most. A steady and reliable funding base is critical for organizations like the Global Fund to support the kind of long-term projects that have the most substantial impacts. The U.S. has, commendably, been the single largest contributor to the Global Fund to date - this commitment must be sustained, and $4 billion is a small price to pay.

3) Build Foundational Health Systems in Every Country:

You could argue even the Global Fund focuses too narrowly on a sub-set of diseases; after all, it wouldn't have prevented the emergence of the Ebola outbreak. So let's get back to basics -- how much would it cost to build the essential, foundational public health and veterinary infrastructure that would enable all countries of the world to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks? Thankfully, the World Bank has made those calculations, and estimates that even under a scenario of high disease transmission and risk, all it would take to develop and sustain these permanent systems is up to $3.4 billion annually. The pay-off: An incredible $37 billion saved in reduced disease incidence and prevented pandemics.

We paid $4 billion for the 2014 mid-term elections, and what did we get? 435 Representatives in the House, 36 Senators and 36 Governors.

Doesn't seem like a great deal, given the alternatives.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/4-reasons-why-housing-was_b_4687946.html","4 Reasons Why Housing Wasn't an Issue in the State of the Union","In tonight's speech, President Obama mentioned housing twice. First, at the start of the speech, he included the ""rebounding housing market"" as part of his victory lap. Second, he called on Congress to ""send me legislation"" that would protect taxpayers from paying for another housing crisis while keeping alive the ""dream of homeownership."" That line was vague, and it didn't bring down the house. What he meant was made clearer in the companion policy fact-sheet: Obama was referring to the four principles for housing-finance reform legislation that he outlined last August.

Why nothing new or specific about housing? There are plenty of housing issues that President Obama might have talked about. Affordability is worsening, mortgage credit appears tight, and delinquencies and foreclosures are still too widespread. Why did none of these make the final cut? Four reasons. The housing policies that Obama might have talked about were either:

Refinancing is less of a financial slam-dunk for households now that mortgage rates have risen.

is less of a financial slam-dunk for households now that mortgage rates have risen. Loan modifications are less urgent because rising prices and a strengthening economy have lifted millions of borrowers back above water and reduced the share of mortgages in default.

The housing market is in the best shape of Obama's presidency. Construction and sales in 2013 were both at their highest levels since before he took office, and prices have bounced back to within range of their long-term norms. Two of Obama's main housing initiatives during his first term are less essential today:A key measure to prevent a repeat of last decade's crisis is now in place: the most contentious elements of the qualified mortgage / ability-to-repay and qualified residential mortgage rules were hammered out last year, and QM is now in effect. While the impact and evolution of these rules is still to be seen, the main features of the rules themselves have been settled.

3) Too local. Affordability concerns are growing, as prices and mortgage rates climb up from low levels, but affordability is a local, not national, crisis. In San Francisco, just 14% of homes for sale are within reach of a household with median local income, versus more than 80% in some metros in the Midwest and South. One key solution to an affordability crisis is also local: more construction in markets where demand is strong but supply is held back by regulations and other constraints.

4) Too messy. The huge, looming housing question is how to reform or replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The ""send me legislation"" line repeated Obama's call last August for Congressional action on Fannie/Freddie reform. But tonight he didn't reveal any new thinking on the fundamental challenge: how to keep the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage relatively cheap and widely available while minimizing taxpayer exposure to the next housing meltdown. Any housing-finance reform that could achieve that would be too complicated, too dependent on Congress, and would take too long to succeed for a speech about a ""year of action.""","2014-01-29 11:41:03","1","8.0","6.0","0.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","116.0","90.0","0.0","166.0","0.0","55.0","17","514","86.50","51.56","43.63","35.99","19.77","23.74","82.68","44.94","5.45","2.53","0.39","0.00","0.00","1.56","0.58","2.92","6.42","14.59","8.37","5.45","5.84","0.97","12.06","5.45","2.72","1.17","2.92","3.11","2.14","1.36","0.78","0.00","0.00","0.19","4.09","0.00","0.19","0.00","1.56","9.14","1.75","2.33","0.78","2.14","0.97","2.33","1.36","0.58","0.58","0.19","0.39","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.19","8.75","0.39","2.14","5.06","1.17","1.17","3.89","7.98","0.97","17.90","2.14","8.95","7.78","5.64","0.19","5.06","5.25","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.34","4.67","3.70","1.17","0.00","0.39","0.00","1.95","1.95","1.36","0.39","0.78","2528","8.66","20.03846153846154","763","502","25","59.53","11.8","9.9","13.05","13.2","128","7.25","20.239203187250997","281","18.46","2","0.43","0","21","9","41","0","68","46","4","2","6","106","36","0","35","0","0","10","4","20","2","1","3","11","0","16","15","11","15","13","15","4","1","0","5"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/8-hotly-debated-issues--f_b_6114754.html","8 Hotly Debated Issues... From the Election That Never Was","Call it the Election That Never Was.

We've heard a lot of talk about this week's election, but the election we needed is the one we didn't see. The important issues, the issues that affected people's daily lives, were never debated. Voters never heard a genuine exchange of views and never had a chance to vote on competing visions of the future.

It has been suggested that the Democratic Party can run and win on social issues in 2016, but that seems less likely after this year's results. If voters can reject a personhood amendment and elect a far-right Republican on the same ballot, social issues aren't likely to be the cure-all some Democrats are seeking.

It's clearer than ever: If Democrats don't offer bold solutions to some fundamental economic issues (we'll offer eight of them, but there are more) then the implications for their party -- and for the country -- are profound, and dire.

Grading on a curve.

It's true that this was never expected to be a good year for Democrats. But the results were worse than expected, even given this year's special circumstances. The gubernatorial results alone demonstrate that this election was a party failure, despite the mitigating circumstances, even if we're grading on a curve. As political strategist Celinda Lake noted when we interviewed her afterwards, this was a ""wave"" election -- and it broke against Democrats.

Waves break quickly, but they form slowly. Public disaffection with the president -- and, by extension, his party -- built over years. If Democrats want to turn the tide for future elections, there's not much time to waste.

Political insiders may sneer at the choices made by ""low information"" voters. But every member of the electorate is a high-information voter about at least one subject: his or her own life. They bring that information into the polling booth and vote accordingly.

Times are still hard for a lot of people. People understand intuitively that ""the system is rigged,"" but only a few leaders have explained why and by whom. Most Democratic candidates offered no explanations for the continuing hard times and few meaningful ideas for ending them.

For far too long, President Obama avoided confronting Republicans, embracing some of their proposals as his own and paying a price for their unpopularity -- a cost his party now also bears. We saw that pattern repeated this year as Republicans once again ran to Democrats' left on Social Security, punishing them mercilessly for supporting the supposedly ""bipartisan"" Simpson-Bowles benefit cut.

Democratic candidates understandably struggled with the president's unpopularity. But many seemed to confuse his image with their party's, abandoning its traditional strengths in an attempt to distance themselves from him.

If so, they miscalculated. Democrats seemed timid and non-confrontational, especially in the South. They seemed unwilling to bring a fight to even the most aggressive opponents -- opponents who didn't hesitate to savage them at every turn. Too many Dems seemed indecisive and apologetic, agreeable ciphers rather than courageous leaders, even as their opponents assumed empty postures of courage or decisiveness. (A friend wondered last night if Alison Lundergan Grimes would acknowledge voting for herself when the voting was over.)

In a race between a candidate and a non-candidate, the candidate wins every time.

The Groucho Paradox

To be fair, Democrats were fighting forces that had been years in the making. And yet, in a much-remarked upon and seemingly paradoxical outcome, voters who rejected Democratic candidates simultaneously embraced Democratic ideas -- or ideas that used to be considered Democratic -- in referendums and propositions around the country. They voted to increase the minimum wage everywhere it was on the ballot, in six states and three cities -- and they did so by wide margins. Voters in solidly-red Phoenix, Arizona, ""soundly"" rejected a measure that would have cut pensions for city workers.

Voters also relaxed marijuana laws in two states and the District of Columbia. They would've done the same in Florida, according to polls, before Sheldon Adelson financed a massive campaign against it. T(he measure still garnered 57 percent of the vote, but needed 60 percent to pass.) And in a move to protect reproductive rights, two states rejected so-called ""personhood"" laws.

To paraphrase a Groucho Marx line: They like everything about you, Democrats, except you.

The success of these initiatives presents a striking contrast to candidates' performance. Alaska's minimum-wage increase passed by 69 percent, but Democratic Sen. Mark Begich lost. In Arkansas the minimum-wage measure passed with 65 percent of the vote, even as incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor went down to defeat. (Pryor sent mixed signals on the minimum wage, supporting the state measure but opposing a Federal increase.)

The seeming ""paradox"" of voters choosing Democratic policies while electing Republican politicians isn't really a paradox at all -- if Democrats haven't campaigned on those policies.

The debate that wasn't.

Meanwhile, in some alternate universe, the Election That Never Was was fought over the economic issues that affect most Americans. Here are eight issues that were hotly debated in that campaign -- a campaign which, needless to say, had a very different outcome:

1. The American majority has lost 75 years' worth of wealth.

Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman have measured the loss: The majority (defined as the ""bottom"" 90 percent of Americans) has lost all of the wealth it accumulated after 1940. Decades of postwar growth built the middle class, but the wealth which the American majority accumulated over nearly three-quarters of a century is now gone:

The authors measured wealth by totaling up home equity, stocks and bonds, the value of pension plans and other assets, and then subtracting the debt people hold. The result? All of the majority's wartime and postwar wealth is gone now.

It hasn't disappeared, of course. It's been shifted upward -- to the top 10 percent, and (most dramatically) to the top 0.1 percent:

And while the wealthiest among us have been grabbing an ever-growing share of the pie, the nation has been trembling in fear of ... what? ISIS? Ebola?

This wealth shift has undone nearly 75 years of progress, with profound implications for the financial well-being of most Americans, but very few voters even heard about it.

2. Student debt is destroying a generation.

We already knew that student debt has reached unprecedented heights, locking young people into a spiral of almost insurmountable debt even as they enter a highly limited job market. Thanks to a new study, we now also know that it is degrading the quality of their lives. A new study shows that students who struggle with educational debt of $50,000 or more suffer in four out of five aspects of well-being, as measured by the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index: a sense of purpose, financial well-being, community relations, and physical health. (There is no evidence that they experience loss in the other measurement, which is social.)

The total amount of student debt in this country is approximately $1.2 trillion. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that more than 13 percent of student debt holders owe $50,000 or more, and the average senior with student debt owes more than $26,000.

What kind of society wounds the lives of its children, the generation that will forge its future? And why was student debt only mentioned in passing in this year's election, with no proposal for fundamentally changing a system which causes so much harm and perpetuates inequality?

3. Banks are still robbing, cheating, and breaking the law.

The ongoing financial catastrophe which some call the Great Recession (I prefer The Long Depression) still haunts us -- most of us, that is. Banks, the institutions whose criminality and fraud caused the crisis, are doing just fine, thank you very much. They were rescued by taxpayers, the criminals within them were never prosecuted, and their senior executives never paid a price for running institutions which functionally became crime syndicates.

Instead of facing criminal investigations, bank executives were allowed to negotiate ""settlement deals"" that forced other people to pay a penalty for their misdeeds. These bankers didn't even have to admit they broke the law. All they had to do was promise not to break the law again.

Now, in what must be the least surprising story to come out of Wall Street in a decade, we learn that they've broken that promise, too.

Democrats in the White House protected bankers (although Dems on the Hill did take some initial steps to rein them in with Dodd/Frank). Republicans in Congress groveled at their feet. And nobody talked about Wall Street criminality during this election, despite the fact that the wrongdoing goes on.

4. The economy continues to grow more slowly than expected.

Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have based their decisions -- or at least their public arguments -- on the economic projections provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). As it turns out, the CBO has consistently expected the economy to do better than it has:

Its predictions have become consistently more grim -- but the economy's performance has been grimmer still. Throughout this year-long campaign, almost nobody asked why -- or what could be done about it.

The austerity measures which Republicans foisted on the nation, often with the President's rhetorical support, stifled growth considerably. These austerity policies cost the nation millions of jobs and billions in lost wages -- and were never debated, even though roughly 90 percent of the electorate considered the economy their No. 1 priority.

5. People need jobs -- lots of jobs.

Labor force participation is at historic lows. Even the official unemployment rate, which is a less reliable measure in periods of protracted joblessness, is extremely high. Our infrastructure -- roads, schools, bridges, power plants -- needs trillions of dollars in repairs.

But Republicans have refused to spend the money needed to create those jobs or fix our infrastructure. Even the President's American Jobs Act, an underpowered measure laced with tax cuts to lure the GOP, was considered ""too liberal"" to be politically feasible.

How often did you hear specific job programs -- not magical talk about tax cut prestidigitation, but real jobs programs -- discussed in this election?

6. Social Security is a core value.

The polling is clear: Americans want Social Security expanded, and they want millionaires to pay for it. But most Democrats (with a few notable exceptions) equivocated on the issue for years. Even Nancy Pelosi, widely considered a liberal stalwart of the Democratic Congress, publicly praised the Simpson-Bowles plan -- a plan which included cuts to Social Security and Medicare.

Predictably, Republicans ran to the left of Democrats on this issue -- again. In 2010 they used a mythical ""Seniors' Bill of Rights"" program to steal Democrats' thunder on the issue, despite their attempt to privatize Social Security a few short years before. This year they ran ads against Democrats who supported Simpson Bowles, claiming (with some accuracy) that these Dems supported a plan that would cut Social Security.

To be sure, Mark Begich made Social Security expansion a signature issue in Alaska and, while the outcome isn't final in his race, things aren't looking good for him. But Begich was fighting a rising tide of perception -- and running in a heavily red state. Bruce Braley embraced it, too. But Braley's move, which came in the waning weeks of his campaign, had the air of a deathbed conversion.

Should we expand Social Security benefits, or cut them and privatize the program? This year we never had a real debate on its future.

7. Climate change is a trillion-dollar problem -- and could drown much of New York City.

How's this for a dose of reality? A new study shows that much of New York City now lies in a flood zone, putting an estimated $129 billion worth of property at risk. Multiplied out to every coastal city in the nation, the risk runs into the trillions -- and it's greatly exacerbated by climate change, according to experts.

Yes, climate change is real -- and it is already beginning to have a devastating impact on our economy.

Republicans continue to do the Koch brothers' dirty work by denying the reality of climate change. And yet, incredibly, the fate of the planet itself was never debated in this year's election.

(One of the neighborhoods which is expected to be flooded in a near-future New York is Wall Street. You can file that under ""Silver Linings."")

8. The Republicans have no plan for fixing the economy.

Consider this quote: ""... It (The Republican economic platform) just struck me as sort of a compendium of modest expectations. If you ask me, 'What's your ballpark guess for how many jobs are going to be created?,' it's just not many.""

Or this response to the GOP's economic proposals: ""I don't think any of these are particular game changers.""

That's just what Republican economists think. Needless to say, independent and left-leaning analysts are even less impressed.

The Republicans don't have a plan to fix our economy. Even their favorite economists say so. Did you hear that come up in this year's campaigning?

Conclusion

Democrats allowed themselves to be outplayed by Republicans who obscured their own policies and, in too many cases, sounded an awful lot as if they were Democrats themselves. That shouldn't have been a surprise. Republicans are very good at finding Democratic strengths and undermining them.

This year's political jujitsu involved a lot of sympathetic talk from Republicans about the economic plight of the majority, and a lot of backtracking from their own fringe social and economic views. (Cory Gardner's successful Colorado campaign is an excellent case in point.) Time and time again, they tapped into the sentiments of voters who are frustrated with the status quo -- and time and time again, the Democrats let them.

Democrats who have been hoping to avoid tough economic issues in 2016 may have just had their hopes dashed by the Republicans, who have proven to be more skillful shapeshifters than anyone realized. That means Dems will need to stake bold economic positions, and they'll need to demand that Republicans defend their own views. That's a real debate ... and it's a debate they can win.

This election wasn't just a failure for Democrats. It was a failure for democracy. The democratic process calls for an honest choice between two competing visions of the future. But these critical issues, and other like them, weren't even debated.

The Republicans' gain was everyone else's loss -- and that won't change until we learn a lesson from the Election That Never Was.","2014-11-06 10:39:33","1","72.0","4.0","0.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","124.0","87.0","0.0","186.0","0.0","55.0","17","2427","83.40","64.93","21.75","31.39","16.29","26.08","80.43","46.89","9.64","4.00","0.16","0.82","0.33","0.54","2.14","5.64","8.69","12.94","7.13","4.74","5.40","1.65","12.07","4.78","2.31","1.44","2.27","3.26","5.89","3.09","2.76","0.49","0.70","0.99","7.87","0.04","0.12","0.12","0.45","11.99","2.27","1.77","1.65","3.01","1.73","3.38","1.36","0.62","0.49","0.12","0.45","0.04","0.37","0.00","0.04","8.98","2.02","1.85","4.41","0.78","1.03","4.53","6.80","1.36","12.69","2.06","6.06","4.61","5.40","0.49","0.12","3.21","0.00","0.08","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.04","0.16","0.00","20.77","5.97","5.07","0.49","0.00","0.45","0.00","3.58","1.15","2.55","1.24","0.25","11968","7.92","17.124137931034483","3683","2400","139","62.38","12.1","8.9","12.87","11.9","521","7.083333333333334","17.603333333333335","980","15.94","11","0.46","0","90","49","267","0","291","194","8","6","16","354","160","44","170","1","0","89","36","140","6","4","3","58","0","71","109","53","68","83","65","24","15","1","6"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alaska-senate-midterm-election-results_n_5729950.html","Alaska Senate Midterm Election Results Show Sullivan Wins Over Begich","Republican Dan Sullivan was victorious over incumbent Democrat Mark Begich in the Alaska Senate race. The Associated Press announced the decision early Wednesday, more than a week after the midterms were held.

Sullivan served as the Attorney General of Alaska under former Gov. Sarah Palin (R). Begich previously served as the mayor of Anchorage before being elected to the Senate in 2008.

More from The Associated Press:

JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Republican Dan Sullivan won Alaska's U.S. Senate race, defeating first-term incumbent Democrat Mark Begich.

Sullivan led Begich by about 8,100 votes on Election Night last week and held a comparable edge after election workers had counted about 20,000 absentee, early-voted and questioned ballots late Tuesday. Thousands more ballots remained to be counted, but the results indicated that Begich could not overcome Sullivan's lead.

The Alaska seat was initially considered key to the Republicans' hopes of taking control of the U.S. Senate, but that goal was accomplished before the Alaska race was decided.

Sullivan's campaign planned to release a statement. A Begich spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment made around 11 p.m.

On Tuesday, news reporters and observers affiliated with candidates or political parties watched as election workers opened ballots, reviewed those in which voters' qualifications were questioned and tallied votes in election centers in Juneau and other parts of the state.

Begich was in Washington, D.C., as Congress geared up to finish out this session. Earlier in the day, his spokesman, Max Croes, said Alaskans deserved to have their voices heard and votes counted.

Sullivan, a first-time candidate, ran a confident campaign, ignoring the debate schedule Begich released during the primary and setting his own agenda. He also attracted some star power to the state, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party favorite, and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney rallying support for Sullivan in the waning days of the hotly contested race.

Sullivan pledged to fight federal overreach, talked about the need for an energy renaissance in the U.S. and at seemingly every opportunity, sought to tie Begich to President Barack Obama and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who are unpopular in Alaska.

Begich complained that Sullivan offered little in the way of proposals for what he would do as senator. Begich touted his clout, including a position on the power Senate Appropriations Committee, and tried to paint sharp contrasts between himself and Sullivan in areas such as women's health, education and Alaska issues.

Begich, for example, was born and raised in Alaska. He cast Sullivan, who grew up in Ohio, as an outsider, and many of the early attacks by pro-Begich groups keyed in to that theme. That perception of Sullivan made for an at-times uncomfortable debate on fisheries issues, in which questioners grilled Sullivan about his knowledge of one of Alaska's most important industries.

On several occasions, Sullivan's wife, Julie Fate Sullivan, an Alaska Native and frequent companion on the campaign trail, appeared in ads defending her husband's ties to the state and his positions on women's issues.

Sullivan has roots in Alaska dating to the 1990s but was gone for nearly seven years for military service and work in Washington, D.C., that included working as an assistant secretary of state. He returned to Alaska in 2009, when he was appointed attorney general by then-Gov. Sarah Palin.

He most recently served as Alaska's natural resources commissioner, a post he left in September 2013, to make his first run for public office.

Sullivan hit the ground running, exhibiting a fundraising prowess that rivaled and during some quarters exceeded that of Begich. Many of his supporters cited his service in the Marine Corps reserves or repeated the oft-repeated GOP refrain that became of hallmark of the campaign — that Begich voted with Obama ""97 percent of the time,"" a figure that takes into account votes during 2013, many of them on confirmations, on which Obama stated a preference.

Sullivan said he was humbled by the support he received and publicly sought to tamp down expectations of a win, even as campaign members expressed great confidence in a victory in the lead-up to the Nov. 4 election and said the Democrats' much-talked-about ground game wasn't all it was made out to be.

It was estimated that tens of millions of dollars were pumped into the state, with Republicans seeing Begich as vulnerable and Democrats trying to hold the seat Begich won in 2008. Voters were barraged by calls and ads, which many said they were turned off by.

Sullivan emerged from a hard-fought, three-way GOP primary to take on Begich, who had token opposition. Begich focused during that race on bolstering his homespun image, casting himself as an independent thinker unafraid to stand up to Obama, with a record of working across party lines, including with Alaska's senior senator, Republican Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski, who backed Sullivan after the primary and is expected to become chairwoman of the Senate energy committee now that Republicans have taken over the Senate, told Begich to knock it off.

A turning point, in the view of many observers, was an ad from Begich's campaign shortly after the primary that painted Sullivan as soft on crime. It featured a man identified as a former Anchorage police officer standing outside the home where an elderly couple was beaten to death and a family member sexually abused in 2013. It ended with the man saying Sullivan should not be a senator.

The ad, which Sullivan responded to with one of his own, was pulled following a demand from an attorney for the victims' family.

Begich, in discussing the ad, said Sullivan had a ""pattern when he was attorney general of doing these plea deals that let violent offenders, sexual offenders out earlier than they should be."" He said Sullivan's record as attorney general needed to be scrutinized. But that didn't become a major focus of TV ads by his campaign and surrogates.

Instead, some of the strongest criticism of Sullivan was with regards to his residency, his support of a permitting bill that critics said would have limited public participation in the state's permitting process and his stance on abortion.","2014-11-12 03:33:06","1","30.0","4.0","0.0","3.0","14.0","0.0","108.0","91.0","0.0","218.0","0.0","59.0","19","1043","97.80","73.66","10.06","34.06","23.18","27.23","71.72","42.09","6.62","3.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.68","0.38","3.55","8.25","17.93","4.70","1.63","4.99","0.48","10.74","4.89","3.36","1.25","2.30","1.92","3.55","2.01","1.53","0.19","0.86","0.00","8.25","0.38","0.10","0.38","2.88","6.52","1.73","1.25","1.05","1.34","0.38","1.44","2.49","0.67","1.15","0.48","0.58","0.00","0.19","0.29","0.19","9.40","1.34","2.68","5.85","1.34","0.19","7.29","2.49","0.38","13.90","1.15","7.38","5.37","3.74","0.86","0.38","0.29","0.00","0.10","0.10","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.53","5.37","6.33","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.15","0.38","1.82","0.38","0.00","5130","8.55","25.261904761904763","1621","1028","49","50.16","13.4","11.5","12.82","13.5","252","5.5625","20.20544747081712","500","23.21","19","0.43","0","34","19","96","0","153","56","3","1","5","158","152","6","66","0","0","21","16","21","2","2","10","30","0","23","88","25","40","8","6","12","5","0","3"

Grimes has long been the primary frontrunner, and has been actively campaigning against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for months.

HuffPost Pollster, which tracks the latest opinion polls, currently finds McConnell and Grimes in a virtual tie:

Below, more details from the Associated Press:

Mitch McConnell and Alison Lundergan Grimes ran victory laps Tuesday in Kentucky as they rallied their party faithful to nominate them for a colossal showdown in November that could help decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.

Grimes, Kentucky's Democratic Secretary of State, rolled to victory over nominal primary opposition. And McConnell easily defeated tea party-backed challenger Matt Bevin, who spent $3.3 million in his failed bid to oust the five-term Republican Senate leader.

When he announced his candidacy last summer, Bevin appeared poised to give McConnell the run for his life. But despite the financial backing of outside conservative groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund and FreedomWorks, Bevin's campaign never gained traction. McConnell used high-profile endorsements from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association to tout his conservative bona fides.

Bevin characterized himself as the true conservative in the race, hitting McConnell hard for his repeated votes to increase the country's debt and his vote to approve the 2008 Wall Street bailout. But his campaign stumbled early when a document surfaced from Bevin's investment company calling the bailout a ""positive development."" And Bevin was caught on tape telling a crowd at a pro-cockfighting rally that he thought it was wrong to make cockfighting illegal.

However, McConnell had already shifted into fall campaign mode. He's been attacking Obama's health care law and coal regulations and trying to link Grimes to the president, who is deeply unpopular in Kentucky. Grimes, meanwhile, has been portraying herself as an ""independent Kentucky woman"" at recent campaign stops in what could be an attempt to woo scorned GOP primary voters.","2014-05-20 19:05:27","1","15.0","3.0","0.0","3.0","16.0","0.0","109.0","91.0","0.0","215.0","0.0","59.0","19","336","94.17","76.25","7.84","70.57","24.00","33.63","68.75","37.20","6.85","4.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.57","0.89","2.38","7.74","12.80","4.76","1.79","5.36","0.30","9.23","4.17","2.08","2.08","1.19","0.60","4.76","3.57","1.19","0.00","0.30","0.30","8.93","0.00","0.00","0.60","3.27","6.25","1.19","1.19","0.60","0.89","0.89","1.49","1.19","0.30","0.00","0.89","0.89","0.00","0.60","0.00","0.30","11.90","1.79","2.68","8.63","1.19","0.89","4.17","3.87","0.00","13.99","1.79","7.14","5.06","5.36","0.89","0.00","1.49","0.30","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","15.18","5.36","4.46","0.60","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.19","1.19","2.08","0.00","0.30","1809","9.09","24.714285714285715","546","332","16","50.36","14.3","11.4","15.49","15.6","93","15.5","21.524819277108435","211","22.5","5","0.36","0","12","5","26","0","32","26","2","1","2","55","70","1","11","0","0","8","8","12","0","0","0","11","0","12","17","9","9","0","9","3","3","0","2"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alright-gop-time-to-put-u_b_6116656.html","Alright GOP, Time to Put Up Or Shut Up","Congratulations Republicans, you've won control of Congress. Now it's time to put down the talking points, stop your OCD obsession with ObamaCare and prove that you can actually do the following:

Close the U.S. Border to Illegal Immigration.

Instead of merely talking tough to keep the Tea Party nativists at bay, while keeping the border semi-porous in order to reward your Chamber of Commerce pals with cheap, easily abused illegal labor, spend $50 billion truly securing our southern flank. That would mean hiring ten thousand returning vets -- many of whom struggle to find work -- so that we can finally stop the flow of all illegal immigrants (and the drug and human traffickers and would-be-terrorists that ride on coattails). Your overpriced border fence isn't going to cut it, okay? The swing voters who came out for the GOP in droves on Tuesday will never say this in exit polls, but they are sick and tired of having our generous and welcoming nation gamed by opportunists. You need armed military on the border to send a clear message to all trespassers: Ir Inicio.

Oh, and while you're at it, close the loophole in the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 that allows Central American families to sneak into the country and then permanently stay here while deliberately skipping their deportation status hearings. You talk a good game about illegal immigration. Now prove it.

Make Sure the Border Is Genuinely Secure before Agreeing to Amnesty.

As I made clear in a previous post on this head, if you agree to amnesty first or simultaneously, then our southern border will be overwhelmed by refugees from all parts of the planet trying to cross illegally before the enforcement provisions of ""immigration reform"" kick in. It will be the Central American border crisis of last summer writ large.

And if our electorally tone-deaf President goes for unilateral amnesty via executive order - which he shockingly vowed to do Wednesday, only a day after voters unequivocally rejected his pattern of unconstitutional overreach -- have the cajones to impeach him.

Put that Bigoted, Homophobic Nutball, Vladimir Putin, In His Place And Preserve Ukraine As a Democratic Nation Free of Russian Interference. Without Causing WWIII.

You did it under Reagan, when the Kremlin had many more nukes pointed our way. You can do it again now. If you can't solve the Ukraine mess using the war powers granted to you by the U.S. Constitution, you will do us zero good occupying the Oval Office come 2016. Keep your eye on the ball: Putin is the major threat to U.S. interests globally. Not Isis. Not Iran. Not Cuba. Not North Korea. Not Yemen. Not Syria. Putin. Get it?

Defeating Putin in Eastern Europe starts with fulsome high-tech support of the Ukrainian armed forces. This should be followed up by an energy policy that enables fast-track construction of LNG ports, so we can export large amounts of the stuff to Europe. Heck, we're just burning off excess natural gas in the Bakken Formation right now. Once we've liberated Europe from its dependence on Russian gas crack, it can be more proactive in helping us deal with the corrupt and criminal Kremlin.

Win the War against Islamic Extremism without Bogging the US down In Another Mideast Quagmire.

I don't want to hear anymore of your chicken-hawk whining about what our President is failing to do in fighting ISIS. You have ultimate control over the purse strings now. If you want to send in U.S. troops, make a transparent, empirical case free of Cheney-level disinformation. Frankly, I think this is the Arab world's and Israel's fight. You need to do whatever it takes to get all countries in the region involved collectively to solve this problem without putting sizable U.S. combat troops on Mideast soil. We've seen that narrative several times now. And, as Rand Paul consistently reminds us, it invariably ends in disaster.

If a collective strategy means working with distasteful Syrian strong man, Bashar al-Assad, so be it. If we've learned anything over the six years of Obama's Mideast non-strategy, it's that secular strongmen, however criminal, are sometimes the best antidote to anarchy - Islamic extremism thrives on anarchy - and, thus, the best regional partners we can currently hope for. Democracy is slowly coming to the Middle East in fits and starts, but not overnight. Be patient and realistic.

Stop Your Absurd and Embarrassing Denials of Global Warming, And Get Busy Implementing A Fossil-Free Energy Future For This Country.

Yes, that can include throwing a few bones to your campaign donors in nuclear and biofuels (Iowa's farmers will remember come caucus time). And, yes, Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, you can loosen some of those coal regulations, so your constituents feel you delivered on your dunderheaded campaign promise to bring back an industry that has as much relevance to our clean energy future as the telegraph does to 21st century telephony.

But, for the love of John Muir, get off this obsession with the Keystone XL Pipeline. This much-touted boondoggle will not add more than 35 full-time permanent jobs, according to the State Department's own analysis. Moreover, the environmental risks are too high against the backdrop of more promising energy alternatives. If you must, pass some legislation regarding the pipeline - to save face with your gullible constituents and oil industry backers - and then live with the inevitable Obama veto.

Get Busy Rebuilding the Infrastructure of This Nation, Including The Construction Of High-Speed Regional Rail Networks.

Republican Ike built the U.S. interstate system. You band of ideologues should at least be able to build high-speed rail. It's outrageous that in our most populous state, California - which, if it were a country, would have the 8th largest economy on the planet - we can't quickly, comfortably and safely train from LA to San Francisco in under three hours, LA to San Diego in under one hour, and downtown L.A. to the growing hubs of Ventura and San Bernardino in less than thirty minutes.

This is the perfect area for bipartisan compromise. You want to know why California bucked the national midterm trend? In part because a broad cross-section of Californians really like Governor Jerry Brown's courageous and vociferous backing of high-speed rail. Republicans, get behind the Governor and help make this thing a reality in the next six years. Then repeat the effort in the Midwest, where my hometown of Omaha -- corporate HQ of the Union Pacific railroad -- should be connected to major regional hubs like Minneapolis, Denver, and Chicago in less than four hours, and nearby hubs of Des Moines and Kansas City in under one hour. A regional network like that would cause economic growth to explode in the Heartland.

Dramatically Expand Marine, Wetland and Forest Protection, So Your Right-Wing Base of Fishermen and Hunters Will Actually Have Wildlife to Kill in the Future.

Remember that GOP President George Bush, Sr. passed the Clean Water Act. You don't need to take an adversarial stance on environmental issues in order to remain true to your free market principles. Pick areas where bipartisan consensus is possible. Remember ""conservative"" is drawn from ""conserve."" Be the party of conservation, and, thus, remain true to your conservative bona fides.

Over 100 years ago, Republican Teddy Roosevelt showed how environmental and workplace protection could be winning conservative issues. Follow his example, and win over huge swaths of independent voters, who could be yours in 2016 if you were not so stubbornly backward on sensible environmental protection.

That's my take. Let me know what you think in the Comments area below.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americas-lagging-female-p_b_6116754.html","America's Lagging Female Political Representation","America continues to lag most other democracies in terms of female representation. This distinction is not one to be proud of yet our nation has been behind the curve on female political representation for generations.

Currently there are 20 female senators, 16 Democrat and four Republican. In the House, there are 79 female Representatives, 60 Democrat and 19 Republican. The number of women in the Senate and the House comprise the highest numbers ever in either body yet these rates of female representation are remarkably lower than other democratic countries.

In 2012, the US ranked 28th out of 34 OECD countries in terms of the share of women parliamentarians, topping only Korea, Ireland, Turkey, Chile, Japan, and Hungary. Comparatively speaking, this is a drop from 2002 as France, Italy, Hungary and others all leapfrogged over the United States in female representation.

Moreover, the disparity between the parties is painfully telling. Female representation among Democratic national legislators, at 30.4 percent, is in the upper-third of the OECD's overall rankings. Contrarily, only 8.2 percent of the Republican national legislators are female. This ranks dead last compared to other OECD countries, a national embarrassment that needs to be addressed.

The lack of female legislators is also exhibited at the state legislative level. There, the percentage of female legislators rose from 8 percent in 1975 to 20.6 percent in 1995. In the 19 years since, the rate has only crawled up to 24.2 percent. The stagnation in progress needs to be addressed for America to catch up to other leading democracies. Approximately two-thirds of the female state legislators are Democrats, a less-extreme reiteration of the party imbalance seen at the national level.

Since being a state legislator is often a stepping stone to the national level, addressing the gender imbalance at the state level is critical to addressing it at the national level. In order to have more female state-level legislators, more women will need to express an interest in political careers as well as develop local-level experience such as community and school boards.

Two key differences emerge when comparing the US and democracies that are leading in female representation. The first is that many countries have implemented gender quotas, a mechanism that is unconstitutional in the US. The second is that countries using proportional representation systems often have higher female representation.

Making proportional representation the norm in state-level voting, as is done in many other leading countries, could address some of this gender imbalance issue. Voters would cast ballots for the party of choice meaning that gender biases would be restricted to what happens inside the party rolls themselves. Female candidates, who may have more challenges raising financial support, could rely more on party money. Of course, this presupposes that gender biases within political parties are less pronounced than the gender biases in the general public.

Proportional representation would also make room for third-party voices to be heard. It is likely that fewer voters would feel ""orphaned"" and that voter turnout would rise with rising confidence that their votes would have some impact.

Inertia is a powerful force. The two-party system in the US has muted the voices of many women and third-party. It is time America addressed these issues with proportional representation being one mechanism to chip away at our lagging democratic performance.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-open-letter-of-apology_b_6219340.html","An Open Letter of Apology to the United States of America","Dear America,

Hi there! My name is Brian Joyce. I'm a member of the media. Specifically, I'm a talk radio host. And as a member of the media, I owe you an apology.

In case you didn't notice -- and let's face it, the hope was that you wouldn't -- the long-awaited House Intelligence Report on Benghazi was released late Friday afternoon.

After two years of investigations, endless hours of hearings, and at least one concussion, the Republican-led Intelligence Committee has finally admitted what many of us knew all along: that the Obama administration did nothing wrong in Benghazi; that the White House, CIA and State Department did not deliberately mislead the American people on Benghazi; and that the Obama administration did everything it could to respond to Benghazi in a timely and appropriate manner.

Now, like many members of the media, I enjoy entertaining my audience with exciting topics and stimulating conversation. But unlike many members of the media, I will not resort to lies, myths and misinformation to do it. I will not accuse the President of doing things he never did, and I will not become so blinded with delusional, partisan hatred that I will say anything to get you to listen to my show.

And that's why I'd like to apologize to you, the people of the United States of America. It seems like I'm the exception to the norm.

For too long, too many of my colleagues have been spinning lies, myths and misinformation about Benghazi. We fixated on Benghazi. We obsessed with Benghazi. We wouldn't let Benghazi go. And it turns out we were wrong about almost everything concerning Benghazi.

We told you the President was covering up what happened in Benghazi. We told you the President didn't have a ""shred of integrity"" on Benghazi. We told you the President was providing ""cover"" for the terrorists who killed four Americans in Benghazi. We told you that the President could have helped the four Americans who were killed in Benghazi, but instead ordered the military to ""stand down."" Heck, we even told you the President's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, faked a concussion just to avoid testifying on Benghazi!

And after two years of trying our best to convince you that all these things were true, it turns out that we, the media, were the ones who were lying.

According to the House Intelligence Committee's report, there were no intelligence failures leading up to the attack; no stand-down order was ever given; intelligence on who carried out the attacks, and why, was muddled at best; and the White House did not deliberately mislead the American people on anything.

So the media was wrong, and the White House was right. Still, many of us in the media won't admit it. Therefore, I'd like to apologize to you.

Why does the media do this, and why are we too proud to admit it? Who knows. Maybe it's because some of us just aren't that bright. Maybe it's because some of us are so hooked on drugs that we can no longer distinguish fact from fiction. And maybe it's because some of us are so downright crazy, and come from such awful upbringings, that we're a danger to ourselves.

Regardless of what it is, I'd like to apologize. And I'd like to be able to tell you we'll never do it again, but that's not true. We're already doing it again.

We're telling you the President's executive orders on immigration are illegal and unconstitutional. We're telling you his executive orders on immigration are ""unprecedented."" We're telling you the President's ""thuggish, illegal"" immigration moves are nothing more than a cynical effort to back Republicans into a political corner. We're telling you these things despite the fact that we all know the President's executive orders on immigration are legal; they are constitutional; and they're not unprecedented. In fact, there have been 40 executive orders on immigration issued since 1956, spanning every presidency from Eisenhower's to Obama's.

But why tell you that, when it's so much easier to peddle in lies, myths, and misinformation?

By the way, did we tell you that the President is deliberately letting Ebola into America as retribution for slavery? Because he is, you know!

So again, on behalf of the media, please accept my apology. Some of us aren't that bright, some of us are crazy, and some of us are downright delusional. Still, that's no excuse for dumping our issues on you. We owe you more, and we should probably make a better effort to report on facts, rather than run with assumptions and half-truths. We should probably make a better effort to understand policy, before we attempt to comment on it. And we should probably also admit, once and for all, that the President was born in America. But don't hold your breath.

Therefore, please America, accept my apology on behalf of the media. Hopefully, sometime soon, we'll start to get things right on a more consistent basis. Hopefully we'll start to report on facts, rather than myths. Hopefully we won't get so hung up trying to prove the President is lying to you that we ourselves end up getting caught in a lie. Hopefully we'll do all those things.

In the meantime, did you hear about how President Obama canned Chuck Hagel because he's hell bent on weakening our once mighty American military? It's true, you know!

Just ask the media.","2014-11-25 14:03:05","1","23.0","1.0","0.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","127.0","87.0","0.0","170.0","0.0","55.0","17","910","50.80","92.18","18.92","37.43","15.69","20.11","86.15","58.24","16.81","10.44","2.09","4.95","2.86","0.44","0.11","6.37","6.70","14.84","10.33","6.48","5.49","2.64","17.36","3.85","2.64","1.65","1.10","2.42","6.15","3.41","2.75","0.33","1.32","0.11","14.18","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.44","13.19","1.98","2.42","1.65","2.75","2.64","2.86","1.32","0.77","0.44","0.00","0.55","0.22","0.33","0.00","0.00","13.52","5.82","1.43","5.60","0.99","0.66","4.51","9.45","1.87","10.88","1.21","6.04","3.63","4.18","0.22","0.55","0.33","0.11","0.22","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.66","5.49","6.59","0.11","0.77","0.44","0.44","0.88","1.10","4.84","0.00","0.00","4192","6.93","16.448275862068964","1331","906","57","63.8","11.2","8.3","10.73","9.5","144","6.571428571428571","14.717615894039737","351","15.14","14","0.55","0","33","7","80","0","119","55","5","3","10","81","82","5","52","1","0","102","10","52","1","0","9","32","0","46","44","25","15","50","17","1","7","0","7"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andrew-young-on-peace-jus_b_6305452.html","Andrew Young on Peace, Justice and a Few Other Issues","Andrew Young wants you not to worry. Despite humankind's failure to solve the problems of poverty, racism and inequality, and the smaller issues that cause us to despair, Young tells his listeners that a benevolent creator has everything under control. He offers this assurance in the biblical words of his grandmother .... ""Don't be anxious about tomorrow... Consider the lilies of the field; they toil not..."" and after a few more verses that roll easily off his tongue he adds with a beatific smile, ""You don't have to be a believer to know that sounds good.""

Young was in San Francisco recently, drumming up support for world peace, justice, compassion and his Andrew Young Foundation. In an informal - ""You don't mind if I just sit in this comfortable chair instead of standing at the podium?"" - talk at the Commonwealth Club, his remarks ranged from theories on how to make the world work to why prisons don't.

Just a few of those random thoughts include the following:

Re dealing with the bad and the angry: ""Don't get mad, get smart.""

Re getting smart - one of the first things Young did after being elected Mayor of Atlanta in 1981 was to increase the percentages of blacks and women in the police department, in order to insure that it reflected the population of the city. A story about how well that worked in one instance delighted his 2014 audience:

Anticipating two or three thousand people for a Ray Charles concert in Piedmont Park, the city sent a contingent of a dozen police officers to look after the crowd - but the crowd turned out to be over 100,000. ""Ray Charles said he wasn't going out there,"" Young recalled. ""He said, 'I'm blind, but I can see there's people pushing against the stage and I ain't going out there.' And we had a dozen police officers to handle 100,000 people."" Enter one of the police contingent, ""a tiny little woman named Sadie."" Sadie mounted the stage, blew her whistle, got the crowd's attention and told them they were going to play a game. ""You all know about Simon Says? Well, this is Sadie Says."" When she blew her whistle, she explained, everybody on the front row was to turn around and face the opposite direction. When she blew it again, everybody on the next row was to turn around... and so on. By the time Sadie finished blowing her whistle, the entire crowd was facing away from the stage. ""Now,"" she said, ""everybody take ten steps forward."" The crowd surge was ended, the concert went on as planned.

Re prisons: ""You go to prison for taking money from an ATM; you come out knowing how to take the ATM.""

Re global peace and prosperity: There are ""ways to make the world work,"" Young believes. Because food and jobs are two of the keys, his foundation is pushing programs to make protein from duckweed in the south. Small farmers could be back in business, the hungry could be fed.

Young is almost as enthusiastically pro-duckweed as he is anti-Halliburton. ""We don't need to be fighting ISIS,"" he says; ""that's Halliburton's war. You want to go after people for not paying taxes? Go after Halliburton."" And as to those wars, ""One of the things we should know by now is that there is no military solution.""

How can we find lasting solutions to issues like poverty and war? Young says, ""I don't know how to do it - but our kids will know how to do it. I was in a restaurant where a two-year-old had his iPad out and said, 'Mom! They don't have wi-fi here!' -- but a few minutes later he said, 'That's okay Mom, I fixed it.'"" Young urges audiences of all ages to work for peace and justice, acknowledging both the enormity of the tasks and the potential for success. And in the end, he says, ""We just have to believe we've done the best we could."" You don't have to be an Andrew Young believer to know that sounds good.

Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, host of the recent event, asked Young which of his titles he preferred: Mayor, Congressman, husband, father, CEO, Ambassador...? The reply came with another quick smile.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/animal-welfare-in-detroit_b_4783762.html","Animal Welfare in Detroit: A View From the Trenches","A minor media battle has been raging regarding the ""dog count"" in Detroit -- that is, determining exactly how many stray and feral dogs are roaming the city's streets.

To get that part of the issue out of the way, estimates range from 3,000 to 50,000. Although the higher figure is unlikely (it would represent 14 dogs per resident), even 3,000 would mean 750 dogs for each of Detroit's four animal control officers.

The bottom line: Roaming dogs, whatever their number, are just the tip of an iceberg of animal welfare concerns in Detroit (and other struggling former industrial cities) that also include stray and feral cats, improper care of owned animals, dogfighting and animals losing their homes to foreclosure and other economic disruptions.

The debate over the dog count obscures the large number of animal welfare organizations -- most nonprofit and staffed by volunteers -- working tirelessly to find a solution. These groups provide a wide range of critical services, from adoption to sheltering animals to fundraising for spay/neutering programs. Yet, while many of the groups work together, there is lack of cooperation with the city of Detroit.

The Global Urban Studies Program at Michigan State University recently conducted a survey of the 300-plus animal welfare organizations working in Detroit and found the size of the animal welfare problem is the most significant barrier to their success.

However, the groups also identify lack of foster homes (69 percent of respondents) as a more significant barrier than even sufficient funding to address the problem (60 percent). Another frequently mentioned barrier is the role of pet stores, puppy mills and home breeders (also identified as hoarders by respondents). The surplus of animals bred and sold by these operations and the tendency of potential pet owners to buy from them is seen as significantly contributing to the number of stray and unwanted animals.

More than 60 percent of respondents say their organization advocates for an end to gassing in shelters as a means of euthanasia, more strict regulations of pet stores and puppy mills, and for local ordinances that prohibit the outdoor tethering of animals.

Although the groups see animal abandonment as the most serious animal welfare problem in the community (85 percent), the need for humane education for youth is the next most serious concern (mentioned as very serious by 80 percent of respondents) -- even more of a concern than organized dogfighting (78 percent), outdoor tethering of dogs (71 percent) and animal abuse and neglect (70 percent).

The nonprofits are primarily organized and run by women and have been around, on average, for 20 years (although one organization was started to address the working conditions of cart horses in early Detroit.)

Just over half of the groups were created because individuals saw the plight of unwanted animals generally or for specific types: retired racing greyhounds, senior and special needs animals, and other breed-specific needs.

However, 34 percent of the groups were formed specifically in reaction to shelter practices, particularly euthanasia. The groups felt they could do a better and more humane job and serve as an additional resource to overcrowded and underfunded shelters. Funding is most likely to come from donations, grants, merchandise sales and promotional events, social media and out of the pockets of the group members or leaders.

What does the survey suggest, then, about solutions to animal welfare conditions in Detroit?

Educating children in the humane care of animals is critically important and will provide a long-term solution.

Animal welfare groups badly need additional volunteer support, particularly individuals willing to provide foster care for animals in their homes.

Because organized dogfighting is seen to be a central problem in animal welfare, greater attention to combat these activities is needed.

Heightening community awareness of animal overbreeding and its impact on the number of unwanted animals is needed to help residents think about adopting rather than purchasing their family pet.

Finally, a lack of resources -- for animal rescues, licensed shelters and local animal control -- is a critical barrier to more effectively and humanly addressing animal welfare in the city.

Ultimately, the humane treatment of Detroit's stray animals is a goal that goes far beyond a simple ""dog count.""","2014-02-13 15:38:41","1","19.0","1.0","0.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","106.0","93.0","0.0","160.0","0.0","54.0","17","702","96.93","68.07","2.70","12.54","28.08","32.48","75.07","41.03","3.42","1.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.14","2.28","8.40","16.24","4.42","3.85","7.26","0.00","9.54","7.55","3.99","0.43","3.13","4.99","3.99","1.42","2.42","0.14","0.71","0.43","6.84","0.14","0.00","0.14","0.00","10.40","2.28","1.57","2.85","1.71","0.85","2.14","0.85","0.57","0.14","0.14","0.14","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","9.54","2.56","2.28","3.28","1.00","1.85","2.71","6.98","0.43","7.83","0.43","5.27","2.14","6.13","0.14","1.85","1.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.24","3.42","4.99","0.28","0.00","0.14","0.00","2.14","0.57","0.43","3.13","0.14","3615","9.24","28.2","1177","695","25","34.8","16.8","15.3","14.34","17.9","186","12.0","23.825035971223027","341","25.04","1","0.39","0","32","21","64","1","99","63","6","1","4","129","20","0","83","0","0","3","7","30","4","5","0","21","0","18","9","19","21","15","22","5","1","0","1"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/are-political-lies-consti_b_5162824.html","Are Political Lies Constitutional?","Are political lies constitutionally-protected free speech? That's an intriguing question, and one that the Supreme Court is going to take up next week. What makes the question interesting is how a valid argument could be made either way, no matter what your personal politics. Both sides resent well-funded politicians who blanket the airwaves with what they see as the baldest of falsehoods, but on the other hand political free speech is an absolute bedrock of the American system of government. Where do you draw the line? Should a line even be drawn?

The case before the Supreme Court may not answer such fundamental questions. The justices could easily narrowly rule on technical aspects of the case and by doing so punt it back to a lower federal court. But the questions themselves are valid ones, and may eventually wind up before the high court in one case or another.

The case being heard came about because a third-party group wanted to rent some billboards in Ohio to target a sitting House member during a campaign. What the billboards would have stated was not, in fact, true. Ohio has a law on its books (as do at least 15 other states) which bans such false statements about candidates. Therefore the case wound up in court.

Those are the facts of the case, stripped of political details. The key question -- the one that the Supreme Court is likely to punt on, at least this time around -- is whether such state laws are valid, or whether the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech makes such laws unconstitutional.

Does the state have a right to vet campaign statements? At first glance, it would seem to be a welcome check on the flood of negative advertising that each and every election generates. If candidates (and political groups) were limited to only speaking the truth, it would certainly get rid of the worst of these ads. And it's hard to find anyone willing to take a stand for the position: ""More ads! Worse ads!"" Except maybe the campaign consultants who get rich from this process, that is.

But unpopular speech -- in particular, unpopular political speech -- was what the First Amendment was created to preserve. To be a First Amendment absolutist means defending the rights of Nazis (or the KKK, or Fred Phelps) to publicly state their beliefs, no matter how noxious. Political campaign speech seems to be at the heart of this concept, because it is not merely marching in the streets or protesting an event, it is advocating for who will represent the people in government. Advocating for political change, in other words, by the most direct method available: the ballot box. Seen in this light, even political lying has to be considered protected political speech.

Of course, the other side has a good argument as well, which can be boiled down to the famous Mark Twain quote: ""A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes."" If political candidates are forced to spend all their time and energy setting the record straight with the truth, they will have no time to get their own positive message out. This becomes acute when one side (or one candidate) can heavily outspend the other. The one with the bigger advertising budget can bury an opponent with lies, and even if some are successfully debunked for the public, some of them will stick. Is this really how we want our democracy to function?

But the real problem with state laws which forbid political lies boils down to: who decides? Even if you think such a law might improve the tenor of our politics, do you really want elected officials making the case-by-case decisions on what is true enough to be allowable versus what is factually so inaccurate that it cannot be shown to the public? Or maybe unelected officials? Because to enforce such a law, that is precisely what would be needed -- an Office of Political Truth of some sort. And it's pretty easy to project a negative outcome of such powers. For instance, what would happen if a majority of such a board of decision-makers were from the opposing party? How fair would they actually be? Elections could quickly devolve into nothing more than a series of protracted legal battles before such a commission, with each side filing complaints by the dozen. Is that really how electioneering should be regulated?

The idea of allowing nothing but truth into politics is a noble one. The problem is, it's not a very practical one (even ignoring the constitutionality issue for a moment). It would require some sort of election referee on the sidelines, calling fouls and being a gatekeeper for what is allowable play on the field of politics. There's a legal term for this, however: ""prior restraint."" This means giving the government the power to -- in advance -- decide what people can and cannot say. To use an extreme example, it would be like having newspapers submit all their editorials to the government for pre-approval before publication -- which is a chilling concept to even contemplate. Now, as I said, this is an extreme example, because certain types of ads obviously do require some sort of government intervention. An ad which actively called for one candidate to be assassinated would, quite obviously, be illegal (because of the threat of violence, which is a separate crime). But should this be extended to making lies about policies illegal as well?

Ugly politics is not new to America, no matter what you hear from pundits with absolutely no knowledge of our history. Lies are not new in the political arena. Even vicious lies. They've been around since our very beginnings as a nation, in fact. But the traditional way of combating offensive political speech is with more political speech. If neo-Nazis or the KKK want to hold a public rally, then organize a counter-rally and shout them down! If a political ad appears which lies about a candidate, then expose the lie and do your best to discredit both the other candidate and whoever put up the first ad. There are two main ways of doing so, in fact. The first is to attack the opponent as a big fat liar: ""If he lies to you about this, then how can you trust him to represent you?"" The second (often very effective in local races) is to paint the ad as coming from ""outside influences"" or ""outsider money"" that doesn't represent your state and your people: ""Money from outside our great state is pouring in to tell lies. My opponent is fine with people from outside our borders running his campaign -- which tells you what is most important to him. I will represent the good people of this state rather than being beholden to all these outside special interests."" Some combination of these basic themes is the traditional response, because they are very effective at reframing the entire debate and causing a backlash against ads which do contain obvious lies. Additionally, in the past decade or so, newspapers and other media sources have begun to take it upon themselves to ""truth squad"" statements being made by politicians or political ads -- which helps referee the fray to at least some extent.

Of course, this still leaves the problem of unequal campaign finances. When one side can outspend the other, then one side's message gets out to the people and one side's doesn't get heard. That is indeed a problem, but it is a much bigger problem than policing ad copy. No matter how fair ads could be made by an Office of Political Truth, the monetary disparity would remain. Perhaps this would lead to a slightly-politer avalanche of ads from one candidate, but the opponent would still wind up buried nonetheless.

Free speech is a fundamental issue. The case before the Supreme Court does not fall easily on partisan lines, believe it or not. The group which wanted to put the billboards up is the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. The billboard they wanted to put up would have accused a sitting Democrat of supporting taxpayer-funded abortion, because he had supported the Obamacare law. This is inaccurate, factually. Which the Obama White House does indeed argue. But the Obama administration also supports the Susan B. Anthony List's legal argument: that political free speech should allow even billboards which lie about Obamacare. Ohio's attorney general (a Republican) had his office file a brief in the case defending the state law's position, but he also filed another brief, stating his personal beliefs that the law ""may chill constitutionally protected political speech."" Partisans from both sides of the aisle can be conflicted over the details of the case, while still expressing a clear signal on the larger implications of constitutionality, in other words.

As I said, it is a noble goal to attempt to legislate that ""nothing but the truth"" be allowed into political discourse during an election. But it is also an impossible goal -- a Utopian vision which the United States Constitution simply does not allow. The very concept of government policing political speech in such a fashion -- attempting to be a gatekeeper for the truth -- would quickly devolve into either complete toothlessness (see: the F.E.C., for example) or it would just as speedily descend into the horrors of ugly partisanship (""our side never lies, and our opponents always lie"") if the membership of the gatekeepers became another political tug-of-war. Imagine one politician having free rein to say whatever she wished, while an opponent had nine out of ten ads rejected (costing valuable time and money during campaign season).

The Supreme Court is not likely to make a basic ruling on this case. They will likely quibble over legal ""standing"" to bring the case, and will likely punt it back to a lower court in one fashion or another. This will avoid the question, and postpone a real decision. But whenever they do get around to ruling on state laws which mandate truth in political advertising, they should clearly see that while the intent of such laws may indeed be good and pure, the Constitution simply doesn't allow such purity in our political discourse. Popular political speech needs no protection from the First Amendment -- it never has. It is unpopular political speech -- even downright lies -- which need defending by the courts. As ignoble and as impure as that may sound.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bahrainis-take-to-the-str_b_4762308.html","Bahrainis Take to the Streets on 3rd Anniversary of Uprising, as John Timoney and U.S. Government Continue Their Role in Violent Crackdown","Bahrainis are taking to the streets this week for protests that coincide with the three-year anniversary of a popular revolution sparked by the so-called Arab Spring of 2011. Unfortunately, it is less a celebration than an ongoing struggle to resist the oppressive regime of King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, whose family has ruled the small Persian Gulf Island of one million people for more than 200 years.

Protests began on February 14, 2011, with Bahrainis calling for economic and political reforms, but they were repeatedly attacked by police. Over the next six weeks, the monarchy continued its violent crackdown on dissidents, declaring martial law in March 2011. The Bahraini government also brought in troops from neighboring Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help suppress the pro-democracy uprisings. During this period, 35 people were killed, hundreds more were injured, and thousands were jailed, some of whom reported being tortured while in detention.

The violence and political repression was so stark, King Hamad was forced to address the outcry. But instead of doing anything meaningful, the al-Khalifa regime commissioned an ineffective investigation and hired John Timoney, who is notorious in the U.S. for brutalizing protesters and whitewashing the abuse. In 1998, after nearly 30 years with the NYPD and his role in the Tompkins Square Park riots, Timoney became Philadelphia Police Commissioner, honing his repressive tactics on protesters at the Republican National Convention in 2000. Timoney then became Miami Police Chief in 2003, overseeing security for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) summit, and carrying out one of the most brutal responses to political protest in recent memory.

Timoney, who is now a senior director at the security firm Andrews International, was hired by the Bahraini Ministry of the Interior in late 2011 to help deal with the popular, mainly Shiite, uprisings which had become a considerable annoyance to the King and the ruling Sunni minority. Now that Timoney's two-year contract is up, many are asking what was accomplished and where do we go from here.

What has Timoney accomplished?

Not much, ""beyond a healthy bank balance,"" said human rights researcher John Horne, noting Timoney's speculated annual salary of $300,000, plus benefits. Horne, with the group Bahrain Watch, told PolicyMic that, ""After two years, torturers still torture, police still use excessive force, citizens still suffer collective punishment from tear gas, and the security forces still act with impunity."" The Bahrain Watch website also indicates that extrajudicial killings have continued, most recently against Fadhel Abbas, 19, who was shot in the head by police during a protest on January 8th. Less than a year after Timoney began his consulting contract, in November 2012, CNN reported that more than 100 civilians had been killed by police, about twice as many as when he arrived in Bahrain.

Maryam al-Khawaja, acting president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR), told MintPress News last month that they are still documenting ""systematic torture, enforced disappearances, house raids by masked men in civilian clothes,"" and attacks on all forms of protest. Al-Khawaja is currently in exile from Bahrain with much of her family in forced detention. Maryam's uncle and sister are currently serving sentences for spurious crimes, and her father, Abdelhadi al-Khawaja, the co-founder of BCHR and one of the most prominent human rights activists in Bahrain has been imprisoned since 2011.

Last week, King Hamad ratified a new anti-protest law that allows the monarchy to impose a 7-year prison term and fine of up to $26,500 for anyone who publicly insults him, with the option to apply ""aggravating circumstances"" if the insult occurs ""in the presence of the King."" By stifling the most basic forms of political expression, the al-Khalifa regime appears poised to escalate the crackdown on dissidents, with unbridled support from Timoney and the Bahrain police force.

According to a report released last month by the Liberties and Human Rights Department of al-Wefaq, the political opposition to the al-Khalifa regime, there were 745 protests, 183 arrests, 207 home raids, and 17 cases of torture just in the month of December alone. Sayed Hadi al-Musawi, who heads the human rights group, said that more than half of the protests were ""repressed by Bahrain security forces, causing injuries to protesters and suffocation among inhabitants inside homes as a collective punishment.""

One of the most pressing problems in the country is the use of tear gas, a favorite weapon of Timoney's, which he employed extensively in Miami against FTAA protesters. Since 2011, at least 39 deaths have been linked to the use of tear gas, according to Physicians for Human Rights. A number of Bahrainis have died from excessive gas inhalation, in some cases after police have shot canisters directly into people's homes. But, police have also used tear gas canisters as a lethal weapons. Bahrain Watch reports that 14-year-old Ali Jawad al-Shaikh and 15-year-old Sayed Hashim Saeed were both killed after gas canisters were shot directly at their upper bodies at close range.

In fact, injury and death caused by tear gas has been such a problem that Bahrain Watch and others launched a campaign last fall to stop 1.6 million rounds of tear gas from coming into the country by putting pressure on manufacturers and export licensing authorities. Bahrain Watch reported last month that the ""Stop the Shipment"" campaign succeeded in averting tear gas exports from a supplier in South Korea, but that the al-Khalifa regime is still determined to increase its stocks.

What do Wikileaks, the U.S. State Department, and John Timoney have in common?

At a press briefing in November 2012, nearly a full year after Timoney was hired, the U.S. State Department tried to distance itself from the former police chief and the role he was playing in Bahrain. Then-State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland was evasive when questioned about Timoney and tried to downplay the U.S. government's political and strategic interests in the country that hosts the Navy's Fifth Fleet, the primary U.S. naval base in the Middle East.

So our understanding is that last year, the Bahraini Government invited former police official John Timoney to assist them in the Ministry of Interior with their police reform efforts. This is a Bahraini Government initiative. [Timoney] is not working for or on behalf of the U.S. Government.

When asked about Timoney's effectiveness in Bahrain, Nulan said she couldn't speak to what he's involved with inside the Ministry of Interior, and ""can't speak to what he has or hasn't been doing, because he doesn't work for us."" It seems, however, based on an internal State Department email from July 2011 posted to the Wikileaks website late last year, the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain was well aware of, and intimately involved in, the hiring process that landed Timoney his job. Not only were all of the résumés being channeled through the embassy, but diplomatic staff was also privy to discussions between Bahrain's Ministry of Interior and potential candidates. Speaking candidly, Regional Security Officer (RSO) Mark Sullo wrote in his email to fellow diplomatic staff that the position ""has the interest and support of senior [U.S. government] policy makers given the strategic importance of our relationship with [the Bahraini government] and recent events here."" Laying out the geopolitical significance of Timoney's role in Bahrain, Sullo says:

It is seen as a prime engagement opportunity with a non-NATO major ally, hence my current involvement as RSO.

Opportunities for the U.S. to take decisive action

Regardless of the extent of U.S. involvement in hiring Timoney, its interests are undeniable. While the U.S. government has tepidly condemned the al-Khalifa regime's violence against Bahrainis and suspended shipments of tear gas to the Gulf Island state, it continues to sell arms to the monarchy and refuses to impose sanctions against al-Khalifa officials for human rights violations. According to PressTV, the U.S. has sold more than $1.4 billion in weapons to the Bahrain government since 2000, and has recently launched a nearly $600 million construction project to improve its U.S. naval base.

Just over a year ago, Zainab al-Khawaja, who is currently in jail for tearing up a photograph of King Hamad, wrote an op-ed piece for the New York Times, calling on the Obama Administration to take decisive action in Bahrain:

If the United States is serious about protecting human rights in the Arab world, it should halt all arms sales to Bahrain, bring Bahrain's abuses to the attention of the United Nations Security Council, support a special session on Bahrain at the United Nations Human Rights Council, and begin a conversation about potential diplomatic and economic sanctions. The Obama administration should also demand that high-level Bahraini officials be held accountable for human rights abuses, and that nongovernmental organizations, United Nations human rights investigators and journalists be allowed to enter the country and investigate abuses.

Zainab's sister, Maryam, told MintPress News that foreign governments like the U.S. are ignoring events in Bahrain because it's ""an inconvenient revolution, due to geopolitical and economic interest the West has with the Gulf Cooperation Council monarchies."" Zainab called for ""trust-building steps"" to be taken, like releasing all political prisoners, including imprisoned opposition leaders, and ""ending the daily crackdown.""

On this third anniversary of the uprising, Bahrainis are protesting to send a message to King Hamad, of course, but also to challenge countries like the U.S. and the U.K. who have so far refused to end their support for the oppressive al-Khalifa regime. Sending John Timoney to quell the country's popular resistance has unsurprisingly exacerbated the situation and certainly hasn't engendered solidarity with the Bahraini people or diminished the regime's human rights abuses.

Neither John Timoney nor his employer Andrews International responded to requests for comment.","2014-02-13 13:04:12","0","27.0","9.0","0.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","147.0","87.0","0.0","175.0","0.0","55.0","17","1647","97.12","70.15","18.70","12.18","31.08","28.72","73.95","40.38","4.92","1.70","0.06","0.24","0.06","0.97","0.36","3.22","8.62","15.66","4.98","2.55","5.10","0.61","8.99","4.37","2.55","1.21","3.16","1.64","5.40","2.19","3.22","0.30","2.25","0.12","7.59","0.36","0.18","0.30","1.46","6.44","0.91","1.70","0.49","1.46","0.55","1.94","1.28","0.55","0.49","0.12","0.79","0.67","0.24","0.00","0.06","9.96","1.21","1.52","6.44","0.61","0.85","3.70","5.16","0.30","14.21","1.03","6.98","6.07","5.71","0.36","0.49","0.91","0.36","0.49","0.24","0.00","0.18","0.06","0.06","0.00","17.67","4.98","6.80","0.12","0.00","0.12","0.00","1.88","1.46","1.34","0.36","0.61","8324","8.46","32.42307692307692","2574","1613","68","47.42","14.6","12.5","14.16","15.7","373","12.5","20.729845009299442","720","28.73","42","0.4","0","56","49","153","0","223","129","4","2","3","242","273","4","111","1","0","20","18","59","2","4","4","46","0","37","63","42","51","22","42","7","13","1","4"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ban-the-box-whats-next-ba_b_5508616.html","Ban the Box: What's Next? Ban the Job Application?","As an employer and small business owner, my first reaction to Ban the Box legislation is ""no way.""

For those of you unfamiliar with Ban the Box, it's a campaign by many civil rights groups and social advocates to remove from the job application, the ""check box"" that asks if applicants have ever been convicted of a crime or felony. The purpose of the campaign, already effective in over a dozen states as well as hundreds of municipalities, is to make it easier for ex-offenders to find a job.

It's no surprise that many business associations oppose the legislation, believing it will expose the business to theft and its customers and employees to possible harm.

But during a recent table discussion at a conference, I began to see Ban the Box as just the tip of the iceberg about what's wrong with the traditional job application.

By the way, Ban the Box legislation does not require an employer to hire any candidate with a criminal background. Employers may still conduct background checks. Ban the Box simply pushes the question later in the hiring process, just like drug screening, background checks, and medical examinations.

With the war for talent building momentum and the job skill gap widening, more and more employers are struggling to find workers with the right skills they need. The argument that Ban the Box proponents make is that qualified and skilled workers who just happen to have been convicted of a non-violent crime or one committed decades ago might be unfairly and unnecessarily excluded from consideration.

I'm not here to argue for or against this particular legislation other than to say, the argument raises a very valid point. In order to identify applicants who have the right skills, experience, abilities and knowledge what does an employer need to know up front? Shouldn't an employer be making a hire or no-hire decision based on job-relevant information alone?

Job relevance is the heart and soul of equal opportunity and fairness. It is what puts employers on the right and wrong side of employment laws like Equal Employment Opportunity and American Disabilities Acts. These laws already prohibit employers from asking questions about race, ethnicity, age, gender, religion and medical conditions among other things on job applications. Requesting applicants to attach or upload a photo was banned years ago.

So I've been thinking. What else do employers ask that bias recruiters, HR professionals, and managers right off the bat?

Let's start at the very top -- the first name. Names like Jerry, Sam, Ashley, Jordan, Tracy and Kim are unisex names. But names like George, Robert, Nathan and Melvin or Susan, Mary, Emily and Elizabeth likely give away gender fairly easily. Whether intentional or not, even asking the first name on a job application could screen out a qualified applicant from the search by a biased manager. That's not only unfair to the candidate but bad practice for the business if they turn away talent they need.

But gender isn't the only thing that the first name gives away. What about names like Lakisha, Jamal, Abdul and Wei? Not only can they reveal gender but race, ethnicity, and even religion too.

And don't get me started on what last names might reveal! The bottom line is that efforts to search far, deep, and wide for high potential candidates are sabotaged early and often. Employers shoot themselves in the foot at the very instant they ask for first name and last name. They bias what is supposed to be an objective and strategic process with almost reckless abandon.

I think you are getting my drift. Here is my final example: Consider how biased an applicant's home or mailing address might be. A city or street address can reveal race, ethnicity and economic status -- off-limits for most job applications and irrelevant for skill requirements.

While Ban the Box at first seemed to me like just more social activist and civil liberties intrusion into my life as a business owner, the discussion opened my eyes to an even bigger hurdle standing in the way of improving employee screening and selection. In order to put the best candidates at the front of the line, the job application needs a fresh look.

For sure, employers need to collect basic information like name, address and contact information. But like the question about convictions, the question isn't if it can be asked but when.

So here's a crazy thought but one that might improve the odds of finding that needle-in-a-stack skilled worker and keep employers out of hot water.

Ban-The-Name and Ban-The Address, too. The job application can include an email or phone number to contact the candidate. An automated tracking system can assign a candidate ID and hide the name and address or an independent employee can mask the information from recruiters and managers. The recruiter or manager can see only job relevant information such as experience, education, licenses and certifications, and accomplishments. Applicants can respond to questions about availability, ambitions, and attributes that make a good fit for the job. They can even complete a pre-employment test to provide information about job fit, attitude, technical skills, and cognitive abilities (if relevant). And all this can be accomplished without knowing the name, address, and criminal background.

Ban-the-Box, Ban-the-Name, Ban-the-Address -- that's the way a fair, valid and job relevant screening process is supposed to work. It's not perfect and it won't work for everyone. But it's also an innovative approach to help employers identify highly skilled and qualified workers who are currently sifted out of consideration for the wrong reasons. Ban the Box and other initiatives aren't just about protecting workers with criminal backgrounds. It is more than a discussion about civil liberties. It presents a viable solution for employers seeking ways to find more qualified workers to fill open jobs in their companies.","2014-06-19 10:36:36","1","21.0","1.0","0.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","116.0","88.0","0.0","166.0","0.0","55.0","17","993","86.85","47.99","31.61","27.45","19.10","24.67","84.39","46.93","6.85","2.42","1.21","0.10","0.20","0.00","0.91","4.43","9.97","12.89","6.45","4.33","8.46","1.61","10.57","4.73","3.22","1.31","1.01","1.31","3.32","1.71","1.61","0.10","0.60","0.20","6.45","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","12.19","3.63","1.51","1.11","3.73","0.70","4.43","1.61","1.11","0.20","0.10","0.81","0.30","0.40","0.00","0.10","10.47","0.70","4.13","5.54","0.81","0.60","1.41","8.96","0.81","9.97","0.70","5.84","3.22","10.47","0.00","0.81","0.70","0.30","0.10","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.00","15.81","4.73","5.64","0.10","0.00","0.40","0.10","2.42","0.40","1.81","0.20","0.00","4804","7.99","19.442307692307693","1506","975","52","60.85","13.0","9.4","12.42","12.1","211","13.5","18.17641025641026","449","18.1","7","0.45","0","67","2","108","0","105","89","4","2","17","189","53","0","74","1","0","28","7","54","3","0","4","29","0","57","10","16","20","30","26","4","10","0","2"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brinksmanship-and-the-ret_b_6317308.html","Brinksmanship and the Return of Financial Crisis","A government shutdown once again loomed, and familiar deadlines and ultimatums flew around Washington. And Congress just used the threat to loosen the rules created in the wake of the financial crisis, a victory for Wall Street banks in their constant and well-funded campaign against reform.

The rules they have targeted are designed to reduce the risk of another financial meltdown, like the one that drove us into the Great Recession and could have been much worse. Though the repeal has been styled by some as a technical amendment, nothing could be farther from the truth.

Think about the best way to decide legislative policy in the devilishly complex and risk-laden area of derivatives. These are the financial contracts that brought down AIG, the event that triggered the crisis. You might imagine careful deliberation and debate, leading to a thoughtful vote in Congress in which elected representatives must stand up and be counted so that they could be held responsible for a difficult decision.

Of course, that is not how the House of Representatives works, especially not the current lame duck version. A 1,600 page Omnibus Spending Bill appeared Tuesday night and passed the House late on Thursday night. We have become familiar with these spending bills that have replaced reasoned budgeting and serially risk shutdowns just so the administration can be bullied every few months.

This time around, House sponsors attached a provision amending the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. They did this in the dead of night and at the last minute. Lobbyists, who are paid to make certain that the banks can continue to do as much risky business as possible despite the new regulatory regime, pushed to have a provision repealing the ""swaps push-out"" section of Dodd-Frank slipped into the spending bill so that any resistance to the repeal would risk another shutdown. Citigroup lobbyists wrote 70 out of 85 lines of the original bill.

That's Washington style representative democracy for you.

The swaps push-out provision requires banks to transact their swaps business in separate subsidiaries. The concept is that any bank swaps business should be done outside the bank itself, which is backed by FDIC deposit insurance and the many supports provided by the Federal Reserve.

Swaps are complex derivatives contracts requiring payments in the future that change as markets prices for stocks, bonds, oil and many other traded assets change. Thus, they create large and volatile financial obligations going back and forth between a bank and its contract ""counterparty,"" either a company (like AIG), a government or another bank.

Counterparties to the banks who rely on the banks' performance of its obligations can rely on these federal supports and can assume that the government will step in if a problem occurs. This can embroil the government in any bank default making a bailout more likely, good news for bank creditors like the swap counterparties. To avoid this, the swaps push-out requires a separate corporation, not entitled to the federal supports, to create a firewall, insulating taxpayers from the riskiest trading.

Though swaps were regulated in Dodd-Frank, there were plenty of loopholes, so a great deal of that business will go forward just as before. The swaps push-out section now under threat was already watered down in the original Dodd-Frank deliberations. Nonetheless, it still provides important protection. With swaps push-out, there's some possibility that the federal government wouldn't be dragged into a bank default because of the bank safety net.

But members of Congress, urged on by big money from Wall Street, decided that this sensible buffer between casino-like derivatives trading and the American taxpayer was such a bad idea that it had to be discarded through surreptitious and disguised means.

The banks have been out to kill the swaps push-out from the beginning. That makes sense for them since the capital needed to back a subsidiary would cost them more than their basic capital. Banks can raise general capital cheaply since investors have learned that failure is not a concern for banks that are too-big-to-fail. Capital funding for a subsidiary that is separated from this safety net is more costly because a bail out is less likely.

The banks also got some of their customers who often enter into swaps with the banks to urge repeal. The customers complained that their swaps would cost more. Of course they would, since the bank subsidiary's capital backing the swaps would cost more. But the customers, as contract counterparties, have been relying on the too-big-to-fail safety net. Like investors in the banks, these customers simply should not benefit from a pipeline to the American taxpayers. Any additional cost is an element of elimination of that benefit, nothing more.

In Washington, banks have been allowed to set the terms of the regulatory debate. The financial crisis provides many lessons, but one of its central was that allowing banks free reign leads to disastrous results for all Americans. Six years after the onset of the financial crisis, it's too soon to forgot that lesson and revive too-big-to-fail.","2014-12-15 11:03:11","1","18.0","2.0","0.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","111.0","87.0","0.0","164.0","0.0","55.0","17","860","92.95","50.47","17.81","31.73","21.50","25.93","81.74","48.37","7.67","1.86","0.00","0.23","0.23","0.00","1.40","5.81","10.35","15.12","8.02","3.95","4.77","0.93","11.98","4.77","2.91","0.70","0.93","3.37","5.23","2.79","2.44","1.05","0.35","0.58","3.02","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.93","1.86","2.67","1.74","1.98","0.93","2.44","0.47","0.12","0.00","0.12","0.12","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.72","0.35","1.40","4.77","0.93","3.14","3.60","6.74","0.70","12.91","2.44","7.09","3.84","9.53","0.12","0.35","8.14","0.12","0.23","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.00","12.91","4.65","4.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.56","0.47","0.70","0.23","0.00","4234","8.03","21.625","1255","837","40","58.72","12.7","10.3","13.0","13.6","178","8.2","18.86657108721625","410","19.62","5","0.45","0","25","6","113","0","110","70","4","1","20","139","38","3","72","0","0","15","8","35","4","0","11","24","0","41","26","10","28","25","20","12","3","0","1"

But the mailer, as BuzzFeed first reported Friday, is actually a letter from the Washington, D.C.-based anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony List warning voters about Democratic Senate nominee Bruce Braley, who supports abortion rights.

“ALERT -- CHILDREN IN YOUR AREA ARE VULNERABLE TO A PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT THAT CONTINUES UNCONTROLLED,” reads the outside of the envelope. Inside, the letter opens by arguing that Braley's views represent ""potentially life-threatening public health dangers."" To justify the claim, the group cites Braley's vote last year against a bill that would have outlawed abortion at 20 weeks after conception, challenging the viability limit established by the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.

The group defended the letter in an email to BuzzFeed, writing that “abortion is a very serious public health risk both for the child whose life is ended and the mother who may suffer health complications"" and that ""voters deserve to know where their candidates stand on this life and death issue.”

In contrast to Braley, his Republican opponent, Iowa state Sen. Joni Ernst, has endorsed a federal bill that would grant full legal rights to fetuses from the moment of fertilization. Medical experts say such legislation would ban all abortions as well as commonly-used forms of birth control.

Braley's campaign, unsurprisingly, took issue with the group's mailer in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post Friday.

""This is a despicable and desperate attempt by state Sen. Joni Ernst's allies to hide her dangerous record on women's health care through the use of crass fear mongering,"" Braley campaign manager, Sarah Benzing, said. ""The real health threat is Ernst's extreme proposals to ban common forms of birth control, criminalize abortions even in the case of rape or incest, and take a woman's personal health care decisions out of her own hands.""

Beyond the Susan B. Anthony List's efforts in Iowa, its super PAC, the Women Speak Out PAC, has committed millions of dollars to Senate races in North Carolina, Arkansas and Louisiana.

Alaska becomes the fourth state in the U.S. to legalize retail marijuana, along with Oregon, Colorado and Washington state. Voters approved Measure 2, which legalizes the possession, use and sale of recreational marijuana. Adults, age 21 and older, may possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants (with no more than three being mature) for personal use. The measure also legalizes the manufacture, sale and possession of marijuana paraphernalia, such as devices used for smoking or storing the plant. “The folks trying to keep marijuana illegal are relying on the same scare tactics today that they have relied on for decades, but voters just aren’t falling for it anymore,"" Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement early Wednesday morning.

Chris Christie says Republican victories in governor's races across the country show voters want leaders who will ""get things done,"" rather that fighting over ideology. Christie, chairman of the Republican Governors Association and a possible 2016 candidate for president, said he was gratified by GOP wins in Democratic-leaning states such as Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois, as well as victories in key swing states like Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio. Christie said voters ""elect and re-elect governors to get things done."" Christie, who campaigned for GOP candidates across the country, said the winners deserve the credit, not him. He said elections are ""always about the candidate."" Christie spoke Wednesday on NBC's ""Today"" show, ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and Fox News Channel.

11/05/2014 6:57 AM EST Indictment, Dog Killing, Infidelity Overcome By GOP Candidates How bad was it for Democrats? Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican facing a 20-count indictment won in New York and another known for outbursts of rage and killing a beagle, Mike Bost, won a seat in President Barack Obama's home state of Illinois that had been Democratic for 70 years. Down in Tennessee, Rep. Scott DesJarlais' past infidelities and pushing of abortion on a mistress continued to not matter to voters, who handed him a landslide victory. There were a couple of bright spots for Democrats, or at least the more moderate crowd. Florida Rep. Steve Southerland lost to Democrat Gwen Graham after holding an all-male fundraiser and joking about Graham in lingerie. And in Louisiana, GOP Rep.

11/05/2014 5:07 AM EST Alaska Becomes 4th State To Legalize Recreational Marijuana In yet another major pushback against the war on drugs, Alaska legalized recreational marijuana on Tuesday, joining Oregon and Washington, D.C. -- both of which legalized cannabis only hours before. Alaska becomes the fourth state in the U.S. to legalize retail marijuana, along with Oregon, Colorado and Washington state. Voters approved Measure 2, which legalizes the possession, use and sale of recreational marijuana. Adults, age 21 and older, may possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants (with no more than three being mature) for personal use. The measure also legalizes the manufacture, sale and possession of marijuana paraphernalia, such as devices used for smoking or storing the plant. “The folks trying to keep marijuana illegal are relying on the same scare tactics today that they have relied on for decades, but voters just aren’t falling for it anymore,"" Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement early Wednesday morning. ""The results are particularly encouraging since voter turnout during a midterm election is typically smaller, older, and more conservative. Clearly, support for ending marijuana prohibition spans the political and ideological spectrums."" Read more here. -- Matt Ferner

Tonight is a big victory for We the People! Credit is due to the victorious candidates. Your message to President Obama is undeniably received, though he'll try to ignore it. ... The Democrats got mauled today, deservedly so. To prohibit that from happening to the GOP in 2016, it must learn the lesson from the last time Republicans held the Senate majority. This time they must not retreat, and it's our responsibility to hold them accountable. Will they fight for reform that aligns with the limited government planks of the Republican platform, or will they return to the big government cronyism and status quo favored by the permanent political class? Will they drain the swamp or decide the D.C. cesspool is really just a jacuzzi they can't wait to jump on into and shake us off?

"http://montrealgazette.com/technology/science/the-right-chemistry-stephanie-kwolek-was-as-tough-as-kevlar-the-material-she-invented","The Right Chemistry: Stephanie Kwolek was as tough as Kevlar, the material she invented","Stephanie Kwolek may have been short in height, but when it came to making a contribution to science, she was a giant. The former DuPont chemist who recently passed away was responsible for the introduction of the super-strong material Kevlar. Not only did Kevlar prove to be an excellent replacement for steel in steel-belted tires, it ended up saving numerous lives with its use in body armour and military helmets.

Fibres made of Kevlar, chemically known as a “polyaramid,” can be woven into fabrics that are stronger and lighter than steel. A jacket made of seven layers weighs only two and a half pounds but can deflect a knife blade and stop a .38 calibre bullet from 10 feet. Sails, skis, hockey sticks, canoes, airplane and spacecraft parts, armoured limousines, bomb-resistant building materials, motorcycle safety clothing, cut-resistant gloves, suspension bridge cables, optical fibres and brake pads have all benefited from the discovery made by Kwolek back in 1965.

Kwolek had been bent on going to medical school, but, after studying chemistry in college, needed to earn some money for tuition. She applied for a job at DuPont and was interviewed by William Hale Charch, one of the company’s star scientists for having developed a process to make cellophane waterproof.

Charch told Kwolek that she would hear about her application in a few weeks, whereupon she retorted that she had other offers. Charch liked her gumption and offered her a position right then and there. At the time she joined DuPont, the company was already famous for its prime product, nylon, invented in the 1930s by Wallace Carothers. Kwolek followed in Carothers’s footsteps and in 1959 co-authored a paper on a simple production of nylon that could be carried out in a classroom. That demo has become famous as “The Nylon Rope Trick” and is performed by chemistry instructors around the world to illustrate the formation of a polymer, or giant molecule, from individual components. It amounts to pouring solutions of the required monomers into a beaker and drawing out the nylon fibre that forms at the interface of the immiscible solutions. A magical demo indeed!

With an energy crisis looming in the 1960s, DuPont launched a project to find a synthetic polymer to replace steel in tires, with the goal of making them lighter, to improve mileage. Kwolek was put in charge of this research and synthesized a number of polymers based on knowledge gained from the manufacture of nylon, which itself was not strong enough for use in tires. Kwolek tried a number of reactions based on the nylon model, varying the molecular structure of the two starting materials. Whenever she made a new polymer, she produced fibres for strength testing by melting it and having the liquid pumped through a shower-head-like device known as a “spinneret.”

One day, a new material she produced by linking together para-phenylenediamine and terephthaloyl chloride would not melt, so Kwolek decided to try to dissolve it in a solvent. After trying a variety of solvents, she managed to dissolve her new material in hexamethylphosphoramide, later replaced by the safer n-methyl-pyrrolidone. The solution looked cloudy and the technician in charge of the spinneret refused to try it, saying he was worried it would plug up the holes. Kwolek insisted, and the rest, as they say is history. Not only did the new fibre prove its value in tires, it found a new application when a police officer tried to shoot out the tires of a fleeing vehicle. The bullets did not penetrate and the idea for body armour was born.

There was one application where Kevlar did not meet with success. It was a key component of the Montreal Olympic Stadium’s retractable roof, which never worked as planned and was eventually replaced. New applications, though, keep turning up. Nike launched a series of basketball shoes with Kevlar parts and laces. The shoes supposedly provide more consistent “lockdown through the midfoot,” whatever that may mean, and are equipped with Kevlar laces which stretch far less than conventional laces, for better support. That may be somewhat of a marketing stretch, but what is a fact is that by the time Stephanie Kwolek passed away at the age of 90, her landmark invention is estimated to have saved the lives of 3,000 police officers. The day she died, DuPont announced that the one-millionth bulletproof vest made with Kevlar technology had been sold.

"http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/arts/though-this-be-madness-there-is-music-in-it","Though this be madness, there is music in it","After the opening night performance of The Tiger Lilies Perform Hamlet at Place des Arts on Wednesday night, fans lined up for autographs from members the three-man band following purchase of one of their CDs.

Yes, the band.

Hamlet (Caspar Phillipson) was nowhere in sight. This macabre musical version of Shakespeare’s play is not all about him.

Phillipson, a handsome, likable actor who resembles a youthful Robert Redford, does an excellent job delivering his soliloquies.

Nanna Finding Koppel’s acrobatic Ophelia is irresistibly ethereal.

But the play is constantly interwoven with songs (21 of them), composed and sung by Martyn Jacques, of heart-piercing falsetto voice and bold, insinuating demeanour. Wearing a bowler hat, his face painted clown white with black bee-stung lips, he either saunters across the stage with his accordion and or sits to sing at the piano.

Truly, no matter how graciously Jacques attempts to give a scene back after he steals it, he remains the decadent rock star and leader of the Greek chorus of this Brechtian cabaret.

He’s backed up by the two other members of the Tiger Lilies band who haunt the stage throughout, playing multiple odd musical instruments, including a saw.

Still, the most impressive thing about this production is the way that director Martin Tulinius has balanced various eccentric, unorthodox ploys, so that we remain engaged with the play while enthralled by the music.

He has radically reduced Shakespeare’s text, playing up and extending the Hamlet/Ophelia love story using beautifully choreographed scenes that depict them floating together through the air. Ophelia walks a bed frame as if it were a tightrope — a breathtaking nouveau circus moment.

Queen Gertrude (Charlotte Engelkes) is like a prancing peacock, part whore, part Lady Macbeth, who, in a rare tender moment, uses her long, ruffled skirt as a cloak to comfort Ophelia.

Zlatko Buric gives a hammy performance as the buffoonish, superannuated Claudius, while Morten Christensen’s Laertes also remains within the realm of caricature.

Tulinius makes brilliant use of projections, including an image of Hamlet’s face upon the actor’s real face to conjure of the ghost of the prince’s father.

The wooden Elsinore backdrop with its multiple doors acts as a screen when not being raised or lowered to ominous effect. Giant worms writhe to illustrate what happens to us after death. Breaking waves appear for Ophelia’s normally offstage drowning scene as she dangles, helpless from a wire.

Violent scenes are done in slow motion. Actors are reduced to Hamlet’s ventriloquist dummies at one point, puppets on strings at another.

At times, the Tiger Lillies’ Hamlet brings to mind Carbone 14’s iconic, highly choreographed 1987 version of Heiner Muller’s Hamletmachine — another adaptation that also focused on Hamlet and Ophelia’s relationship.

Personally, as Hamlet rewrites go, I prefer Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.

But Tulinius has given these two minor ex-schoolmate characters a clever nod, too, by having Hamlet shake hands with members of the audience, saying things like, “I haven’t seen you since college days” before leading us into the play-within-the-play.

Previous acquaintance with Shakespeare’s play is assumed here. Many, but not all, of the key lines have been retained. To Be or Not to Be is a song by the Tiger Lillies as well as the opening line of a soliloquy, spoken by Hamlet.

It also helps to know that the Tiger Lillies, who have 35 albums and a British/European cult following, are renowned in London for their “junk opera” Shockheaded Peter, which won an Olivier Award for Best Entertainment in 2002.

For those who like their Shakespeare deconstructed and reinvented, this Hamlet is an absolute must.

Micheline Jodoin was thanked for her decade of service by the board of directors of the N.D.G. rehab centre in a statement a day after a four-hour meeting at which the executive director was grilled — somewhat belatedly — about the terms of her compensation.

It is alleged that Jodoin was simultaneously collecting a pension after retiring, two years of severance after her previous position was eliminated and an additional salary after contracting herself out to return to run the centre through a private firm owned by her husband. According to Constance-Lethbridge’s spokesperson, the contract was approved “by all the appropriate authorities,” including the board. And according to a board member who spoke to The Gazette, the board “was told all of this was legal” regarding the contract after retirement. Whether it was, in fact, legal presumably is something the health ministry is looking into.

The board of directors was right to ask tough questions Wednesday and take swift action after concerns were raised in the media about Jodoin’s compensation. But it raises the question: What happened to board oversight over the arrangement in the first place?

This is not the first time the effectiveness of boards of directors in the public health sector has come under scrutiny. The vigilance of the McGill University Health Centre board over former CEO Arthur Porter (who now stands charged with fraud in connection with the awarding of the MUHC superhospital project) and the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal over departed CEO Christian Paire (who was hastily shuffled out after an auditor general’s report slamming his excessive compensation) came under fire.

But the most recent revelations come at a particularly sensitive time for all boards overseeing public institutions in Quebec. The government recently tabled Bill 10, which proposes to merge 128 local health agencies and boards of public hospitals, nursing homes and rehabilitation centres into just 28 mega-boards, whose members would all be appointed by the health minister.

That bill is a threat to diversity and community oversight of institutions cherished by minority groups, such as anglophones and Jewish Quebecers. Additionally, the government is considering merging or abolishing school boards, which would be another blow to community representation. So the timing couldn’t be worse.

A full, open and transparent accounting of whether the Constance-Lethbridge board properly acquitted itself of its duties is needed, along with a long overdue reckoning of the roles of the MUHC and CHUM boards in their respective scandals. But the latest controversy should not be allowed to make the government’s case for eliminating boards of directors.

In general, there are obvious weaknesses in boards of directors that need to be addressed, such as the experience, expertise and courage of members to question executive directors, who in sitting ex officio can sometimes be relied upon too heavily to guide the board or, at worst, lead directors down the garden path. But boards made up of citizens seeking to serve their communities by volunteering their time to steer important institutions are something society should value — and keep.

If the health minister assumes power over naming board members, much will be lost in terms of representation, diversity and the closeness of institutions to the communities they serve. Board members should not be puppets to be manipulated by the CEOs they are supposed to question or the health minister of the day.","2014-10-03 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","592","97.87","66.37","16.69","31.53","26.91","29.90","78.89","46.11","5.57","1.86","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","0.84","3.72","10.14","17.40","6.76","2.03","4.56","0.68","10.47","4.05","2.87","1.86","1.35","1.86","2.20","1.18","0.84","0.17","0.17","0.34","7.43","0.17","0.17","0.84","0.34","8.61","1.69","1.01","1.52","2.70","1.18","2.53","1.01","0.34","0.34","0.17","2.20","0.00","2.20","0.00","0.00","9.97","2.03","1.01","6.59","0.34","0.68","4.05","5.57","0.17","13.51","1.18","7.43","4.90","7.09","0.17","0.34","1.69","1.18","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.49","3.89","3.72","0.17","0.00","0.17","0.00","1.18","0.68","1.01","0.68","0.00","3061","9.05","27.136363636363637","951","586","22","44.48","15.6","13.7","14.39","17.4","152","13.75","23.01542662116041","314","24.18","9","0.45","0","21","5","65","3","85","40","2","2","7","109","40","0","49","2","0","7","9","18","0","1","2","19","0","20","19","20","21","6","13","5","5","1","0"

A real contest is not only a boost for democratic debate, it could act as a magnet to draw voters to the polls at a time when even more than usual is at stake.

As the Quebec government seeks to contain rising costs in the education system, the role of school boards in implementing budget cuts and prioritizing services is more important than ever — at least until further notice. Health Minister Yves Bolduc is contemplating major structural reforms to the education system, which could include the merger or abolition of school boards.

This could be a use-it-or-lose moment for voters. Failure to turn up at the polls would send a message that the public doesn’t care about the fate of school boards.

As well, this will be the first time board chairs will be elected by universal suffrage rather than chosen from among commissioners.

With so much at stake, the onus will be on candidates to articulate a vision for education, connect with their communities and provoke discussion about the direction of public schooling.

This is especially true in English education, which stands as a last bastion of community control over valued institutions.

According to the Quebec English School Boards Association, races are taking place in fully half the contests, up from 33 per cent in 2007; the remainder of posts will be acclaimed. In the Montreal area, two candidates are vying to be chair of the English Montreal School Board, three are facing off at the Lester B. Pearson School Board and two are competing to run the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board.

On the French side, four candidates are running for chair of the Commission scolaire de Montréal, Quebec’s biggest school board, and two are contesting the chair position at the Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys.

Voter participation rates in the past have been dismal, provoking such reforms as the direct balloting for board chair this time out, and the holding of school board votes at the same time as municipal elections starting in 2017.

In 2007, the overall turnout was a paltry 7.9 per cent. It was a slightly better 16.9 per cent in the English system — still nothing to brag about.

Those wishing to cast a ballot for English boards in particular need to make sure they are on the right voters list. Only those whose children are currently enrolled in English public schools are guaranteed to be registered to vote for English board elections. Everyone else defaults to the French list.

Voters must first check their status by calling the Directeur général des élections at 1-888-353-2846. To change lists, they must contact the English school board in their district and fill out a form. But they must act quickly. The deadline to get on an English list is Oct. 14.

This is an annoying administrative hoop, but there are good reasons to jump through it. Access to English schools is a minority right that anglophones have fought to protect. But enrolment is nevertheless declining, with about 12 per cent of families eligible for English school opting to send their children to French school instead.

The next boards will have their work cut out for them. All the more reason to pay attention to the debate increased competition will generate and participate in defining the future of public education in Quebec — whether in English or in French.","2014-09-30 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","590","97.60","60.05","22.37","37.78","19.67","22.71","72.37","45.76","4.41","1.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.53","2.88","9.32","18.47","8.14","3.39","4.07","0.51","11.36","3.90","3.05","0.85","3.90","1.19","2.37","1.53","0.85","0.00","0.34","0.34","5.59","0.17","0.17","0.00","0.17","8.14","1.02","1.69","1.69","0.85","1.86","2.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.00","6.95","0.85","1.69","4.24","0.85","0.51","1.02","8.14","1.53","14.58","1.69","9.32","3.73","5.93","0.34","0.17","1.19","0.17","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.17","0.00","10.51","5.08","3.73","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.00","1.19","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.00","2777","7.78","22.0","845","586","31","69.21","11.1","8.3","11.37","11.3","119","11.0","17.682866894197954","310","19.89","2","0.43","0","13","21","62","1","84","40","2","2","13","99","48","0","40","2","0","8","5","20","2","0","5","25","0","34","4","21","10","13","14","3","0","1","1"

But the adverse effects of Bill 10 pose a grave threat to the rights of minorities — particularly the ability of the historic anglophone and Jewish communities to govern cherished institutions and access care in English at designated bilingual facilities in the future.

Bill 10 proposes to reduce 128 boards of directors to just 28 — province wide. So, for example, instead of being run independently, the Jewish General Hospital, St. Mary’s Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, Miriam Centre, Jewish Eldercare Centre, Maimonides Geriatric Centre, Constance-Lethbridge Rehabilitation Centre, Gingras-Lindsay Rehabilitation Institute, CSSS Cavendish and CSSS de la Montagne would all be lumped together under a single umbrella of governance.

The McGill University Health Centre has been spared such a merger and will remain one of a handful of stand-alone institutions. But what of Quebec City’s Jeffrey-Hale-Saint-Brigid’s, which is to be swallowed up under Bill 10 by a single super-board in a region where anglophones make up just 2 per cent of the population?

The goal of the reform is to slash $220 million a year in administration costs by removing 1,300 management positions — or 10 per cent of managers in 18 soon-to-be abolished regional health boards. But in stripping institutions from the Douglas Hospital to the Montreal Chinese Hospital to Batshaw Youth and Family Services of their distinct boards, made up of directors connected to their communities, the reform seems to confuse bureaucracy with governance.

The proposed reform concentrates enormous power in the hands of the health minister to appoint all the board members and even intervene by imposing a special representative should a given board not be seen to be following the minister’s directives. The bill also says the minister “can” appoint a special consultative committee to recommend ways to “preserve the cultural, historic or local character” of merged facilities. But this is a discretionary power and very weak protection indeed for the role of communities in valued institutions.

Bill 10 contains clauses that profess to safeguard the linguistic status of facilities currently designated bilingual — and Barrette publicly insisted these facilities would not lose their right to operate in English. But if the representation of community members on the mega-boards is watered down, there would be nothing to stop a future governing board from changing it.

Barrette has personally shown sensitivity to the plight of anglophone institutions, rapidly intervening to nix plans to merge bilingual Montreal rehab centre Constance Lethbridge with three francophone institutions amid concerns it would lose its language status. But what happens in the future if the person holding the health portfolio or the government of the day is less sympathetic to minority language concerns?

As with the case of Constance Lethbridge, there is a world of difference between enshrined rights and good intentions. This is now writ large for all minority and community representation at publicly funded health institutions.

The role of boards of directors in ensuring the responsiveness of health facilities to the communities they serve will be erased in one fell swoop if Bill 10 is signed into law as is.

To comprehend the implications, think back no further than the tense debate on the Parti Québécois’s repugnant charter of values, which would have stripped doctors and nurses from wearing religious insignia from kippahs to hijabs while exercising their duties at public hospitals. The Jewish General took a strong stand in denouncing the dress code and vowing to ignore the law. Under the proposed reform, this voice would be lost, or at least severely diluted.

Bill 10 proposes to do nothing less than excise the beating heart of Quebec’s vibrant minority communities.","2014-09-26 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","638","98.18","52.51","9.60","20.98","27.74","30.56","73.20","41.69","2.82","0.78","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.78","2.04","9.09","16.61","5.49","2.51","5.17","0.78","8.31","3.45","1.57","0.78","3.13","1.25","3.45","1.57","1.88","0.47","0.16","0.78","4.55","0.16","0.16","0.00","0.00","7.21","0.78","1.10","1.57","1.41","1.25","3.13","0.94","0.16","0.31","0.47","4.23","0.47","3.61","0.00","0.16","9.40","2.04","1.10","5.49","0.63","0.78","1.41","5.64","1.10","10.82","0.78","7.84","2.35","5.33","0.31","0.31","1.88","1.57","0.16","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","10.50","3.29","3.61","0.00","0.00","0.31","0.00","1.57","0.63","0.94","0.00","0.16","3313","9.3","29.272727272727273","1054","631","23","35.2","15.9","15.2","14.45","17.8","172","13.625","23.863328050713157","332","26.18","2","0.4","0","24","18","65","1","81","42","2","1","10","101","73","0","54","2","0","3","5","22","1","0","2","29","0","33","6","15","25","5","16","3","2","0","1"

The world has begun to respond to the threat posed by the so-called Islamic State with military air strikes that may well see troops from Western countries on the ground very soon. At the same time, this week’s binding UN resolution also calls for domestic anti-terror policies to be revamped to staunch the flow of foreign fighters to the front lines of jihadist-triggered conflicts.

On the military front, the U.S. is primarily interested in putting together a regional coalition of majority Sunni-Arab nations — Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain — that will get more directly involved in fighting the Sunni extremists that dominate IS.

For its part, Canada has already sent 69 military advisers to northern Iraq, to reinforce Kurdish fighters acting as a bulwark against further IS incursions. Canada is also aiding with the transport of ammunition, weapons and humanitarian assistance. But Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Canada has been called upon by the U.S. to do more.

Canada ought to be an active partner in the fight, but Harper also should make good on his promise to hold a full parliamentary debate on Canada’s involvement. And any involvement must respect Canada’s weak combat capacity; under the governing Conservatives, the military has stayed largely intact in terms of the number of personnel, but cuts to equipment maintenance and upgrading have largely degraded Canada’s potential effectiveness.

New Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair is correct that there is a significant threat of mission creep in any new offensive. And while he is also right that Canadians are not enthusiastic about military involvement, he should not underestimate the importance of forcefully confronting IS.

IS may be an ideological abomination. But it is highly disciplined, well-trained, well-equipped — and it is also increasingly wealthy due to black-market crude-oil sales. It is a serious threat to regional and global security.

That said, there can no hope of a pure military victory, at least one in the traditional sense, against such a non-traditional, non-state actor.

However, military action will be useful, as it has been in recent days, with bombings designed to destroy captured oil-production facilities that were bringing IS millions of dollars a day in underground crude-oil revenues.

The fight against IS is an ideological war, more than a munitions war. It is the latest chapter in an unfolding civil war in the Middle East over the future of Islam. In this respect, Muslim nation states have a selfish interest in seeing IS destroyed. But given the Sunni roots of IS, it will ultimately be up to the Sunni nations to step up and do more to combat this group that even al-Qaida has disowned and regards as a mad menace.

It is estimated some 130 Canadians are waging jihad under the IS banner. But Canada isn’t alone. Other countries are also seeing citizens going abroad to join IS and other jihadist groups. Canada needs to step amplify efforts to identify and stop those ready to join the battle, exercise vigilance over fighters who return home, and hold to account any Canadians involved in atrocities perpetrated by IS.

Military action should be continued against IS, but with the more realistic strategic goal of destabilizing it while political alliances with moderate Muslims in the Middle East can be transformed into a newer and more powerful ideological force.

The perverted world view espoused by IS cannot be allowed to proliferate unchecked.","2014-09-25 00:00:00","0","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","620","90.36","56.41","27.54","7.28","23.85","28.06","80.32","45.16","4.52","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.00","4.03","8.23","14.35","10.32","3.71","5.48","0.81","13.06","4.68","2.90","0.32","0.65","2.58","7.74","3.06","4.68","0.65","3.23","0.16","5.48","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.48","7.90","0.81","1.29","1.13","1.29","0.81","3.06","1.77","0.81","0.32","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.32","0.16","0.00","10.81","1.77","1.61","7.10","0.81","1.13","2.26","9.35","1.61","15.16","1.94","9.68","3.87","2.10","0.48","0.32","0.97","1.94","0.48","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.00","12.74","5.16","4.35","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","2.10","0.00","0.97","0.00","0.00","3077","9.0","24.192307692307693","974","610","29","50.16","13.5","11.5","13.0","13.7","167","13.125","21.35081967213115","347","22.0","20","0.44","0","21","3","60","0","67","71","4","2","12","85","72","4","37","1","1","10","2","32","3","0","1","25","0","32","5","13","27","9","21","5","2","0","0"

But the suggestion that paid leave could be scaled back to nine or 10 months, down from the current 50 weeks, is something that should be approached with caution. Such a move might actually prove counterproductive, both by upping the cost of operating the publicly subsidized daycare system and making it more difficult for parents to return to work as they seek a scarce spot for a young baby.

Parental-insurance plans generally are a worthy public investment that promote a range of family-friendly health, social, developmental and economic goals. A one-year leave to give mom and/or dad time at home to nurture their new baby is the gold standard.

The Quebec Parental Insurance Plan is, however, extremely generous compared to the benefits in the rest of Canada, which are administered by the federal government. Quebec moms are exclusively entitled to 18 weeks of benefits, during which time fathers also get five weeks of paid leave, something they do not get elsewhere in Canada. The remaining 32 weeks can be split between both parents. Quebec pays 70 per cent of salary for half the leave and 55 per cent for the remainder (or 70 per cent and 55 per cent of $69,000, for those whose annual salary is higher). Quebec also offers the option of higher benefits — 75 per cent — allocated over a shorter period of time. And there is a program for adoptive parents. In the rest of Canada, parents can collect 55 per cent of their salary (or of $48,600, if their salary is higher than that amount) for 50 weeks.

The current made-in-Quebec system was introduced by the Liberals in 2006 — and came after a fight all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada over Quebec’s right to establish its own program.

Last year, the QPIP paid out $1.87 billion in benefits, and Quebec recorded 88,600 births.

Should Quebec’s program be scaled back? As with every program under the microscope, it’s hard to justify why it should escape scrutiny entirely.

But the idea of reducing the time period of benefits should be immediately scrapped for the unnecessary burden it would put on both families and the public purse. Parents returning to work after a leave already know daycare places for children under 18 months of age are harder to find, given that not every daycare has a “pouponnière.” If they manage to find a spot in the private sector, the fees can be higher for infants until they can graduate to a room for toddlers older than 18 months, due to lower employee-to-child ratios required, exacting standards for the rooms where babies are cared for and other factors. In cases where a parent does find a subsidized space, the cost to the public purse is higher: the subsidy for each child under 18 months is $61.86 versus $39.08 for an older child.

Cutting off parental benefits earlier would mean the government is going to have to foot the bill for a greater number of younger children at a higher cost. And in other cases, it will simply force families to pay for the higher costs themselves — wherever they manage to find daycare.

If, in the end, some cutbacks to parental benefits must be made, let those be in the form of cuts to benefits, not the time period covered. Forcing parents back into the workforce prematurely would not only have social drawbacks, it would be a false economy for the government, and would penalize parents twice.","2014-09-18 00:00:00","0","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","625","95.77","64.96","47.60","59.08","26.04","20.16","82.56","46.72","5.44","1.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.44","4.00","9.60","16.32","8.00","3.36","4.64","0.80","12.32","4.80","3.84","1.12","4.80","2.08","3.20","2.40","0.64","0.00","0.16","0.16","8.16","3.68","0.16","0.32","0.32","9.76","1.60","0.96","2.24","2.24","1.28","3.52","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.48","0.16","0.32","0.00","0.00","10.88","3.04","0.96","4.48","2.24","0.48","2.08","8.96","0.96","17.76","2.24","8.16","7.84","6.08","0.48","0.96","4.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.12","3.68","5.12","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","1.44","0.32","0.64","0.64","0.96","2832","7.89","27.47826086956522","887","616","27","65.25","12.0","9.8","10.8","12.5","122","17.833333333333332","19.042077922077922","302","23.7","2","0.44","0","18","31","71","0","86","39","11","0","18","90","20","0","53","3","0","13","5","28","1","0","3","24","0","40","8","9","18","15","17","5","0","1","4"
"http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/arts/parked-in-a-plum-role","Parked in a plum role","Opportunity has knocked at last. Veteran actor/director Joel Miller is about to play a long-desired role, Shakespeare’s Falstaff.

Miller will be doing the role outdoors, in Repercussion Theatre’s Harry the King: The Famous Victories of Henry V, which opens on July 8 in Westmount Park.

“The more I get involved with it, the more I love it,” Miller said via cellphone from the Côte-St-Luc park where rehearsals were held this week. “I was aware that it wasn’t going to be a walk in the park — although it is indeed a walk in the park. I just discovered some muscles I never knew I had.”

Park Shakespeare, which entails location changes every couple of days as well as discreetly swatting mosquitoes mid-speech, tends to be a rite of passage for recent graduates, rather than late-career artists.

But Miller, who taught at the National Theatre School for almost 20 years and admits to being in his early 70s, is having a blast. Asked about his approach to Falstaff, Miller replied, “The whimsical part of myself wants to say that I drink a lot of booze.”

Falstaff is one of Shakespeare’s most beloved characters. He’s a sodden, overweight, blowhard of a knight who becomes a companion to the wayward young Prince Hal (who becomes the heroic King Henry V). Playing Falstaff is an honour eagerly sought by mature actors, almost on a par with portraying King Lear. (The late, great William Hutt did both, plus Prospero, during his last years at the Stratford Festival.)

Harry the King is an adaptation by Repercussion Theatre artistic director Paul Hopkins and Concordia professor Karen Oberer — with help from McGill Shakespeare expert Paul Yachnin — that combines three Shakespeare plays: Henry IV, Part One, Henry IV Part Two, and Henry V, along with a dash of Richard II.

Miller is happy to acknowledge that he’s a tad slim for Falstaff. Padding will be added to create a suitable girth. He sees Falstaff as a “Lord of Misrule,” a person appointed by the court in medieval times to preside over the Feast of Fools, “when the nobility became servants to the commoners for one day.”

Besides being a boozer with a big appetite, Falstaff is a “parallel father figure to Prince Hal,” Miller said. “Because Hal’s father Henry IV has always been very critical of Hal and doesn’t like him hanging out with Falstaff and his gang. Through mockery and raillery, Falstaff is teaching Hal. He’s a total anarchist.”

Even Queen Elizabeth I was smitten with the old rogue, to the point that she asked Shakespeare to write Falstaff into a third play (he appears in Henry IV Parts One and Two, but not in Henry V). Thus he ended up in Merry Wives of Windsor. Many years later, Giuseppe Verdi wrote him an opera.

Hopkins said it’s the first time that Repercussion Theatre has tackled Shakespeare’s history plays. The 100th anniversary of the First World War seemed a good time to do them. “In Henry V, there’s a lot of battles and it’s often brought up when it comes to war,” he said, citing the Sir Laurence Olivier film Henry V, which was a vital part of Britain’s effort to rally the troops during the Second World War.

Harry the King, however, is an amalgam. “I’ve extracted the storyline of Hal, which spans four plays,” Hopkins explained. “He’s introduced at the very end of Richard II and then he becomes a character in Henry IV Part One, Henry IV Part Two and Henry V.”","2014-07-09 23:04:50","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","160.0","162.0","0.0","83.0","7.0","7.0","1","592","93.77","69.99","18.90","51.03","19.73","20.44","77.20","43.92","8.11","4.56","1.69","0.00","0.00","2.70","0.17","3.55","9.80","14.36","7.43","3.21","3.72","0.68","12.50","3.38","1.52","1.69","2.70","3.04","6.08","3.72","2.36","1.18","1.01","0.00","8.95","0.51","0.51","0.51","4.39","6.93","2.20","0.68","0.68","1.52","0.84","1.35","1.86","0.51","1.35","0.00","2.53","0.17","1.52","0.00","0.84","7.77","1.01","1.35","4.73","1.69","0.00","4.22","7.09","0.84","13.85","2.36","5.91","5.57","1.86","3.38","0.00","0.00","0.34","0.51","0.51","0.00","0.17","0.17","0.17","0.00","20.27","5.07","6.59","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.84","3.38","2.87","1.01","0.17","2643","7.72","23.384615384615383","799","589","30","68.5","9.6","8.6","10.21","10.7","116","7.5","17.717758913412563","315","20.81","24","0.43","0","13","11","62","0","71","37","0","1","2","69","137","0","21","0","0","29","4","20","2","0","3","17","0","14","25","11","12","5","30","5","3","0","3"
"http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/arts/just-for-laughs-mike-birbiglia-is-happy-to-lose-the-plot","Just for Laughs: Mike Birbiglia is happy to lose the plot","MONTREAL — There is little mystery about the titles of Mike Birbiglia’s one-man shows. Audiences knew exactly what was in store for them with monologues like Sleepwalk With Me, What I Should Have Said Was Nothing and My Girlfriend’s Boyfriend.

Birbiglia’s latest play to be launched at Just for Laughs, Thank God for Jokes, is pretty self-explanatory as well. And judging by audience reaction to his previous pieces, it’s a good bet that Thank God for Jokes will eventually hit Broadway and perhaps spawn another film.

Birbiglia has a masterful monologist’s touch. He is able to dig deep into his past, come up with embarrassingly personal tales of woe and transform them into highly humorous, occasionally poignant entertainment for the masses. Ever honest, Birbiglia calls this process “monetizing my pain.”

But Thank God for Jokes is somewhat of a departure for the comedian, who presents the show July 23 to 26 at the Gesù — and as Birbiglia asks in a phone interview: “Could there be a better place for me to thank God than at a church?” Probably not.

“My other shows were so focused on me telling a singular story, but I really wanted to go back to what brought me into this in the first place, to what made me love comedy.

“It was the jokes of Bill Cosby, Steven Wright and Mitch Hedberg that touched me and had me laughing my head off. So I decided that I wanted to put together the funniest show I could and not think about narrative. To show the role comedy has played in my life and in all our lives.”

But don’t go expecting Birbiglia to recite his top 100 one-liners. Instead, he will be telling 10 stories over the course of his show.

Birbiglia will also seek to demonstrate how comedy can be profound and bring people together but can also alienate. “Jokes can give and take. They have a double-edged nature.”

Unlike that of most of his fellow American comedians, Birbiglia’s humour is not punchline-driven. It’s more nuanced. Much like that of such Brit wits as Monty Python, or that of some Québécois raconteurs.

“I’ve never been to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, but friends have been telling me for years to go, that my stuff would fit in nicely there, that performers there are doing similar things to what I do,” Birbiglia says.

“Americans don’t always understand that kind of humour — much the same way they don’t understand soccer.” Pause, followed by an unusual segue: “I don’t have any soccer jokes in this play, but I did play a lot of soccer growing up. I was actually an excellent goalkeeper and I was, surprisingly, quite aggressive.”

But Birbiglia lost his aggressiveness when confronting an opposing forward for a loose ball. “I slid into him and the ball, and he kicked my head as though it were the ball. And I decided never to play goalkeeper again.”

One gets the feeling that Birbiglia has now found another embarrassingly personal moment to monetize. “I like to think that guy played a role in kicking my head into comedy,” he cracks.","2014-07-12 02:27:58","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","160.0","162.0","0.0","83.0","7.0","7.0","1","523","58.22","41.68","38.91","99.00","17.43","19.50","87.38","52.77","14.34","8.80","5.74","0.19","0.00","2.10","0.76","5.54","5.54","14.15","8.99","5.54","6.50","1.91","16.83","3.63","2.87","1.53","1.72","2.49","9.37","7.65","1.34","0.38","0.38","0.38","8.80","0.00","0.96","0.00","2.87","11.47","1.91","0.76","1.53","2.68","1.34","3.44","3.25","1.15","0.96","0.96","1.53","0.76","0.57","0.00","0.00","5.74","1.53","1.72","1.91","1.34","0.00","5.35","9.18","0.96","11.85","2.68","6.31","3.44","1.15","5.35","0.00","0.57","0.96","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","17.59","5.54","4.59","0.38","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.96","3.63","2.29","0.00","0.00","2340","7.25","23.304347826086957","724","522","30","70.73","11.3","7.7","9.92","9.6","91","6.916666666666667","15.933180076628354","294","21.09","15","0.5","0","23","7","39","0","64","36","1","4","8","64","54","2","20","0","0","34","13","33","1","0","2","18","0","31","21","12","8","13","16","1","6","0","2"

News reports suggesting the premier is vying to get Quebec’s signature on the Constitution by 2017, Canada’s 150th birthday, were doused the next day by Couillard himself, who told reporters to look more closely at the text of his speech. The key sentence in the speech read: “À l’aube du 150e anniversaire du Canada, les Québécois souhaitent que le pacte qui lui a donné naissance soit réaffirmé.”

True, there’s a certain ambiguity there, but Couillard was right to say Sunday that his priority is the economy, not the Constitution, and that he simply meant to say Quebec’s ties with the rest of Canada need to be “reaffirmed” as 2017 approaches.

The clarification is most certainly welcome, given Canada’s difficult constitutional history over the past generation. What’s more, Couillard wasn’t elected with any mandate to enter into constitutional talks. The absence of Quebec’s signature on the 1982 Constitution isn’t a good thing, but polls show Quebecers generally like the Constitution, and it applies to Quebec nonetheless. In fact, the Constitution, as passed in 1982, hasn’t prevented the Quebec legislature from taking measures to preserve and promote French.

Couillard won a surprising majority-government upset in the April 7 election, but no one should take that, or the simultaneous collapse of the Parti Québécois, as a sign of renewed federalist fervour in Quebec.

The fact of the matter is that Quebecers are largely divided over Quebec’s place in Canada. One-third would like to separate from Canada, one-third would like to see Quebec sign the Constitution and one-third are generally happy with the ambiguous middle position. Those proportions have shifted somewhat in the past generation, but not by much. Against this backdrop, no Quebec premier should try to change the constitutional status quo, one way or another. The federal Clarity Act, quite rightly, insists on a clear majority in favour of sovereignty, in any referendum question, for it to reflect the clear will of the people. Similarly, no Quebec premier should push for Quebec’s signature on the Constitution without there first being a strong indication over time that this is what a clear majority of Quebecers want. To act otherwise would be to invite political confrontation, social unrest and economic uncertainty.

For the moment, Quebecers as a whole are not demonstrably unhappy with the current constitutional configuration. In the end, it’s very difficult to lead people in a direction where they don’t want to go. There may well come a day when public opinion will crystallize in favour this or that, and remain constant for a decade or so. Until then, Quebec politicians should just put the whole constitutional debate on ice, as François Legault’s Coalition Avenir Québec has formally done.

Canada doesn’t always work very well in theory, but it works well for Quebecers in practice. By all means, let’s hear some speeches reaffirming Quebec’s ties with Canada as 2017 approaches, but let’s devote our political energies to moving forward on the economy, environmental issues, health care and other more pressing issues.","2014-09-08 00:00:00","0","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","551","94.72","49.27","26.55","66.96","25.05","27.40","74.59","44.10","5.44","1.81","0.00","0.54","0.00","1.09","0.18","3.63","9.62","15.25","6.35","3.45","5.26","2.18","12.70","5.08","2.36","1.09","2.72","2.90","4.72","3.45","1.27","0.54","0.18","0.18","5.26","0.18","0.00","0.00","1.45","12.34","1.45","0.54","2.00","3.63","1.81","3.81","2.72","1.27","1.27","0.36","0.18","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","6.17","0.91","1.45","2.36","1.45","0.54","2.54","8.17","0.91","15.06","2.18","6.90","6.35","2.72","0.18","0.00","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.54","0.00","16.88","3.99","7.44","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.91","0.73","3.63","0.00","0.00","2722","8.43","27.142857142857142","868","545","22","46.3","14.1","13.0","13.7","15.9","123","17.166666666666668","20.94752293577982","305","24.33","1","0.44","0","17","10","67","0","69","56","2","0","10","97","59","0","23","0","0","10","3","29","1","1","1","18","0","31","13","7","10","10","17","2","3","0","3"

Most shocking was his claim that he paid $250,000 to former Montreal police chief Jacques Duchesneau, to help Duchesneau with his campaign debts after his failed Montreal mayoral bid in 1998, in exchange for unspecified future favours.

Accurso’s allegation — vociferously denied later Friday by Duchesneau — rattled the very foundation on which the commission had been struck. It had been a 2011 report by Duchesneau, as head of Quebec’s anti-collusion squad, that was a key impetus to the formation of the Charbonneau Commission. His report drew links between the awarding of provincial transport contracts and illicit political financing. And Duchesneau was the commission’s first witness in 2012, claiming that 70 per cent of all contributions to political parties in Quebec in recent years have been illegal.

Justice France Charbonneau asked Accurso point-blank if he was out for revenge. When she demanded to know if he had a copy of this cheque, he fired back that all of his documents have been seized by police — and he didn’t remember which company it had been issued from.

Of course, authorities will now need to review these documents for supporting evidence. In the meantime, Accurso’s allegation shouldn’t be allowed to overshadow the many hours of testimony from many others witnesses since the commission began. From the very beginning of the hearings, some witnesses have provided self-serving testimony, and the reputations of many people have been affected as a result, perhaps in some cases unjustly. But as a whole, however imperfect, the commission has done good work trying to illuminate the public’s understanding of corrupt practices in political financing and public tendering.

Time is running out for the commission; it is due to move on now to hear briefs from major players in Quebec society on how to improve tendering and related questions. But Accurso’s testimony this week pretty much obliges the commission to break with the script and call new witnesses, and perhaps recall some who have testified before.

For one, former premier Jean Charest needs to be summoned. So, too, should former Quebec Liberal fundraiser Marc Bibeau. Bibeau has figured in the testimony of many witnesses, but until Accurso took the stand this week, Charest had only been mentioned peripherally.

True, that photograph of Charest with Accurso that made the news this week dates from 2001, before Charest became premier in 2003, but it has an exceedingly chummy quality to it that raises legitimate questions about the nature of their relationship, and that of the political class and construction industry more generally. As well, former Parti Québécois premier Pauline Marois should also be required to testify, as should her husband Claude Blanchet, to answer allegations about an unspecified “deal” alluded to by union leaders in wiretap testimony heard earlier by the commission.

The Gomery inquiry into the federal Liberal sponsorship scandal managed to call former prime ministers Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin to testify. Similarly, Charbonneau should not be shy to require former Quebec premiers to appear.","2014-09-05 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","535","94.03","67.97","9.90","39.11","25.48","30.65","72.52","44.86","6.92","2.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.43","0.19","4.30","7.10","17.38","7.10","3.36","5.23","0.56","11.21","5.42","3.93","1.12","2.06","2.43","2.99","1.87","1.12","0.19","0.37","0.19","7.10","0.19","0.19","0.37","2.24","9.53","2.62","1.12","1.68","2.80","0.56","1.87","0.93","0.56","0.37","0.00","0.19","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.17","1.31","1.68","3.36","0.75","0.19","7.10","4.67","0.37","12.90","0.75","4.67","7.48","5.05","0.37","0.00","1.31","0.19","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","12.34","3.93","5.61","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.56","0.37","1.50","0.00","0.19","2732","8.86","25.857142857142858","868","534","21","45.69","15.8","13.2","13.81","16.3","134","12.0","22.1974531835206","296","23.14","0","0.45","0","15","9","49","0","74","42","1","1","5","89","59","0","30","0","0","11","8","21","3","0","3","24","0","24","25","4","21","7","11","3","2","0","2"

From the 4.52-per-cent increase to bring the salary of François Chamberland, executive director of technical services, to $188,692, to the 6.53-per-cent raise to push the pay of Luc Tremblay, executive director of finance, to $225,162, the hikes to executives averaged 5.31 per cent.

News of these raises, well in excess of the inflation rate, comes at a time the STM is slashing $65 million from its operating budget, cost-cutting that has meant reduced service on some bus routes, fewer staff at métro ticket booths, dirtier transit stations — and, not surprisingly, lower customer satisfaction.

Executive compensation in the public sector is often an easy target for criticism; there must be a recognition that pay has to be competitive to attract top people to important public positions and retain them. However in this case, the base rates already earned by these executives are reasonable, and increases exceeding inflation are hard to justify. The salary hikes are substantially more than the modest 2.3-per-cent increase in weekly earnings that Canadians saw in February 2014 from a year earlier.

The 2013 annual report, which was made public last month and which disclosed the pay hikes, also showed that customer satisfaction dropped in 2013. Last year, The Gazette obtained the salary figures for a longer list of STM managers and found that the salaries of a dozen top managers had jumped by 10 per cent in 2012.

That executives are being rewarded so handsomely while customer satisfaction is declining and service to the public is being cut is unacceptable. News of the increases is also politically unfortunate, coming as it does at a time when Mayor Denis Coderre is looking for take-backs from municipal workers on pension reform. It will undermine the city’s case in the pension dispute.

The excessively large raises to STM executives is a reminder of disquieting trends in the private sector, where executive compensation — generally much higher than in the public sector, pensions aside — is creeping back up to unprecedented levels, after cooling in 2008 and 2009 in the wake of the global economic meltdown.

Realities in the public sector, though, are quite different; the public sector is struggling through a slow but steady fiscal deterioration. At the provincial level, Quebec is proposing new austerity measures to help offset a persistent structural deficit. Municipalities will also be looking at new austerity measures when 2015 budgets are tabled late this fall.

Under the circumstances, the pay hikes to STM executives in 2013 sent the wrong message to employees, to passengers and to Quebecers at large. It is to be hoped that the new STM board chairman, Philippe Schnobb, appointed by Coderre last fall, will be able to oversee greater budgetary discipline going forward.","2014-07-07 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","492","97.36","54.84","53.63","44.37","28.94","27.44","76.02","41.06","3.66","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.20","3.46","9.15","15.65","6.91","3.25","4.07","0.20","10.77","5.49","3.05","1.02","4.47","0.81","4.27","2.64","1.63","0.41","0.20","0.20","2.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.67","1.63","0.61","0.41","1.02","0.41","1.42","1.42","1.02","0.00","0.41","0.41","0.20","0.20","0.00","0.00","8.74","0.41","2.03","6.71","1.22","0.20","2.85","6.30","1.02","18.90","4.67","9.96","5.08","10.16","1.02","0.00","6.10","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","13.21","3.46","6.71","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.00","1.63","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.61","2417","8.88","29.294117647058822","767","485","21","48.03","13.8","12.3","13.29","14.7","126","7.916666666666666","21.63175257731959","281","25.71","5","0.39","0","10","25","50","3","68","42","5","0","4","94","24","1","40","0","0","4","1","23","1","0","0","21","0","14","12","14","10","6","17","5","0","0","3"
"http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-with-this-budget-quebec-starts-putting-its-house-in-order/wcm/81567943-ab86-420d-a70e-255285ff8f5c","Editorial: With this budget, Quebec starts putting its house in order","MONTREAL — Finance Minister Carlos Leitão’s first budget reads like a business plan for reviving Quebec’s moribund economy, with tax cuts for small enterprises, infrastructure investment, a relaunch of the Liberals’ Plan Nord, planned equity stakes in natural resource companies, a maritime strategy to position the province as a shipping and shipbuilding hub and a vow to create 250,000 jobs in five years.

“Quebec is open for business,” Leitão, a world-renowned economist, declared, sounding as much like a chief executive officer as a finance minister.

Quebecers may have been expecting dreaded austerity measures after all the talk of Quebec’s dire financial situation during the April 7 election campaign and since, but the new government certainly has not taken an axe to front-line services. At least not yet.

Instead, it appears that revving Quebec’s economic engine will be the first move on the long road to putting the province’s precarious finances back on track, with the government betting on economic growth of 1.8 per cent in 2014 and two per cent in 2015 after a weak 2013.

But make no mistake: painful measures to come are foreshadowed in this budget, which will hold government spending increases to 1.8 per cent this year — and just 0.7 per cent next year. That very low number on the horizon is the Rubicon Quebec will have to cross.

Any deep cuts to Quebec’s generous social services — to tame a projected deficit of $2.35 billion in 2014-15 and a return to a balanced budget promised for 2015-16 — will be deferred until after a review of the necessity, efficiency, delivery and financing of every government program, as well as a separate scrutinizing of the tax system that funds them all.

This seems prudent and realistic, given the tight timeline — just five weeks — between Premier Philippe Couillard’s Liberal government taking office and the presentation of this first budget Wednesday.

The kind of reform this administration has promised will take time to implement — not because the situation isn’t urgent, but because structural overhaul of this magnitude requires thorough examination and careful consideration. The commissions set up for this — to review programs and evaluate taxation — are to ensure proper reflection takes place.

Nevertheless, hitting the brakes on government spending inevitably will have an impact on services like health care and education. Growth in health spending will be capped at three per cent this year, or $33 billion, and 2.7 per cent next year. That will hurt, given it rose 5.8 per cent last year. There is a hiring freeze in the civil service and publicly funded agencies. Parental fees for subsidized daycare will be indexed, so the daily cost will rise to $7.30 from $7 by October. Taxes on cigarettes and alcohol will rise, but they will fund a modest tax credit to help seniors afford sports and leisure activities.

Infrastructure spending has been scaled back to $11.5 billion this year from the $15 billion the Liberals promised during the campaign. But Leitão said this was necessary to limit borrowing costs after the discovery that the deficit for 2013-14 is actually $3.1 billion — $600 million higher than predicted.

The budget lays the groundwork for more drastic measures that must be taken soon. Treasury Board Chair Martin Coiteux also tabled spending estimates, a much more sobering document, and talked about needing “courage” to re-evaluate every program Quebec offers to regain control of public finances.

These are formidable challenges. Quebecers are aware of this, with about 70 per cent telling a pollster in the aftermath of the election that the government needs to clean up its financial house. And they must remember this as the services dearest to them come under review.

The path immediately ahead is indeed bleak. But onward Quebec must press if it is to have a bright future.","2014-06-04 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","635","94.62","45.00","22.85","46.05","24.42","28.35","77.32","41.57","4.57","0.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.63","3.94","8.50","14.33","6.61","2.83","5.98","0.79","11.18","4.09","2.83","0.16","6.14","1.57","2.99","2.05","0.94","0.16","0.00","0.31","2.20","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.66","1.42","0.94","1.26","1.26","2.20","2.68","1.42","0.31","0.31","0.79","0.94","0.00","0.94","0.00","0.31","7.56","0.47","1.89","4.09","0.94","0.31","1.73","5.67","3.46","13.70","1.57","6.30","6.46","8.03","0.31","0.16","7.56","0.31","0.00","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.16","0.00","12.91","4.09","4.41","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.94","0.63","1.42","0.00","1.26","3119","8.35","25.115384615384617","960","639","35","61.36","11.8","9.2","12.3","11.7","154","16.166666666666668","18.960062597809078","354","22.62","1","0.4","0","25","45","70","0","78","53","1","1","16","133","36","0","34","2","0","7","1","27","2","0","2","22","0","34","11","10","14","5","18","5","0","0","0"

Just weeks before Lin Jun was killed, the man accused of his murder walked into a Montreal hospital and had a one-hour assessment by a psychiatrist.



“Had it been longer, we probably wouldn’t be here today,” Luka Magnotta’s defence lawyer told the jury on the opening day of the 32-year-old’s first-degree murder trial.



Luc Leclair told the eight-woman, six-man jury that his client admits to the five counts against him, including the killing of Concordia University student Lin Jun, but will set out to show that his mental state prevented him from fully grasping what he was doing.



Crown prosecutor Louis Bouthillier, on the other hand, told the jury that the evidence they will hear over the next three or four weeks will show that the murder was planned up to six months in advance and that it was deliberate. He said an email a British reporter received makes it clear that Magnotta had planned to kill a human being and make a movie of it.



“You will see the so-called murder video,” Bouthillier told jurors. “Evidence will show it was posted by Magnotta on a website.”



He also made the shocking revelation that in the first 53 seconds of a video, shot the week before, another man can be seen bonded to Magnotta’s bed.



“The video shows Lin Jun in the same position,” Bouthillier said.



That video will be shown during the third week of the trial and Bouthillier told jurors they would be forewarned, given the upsetting and gruesome nature of the material.



Before the lawyers spoke, the five charges were read aloud by the court clerk: first-degree murder, causing an indignity to a human body, producing and distributing obscene material, sending obscene material via Canada Post and harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other MPs. After each count, Magnotta said clearly “not guilty.” As he spoke, the father of the victim, Lin Diran, stared at him intently but showed no emotion.



Given the length and difficult subject matter of the trial, there are 14 jurors, instead of the usual 12. All will hear the evidence, but only 12, chosen randomly by drawing numbers, will actually deliberate and decide Magnotta’s fate. The two alternates will take the place of anyone who leaves partway through the trial, which is expected to last six to eight weeks.



In his opening statement, Bouthillier also said that surveillance cameras at Magnotta’s Côte-des-Neiges apartment show Lin entering the building with Magnotta in late May 2012. He was killed and dismembered and the jury will see photos of the body parts, Bouthillier warned. Parts of the body were mailed to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Liberal Party of Canada in Ottawa, while others were shipped to schools in Vancouver.



The head was discovered in Angrignon Park, Bouthillier said.



Leclair said he hopes to call Magnotta’s father, Donald Newman, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, to tell the court what his son’s life was like growing up. Magnotta, who changed his name from Eric Newman, has a sister, Melissa, and a brother, Conrad, the defence revealed.



“We may hear from his family, or not,” Leclair said. “I’m keeping my fingers crossed.”



He said that in March, 2012, just months before the murder, Magnotta went to a Montreal hospital and was referred to a psychiatrist whom he saw in April, 2012. Leclair said he will be presenting Magnotta’s medical reports, including those from Peterborough, Ont., and North York General Hospital, to prove his defence of not criminally responsible.



He said his client claims someone named “Manny” told him a year before the killing to commit the acts with which he is charged.



The first witness called to testified Monday showed photos of body parts that were found stashed in garbage bags and a suitcase behind and beside Magnotta’s Décarie Blvd. apartment in the Côte-des-Neiges area.



Caroline Simoneau, a crime scene technician for the Montreal Police, said she arrived on the scene at about 12:15 on May 29, 2012. They found a human torso tucked snugly inside a suitcase, that was covered in flies and emitted a strong odour, she said. A dead black dog with white paws was tripled bagged in black garbage bags.



Police also found a leg in one bag and two arms and a leg in another, Simoneau said, describing each photo as it was projected on large screens in the courtroom. The limbs were missing the hands and feet. She showed photos of two knives, a screwdriver, a grinder, hammer, blue latex gloves and several pieces of clothing. Police also retrieved a bloody mattress cover and a soaked towel that oozed red liquid she said.



There was red liquid seeping from many of the garbage bags, Simoneau told court. In all, police searched 31 garbage bags. They found pink tissue paper, a gift bag and a Canada Post cardboard box.



The trial continues Tuesday.

Graham Hughes/THE CANADIAN PRESS

If so, the trial will probably begin on Monday.

The first two men who appeared before Superior Court Justice Guy Cournoyer Tuesday were chosen as the triers, who will sit in court throughout the jury selection and determine which candidates fit the bill. Once accepted by the triers, both the crown and defence have the opportunity to overrule their decision and reject a candidate.

As the candidates filed into court one at a time, Magnotta sat in the prisoner’s box, his arms folded across his chest and he appeared to doze off at times. A few times he conferred with his lawyer, Luc Leclair, on a jury candidate.

Each candidate was asked a series of questions by Leclair including whether they had seen the “so-called murder video on the Internet, in which you see Magnotta allegedly committing the murder of which he is accused.” Leclair asked whether they could set their opinions aside during the trial and if they wanted to be on the jury. They were also asked if they could handle seeing “graphic and potentially upsetting” evidence.

If francophone, they were asked the questions in English; if anglophone, they were asked in French. All were asked whether they read newspapers, magazines or books or whether they watched television or listened to the radio in their second language.

Out of the 22 candidates who were called before the judge Tuesday, five were selected. Among the three women, there is an auto parts analyst, an assistant manager at a telecommunications firm, and an insurance broker. Among the men is a website programmer.

“It’s the first time since becoming a Canadian citizen that I feel like a citizen,” the man, who is black, told the court.

The other man works as a maintenance man and cleaner. When asked why he wanted to be on the jury, he replied, “The judge said it is a good life experience so if he said it, it must be true.”

“Thank you,” replied Cournoyer. “You just made my day.”

Twelve people will be chosen to sit on the jury, plus two alternates, who will listen to all the evidence but not deliberate. Another two will be chosen as back-ups until the trial begins.

Magnotta, 32, faces five charges in connection with the May, 2012 death of Lin Jun, a Chinese national and 33-year-old Concordia University student. Magnotta was arrested in June 2012, and has been in detention ever since.

Jury selection continues Wednesday.

An additional four people — two who will be back-ups until the trial begins and two who will listen to all the evidence but not deliberate — will likely be chosen Friday.

If so, the trial will get underway Monday in room 5.01 of the Montreal courthouse.

So far, about 85 people — randomly chosen from the electoral list — have been called before Superior Court Justice Guy Cournouyer, although a handful have failed to appear.

Those present have had to answer several questions posed by defence lawyer Luc Leclair in order to determine their impartiality and fluency in French and English.

Magnotta faces five charges in connection with the May 2012 death of Lin Jun, a 33-year-old Chinese national and Concordia University student.

A translator, CEGEP professor, call-centre employee, retired financial planner and a woman who works in the bursary department at McGill University were added to the jury Thursday, but several candidates were rejected based on their pre-conceived ideas of the case.

“I don’t understand why there’s a trial for this,” said one man who works as a web designer. “There’s video proof he’s guilty so this is a waste of time.”

Another man said he didn’t want to be on the jury because he thought Magnotta was guilty.

“I’m too scared to disappoint members of my family and co-workers if he’s found not guilty,” he told the court.

Jury selection will continue Friday.

On Wednesday, a woman who does public relations for a firm was chosen after she told the court she believed everyone has the right to a fair trial. A university professor who teaches hospitality management was also chosen. He said he wanted to be on the jury because he saw it as his civic duty, like voting or paying taxes.

The first 12 people chosen will hear all the evidence throughout the trial, expected to last six to eight weeks. They will then deliberate in order to reach a unanimous verdict. Another two will hear all the evidence, but not deliberate. And the last two will serve as back-ups only until the trial starts, which could be as early as Monday.

Throughout the selection process so far, Magnotta has sat in the prisoner’s box, often with his eyes closed and sometimes sipping water. At times, he confers with his lawyer, Luc Leclair, about whether a candidate should be rejected as a juror.

The 32-year-old faces five charges, including first-degree murder, in connection with the May 2012 death of Lin Jun. Jun was a Chinese national who studied at Concordia University. Magnotta was arrested and charged in June 2012.

Two of the 24 candidates called to appear Wednesday didn’t show up, while others didn’t appear to be sufficiently bilingual. The trial will be held in English, but some witnesses will testify in French and some reports will be written in French.

A woman rejected Wednesday said she didn’t have an opinion on Magnotta or the case and wanted to hear the facts.

“I would like to know the five Ws,” she told the court. “Like how, when, why and where.”

An artist who makes miniature replica firearms and has a tendency to faint was also rejected.

Two people were released from duty by Superior Court Justice Guy Cournoyer Wednesday — a man who had a doctor’s note regarding his mental health and a military reservist who is being sent to Valcartier this weekend.

The selection process continues Thursday.

THE CANADIAN PRESS HO/THE CANADIAN PRESS

MONTREAL — First a foot, neatly packaged and labelled, was delivered by Canada Post to Conservative Party headquarters. Then a hand and foot — badly decomposed by the time they made their way across the country — were delivered to two Vancouver schools.

For about a week, the news headlines were filled with increasingly gruesome details, as the mystery of the body parts unfolded. Another hand discovered. The head. The torso.

Interpol was alerted, sparking an international manhunt.

On June 4, 2012, Ontario-born Luka Magnotta was arrested in an Internet café in Berlin.

On Monday, jury selection for what is sure to be one of the most closely watched trials since perhaps that of killer Paul Bernardo is to get underway at the Montreal courthouse.

With both the Crown and defence weighing in, 12 members of the public will be chosen to determine the fate of the 31-year-old accused as they sit through six to eight weeks of disturbing evidence.

Magnotta is charged with the first-degree murder of 33-year-old Lin Jun, a Chinese national who was studying engineering and computer science at Concordia University. He is also charged with committing an indignity to a body, publishing obscene material, criminally harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other Members of Parliament, and mailing indecent and obscene material.

Like all trials, this one will be open to the public. But the Quebec Superior Court room in which it is to be held has fewer than two dozen seats, so an overflow room will be available in which people can watch on a screen.

It will be up to Superior Court Justice Guy Cournoyer to decide how to manage the expected large numbers of journalists and onlookers.","2014-09-05 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","165.0","167.0","0.0","88.0","8.0","7.0","1","314","98.01","62.50","26.31","16.64","19.62","27.39","74.52","43.31","4.46","1.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.96","3.18","9.87","16.88","7.64","1.59","4.78","0.00","11.46","2.23","1.91","1.59","5.10","1.59","3.50","1.27","1.91","0.32","0.96","0.00","4.14","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.64","5.41","1.27","0.96","0.32","0.96","0.96","0.96","2.23","0.96","0.00","1.27","2.55","2.23","0.00","0.00","0.32","6.05","0.96","0.64","3.82","0.64","0.00","3.50","6.37","2.23","15.61","0.96","9.24","5.10","2.55","0.32","0.64","0.00","0.32","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.38","5.41","5.73","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","1479","9.04","19.625","474","310","15","58.92","13.5","10.2","11.66","12.4","86","6.666666666666667","21.376774193548385","206","17.88","8","0.42","0","9","13","33","0","40","19","1","0","5","43","49","0","15","0","0","5","1","11","0","1","0","13","0","11","9","8","15","1","7","2","2","0","1"

Lawyers in the case were in court Monday to argue various motions by the defence.



A temporary publication ban on the motions prevents the media from reporting their contents until Justice Guy Cournoyer rules on them. The hearings will continue on Tuesday.



Magnotta is charged with first-degree murder in the May 25, 2012 death of Lin Jun, a 33-year-old Chinese national who was studying engineering at Concordia University.



Magnotta, 31, sat in the prisoner’s box Monday, listening to the procedure. His hair was shaved close to his head and he appeared much heavier than when he was arrested two years ago.



His trial is set to begin Sept. 8. Besides the first-degree murder charge, he is also accused of committing an indignity to a body, publishing obscene material, criminally harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other MPs, and mailing indecent and obscene material.

"http://montrealgazette.com/sports/Alouettes/football/alouettes-knock-the-stuffing-out-of-roughriders/wcm/cf459a9f-61ff-4c99-bdca-65f22f12f6e5","Alouettes knock the stuffing out of Roughriders","MONTREAL — There was no way the Alouettes were going to lose on the day devoted to Anthony Calvillo.

And how ironic that on the day the organization retired the legendary quarterback’s number, the Als looked like the powerhouse team that dominated the Canadian Football League when Calvillo was in his prime.

Montreal won its third consecutive game Monday afternoon at Molson Stadium, defeating the Saskatchewan Roughriders 40-9 before a season-high crowd of 23,069. During halftime, a 24-minute ceremony was conducted in which Calvillo became the 10th player in franchise history to have his number retired. Former teammates Tracy Ham and Mike Pringle were among those who addressed Calvillo. The franchise also paid tribute to Calvillo with a red and white stripe, accompanied by his number, on the 13-yard lines at both ends of the field.

The Als improved their record to 6-8, moving into a three-way tie for first place in the East Division with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts. In the process, Jonathan Crompton improved his record to 5-1 as the team’s starting quarterback.

The defending Grey Cup champions, meanwhile, lost for the fourth time in five games since Darian Durant, their starting pivot, suffered an injury. Saskatchewan’s record now is 9-6.

The Riders actually scored first, taking advantage of a Duron Carter fumble in the first quarter that was recovered by Tristan Jackson at the Montreal 35.

That eventually led to an 11-yard touchdown pass from Tino Sunseri to Anthony Allen, who was wide open in the flat, at 11:19. But the Riders would never lead again.

The momentum of the game changed when Sunseri was hit by linebacker Chip Cox in the second quarter. Cox, the league’s outstanding defensive player in 2013, forced a fumble that was recovered by John Bowman at the Saskatchewan 25.

Three plays later, third-string quarterback Tanner Marsh scored on a one-yard run at 5:02. The play came after the Riders were called for pass interference.

Montreal took a 14-7 lead more than 10 minutes into the quarter. Crompton passed to Carter over the middle, and the wide-receiver outraced Saskatchewan defenders into the end zone. Carter extended himself on the play, making a nice reception.

Newcomer Chris Rainey, making his Montreal debut, returned the second-half kickoff 52 yards. The Als then went 67 yards in six plays, culminating in a 25-yard touchdown pass to Carter, his second of the game, at 2:54.

Carter outwrestled Rod Williams for the ball on the play, giving the Als a commanding 21-7 cushion.

After Chris Milo struck the crossbar on a 47-yard field goal attempt, Crompton passed 26 yards to Tyrell Sutton, replacing injured tailback Brandon Whitaker. That eventually led to the first of four Sean Whyte field goals, a 25-yarder, at 9:47.

On the Riders’ next possession, Allen fumbled the exchange with Sunseri. The ball was recovered by linebacker Winston Venable at the Saskatchewan 30-yard line.

Two plays later, Crompton connected with Brandon London, who was between two defenders, for a touchdown at 10:38, increasing Montreal’s lead to 31-7.

Whyte concluded the quarter with a 42-yard field goal at 14:23.

Montreal outscored the visitors 20-0 in the period.

Whyte conceded a safety four minutes into the fourth quarter before kicking a 25-yard field goal at 11:20. He added a 29-yarder at 13:45.

Crompton left the game in the fourth quarter, replaced by Alex Brink. Crompton unofficially completed 12 of 25 passes for 225 yards along with three touchdowns.

The Als meet the Argonauts on Saturday afternoon at the Rogers Centre.

"http://montrealgazette.com/sports/Alouettes/football/alouettes-to-rely-on-sutton-against-roughriders/wcm/7f8fea63-a633-4bb1-8ced-0972c106fefe","Alouettes to rely on Sutton against Roughriders","As much as every professional athlete wants to play, he’ll claim opportunity shouldn’t come at the expense of another who has been injured. Otherwise, he comes across as being selfish, and not a team player.

Tyrell Sutton has always felt a connection to Brandon Whitaker since his arrival in Montreal last season. Two men chasing the same job, which is perhaps why Sutton has felt a symbiotic relationship with the Alouettes’ starting tailback.

And so, it’s with mixed emotions that Sutton has taken his promotion to starter after the Als placed Whitaker on the six-game injured list late Friday afternoon. He broke two bones in his foot last Wednesday during an off-field workout. With five games remaining in the regular season, and the Als in no way guaranteed a playoff berth, Whitaker’s season might, in fact, be over.

“It’s very unfortunate. Anyone can tell you he (Whitaker) is one of my best friends. He’s like a brother of mine,” Sutton said Sunday, during an interview in the team’s Olympic Stadium dressing room. “I didn’t want to do this without him. I still don’t, but the game stops for nobody.

“Nobody wants to be a backup, but you play the role that you have. I’m not saying I was fine with it, but I was fine with it. There’s nothing wrong with Whit. There’s no reason for me to say I should be starting over Whit.”

But beginning Monday afternoon at Molson Stadium (1 p.m., TSN, RDS, TSN Radio-690) against the Saskatchewan Roughriders, that’s the role Sutton has been cast into. And he’ll be backed up by former Pittsburgh Steeler Chris Rainey, although he arrived only this week and had been on the practice roster.

Whitaker was second in the Canadian Football League in rushing yards, behind Calgary’s Jon Cornish, but has a history of injury problems. He tore his anterior cruciate ligament in 2012, and finished last season on the nine-game injured list after dislocating a shoulder and pulling his hamstring.

Sutton started the final three games, along with the East Division semifinal against Hamilton. He exceeded 100 yards in both games against the Tiger-Cats and completed the season with an impressive 6.2-yard average, gaining 342 yards on 55 carries.

“Everybody trusts Sutton. He can run. He can block. He knows the offence,” said offensive-tackle Jeff Perrett. “He’s a physical runner, straight downhill, and he’s not scared of contact. He’s not scared to be a blocker. He’s fast and has the whole package.”

At 5-foot-8 and 213 pounds, Sutton’s two inches shorter, but 13 pounds heavier than Whitaker. Sutton, who spent time in the NFL with Green Bay, Carolina and Seattle, started this season on the six-game injured list, having suffered a hamstring problem at training camp. The Als introduced a two-back system two months ago, at Saskatchewan. Sutton was dressed for Montreal’s last game, at Ottawa, but failed to play a down because of a rib injury.

Sutton, much like Mike Pringle –– who will attend a halftime ceremony Monday during which former quarterback Anthony Calvillo will have his number retired –– will gain his yards running over and through tacklers. He’s an aggressive ball-carrier compared to the elusive and shifty Whitaker.

“I don’t care. You hit me, you’re going to feel some kind of force behind it,” Sutton said. “We’re both quick, fast and very intelligent.”

Rainey, meanwhile, is a 5-foot-8, 190-pound back who gained nearly 2,500 yards at the University of Florida while scoring 13 touchdowns. He also proved competent catching the ball out of the backfield and is a versatile player who can return kicks, if necessary. He was the Steelers’ fifth-round draft pick in 2012 and was a first-team all-SEC all-star as a senior.

Despite his limited time with the Als, Rainey claimed he has been able to learn the entire offensive playbook.

“All you got to do is go to YouTube,” he said, laughing. “I’m not bragging, but I’ve got all my work on there. I’m still that kind of player –– a playmaker than can score from any place.

“I hope (the organization) sees something in me and I hope to show them.”

Rainey’s activation can be considered surprising, given his limited time in Montreal. The Als, arguably, might have selected Brandon Rutley, who returned to the practice roster Sept. 23 –– where he had spent most of the season before being released on Aug. 11. Rutley dressed for a July game at Vancouver.

“He (Rainey) brings a different dimension that, I think, will complement Tyrell as we move forward,” head coach Tom Higgins explained. “He has been impressive and looks quick.

“Right now, it made the most sense to put the possibility of a home-run hitter and see what he can do. He showed us enough.”

With Toronto’s last-minute comeback victory against Hamilton on Friday, the Als must defeat the defending Grey Cup champions to keep pace with both teams. Under that scenario, all three would sit at 6-8 with four games remaining. Three of those four Montreal games come against the Argonauts and Ticats.

“You can’t look at what everyone else is doing. Take care of our own business and we’re in,” Perrett said. “All the clichés are true in this case. As long as we keep winning and play like we have been, we’ll be fine.

“This is the situation we put ourselves in. We have to keep winning. Maybe it makes us play more desperate, which is a good thing. We have zero room for errors and mistakes.”

The Riders, meanwhile, might be 9-5, but are without their starting quarterback, Darian Durant. And they’ve lost three of four games since he underwent surgery in early September to repair a torn tendon in his right elbow. He’s eligible to return from the six-game injured list on Oct. 24.

Tino Sunseri is expected to start at quarterback.

Saskatchewan also will be missing left-guard Brendon LaBatte with an upper-body injury. LaBatte was the league’s outstanding lineman last year.

Notes: Tracy Ham, the quarterback whom Calvillo replaced, also is scheduled to attend the jersey retirement ceremony. To accommodate the proceedings, the halftime break’s expected to last 24 minutes, longer than normal. … LaBatte will be replaced by Dan Clark. … Als linebacker Kyries Hebert will miss his second consecutive game with a hamstring injury.

MONTREAL – Much has been made of Chad Johnson’s contribution – or lack of such – with the Alouettes this season.

The former NFL standout wide-receiver, who spent most of his career with the Cincinnati Bengals, returned to pro football this season, following his release from the Miami Dolphins in 2012. But Johnson has had little impact with Montreal, held to seven catches for 151 yards. He has scored one touchdown.

None of this should be surprising. The Als utilize Johnson at strong-side wide-receiver – the longest throw on the field for the quarterback – and have made little, if any effort, to move him around. In the one game he was scheduled to play slotback, at home against Edmonton, he suffered a concussion on the second play.

General manager Jim Popp, the man responsible for signing the 36-year-old, predictably has defended the move, suggesting it was never Johnson’s mandate to be the team’s saviour.

“When Jim Popp signed him,” Popp said, talking in the third-person, “it was to fit him into a very talented receiving corps – one on which S.J. Green and Duron Carter are the stars. I was trying (to find) another piece to the puzzle.”

Popp also knew he had an opening at receiver, since Jamel Richardson was coming off debilitating knee surgery and wouldn’t be ready for the start of training camp. Indeed, Richardson was released following camp and hasn’t resurfaced with another Canadian Football League club – yet to be medically cleared.

“If you look at the stats, you’d think he would have had more,” Popp said. “If you look at how many times he’s actually had a ball thrown to him, he wouldn’t have a lot more.

“We have a lot of weapons on offence; you can’t say we don’t.” . . .

In case you haven’t heard, veteran receiver Eric Deslauriers finds himself on the six-game injured list, having suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee. He suffered a similar injury in 2009, combined with a torn hamstring, forcing him to miss the Als’ Grey Cup victory against Saskatchewan.

Deslauriers has never been used extensively since joining Montreal in 2007. This season, he has 15 catches for 121 yards, but has yet to score a touchdown.

Potentially complicating matters is the fact Deslauriers is a potential free agent next February. He’s 33.

“This is an injury I came off before. I know how to handle it,” Deslauriers said earlier this week. “I jogged today and it felt good. I hope to be on the field faster than I think.

“You never want to be injured and I pride myself on being healthy. I haven’t missed a practice in five years. I was hoping to keep that going. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case.”

Deslauriers never has played with a brace since suffering his 2009 injury. He said he will when he returns this season – provided he returns. . . .

You’ve probably heard by now non-import Calgary running-back Jon Cornish won’t face the Als Sunday afternoon at Molson Stadium.

Cornish, the league’s reigning outstanding player and top Canadian, was concussed by Montreal linebacker Kyries Hebert on June 28, when the teams opened the regular season. The Stampeders said he’s resting some nagging injuries that have no correlation to his earlier head problems.

Hebert was fined by the CFL for the hit, having led with his head. He continues to maintain it wasn’t intentional. While he’s sorry Cornish missed a number of games, Hebert won’t apologize for the way he plays.

“I can’t apologize for how hard I hit a player. The fact he got injured on the play, it really looked bad,” Hebert said on Saturday. “It was a football play. It’s my job to get him on the ground. I did. Regretfully, there was contact with the head, which you never want.”

Hebert has suffered a concussion himself, so knows brain injuries are a serious matter.

“My intent wasn’t to injure,” Hebert said. . . .

News you need: As montrealgazette.com has previously reported, former Als slotback Ben Cahoon reiterated he and Popp had discussions last winter about joining Montreal as an assistant coach. Cahoon confirmed the scenario this weekend, when he returned to be inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.

Popp was under the assumption he would remain the Als’ head coach. The idea was Popp would hire an offensive co-ordinator and an offensive position would be found for Cahoon. The team instead, of course, hired Tom Higgins as its head coach.

Having said that, there was no guarantee Cahoon, who has already been through the coaching regime at Brigham Young University, his alma mater, would have accepted. He’s the father of four young girls and has a job back home, near Salt Lake City, in the medical supplies field. His coaching experience at BYU soured him, to an extent, on coaching. . . .

Although he compiled 254 regular-season victories as a head coach – the most in CFL history – Wally Buono, another Hall inductee, insists Don Matthews, not he, is the best coach the league has seen.

“I don’t measure it by wins,” Buono said. “Don did it a certain way, his way. I did it with two teams. He did it with five. He set the standard for great coaching. The fact I coached a year longer than him gave me a few more wins.”

Buono remains involved in the game, now serving as the GM of the British Columbia Lions. . . .

And finally, Als scratches against Calgary are Kenny Stafford and Dominique Ellis.

The Alouettes were leading Edmonton 16-12 early in the fourth quarter before the Eskimos erupted for three successive touchdowns in slightly less than 11 minutes.

It appeared to be a case of the Als’ defence, on the field for just over 37½ minutes, succumbing to attrition and breaking down. Nonetheless, a defiant Chip Cox vowed on Thursday history won’t be repeated this Sunday, against the Stampeders, at Molson Stadium.

“Do you think it’s going to happen again this week? Give us 40 minutes and I bet you it won’t happen again this week,” the strong-side linebacker, the Canadian Football League’s outstanding defensive player in 2013, stated following practice at Stade Hébert.

“We won’t let that happen again,” Cox continued. “Because we won’t. I can say that. This defence won’t let that happen again. We’re going to stand up. We’re going to put the team on our back. We’re going to take responsibility for everything.”

It won’t be easy, of course. The Stampeders (10-1) are the CFL’s best team and haven’t lost on the road this season. Even missing starting quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell and defensive-lineman Charleston Hughes, Calgary figures to be a formidable challenge. Drew Tate, who was the Stamps’ former starter, replaces the injured Mitchell.

“I don’t anticipate them changing how they play defensive or offensively,” Als head coach Tom Higgins said. “History has proven with that organization it doesn’t matter who’s playing. They seem to be able to be very productive.”

Productivity isn’t a word associated with the Als for the better part of two seasons. Montreal finished third in the East Division last year, at 8-10, and will be hard-pressed to match that mark as the team sits at 3-8. Indeed, even making the playoffs might be challenging, although the Als, Hamilton and Toronto all have three wins.

Losing might be part of football, but for veteran Als players, it remains a novelty.

“It has been tough, even last year,” offensive-tackle Josh Bourke said. “I’m not saying we can’t be great at some portion of the season, but we’re still trying to find our way — especially offensively. We have one decent game, then we struggle a little bit.

“We haven’t consistently been putting it together most of the season. Until we do, we’re just going to be an average to below-average offence.”

From breaking in an inexperienced offensive coordinator, Ryan Dinwiddie, to the shuffling of quarterbacks, little has worked for Montreal. And the numbers don’t lie. The Als have scored more points than only expansion Ottawa, more touchdowns than only the Redblacks. Montreal is last in the league in offence, averaging 267.5 yards per game. And the Als are ahead of only Ottawa in first downs.

Brandon Whitaker might be second in the CFL in rushing, with 605 yards, but Duron Carter potentially will be the Als’ only 1,000-yard receiver.

“We have vets everywhere on offence, slightly at quarterback. I don’t have excuses for you,” said slotback S.J. Green. “We just have to make the plays. Why aren’t we? Execution, lack of detail, attention to details, just not being locked in on the play at the time. I’m not saying guys aren’t focused, but obviously they’re not focused enough if they’re not making the play.”

The majority of Als players believe they’re still capable of escaping the abyss — Cox merely stating he hopes so — because they believe in each other and haven’t relinquished hope, because playing in a weak division leads to endless possibilities.

Of course, what else are they supposed to say?

“All we can go off is what we have in our locker room, the game plan and the trust we have in each other,” Green said. “Outside sources really don’t matter to us. Whether you guys (in the media) believe we can turn it around or not, we really don’t care.

“All we have is us, and we know that.”

Sunday’s game coincides with the Canadian Football Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Three former Als — slotback Ben Cahoon, offensive-tackle Uzooma Okeke and linebacker/punter Wally Buono, now the B.C. Lions’ general manager — are among this year’s entrants, with festivities beginning Friday night. Next month, during a game against Saskatchewan, quarterback Anthony Calvillo will have see number retired.

Cahoon, Okeke and Calvillo were part of great Montreal teams not so long ago. Teams that won, had glory and dominated. It was a tradition. It was the Als’ way. But that mystique has disappeared in the span of two years.

“I’m sure they’d be pissed off. They would see the product we put on the field every week and they’d be ashamed to wear an Alouettes jersey. I would be, too,” Green admitted. “I hope we can make them proud, put some wins together and make a playoff push.”

In a season where wins have been few and far between, Montreal must take its victories where it can — in any shape or form.

The Als won for the third time in four games Sunday afternoon at Molson Stadium, defeating the Calgary Stampeders, 31-15, before 19,892 spectators. The Stamps were missing quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell, running-back Jon Cornish, leading receiver Marquay McDaniel and defensive-lineman Charleston Hughes.

Montreal improved to 4-8, keeping pace in the East Division with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts, both of whom defeated West Division teams this weekend. The Ticats are in first place, with a 4-7 record, while both the Argos and Als have identical marks — although Toronto has defeated Montreal once this season.

Calgary saw its six-game unbeaten streak come to an end, although the Stamps still hold the Canadian Football League’s best record of 10-2.

The game coincided with the Canadian Football Hall of Fame’s annual induction ceremony — former Als Ben Cahoon, Uzooma Okeke and Wally Buono among this year’s recipients.

Following a scoreless opening quarter, the Als went on a 10-play, 78-yard drive, capped by Tanner Marsh’s one-yard run at 1:06. Earlier in the drive, Jonathan Crompton completed a 27-yard pass to S.J. Green. The other significant play was a 22-yard completion to Duron Carter, moving the ball to the Calgary three-yard line.

Sean Whyte’s 50-yard punt single at 5:24 increased Montreal’s lead to 8-0. Stamps’ punter Rob Maver got that back with an 85-yard punt single at 6:58.

But the Als then went on a methodical seven-play, 75-yard drive to take a two-touchdown lead.

Crompton connected with James Rodgers for a 19-yard gain on the drive. Two plays later, coincidentally following two runs by Tyrell Sutton — ignored last week at Edmonton — Crompton hooked up with Rodgers for an 18-yard touchdown pass at 10:20. Rodgers broke a tackle on the play.

But the visitors went on a 12-play, 67-yard drive before halftime. Drew Tate, who was replacing Mitchell, gained 15 yards on the drive and capped the possession with a one-yard run, off play-action, for the touchdown at 14:37, sending the teams to their dressing rooms with the Als nursing a 15-8 lead.

Last week, Calgary overcame a 29-3 first-half deficit against Toronto. And it appeared history might be repeated when the Stamps scored on their opening possession of the third quarter, requiring only five plays to go 54 yards.

The significant play was a 39-yard pass to Maurice Price, who beat Billy Parker on the play, moving the ball to the Montreal six-yard line.

Tate then scored on a quarterback draw at 3:17, tying the score.

But the Als retained their composure under first-year starter Crompton.

Whyte’s 18-yard field goal late in the quarter capped an impressive drive — albeit one Montreal couldn’t complete — giving the home team an 18-15 lead.

A 19-yard punt return by Rodgers to begin the fourth quarter gave the Als good field position at the Calgary 45. Five plays later, and following a 20-yard run by Brandon Whitaker, Crompton passed 10 yards to Carter for a touchdown at 3:21.

Carter beat cornerback Quincy Butler on the play.

Montreal had a 10-point lead but wasn’t finished, Whyte’s 34-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter proving to be a much-needed insurance score. Whyte added a 27-yarder at 12:18.

Both Sutton and defensive-tackle Michael Klassen sustained injuries for the Als. Klassen was taken off the field on a Gator, having suffered an injury to his left knee, it appeared.

The Als’ next game is this Friday night, at Ottawa.

How about the fact they were also without tailback Jon Cornish? All he did last season was capture the Canadian Football League’s outstanding player award while also being named the top Canadian.

Marquay McDaniel? Calgary’s leading receiver. Charleston Hughes? The team leader in quarterback sacks.

This also might be a good time to remind readers of this space nothing upsets a professional athlete more than the suggestion his squad just beat an inferior team.

“I couldn’t care less who they play. Obviously, everyone has injuries,” said Josh Bourke, the Alouettes’ hulking offensive-tackle. “Cornish played a pretty damned good game last week. I don’t know what his situation was … nagging injuries? That’s what they’re saying. We’re not really concerned. They have two other running backs that are both professionals that are capable. Did they miss him? I’m sure they did.

“And Drew Tate’s got plenty of experience in this league. He’s had quite a bit of success. I don’t see a huge drop-off at the quarterback position.

“It’s a win –– and we’ll take it.”

Indeed. While the Als’ 31-15 victory was impressive, it must be kept in perspective. The Stampeders have depth, but Calgary didn’t field its strongest team. Tate was this team’s starter at one point, before sustaining injuries. But he’s the backup now, and clearly displayed why he has been cast in a supporting role.

He completed only 50 per cent of his passes, good on 15 of 30 attempts for a modest 152 yards. And he was intercepted once. Many of his throws almost looked like knuckleballs, his receivers unable to dig them out of the dirt. Calgary had the ball barely more than 23 minutes, generating only 15 first downs and 267 yards’ net offence.

Nonetheless, after leading his team to touchdowns late in the second quarter and another to begin the third period, Tate and the Stampeders were tied 15-15 with Montreal. The Als’ defence didn’t allow a point through the game’s final 26:43.

That was impressive, especially following the unit’s meltdown at Edmonton in their last game, the Eskimos scoring three consecutive touchdowns in the fourth quarter, erasing Montreal’s 16-12 lead.

“It was a statement. We know we didn’t perform in the fourth and we wanted to come out and do all we could not to blow it again,” said defensive-tackle Alan-Michael Cash, who recovered a pair of fourth-quarter fumbles.

In the days leading up to the game, linebacker Chip Cox told The Gazette the defence would carry the team this week –– even if the unit spent 40 minutes on the field. There wasn’t going to be another meltdown.

There could have been, when the score was tied.

“I think (last week’s performance) had a lot to do with it,” Cox said on Sunday. “We were in the same position last week and we blew it as a defence. We blew it. We’ve yet to finish a game, strong, while we were up.”

The Als have now, outscoring the visitors 13-0 in the final period. That fourth-quarter play was a regular occurrence, especially at home, when Anthony Calvillo was directing the huddle in the good old days, which now seem like a distant memory.

“There’s multiple signs that, all of a sudden, we’re getting where we want to be. I’ll take that (fourth quarter) as a sign,” said head coach Tom Higgins, showing some rare emotion when the game ended, pumping his fists in the air. “There’s no quit in the athletes. They have a lot of pride. It’s a challenge when you make so many changes. We’re going in a direction we feel is positive.

“The advantage you have, when you’re on the sideline and with the group, you know when there’s panic. There was no panic. They kept playing and made things happen. It’s easier to take when you know how the athletes are responding. You can let your mind wander if you want. But it’s easy to stay in the moment.”

The Als have now reached the two-thirds mark of this marathon with a 4-8 record. They’ve finally climbed above .500 at home, now at 4-3, but have yet to win on the road –– so plenty of issues remain.

But this team responded and met its challenge. Montreal took the field knowing both Toronto and Hamilton had won earlier this weekend. The Als knew they required a victory to keep pace, although they sit third in the East Division despite all three teams having won four times.

The Als have six games remaining –– two at Ottawa against an expansion team that pretty well loses every game but remains competitive; two against Toronto, one home and away; a home game against Saskatchewan, which has lost starting quarterback Darian Durant, and the season finale at Hamilton, a match that potentially looms large.

If you’re looking for signs in the tea leaves, the Tiger-Cats still have a game in hand while the Argos, who have played their last four on the road, still have five games remaining at the Rogers Centre with only six to play.

“I think all of the players would have known we wanted to stay on par with Toronto and Hamilton,” Higgins said.

"http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/arts/what-to-see-at-the-jazz-fest-wednesday","What to see at the jazz fest Wednesday","MONTREAL – A quick look at five noteworthy shows Wednesday at the Montreal International Jazz Festival, which wraps up July 6:

Matt Andersen and the Mellotones (7 p.m., Club Soda, 1225 St-Laurent Blvd., $36). The award-winning New Brunswick native showcases his new album, Weightless, featuring impassioned vocals complemented by sunny folk/blues guitar.

Zappa Plays Zappa (8:30 p.m., Metropolis, 59 Ste-Catherine St. E., $40 to $68.55). Few musicians can hope to accurately re-create Frank Zappa’s mind-frying compositions, but son Dweezil has the exceptional genes, talent and bandmates required to keep his father’s legacy alive.

The London Souls (9 and 11 p.m., Loto-Québec Stage, de Montigny and Clark Sts., free). The New Yorkers marry a love of vintage British rock with classic pop hooks, and come armed with a fiery live rep.

Randy Weston and Billy Harper (9:30 p.m., Cinquième Salle of Place des Arts, $52). Weston, whose piano style bears the influence of Thelonious Monk, and sharp-toned saxophonist Harper, who has played with Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers and Max Roach, team up in support of their album The Roots of the Blues.

Of Montreal (11 p.m., Club Soda, $37). Kevin Barnes and his genre-straddling Athens, Ga., psychedelic polymaths return to their spiritual home.

"http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/the-revenge-of-dr-porter","The Revenge of Dr. Porter?","Arthur Porter, the former head of the McGill University Health Centre who is facing extradition to Canada to face fraud, breach of trust and money laundering charges, has been held in a Panamanian jail for more than a year. During that time he says he’s been treating himself for stage four lung cancer, tear gassed and injured in a prison riot and, every now and then, proclaimed his innocence and vilified his accusers via his ongoing blog Illegal in LaJoya, a reference to the name of the infamous jail where he is being incarcerated. But now it seems that Dr. Porter has also found the time to write what ostensibly is a memoir but what might also be perceived a list of allegations against those who were associated with him in happier days. Entitled “The Man Behind the Bow Tie”, the work purports to detail Porter’s relations with, among others, Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Quebec premier Philippe Couillard. Is this a work of history? Of fiction? Is it revenge? The Gazette’s Aaron Derfel has been reporting on the triumphs and travails of Porter’s career and read his latest work. We asked him what he made of Porter’s version of events. Click on the audio player below to hear what he had to say.

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20140107-michael-schumacher-accident-ski-coma-amelioration-sante-formule-1","L'état de santé de Schumacher s'améliore légèrement","Lueur d’espoir pour Michael Schumacher. L’état de santé de l’ancien pilote Ferrari serait ""en légère amélioration"", selon les propos d’une proche du septuple champion du monde de Formule 1. Schumacher ne serait plus en ""danger de mort immédiate"".

Les nouvelles sur l’état de santé de Michael Schumacher évoluent quotidiennement au centre hospitalier universitaire de Grenoble. Selon le Journal du Dimanche, le pilote allemand aurait passé un scanner le 4 janvier qui aurait été jugé ""très mauvais"" par les médecins. Cet examen aurait provoqué une ""légitime inquiétude"". Le cerveau de l'ancien pilote de Formule 1 a en effet déjà été endommagé en février 2009 après un accident de moto. Son artère vertébrale gauche qui alimente le cervelet a été brisée.

Mais les dernières nouvelles se veulent plus rassurantes. L’état de santé de ""Schumi"" s’est en effet légèrement amélioré lundi, notamment grâce à un nouveau protocole de traitement. À en croire le quotidien allemand Bild, les médecins de l’hôpital de Grenoble seraient eux-mêmes désormais confiants quant aux chances de survie de l’ex-pilote Ferrari. Une proche du septuple champion du monde de Formule 1 a, de son côté, indiqué à l'agence allemande SID que le pronostic vital de Schumacher était toujours engagé, mais que son entourage avait l'espoir qu'il s'en sorte.

Conférence de presse des enquêteurs mercredi à 11h

Dans le coma, Michael Schumacher est hospitalisé à Grenoble depuis une chute à ski survenue dimanche 29 décembre dans la station de Méribel, où il possède un chalet. L’Allemand de 45 ans est tombé sur des rochers alors qu'il skiait entre deux pistes balisées dans la station savoyarde. Les circonstances de l’accident font actuellement l'objet d'une enquête.

Le parquet et les gendarmes ont justement annoncé qu'ils tiendraient une conférence de presse mercredi 8 janvier à 11h (heure de paris) au palais de justice d'Albertville. Cette conférence doit porter sur l'état d'avancement de la procédure.

Les enquêteurs ont mis la main vendredi sur la caméra GoPro fixée sur le casque de Schumacher au moment de l'accident. Selon une source proche du dossier, la caméra fonctionnait et les images sont exploitables. Cette source n'a pas précisé en revanche si les images tournées permettaient de préciser les conditions de la chute de Schumacher, notamment la vitesse à laquelle il skiait avant que sa tête ne percute un rocher dans un secteur situé hors des pistes balisées. Par ailleurs, un steward allemand de 35 ans a affirmé au magazine Der Spiegel avoir filmé par hasard le pilote au moment de son accident. Selon ce témoin, Schumacher avançait ""à une vitesse maximale de 20 km/h"".

Les suites judiciaires éventuelles dépendront des conclusions des enquêteurs sur les circonstances de la chute. Avec notamment pour enjeu le versement éventuel de dommages et intérêts, qui peuvent s'avérer conséquents dans le cas d'une personnalité telle que Michael Schumacher.

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20140129-michael-schumacher-reveil-coma-f1-accident-ski-formule-1","Vers une sortie de coma pour Michael Schumacher ?","Un mois très exactement après son grave accident de ski, Michael Schumacher est toujours en soins intensifs à l'hôpital de Grenoble. Selon plusieurs médias français, le septuple champion de Formule 1 serait désormais en phase de réveil progressif.

Un mois tout juste après avoir été victime d’un grave accident de ski sur le domaine de Méribel (Savoie), le 29 décembre, l'ayant conduit a être plongé dans un coma artificiel, l’incertitude demeure sur l’avenir de Michael Schumacher.

Dans le dernier bulletin de santé, publié le 17 janvier, l'état de Schumacher y était qualifié de ""stable"" et non plus de ""critique"" comme le 6 janvier. Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD), citant des ""sources hospitalières non autorisées"", a indiqué le 26 janvier que ‘Schumi’ était en phase de réveil progressif. Toujours selon le JDD, l’Allemand pourrait se réveiller avec des ""pertes fonctionnelles"", sans préciser leur nature.

Michael #Schumacher est bien en phase de rÃ©veil. — Antoine Arlot (@antoinearlot) January 29, 2014

L’information est aussitôt démentie sur RTL par le professeur Gérard Saillant, ami du pilote, qu’il l’a qualifiée de ""complètement fausse."" Pour autant, c’est au tour de l’Équipe, mercredi 29 janvier, d’annoncer que Schumacher venait ""d'être placé en phase de réveil progressif.""

Les médecins décident généralement de la sortie du coma artificiel, une fois que la pression dans la boîte crânienne est redevenue basse et stable. ""Quand on enlève doucement la sédation et que la pression reste correcte, cela détermine l'arrêt complet du coma artificiel"", explique à l'AFP le Pr Gérard Audibert, responsable de l'unité de réanimation neurochirurgicale du CHU de Nancy. Le patient revient alors à son ""état de base clinique"". Il peut rester dans le coma, cela arrive, ou se ""réveiller"" progressivement.

Des séquelles très graves

À la sortie du coma artificiel, les médecins sont attentifs aux réactions du patient. ""On va tester pour voir si on arrive à communiquer avec lui, s'il répond aux stimulations verbales, avec des ordres du type ‘serrez-moi la main’, ‘fermez ou ouvrez les yeux’"", explique le Pr Audibert.

Interrogé par RTL.be, Steven Laureys, neurologue au CHU de Liège, se montre très prudent quant à l’issue de ce réveil. ""Les séquelles après un traumatisme comme cela sont très graves. Les chances de retrouver le patient comme il a été avant sont quasi inexistantes.""

Un avis partagé par Gary Hartstein, ancien délégué médical de la F1. Sur son blog, ce spécialiste en anesthésie et en médecine d'urgence indique : ""Il est extrêmement peu probable que le Schumacher que l'on connaissait avant l'accident revienne. Il faudra considérer comme un triomphe de la résistance humaine le fait qu’il soit encore en mesure de marcher, de se nourrir, de s'habiller, et de conserver certains aspects significatifs de sa personnalité.""

Après la phase de réveil, ""la route peut être encore très longue et on a vu des patients s'améliorer entre un et trois ans après un accident"", explique à l’AFP le Dr Bernard Vigué, anesthésiste-réanimateur au CHU de Bicêtre. ""Le temps au bout duquel le patient peut récupérer de son accident sur le plan neurologique, et la qualité de cette récupération restent impossibles à pronostiquer avec certitude aujourd'hui"", selon le Pr Jean Mantz, chef du département d'anesthésie réanimation à l'hôpital parisien Bichat-Beaujon-Louis Mourier. Selon le Pr Audibert on peut être fixé sur le handicap définitif consécutif à un traumatisme crânien environ deux ans après l'accident.

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20140130-michael-schumacher-phase-reveil-coma-formule-1-f1-accident-ski","Michael Schumacher en phase de réveil","Michael Schumacher entame un ""processus de réveil"" plus d’un mois après avoir été plongé dans un coma artificiel à la suite d'un grave accident de ski survenu à Méribel (Savoie). Le processus ""pourra durer longtemps"", a prévenu sa porte-parole.

Plusieurs médias français l’annonçaient. C’est désormais officiel. Le septuple champion de Formule 1, Michael Schumacher, se trouve en phase de réveil progressif, plus d’un mois après avoir été plongé dans un coma artificiel à la suite d'un grave accident de ski survenu à Méribel (Savoie).

Les sédatifs administrés au pilote allemand, toujours en soins intensifs à l'hôpital de Grenoble, sont ""depuis peu diminués, afin d'entamer un processus de réveil, qui pourra durer longtemps"", a déclaré, jeudi 30 janvier, sa porte-parole Sabine Kehm dans un communiqué.

Celui-ci confirme les informations du ""Journal du Dimanche"" (JDD), qui, citant des ""sources hospitalières non autorisées"", indiquait le 26 janvier que ‘Schumi’ était en phase de réveil progressif. Toujours selon le ""JDD"", l’Allemand pourrait se réveiller avec des ""pertes fonctionnelles"", sans préciser leur nature. Une information corroborée par le quotidien ""l’Equipe"" dans son édition du mercredi 29 janvier.

Des séquelles très graves

Les médecins décident généralement de la sortie du coma artificiel, une fois que la pression dans la boîte crânienne est redevenue basse et stable. ""Quand on enlève doucement la sédation et que la pression reste correcte, cela détermine l'arrêt complet du coma artificiel"", explique à l'AFP le Pr Gérard Audibert, responsable de l'unité de réanimation neurochirurgicale du CHU de Nancy. Le patient revient alors à son ""état de base clinique"". Il peut rester dans le coma, cela arrive, ou se ""réveiller"" progressivement.

À la sortie du coma artificiel, les médecins sont attentifs aux réactions du patient. ""On va tester pour voir si on arrive à communiquer avec lui, s'il répond aux stimulations verbales, avec des ordres du type ‘serrez-moi la main’, ‘fermez ou ouvrez les yeux’"", explique le Pr Audibert.

Interrogé par RTL.be, Steven Laureys, neurologue au CHU de Liège, se montre très prudent quant à l’issue de ce réveil. ""Les séquelles après un traumatisme comme cela sont très graves. Les chances de retrouver le patient comme il a été avant sont quasi inexistantes.""

Fixé sur le handicap définitif deux ans après l'accident

Un avis partagé par Gary Hartstein, ancien délégué médical de la F1. Sur son blog, ce spécialiste en anesthésie et en médecine d'urgence indique : ""Il est extrêmement peu probable que le Schumacher que l'on connaissait avant l'accident revienne. Il faudra considérer comme un triomphe de la résistance humaine le fait qu’il soit encore en mesure de marcher, de se nourrir, de s'habiller, et de conserver certains aspects significatifs de sa personnalité.""

Après la phase de réveil, ""la route peut être encore très longue et on a vu des patients s'améliorer entre un et trois ans après un accident"", explique à l’AFP le Dr Bernard Vigué, anesthésiste-réanimateur au CHU de Bicêtre. ""Le temps au bout duquel le patient peut récupérer de son accident sur le plan neurologique et la qualité de cette récupération restent impossibles à pronostiquer avec certitude aujourd'hui"", selon le Pr Jean Mantz, chef du département d'anesthésie-réanimation du groupe hospitalier parisien Bichat-Beaujon-Louis Mourier. Selon le Pr Audibert, on peut être fixé sur le handicap définitif consécutif à un traumatisme crânien environ deux ans après l'accident.

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20140424-formule-patron-formule-bernie-ecclestone-juge-corruption-allemagne-munich","Le patron de la F1 Bernie Ecclestone jugé pour corruption","Le procès de Bernie Ecclestone, controversé patron de la Formule 1, s'est ouvert le jeudi en Allemagne. Le milliardaire est accusé d'avoir versé 44 millions de dollars de pots-de-vins à un banquier en vue de conclure la vente des droits de la F1.

Bernie Ecclectone est apparu décontracté, jeudi 24 avril, lors de son arrivée au tribunal de Munich où il est jugé à partir pour corruption. ""J'ai confiance, le soleil brille', a-t-il déclaré aux journalistes avec un sourire.

Le patron de la Formule 1 risque pourtant jusqu'à 10 ans de prison s'il est reconnu coupable lors de ce procès. Le milliardaire, ancien pilote automobile, est accusé d'acoir versé 44 millions de dollars (31,8 millions d'euros) au banquier allemand Gerhard Gribkowsky en 2006 et 2007, qui travaillait pour la banque publique bavaroise Bayern LB, en vue de conclure la vente des droits de la F1 au fonds d'investissement CVC Capital Partners. Ce dernier avait racheté à l'époque pour 839 millions de dollars les droits de la F1 détenus jusque-là par Bayern LB.

Pots-de-vin ou chantage?

Dans cette affaire, Bernie Ecclestone, surnommé ""Napoléon"", a toujours clamé son innocence. Il affirme avoir été victime d'un chantage. En juin 2012, lors du procès de Gerhard Gribkowsky pour corruption et fraude fiscale pour n'avoir pas déclaré les millions versés, le patron de la F1, entendu comme témoin, avait certes reconnu cette somme. Mais il s'agissait, selon lui, du ""prix du silence"" à payer pour que M. Gribkowsky ne fasse pas de révélations au fisc britannique sur son patrimoine. La fortune personnelle personnelle de Bernie Ecclestone est en effet estimée autour de quatre milliards d'euros.

Ce procès, dont les audiences sont déjà programmées jusqu'à mi-septembre, pourrait avoir des répercussions sur le monde de la Formule 1. ""S'il est démontré que M.Ecclestone a commis quelque chose de pénalement répréhensible, nous le limogerons"", a ainsi prévenu en 2013 Donald Mackenzie, co-fondateur de CVC, devant la Haute Cour de juste britannique. M. Ecclestone est le directeur général de la société Formula One Group, détenue par le fonds CVC Capital Partners.

Ce n'est pas la première fois que Bernie Ecclestone se retrouve dans la tourmente. En 2005, il avait dû s'excuser après des remarques sexistes sur les femmes pilotes. Quatre ans plus tard, il avait aussi créé la polémique en qualifiant Adolf Hitler ""d'efficace"".

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20140804-russie-etats-unis-poutine-sanctions-bourbon-mcdonalds-union-europeenne-embargo","L’embargo, l’ultime arme de Poutine face aux sanctions internationales","Depuis le durcissement des sanctions occidentales contre Moscou, les autorités russes décrètent chaque jour un nouvel embargo sur des produits en provenance d'Europe ou des États-Unis. Une guerre au grand dam des consommateurs.

""Tenir un homme par le ventre."" Cet adage, la Russie a décidé de le mettre en pratique, en interdisant des produits européens et américains sur son territoire. Depuis le durcissement des sanctions à son encontre, le Kremlin a décidé de répliquer en visant directement les assiettes. Lait, fromage, oignons d’Ukraine, pêches de Grèce, prunes de Serbie, pommes et choux de Pologne, viande d’Espagne… Ce n’est désormais plus dans le sud de l’Ukraine que la Russie dégaine ses armes, mais sur le terrain commercial.

Et à chaque jour suffit son produit interdit, sous couvert de motifs sanitaires et de ""protection des consommateurs"". Selon Rosselkhoznadzor, l’agence sanitaire russe, tous ces produits contiennent des substances nocives, sont infectés par de dangereuses bactéries ou ne respectent pas les normes réglementaires.

Lundi 4 août, c’est le bourbon fabriqué aux États-Unis qui risque de rejoindre les fruits et légumes polonais, déjà interdits vendredi. ""Des phtalates, qui peuvent provoquer des bouleversements fonctionnels et organiques dans le système nerveux central et périphérique, dans le système endocrinien, ainsi que le cancer et des problèmes d'infertilité chez les hommes et les femmes, ont été trouvés dans"" ce whisky américain, indique l'agence sanitaire russe.

""Il s’agit en réalité bien évidemment d’une réaction aux sanctions, c’est la continuité de la politique par d’autres moyens. Toutes ces mesures ressemblent à une vengeance contre des pays perçus comme hostiles"", explique l’économiste russe Konstantin Kalachev, interrogé par l’AFP.

Un régime 100 % russe

Les consommateurs, qui pensaient échapper au conflit opposant l’Ukraine à la Russie, le retrouvent finalement dans leur assiette. Les Russes pourraient ainsi devoir dans quelques jours consommer du 100 % russe, ou du russe ""friendly"".

""Outre leurs effets économiques, ces mesures ont un effet plus large de propagande : l’autarcie pour la Russie et la substitution de ses importations par une production domestique, estime Konstantin Kalachev. Ces mesures sont soutenues par la majorité de la société russe car la population n’a pas l’impression d’en souffrir.""

La Russie est souvent accusée d’utiliser l’arme commerciale, notamment en invoquant des motifs sanitaires, comme moyen de pression diplomatique sur ses voisins. Si le pays figure parmi les premiers producteurs mondiaux de lait, de pommes de terre ou de céréales (25,4 millions de tonnes de céréales exportées cette année), les supermarchés de Moscou regorgent aussi de produits alimentaires importés.

Pas sûr, donc, que les Russes acceptent longtemps de troquer leur bourbon pour de la vodka. Et leur McDo pour un bœuf Stroganoff. Le géant américain de la restauration rapide est en effet dans le collimateur des autorités sanitaires russes, qui ont demandé devant la justice l'interdiction de plusieurs de ses produits en raison d'""infractions sur les normes de sécurité et de valeur énergétique"".

""Le ministre des microbes étrangers""

La raison évoquée par les autorités russes pour ces interdictions est toujours la même - la protection des consommateurs et la santé de la population -, à l’exclusion de tout motif politique.

""Quelle décision politique ? L’Ukraine est un pays où il y a la guerre, où la sécurité des citoyens ordinaires n’est pas assurée, où des gens sont tués. Ils n’ont pas de produits de qualité. Pourquoi devrions-nous importer de la viande, par exemple, [d’animaux] qui ont été tués par des tirs de mortier ?"" a lancé, mercredi, Nikolaï Pankov, responsable du Comité parlementaire sur l’agriculture.

En invoquant des motifs purement sanitaires pour ses interdictions, l'agence sanitaire russe rapproche sa rhétorique de celle de l’agence russe de protection des consommateurs, dont l’ancien chef Guennadi Onichtchenko a été ironiquement surnommé par la presse ""ministre des microbes étrangers"", lors de conflits commerciaux précédents.

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20140909-michael-schumacher-hopital-lausanne-suisse-soins-gland-sante-paralyse-formule-1","Michael Schumacher quitte l'hôpital de Lausanne","L'ancien pilote allemand de Formule 1 Michael Schumacher a quitté l'hôpital de Lausanne, où il était soigné et poursuivra ses soins à son domicile de Gland, en Suisse, a annoncé mardi son entourage dans un communiqué.

L’ex-champion de F1 Michael Schumacher va poursuivre son traitement à son domicile de Gland en Suisse, après avoir quitté l’hôpital de Lausanne, a annoncé sa famille dans un communiqué, mardi 9 septembre. ""La réhabilitation de Michael continuera depuis la maison. Au cours des semaines et des mois passés, il a fait des progrès par rapport à la gravité de sa blessure, mais un long et dur chemin se trouve devant lui"", souligne la porte-parole de la famille, Sabine Kehm, qui ne précise pas quand exactement l’ancien champion de Formule 1 a quitté l’établissement.

Michael Schumacher avait violemment heurté un rocher de la tête, le 29 décembre 2013, en skiant en compagnie d'un groupe d'amis dans la station de Méribel, en France. Le 17 février, le parquet avait classé sans suite l'enquête sur cet accident, excluant toute responsabilité d'un tiers, la famille conservant la faculté d'agir au civil. Sorti du coma en juin alors qu’il se trouvait au CHU de Grenoble, il avait été admis à l’hôpital universitaire de Lausanne.

Àgé de 45 ans, Michael Schumacher a remporté 91 Grands Prix et sept titres de champion du monde. Il avait définitivement mis fin à sa carrière professionnelle en 2012.

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20140908-somalie-soldats-union-africaine-ua-nouveau-accuses-abus-sexuels-viols-human-right-watch","Somalie : des soldats de l’Union africaine de nouveau accusés d’abus sexuels","Elles sont 21 femmes et jeunes filles somaliennes à avoir été violées ou sexuellement exploitées par des militaires servant dans les forces de l’Union africaine à Mogadiscio. Dans un rapport accablant de Human Rights Watch, elles témoignent.

Dix dollars. C’est la somme que de jeunes somaliennes, parfois âgées d’à peine 15 ans, ont reçue de la part de soldats de l’Union africaine (UA) après avoir été violées, dénonce Human Rights Watch, dans un rapport à charge publié lundi 8 septembre.

Des médicaments, de la nourriture, de l’eau… En confiance, elles étaient venues chercher de l’aide dans l’une des deux bases de la Mission de l’Union africaine en Somalie (Amisom). ""Il a commencé par arracher mon hijab, et puis il m’a agressée."" Qamar, 15 ans, était allée à la base du contingent burundais à Mogadiscio pour obtenir des médicaments pour sa mère malade. Un interprète somalien lui a alors demandé de suivre deux soldats pour avoir ces produits. Ils l’ont emmenée dans un coin isolé, et l’un des soldats l’a violée. Alors qu’elle partait, le deuxième soldat burundais lui a tendu 10 dollars.

D’autres, affamées, n’ont pas connu meilleur sort. En mai 2013, Kassa a été présentée à un interprète somalien au camp de base de l’Amisom dans l'espoir d'obtenir un peu de nourriture. ""J’étais inquiète, a-t-elle raconté. J’ai voulu m’enfuir en courant, mais je savais que la raison qui m’avait amenée ici me permettrait de surmonter ce moment – ma faim. J’avais fait un choix, et je ne pouvais plus reculer."" Après avoir eu des rapports sexuels avec un soldat ougandais, elle a reçu la même somme des mains de l’interprète. Dix dollars.

Par l'intermédiaire d'interprètes, ces soldats - venus d'Ouganda, du Burundi, ou encore de Sierra Leone - ont ""exploité la pauvreté et le manque de nourriture des femmes pour obtenir des relations sexuelles"", dénonce l’ONG. ""Les femmes et les jeunes filles qui viennent chercher de l’aide dans les camps de l’Amisom de Mogadiscio le font au prix de risques importants"", conclut Human Rights Watch, dans son rapport de 81 pages, intitulé ""Le pouvoir que ces hommes ont sur nous : exploitation et abus sexuels commis par les forces de l’Union africaine en Somalie"".

Vingt-et-une femmes violées ou sexuellement exploitées

""Elles ne devraient pas avoir à vendre leur corps pour que leur famille puisse survivre"", s’insurge Daniel Bekele, directeur de la division Afrique à Human Rights Watch. Et de prévenir qu’une ""nouvelle crise alimentaire s'annonçait dans les camps de personnes déplacées"".

Pour ce rapport, qui rassemble des informations sur l’exploitation et les abus sexuels subis par des femmes et des jeunes filles somaliennes dans deux bases de l’Amisom de Mogadiscio, depuis 2013, Human Rights Watch a rencontré 21 femmes et jeunes filles. Elles racontent avoir été violées ou sexuellement exploitées par des militaires ougandais ou burundais servant dans les forces de l’UA. Des dires confirmés par plus de 30 témoins, observateurs étrangers, soldats et responsables de pays contributeurs de troupes.

""Les pays contributeurs de troupes, l'Union africaine et les bailleurs qui financent l'Amisom devraient se pencher urgemment sur ces abus et renforcer les procédures en Somalie pour que justice soit rendue"", a estimé l'ONG de défense des droits de l'Homme.

Urgemment, car l'Amisom, déployée depuis 2007 en Somalie où elle appuie les fragiles autorités de Mogadiscio dans leur combat contre les islamistes shebab, n’en est pas à son premier crime sexuel.

Des viols en série

Mi-août 2013, la mission ouvrait une enquête sur une accusation de viol en réunion d'une Somalienne par certains de ses soldats. La victime aurait été enlevée, droguée et violée à plusieurs reprises début août à Maslah, dans la banlieue nord de Mogadiscio.

En février de cette même année, la victime d’un viol similaire et le journaliste à qui elle s'était confiée avaient été condamnés à de la prison ferme pour ""outrages aux institutions"". Face au tollé au sein de la communauté internationale, leurs condamnations avaient ensuite été annulées par la justice somalienne.

""L'Amisom est au courant des accusations portées contre ses soldats"", avait alors admis la Force africaine dans un communiqué. Depuis, l’enquête, elle, est toujours en cours…

""L’UA ne peut plus fermer les yeux sur les exactions commises dans les bases de l’Amisom, car cela nuit à la crédibilité même de cette mission"", a prévenu Liesl Gerntholtz, directrice de la division Droits des femmes à Human Rights Watch. ""Les gouvernements qui la soutiennent devraient œuvrer avec l’UA pour mettre fin aux abus sexuels et à l’exploitation des femmes et des jeunes filles somaliennes par leurs soldats, prendre des mesures contre ceux qui y participent, et faire tout leur possible pour prévenir de nouveaux cas d’abus et d’exploitation sexuelle des femmes somaliennes à l’avenir"", enjoint-il.

Pour lutter contre ces violences sexuelles, véritable fléau lors des conflits en Afrique, les accords conclus entre l’ONU et l’Union africaine, tout comme les conférences et les ""condamnations fermes"" de la communauté internationale ne semblent rien y faire. Le mandat de l’Amisom a quant à lui été prorogé par le Conseil de sécurité jusque 2016. Les élections générales dans le pays sont prévues la même année et la mission de maintien de la paix mise en place par l’Union africaine devrait ainsi quitter la Somalie à l’issue de son mandat.

France 24 n’est toujours pas parvenu à joindre l’Union africaine ou l’Amisom.

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20140924-islam-otage-editorial-sylvain-attal-herve-gourdel-syrie-irak-organisation-etat-islamique-ei","L’islam en otage","François Hollande a confirmé, mercredi, l'assassinat de l'otage français Hervé Gourdel, enlevé dimanche 21 septembre en Algérie par un groupe jihadiste ayant prêté allégeance à l'organisation de l'État islamique. Éditorial.

""Hervé Gourdel est mort parce qu’il était Français"", a dit François Hollande en rendant hommage au touriste assassiné en Algérie, mercredi 24 septembre. Un choc probable à venir en France, et de multiples défis. Comment y faire face ?

L’assassinat de l'otage Hervé Gourdel, par les émules algériens de l’organisation de l'État Islamique, n’est hélas pas une surprise. Visiblement, ce nouveau groupe baptisé ""Soldats du califat"" se devait de faire preuve rapidement du zèle pour crédibiliser son allégeance à la dernière ""franchise"" jihadiste ayant le vent en poupe.

Selon les premières informations dont nous disposons, la vidéo de revendication du groupe jihadiste lié à l'organisation de l’État islamique, ""message de sang pour le gouvernement français"" s’inspire d’ailleurs scrupuleusement des mises en scène macabres de l’EI. Il n’y a donc pas eu la moindre volonté de négociation. Ce crime était en quelque sorte le gage d’adhésion à l’organisation. La participation française aux bombardements en Irak était une occasion parfaite.

Dans ces conditions, le sort réservé au malheureux touriste français pourra donner le sentiment aux hésitants, ici en France, que le gouvernement a en connaissance de cause exposé ses ressortissants aux foudres des terroristes. C’est d’ailleurs un des ressorts de la terreur, comme l’a souligné François Hollande : répandre la peur pour faire craquer le front intérieur, montrer que l’ennemi n’a pas de base solide dans son action, face à des guerriers d’Allah, forcément soudés et qui ne craignent pas la mort.

Que peut-on opposer à cela ?

D’abord appeler un chat un chat : un assassinat n’est pas une ""exécution"", terme impropre que trop de medias emploient encore pour qualifier ce genre de forfait.

Rappeler que ces meurtriers ne sauraient se réclamer de la qualité de ""soldats"", puisque c’est ainsi qu’ils se nomment eux-mêmes. Des soldats n’assassinent pas de sang froid des civils innocents.

Exiger ensuite qu’en ces circonstances, l’union nationale se manifeste partout. Toute critique du gouvernement français à des fins politiciennes serait absolument indigne.

Rappeler que les terroristes (ceux d’Aqmi, du GIA avant que l’organisation de l'EI ne se fasse connaître) n’ont pas attendu cette dernière intervention pour tuer des Français. On rappellera ici le sort des moines de Tibéhirine, ou de Michel Germaneau et Philippe Verdon au Mali.

Dénoncer enfin la stigmatisation de la religion musulmane, des musulmans dans leur ensemble, qui risque d’être un exutoire facile pour certains esprits faibles mais qui est irresponsable de la part d’un élu comme le maire de Nice, Christian Estrosi, qui parle ""d’ennemi de l’intérieur qui se prépare dans les caves et les garages"". Jeter ainsi le soupçon sur toute une population n’est pas faire preuve de lucidité sur l’attirance pour le jihad de trop de jeunes musulmans français.

Éviter en même temps toute forme de relativisme : le gouvernement estime à environ un millier le nombre de Français partis faire le jihad en Syrie. Si l’on s’en tient là, cela ne fait que quelques dizaines, une centaine peut-être, d’individus susceptibles de revenir en France avec des intentions menaçantes. Même s’il y a eu des cafouillages et des ratages, les surveiller n’est pas hors de portée des services de renseignement et de sécurité. Le danger pour la cohésion de la nation française est ailleurs.

Beaucoup trop de Français musulmans répugnent à condamner clairement les agissements de ces groupes terroristes, invoquant trop facilement un ""deux poids deux mesures"". L’absence de condamnation des bombardements américains ou israéliens qui tuent aussi des innocents, en Afghanistan, en Irak ou à Gaza. Quel rapport avec les persécutions de minorités, les viols, les décapitations en masse de chrétiens, de Kurdes, Yazidis ou musulmans chiites ?

Les organisations membres du CFCM ont, fait sans précédent, condamné unanimement l’EI et ont dit en termes très clairs que ces criminels ne sauraient se réclamer de la religion musulmane. Mais on peut malheureusement douter de la représentativité du CFCM. Dans ces conditions, on peut tout à la fois dire que nul ne saurait exiger des musulmans qu’ils manifestent en masse contre les assassins jihadistes et en même temps qu’une telle initiative, sur le mode du hashtag #notinmyname serait le désaveu le plus cinglant à ceux qui prennent l’islam en otage.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20140203-eu-corruption-levels-breathtaking-home-affairs-malmstroem-bulgaria","EU corruption 'breathtaking', home affairs chief says","Corruption across the European Union's 28 countries costs some €120 billion ($162 billion) per year – a ""breathtaking"" sum equal to the bloc's entire annual budget, EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem said Monday.

""The extent of the problem in the EU is breathtaking,"" Malmstroem wrote in an op-ed piece in Swedish newspaper Goeteborgs-Posten.

Malmstroem said the estimate, amounting to a little less than 1 percent of the bloc's total economic output, could be ""much higher"".

In presenting the first such European Commission report, Malmstroem emphasised the figure was ""an estimation"" and said the actual amount is ""probably ... much higher"".

""Corruption undermines faith in democratic institutions, drains the legal economy of resources and is a breeding ground for organised crime,"" she wrote.

Malmstroem called on member states to do more to stamp out the problem, saying: ""The price of not acting is simply too high.""

The report does not rank countries nor suggest legal remedies, with Malmstroem saying that steps actions could follow talks with member states.

""No 'corruption-free' zone in EU""

But ""one thing is very clear – there is no 'corruption-free' zone in Europe"", she said.

While Malmstroem refused to point the finger at any particular country, the EU has had longstanding concerns about corruption in Bulgaria and Romania, especially over their use of EU funds, and both were put under a special monitoring mechanism when they joined the bloc in 2007.

The report said that ""fighting corruption has long been a priority for Bulgaria"" but that despite the country's best efforts, the problem ""remains widespread"".

A poll found 84 percent of Bulgarians agreed corruption is prevalent while last year there were large demonstrations against the government's ties with wealthy oligarchs.

The Commission ""suggests that Bulgaria should shield anti-corruption institutions from political influence and appoint their management in a transparent, merit-based procedure"".

In addition, the Commission ""is suggesting that a code of ethics is adopted for members of the National Assembly"".

In Romania, ""both petty and political corruption remains a significant problem"", the report said, adding that efforts to address the issue have been inconsistent.

The Commission suggested Romania should ensure truly independent corruption investigations and develop ""comprehensive codes of conduct for elected officials"".

A poll showed that 93 percent of Romanians agree that corruption is widespread, the report said.

Finland, Denmark top of class

Among the other member states, the report named Denmark and Finland as top performers on the corruption index.

The report said that in France, ""corruption-related risks in the public procurement sector and in international business transactions have not been addressed"" sufficiently.

Germany, the bloc's largest economy, ""is amongst the best countries of the EU"", the Commission said. However, it said Berlin ""would benefit from the introduction of strict penalties for corruption of elected officials"".

Picking up on an issue attracting a lot of domestic attention, it also suggested Germany should develop a policy to deal with the ""revolving door"" phenomenon, where officials leave office to work for companies they may have recently helped.

Malmstroem said Sweden ""is among the countries with the least problems"".

She said research showed that one in 12 EU citizens had experienced corruption in the past year, while four out of 10 companies regard it as ""an obstacle for doing business within the EU"".

The report reviews how existing laws and policies work and suggests what further effort could be made.

Malmstroem singled out public procurement, notably tenders for construction projects, as a major cause of concern.

Graft watchdog Transparency International welcomed the report, saying it marks ""an important step in the EU's collective effort to scale up its anti-corruption efforts"".

""It is a stark warning against complacency about corruption in any EU country,"" it added.

The report did not cover corruption in the EU's own institutions, with the bloc's finances reviewed by the separate Court of Auditors.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20140306-french-built-warship-destined-russia-crimea-crisis-mistral-test-run","France will not halt Russian warship sale despite Ukraine crisis","One of the two French-built Mistral-class warships purchased by Russia got its first test run on Wednesday in western France. Despite the crisis in Crimea, Paris said it was not yet ready to scrap its €1.2 billion deal with Moscow.

Despite France’s vocal diplomatic efforts on behalf of Ukraine, Paris still plans to supply Russia with two Mistral-class helicopter carriers to strengthen Moscow’s navy.

The “Vladivistok” helicopter carrier set sail at sunset from the French Atlantic port of Saint-Nazaire for a three-day sea trial. The 22,000-tonne warship is capable of deploying up to 450 soldiers, helicopters and tanks in amphibious assaults.

French deal attacked back in 2011

France agreed in 2011 to sell two Mistral-class helicopter carriers to Russia, attracting criticism from several NATO allies afraid of Russia’s military resurgence in the wake of the 2008 Georgian war.



As the French shipbuilder floated out the ""Vladivostok"" on Wednesday, senior diplomats from Russia, Ukraine, the US, and leading Western powers met in Paris to try to bring an end to the crisis.

Despite the deployment of thousands of Russian troops in Crimea, France’s Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on Monday that the crisis had not reached the point where France would consider halting the sale of warships to Russia.

Asked on RTL radio whether France would scrap the deal, Fabius said: ""We aren't there. For the moment we are trying to stop the Russian movement in Ukraine and maintain, or rather, establish dialogue.""

Hurting its own interests

France’s reluctance to use the sale as a bargaining chip cast doubt in some circles on Paris’s determination to use tough economic sanctions to force Russia’s hand over the Ukrainian crisis.

However, Philippe Migault - an expert on Russia and the arms industry at the Paris-based IRIS think tank - told FRANCE 24 that, “a signed contract is a signed contract.”

“Any delay or cancellation in the Mistral deal means that the shipbuilder would have to pay fees. This deal also safeguards a lot of jobs in Saint-Nazaire”, said Migault.

The lucrative deal has been heavily criticised by several US lawsmakers, who feared that the Mistral-class warships delivered to the Russians would include the highly-prized NATO communication and weapons systems.

No transfer of sensitive technology

However, the French shipbuilder has since confirmed that the communication system would be fitted “only if the Russian navy receives NATO approval”.

“This deal doesn’t involve any transfer of sensitive technology. Also, France sells the helicopter carrier, but it doesn’t sell the helicopters that go with it”, said Migault.

The arms industry expert also believes that the delivery of these two helicopter carriers would not significantly further tip the balance of power in the Black Sea for the Russians.

The “Vladivostok”, whose delivery to the Russian navy is set for the last quarter of 2014, is to join Moscow’s Pacific fleet. Its sister ship “Sevastopol”, still under construction, is named after the Crimean strategic harbour at the centre of the current Ukrainian crisis.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20140508-ukraine-donetsk-rebels-referendum-autonomy","Ukraine separatists ignore Putin’s call to postpone referendum","Pro-Russian activists on Thursday anonymously voted to go ahead with a referendum over the independence of a separatist-held region in Ukraine’s east, ignoring Russian President Vladimir Putin's call to delay the controversial vote.

“We have just voted in the People’s Council...The date of the referendum was endorsed by 100 percent. The referendum will take place on May 11,” Denis Pushilin, the self-declared leader of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, said.

Putin on Wednesday urged the separatists to pospone the vote.

Ukraine’s government and its Western allies have urgently sought to halt the referendum since they fear the referendum could lead to a repeat of Russia’s recent annexation of Crimea, albeit on a much larger scale.

The United States and European Union – which have so far imposed only limited sanctions targeting Russian nationals and small firms because of Moscow’s meddling in Ukraine’s crisis – have threatened to impose much wider sanctions on Russian industry if Moscow takes further steps to interfere in Ukraine.

Sunday’s planned referendum was seen as a potential trigger for such sanctions.

The prospect that further sanctions might be imposed has already hurt Russia’s economy indirectly by scaring investors into pulling out capital and forcing the central bank to raise interest rates to protect the rouble.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20140531-defeated-candidate-hamdeen-sabahi-contests-egypt-election-result-al-sisi","Defeated candidate Sabahi contests Egypt election results","The defeated candidate in Egypt’s presidential election, which saw a landslide victory for former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, appealed Friday against the result, saying election rules had been broken.

Leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi, the only candidate to stand against Sisi, won just 3 percent of votes in the country’s three-day poll, according to judicial sources, compared to 93 percent for the retired field marshal, though official results have yet to be released.

Sabahi conceded defeat on Thursday, but his campaign said in a statement Friday it has made a legal complaint to the elections committee objecting to “the existence of campaigning inside polling stations” by Sisi supporters, among other abuses.

It also appealed to the committee to nullify all votes cast on the third day of polling.

Authorities extended voting by one day at the last minute on Tuesday, an extraordinary measure that observer missions said raised questions about the integrity of the electoral process although it was not an illegal move.

The measure was designed to increase turnout, with authorities fearing a low level of participation would prevent the winner being handed a strong mandate.

Nevertheless, turnout was estimated at just 46 percent. Sabahi had previously questioned the validity of even that modest figure, calling it “an insult to the intelligence of Egyptians”.

The election took place against the background of a crackdown against supporters of Morsi, deposed as president by the army last July, which has seen his Muslim Brotherhood outlawed, hundreds killed and thousands arrested.

Sisi led the overthrow of Morsi after mass protests against his rule. Sabahi came third in 2012 elections that brought Morsi to power as Egypt’s first freely elected leader.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20140603-egypt-sisi-presidential-election-landslide-victory","Egypt's Sisi sweeps presidential poll in landslide victory","Egypt’s former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was declared the winner of the 2014 presidential election on Tuesday with a landslide 96.91% of the vote.

Official results of last week’s vote was announced by the country’s election commission late Tuesday and came as no surprise in a country where the opposition has been severely crushed.

Turnout was about 47% of Egypt's 54 million voters, the commission said - less than the 40 million votes, or 80% of the electorate, that Sisi had called for.

The results, and the swearing in on Sunday, crown the rise of the retired field marshal, who last summer ousted Egypt’s first democratically elected president, the Islamist Mohamed Morsi.

Over the past few months, Sisi has led a crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood supporters of Morsi's Islamist supporters. The former army chief has vowed to restore stability and repair the dilapidated economy after three years of turmoil.

Only opponent already conceded defeat

Leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi, the only candidate to stand against Sisi, conceded defeat last week, but his campaign said in a statement Friday it has made a legal complaint to the elections committee objecting to “the existence of campaigning inside polling stations” by Sisi supporters, among other abuses.

Authorities had extended voting by one day at the last minute, an extraordinary measure that observer missions said raised questions about the integrity of the electoral process although it was not an illegal move.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20140610-sponsors-voice-concerns-over-fifa-corruption-allegations","Sponsors voice concerns over FIFA corruption allegations","A growing number of FIFA sponsors, including Budweiser beer, Adidas, Sony and Visa, have voiced concerns over allegations of corruption surrounding the awarding of the 2022 tournament to Qatar.

The calls, which have been growing since Sunday, came as former US prosecutor Michael Garcia was due to finish an investigation on behalf of FIFA, soccer's ruling body, into the decisions to hold the Cup to tiny Qatar in 2022 and Russia in 2018.

With the World Cup kicking off in soccer's spiritual home Brazil this week, FIFA is struggling to contain the fallout from claims that bribery helped Qatar to secure the showpiece event.

Garcia is due to submit his report to FIFA in around six weeks' time - roughly a week after the World Cup final in Rio de Janeiro on July 13.

If he finds that there was corruption involved, soccer officials say Qatar could be stripped of the 2022 Cup.

Both Qatar and Russia have denied any wrongdoing.

Qatar's bid, in particular, has been the subject of media leaks alleging that the former head of soccer in Asia, a Qatari, bribed colleagues around the world to help secure the bid.

The former official, Mohamed Bin Hammam, has declined to comment. He has been banned from football for life over separate corruption allegations.

Sponsors who pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the ""halo effect"" of associating their brand with the World Cup have broken with protocol and publicly demanded that FIFA get to the bottom of the corruption claims.

""We are concerned about the situation and are monitoring developments; we expect FIFA to take all necessary steps to address the issue,"" brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev said in a statement. Its Budweiser beer has signed up as a World Cup tournament sponsor until 2022.

No soccer tradition in Qatar

Qatar's bid has attracted controversy from the outset because of the extreme summer heat during the months when the Cup is played, and the tiny country's lack of a domestic soccer tradition.

If it goes ahead, the tournament is expected to be switched to a date later in the year, creating costly scheduling headaches for broadcasters and European soccer clubs.

Sony, Adidas, Visa, Coca-Cola and Hyundai, all members of the top tier of FIFA sponsors, spoke out on Sunday in favour of a thorough investigation of bribery claims. Of the top-tier sponsors, only Qatari carrier Emirates airlines was silent.

It is unusual for sponsors to say anything publicly on such a sensitive issue. All of the sponsors had kept resolutely quiet until Sunday.

Scores of international soccer delegates are assembling in Brazil ahead of the World Cup for a FIFA congress, at which its long-serving chief, Sepp Blatter, is expected to announce he is seeking another term. Blatter has made clear he voted against Qatar's bid and preferred to hold the 2022 World Cup in the United States.

""The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,"" said German sportswear company Adidas, which has signed up as FIFA sponsor until 2030, extending a partnership dating back to 1970.

FIFA’s huge advertising income

FIFA, which Blatter has led since 1998, earned almost $1.4 billion last year, including more than $600 million from the sale of broadcasting rights and more than $400 million from sponsors and other marketing partners.

""If FIFA is being seen as corrupt or poorly governed, then this image begins to transfer on to sponsors,"" said Simon Chadwick, professor of sport business strategy and marketing at Coventry University in central England.

Football’s popularity around the globe makes it hard for sponsors to turn their back on the game because rivals will swiftly move in to replace them, added Chadwick.

Wasserstrom took his complaint to the UN's oversight office. He was arrested, sacked from his job, investigated and treated like a pariah by an employer he had loyally served for three decades.

During his seven-year ordeal, Wasserstrom found UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon ""unhelpful"". ""I was informing him all long of what I though were missteps"", he says, ""and he didn’t intervene when he could"".

But the US diplomat found a powerful ally in his own government. A bill passed by Congress in January forces the State Department to withdraw 15% of US funding from any UN agency that fails to establish protection for employees who expose corruption.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20141201-moldova-pro-europe-parties-poised-win-parliamentary-majority","Pro-Europe parties poised to win Moldova elections","Moldova’s three main pro-Europe parties appeared on Monday to be able to form a new coalition with most of the vote from an election on Sunday counted, despite the pro-Moscow Socialist Party taking first place.

With 87 percent of the vote counted, according to the election authorities, the three parties - the Liberal Democrats, the Liberals and the Democrats - had a combined vote of 44 percent - enough to win a majority in the 101-seat parliament.

This was in spite of the pro-Russia Socialist Party taking a surprise lead with 21.5 percent of the vote and the communists, who wish to revise part of a trade deal with the European Union, taking third place with 17.8 percent.

A three-party coalition, led by Prime Minister Iurie Leanca’s Liberal Democrats, has piloted one of Europe’s smallest and poorest countries along a course of integration with mainstream Europe since 2009, culminating in the ratification of a landmark association agreement with the EU this year.

Sunday’s vote took place in the shadow of a separatist war in neighbouring Ukraine triggered by it following similar pro-Europe policies that set it on a collision course with Moscow.

Pre-election surveys showed deep division over whether ex-Soviet Moldova should stick to the pro-Europe path pursued for the past five years or move back into Russia’s orbit.

This, together with the coalition’s poor record of fighting corruption and conducting deep reform, as well as Russian pressure on Moldova to change course, had raised questions over the coalition’s ability to hold on to power.

“The three (coalition) parties, whose strategic aim is European integration, will have no difficulty in forming a ruling majority even without the help of the parties of the left,” said analyst Oazu Nantoi, director of the Institute of Public Policies political research centre.

He predicted they would be able to muster 54 seats in the new parliament, a comfortable majority in the assembly.

Figures released by election authorities, with 87 percent of the vote counted, gave the Liberal Democrats 19.2 percent of the vote, the Democratic Party 15.8 percent and the Liberal Party 9.4 percent.

The strong vote for the socialists, whose leader Igor Dodon is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, reflected a deep reluctance among many to diminish the close, historic relationship with Russia, the main supplier of energy - and also a fear of the consequences.

They had campaigned against the westward movement of Moldova and in favour of the Russia-led Customs Union economic bloc.

Moldova’s breakaway pro-Russian enclave of Transdniestria gives Russia a potential springboard for action in the landlocked country of 3.5 million, wedged between war-torn Ukraine and EU member Romania.

Moscow though has so far shown no readiness to intervene. But it has shown its displeasure by banning imports of wines, vegetables and meat from an economy which relies on agricultural exports.

Many analysts say that with Moldova already gaining from the EU deal - its citizens can travel visa-free to Western Europe - the pro-European drive will be difficult to reverse.

Prime Minister Leanca has said he wants full European Union membership for Moldova by 2020.

The Communist Party had been expected to recover its old position as the dominant force of the left, but the Socialists appeared to have made inroads into its vote.

“The communists changed their position too much in relation to the European Union and the Customs Union, whereas the socialists positioned themselves as the one pro-Russian party,” said political analyst Vitalie Andrievschii.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20141201-most-wanted-nazi-war-criminal-died-syria","Most-wanted Nazi war criminal ‘died in Syria’","A Nazi war criminal who topped most wanted lists for his part in the Holocaust is ""almost certain"" to have died in Syria four years ago, a Nazi-hunting group said Monday.

""I am almost certain that he's no longer alive,"" Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's Jerusalem office, told AFP.

Zuroff said that according to a German intelligence officer Alois Brunner ""died four years ago in... Damascus,"" where he had fled seeking refuge decades ago.

The Wiesenthal Centre ""could not confirm the information"" for certain, he stressed, but given the 1912 birth year of Brunner, the unrepentant ""right-hand man"" of leading Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann, he was in any case unlikely to be alive.

Brunner topped the Simon Wiesenthal list of wanted Nazis for deporting tens of thousands of Jews to death camps during World War II, although he was removed this year due to his age and almost certain death, Zuroff said.

After the war Brunner escaped detection by taking on a false identity and worked for two years for the US occupying forces in Germany, before fleeing to Egypt in 1954 and from there to Syria, where he was protected by successive regimes.

He was pursued by Nazi hunters and survived assassination attempts allegedly by Israel's secret intelligence service, the Mossad.

""In Brunner's case, he got two letter bombs. He lost three fingers, he lost an eye, so I'm sure that didn't contribute to his (good) health,"" Zuroff said, in a veiled allusion to the Mossad.

French investigators, trying to call Brunner to account for crimes committed during the occupation of their country, lost track of him in 1992 in Damascus, where he had been living under an assumed identity.

""He was responsible for the deportation to the death camps of 128,500 Jews,"" Zuroff said -- including 47,000 from Austria, 44,000 from Greece, 23,500 from France and 14,000 from Slovakia.

""He was a fanatic anti-Semite, a sadist and a person who was totally dedicated to the mass-murder of European Jewry.""

"http://www.france24.com/en/20140109-french-senators-pass-anti-amazon-law-protect-small-retailers","French senators pass ‘anti-Amazon’ law to protect small retailers","In a bid to protect France’s independent bookshops, the French Senate on Wednesday night approved a bill that would ban online book retailers from offering free delivery.

France has long protected small booksellers. Since 1981, a law has banned discounts on new books of more than five percent of the cover price, which effectively stops large chains from engaging in aggressive price wars with their smaller rivals.

But with huge growth in online sales, especially from Amazon, the game has changed.

Traditional booksellers in France claim Amazon and other web-based retailers are subjecting them to unfair competition by offering new books with a five-percent discount as well as free shipping.

The bill passed by the Senate, which was approved by France’s lower house of parliament in 2013, will forbid companies like Amazon from shipping to France for free.

Put forward by the centre-right opposition UMP party, the bill tweaks one clause in the existing 1981 legislation, forbidding retailers from offering the discount and free shipping at the same time.

It has enjoyed rare near-universal support across the political spectrum, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate. With the additional amendment, the bill now goes back to the National Assembly for final approval.

France has one of the highest number of traditional book shops in the world – with a total of 3,500, of which around 800 are single independent businesses.

This compares with the United Kingdom – which has less than 2,000 bookshops – whose numbers are being steadily eroded by web competition.

In France, book sales have slumped, with a 4.5 percent drop in 2012 compared to the previous year, according to government figures.

Data also showed that 17 percent of all book purchases in France were now online, and that figure was growing. In 2003, it was just 3.2 percent.

The new legislation is also unlikely to be the last of Amazon’s woes in France. Culture Minister Aurélie Filippetti has blasted the online retail giant for dodging French taxes by basing its operations in Luxembourg, and has said the government is looking at new ways to tax online players such as Amazon and Google.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20140205-usa-lawmakers-push-disqualify-french-rail-sncf-holocaust-role","US lawmakers take aim at French rail for Holocaust role","Two US lawmakers are pushing to disqualify a subsidiary of France’s national railway company from bidding for a €4.4 billion US contract over its role in deporting Jews to Nazi death camps during World War II.

State Senator Joan Carter Conway has introduced a bill in Maryland’s state legislature that would ban the Keolis transport firm, whose majority stakeholder is France’s national railway company SNCF, from bidding on a €4.4 billion contract.

Conway and fellow Democratic lawmaker Samuel Rosenberg say Keolis should be kept out of the bidding process unless SNCF compensates the families of Holocaust victims.

Several US lawmakers have in the past called on the SNCF to take responsibility for its role in the transport of 76,000 Jews from France to Nazi death camps.

“SNCF’s refusal to fully acknowledge its role in the Holocaust and its recent attempt to rewrite history is insulting to its victims and deeply troubling,” Conway has said.

The bid concerns a 25-kilometre stretch of railway in the East Coast state.

Discrimination against French firm

Alain Leray, president of SNCF America, told the AFP news agency that the company would examine the bill to determine whether it discriminated against the French firm.

In the past, SNCF has resisted pressure to take direct responsibility for the deportation of Jews to Auschwitz and other death camps, claiming it had been requisitioned by the Vichy regime that collaborated with the German occupiers.

But in 2010 the company's chairman, Guillaume Pepy, met in Florida with US representatives and Jewish community groups to express his regret for SNCF's wartime role.



Pepy said he wished to share ""his profound pain and regret for the consequences of acts ... carried out under order"".

In 2011 the French company reiterated its remorse, saying it had been “forced to act as a cog in the Nazi extermination machine”.

But it has so far refused to pay compensation to Holocaust survivors and the families of the victims.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20140304-cameron-porn-law-advisor-resigns-over-child-sex-images","Cameron's porn-law aide quits after arrest over child sex images","A senior aide to British Prime Minister David Cameron has resigned after being arrested on suspicion of child pornography offences, Downing Street confirmed on Monday.

Patrick Rock, 62, who helped draw up guidelines on internet porn filters, was arrested by officers from the National Crime Agency last month.

“On the evening of February 12, Downing Street was first made aware of a potential offence relating to child abuse imagery,” said a Downing Street spokesman. “It was immediately referred to the National Crime Agency.

“Patrick Rock was arrested at his home in the early hours of February 13, a few hours after Downing Street had reported the matter. The Prime Minister was immediately informed and kept updated throughout,” he added.

“This is an ongoing investigation so it would not be appropriate to comment further, but the Prime Minister believes that child abuse imagery is abhorrent and that anyone involved with it should be properly dealt with under the law.”

It was reported that police have searched information systems and offices at Downing Street.

Rock was an adviser to the Conservative party for 30 years.

A friend of Cameron told the “Daily Mail”, which uncovered the arrest, that the prime minister was “extremely shocked”.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20140109-dakar-rally-protest-chile-damage-archaeological%20-sites-argentina-ecuador","Dakar Rally runs into angry detractors in Chile","As the Dakar Rally snakes its way across South American deserts, activists in Chile are denouncing the negative impact of the world’s most famous off-road vehicle race on precious archaeological sites.

The race has seen its share of controversy ever since it was launched in France 35 years ago, and its shift from European and African terrain to a South American backdrop in 2009 has only created new disputes.

This week, as fans gathered to see the race rumble through Argentina’s barren northwest, one prestigious Chilean archaeology group saw its complaint against the Dakar dismissed by the country’s Supreme Court in Santiago.

It was the only legal challenge before the courts in Chile, where the motor race is scheduled to finish on January 18, but the row between the competition’s organisers, local authorities and angry activists looks set to drag on.

'Destruction with impunity'

Critics deplore the heavy carbon emissions of the competing 4x4 cars and motorbikes, as well as the damage caused to archaeological sites in the regions crossed by the Dakar Rally.

Paola Gonzalez, vice-president of the College of Archaeologists of Chile, a non-profit dedicated to protecting the country’s landmarks and leading the campaign “No al Dakar”, told FRANCE 24 that over 250 sites classified as historic monuments have been damaged by the international race in the past six years.

An ancient geoglyph in Chile's northern desert allegedly damaged during a previous Dakar Rally.

“In Chile, a national monuments law considers this a punishable crime,"" Gonzalez told FRANCE 24. “Nevertheless, the destruction with impunity of our national heritage continues.”

Gonzalez, who laments the loss of what she calls the country’s “non-renewable memory,” says part of the problem is a legal stalemate between two official government institutions in Chile.

“Under normal circumstances, the Council for the State's Defence (CDE, its acronym in Spanish) would prosecute those responsible for the destruction of national monuments.""

“But the problem is that the Dakar is co-organised by Chile’s National Sports Institute [and the French company Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO)]. The CDE is powerless to act because it cannot turn against another public entity,” the archaeologist said.

Enough safeguards?

Contacted by FRANCE 24, ASO rejected claims by the Chilean archaeologists' group that the race is responsible for damaging precious historic sites.

“In Chile, as in every country we race through, we abide by a simple rule: we completely comply with local legislation,"" said ASO’s Grégory Murac, the director of relations between the Dakar and host countries.

“The process is also straightforward,” Murac continued. “First, we suggest a racecourse to the countries involved. They study it and make recommendations, which we accept. Once this is done, we go there with experts appointed by local authorities to conduct a study of the entire racecourse.”

Murac said that reports are prepared for each stage of the race, with appropriate safeguards taken well before drivers ever start their engines.

Gonzalez retorts that the “safeguards” are laughable since the Dakar has so far been allowed to regulate itself. “In the end, archaeological sites are ‘protected’ by two metal rods linked by a band of coloured plastic,” she fumed.

But ASO’s Murac said the archaelogists have failed to provide evidence to back their claims, a view shared by the Chilean Supreme Court when it dismissed their lawsuit earlier this week.

Ecuador says no

Despite this outcry against this year’s Dakar, many observers also counter that the race is a valuable opportunity to promote Chile’s economy and its image abroad.

Gonzalez is quick to dispute this point as well.

“The financial benefits that come with the Dakar are relatively limited. Every year Chile spends 4.4 million euros just to host the race. And there are additional costs related to the logistics of the competition that go beyond that sum,” she noted.

Indeed, some South American countries have passed on the opportunity to host the Dakar. Ecuador, which considered hosting several special stages in 2015, declined the offer last year citing environmental concerns and high costs.

As in Chile, several citizen groups in Argentina are starting to organise opposition to the competition. Seven Argentinian environmental groups in November 2013 petitioned the Santa Fe province legislature to support a bill that would outlaw the race in the region.

Meanwhile, the hashtag #bastadeldakar (#nomoredakar) has been launched by activists on the social media site Twitter.

However, despite the growing opposition, the Dakar does not appear to be under any serious threat in the near future.

High-ranking ministers in both Argentina and Bolivia have recently hailed the “hard work” of local organisers in bringing the Dakar to their countries, and the benefits of highlighting their countries' landscapes and cultures to global audiences through the race.

Even in Chile, the Dakar is likely to speed ahead. President elect Michelle Bachelet, who won elections late last year, first welcomed the the Dakar in 2009 with open arms.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/interview-want-to-improve-conditions-for-women-in-my-constituency-congress-candidate-sandeep-dikshit-1974597","Want to improve conditions for women in my constituency: Congress candidate Sandeep Dikshit","Sandeep Dikhsit, 49, is a Congress MP from East Delhi constituency from where he will be seeking re-election for the 16th Lok Sabha. He has also worked as deputy chief whip and chief whip. Before he joined politics, he headed a social development group. He hails from a political family. His mother Sheila Dikshit was the former chief minister of Delhi, and his grandfather Uma Shankar Dikshit was a freedom fighter closely associated with Jawaharlal Nehru. (Watch the video here).

You have been an MP for 10 odd years from East Delhi constituency. What are the achievements that you are proud of?Ten years ago, East Delhi was considered the back of beyond of Delhi. We were suffering on many fronts. One was infrastructure. There were traffic jams, and our roads were not adequate to take both our traffic and the traffic coming in from UP, because it’s easy to access Uttar Pradesh and nearby areas from here. We got a lot of help from the Delhi government and the government of India. Our Pushta Road has become fantastic. National Highway 24 was redeveloped. We defused Canal Road, which eased traffic on Vikas Marg. The Anand Vihar ISBT was redeveloped. GT Road got its two flyovers at Shyam Lal College and at Dilshad Garden. And with the coming in of the second and third metro lines, we got fairly good connectivity.

Second, not every area had sewage connections, and therefore, they had sanitation and cleanliness issues. There were quite a few unauthorised colonies, that were facing severe problems, but over time all of them got their sewage connections and water pipelines. There were two principle areas remaining, Kondli and beyond, which is called the Kondli Project, and Okhla, Jamia Nagar, Batla House, and Shaheen Bagh. In both these areas, consultants were appointed because these were completely unauthorised belts and a lot of planning had to happen. In both areas, the sewage line is being laid down.

Third, our parks and greenery were pretty low. We couldn’t do anything with small parks because the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) controls that. But there were two to three large parks that we were interested in, Sanjay Park and Smriti Van. Both of them have fairly decent growth now. After requesting the Delhi government, along the UP canal which runs through Trilokpuri, the entire area was forested. So, we have a kind of a green belt there. Those have been some of the major achievements.

What about education?The Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University has now come up at the Shahdara CBD. The interesting thing is, they are not just putting up an office there, but three professional colleges. And the East Delhi Delhi University’s campus is also coming up in the same place. Then we have the Maharaja Agrasen College, besides Shaheed Rajguru College there. So it’s been quite okay. But we have land issues, it’s very restricted and there’s not enough. We have a high population ratio, I think it’s about thrice as compared to the rest of Delhi. The only place where we have some land available for big infrastructure is between the Vikas Marg and Noida borders. But things are slowly coming up there as well, and we are keen that some breathing spaces in East Delhi remain.

One of the things we don’t actually end up talking about is the relationship between the MP and the local government, because if it’s a good relationship then there is a lot more work that can be done. You had the Congress, the UPA government for the last ten years and, of course, you had the Congress government 15 years in Delhi under your mother, Sheila Dikshit. Can you tell us about how that relationship can be effective?Of course it can be. Let me give you the example of the Monorail. We heard that the Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation (DSIDC) and the Delhi government were keen on introducing the monorail as another alternative to mass rapid transport. They were looking for a working solution. So we met Raj KumarChauhanji, who was one of the people involved in this. We met Ramakant Goswami, and he said they were looking for good, viable options where the monorail can be a subsidy or a freebie input into amass rapid transport, because by itself the monorail may not be a very viable transport alternative.

Immediately we thought of the fact that we have three lines lying west to east in East Delhi. We had no south to north connection because we don’t have any major roads. Then, I thought of Patparganj Road, parts of Krishna Nagar going up to Trilokpuri, which is an excellent belt where the monorail could be connected. We met them, I took the ministers there, we spoke to the CM. They were keen to get it done. We were keen to get it done. And the project came through.

If the government is willing, then it doesn’t matter which party it is. But it does matter when they bring politics in, because I’m saddened by the fact that once the government was removed, the monorail project was shelved. I mean, it’s a project ready to be implemented. You can take the credit for it if you really want the credit. But you go and do the foundation stone for it and don’t call the MP, that’s unfortunate. Ultimately, the people suffer. You push the project back by six months. Six months’ delay in government actually means three-four years delay.

Anything you wanted to do that could not get done?I would like to focus on smaller parks. And the other thing that couldn’t take off is... have you seen the Yamuna Pushta, the Yamuna river bed between Akshardham and Noida border?

Yes.It’s a huge belt. You can’t construct anything there and you should not. It should remain green. It’s lying there as a breathing space for Delhi. So what we had proposed to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was to build a semi-wooded forest there, put in lots and lots of trees so that floods don’t damage it when they come once a year for two-three months. And DDA agreed. But they formulated a grand plan and said, we’ll convert it into one of those bio-diversity parks. Now, the moment you take on a project too big, it takes a long time to get done. But I’m happy that their plans are ready. Hopefully it should get implemented.

Anything else that you are not satisfied with?Yes, our sewage connectivity is not good and neither is cleanliness. I mean, I don’t want to make it a political issue but Municipal Corporation work is not satisfactory. Of course, we are also not people who are good with sanitation. We put solid waste into naalis. We dump stuff wherever we want. Our malba (debris), which comes from our housing construction is put on the roads. It blocks everything. So people have a part to play, but even then the kind of alacrity with which corporation should actually clean stuff just isn’t there.

Do you feel there needs to a special manifesto? What are your concerns?I think with regard to my constituency we need more spaces for women. I don’t want to get into this whole thing of Delhi being safe or unsafe. That’s a cultural issue. But if you provide spaces which are gender neutral, gender sensitive things do make a difference. Look at Dilli Haat. It is a place where girls and boys and men and women can actually walk around and feel free. Of course, what individual men what would do, nobody can say. For example, the Dilli Haat we had planned that in front of the Samachar Apartment. Unfortunately some people went to the National Green Tribunal and stalled it, for what reason I don’t know. But that would have been a great space for women.

Also we need educational institutions – that’s why I was very keen on the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. What also happens is that when, in your neighbourhood, you find proud, confident women walking around, your own attitude starts changing. You know, the older, slightly more feudal mindset places women in a particular context in your thinking. And whenever women go outside of that context, the male in you reacts to it, which is most unfortunate. But the more openness you have, the more interactive places that are there, women feel more confident and there’s a healthy environment that builds.

The other problem that we do have is that we have very, very large, porous border with Uttar Pradesh. I am not saying there’s anything wrong with UP or Delhi but borders give people places to move in and out. So law and order as a protection institution is not that clear. I was hoping, and we had spoken to the Delhi Metro to create a ring metro on the Delhi-UP border. Once a ring metro is created then it becomes a more secure border. Police can take a look at it. Infrastructure can come up and therefore, the people moving in and out would be restricted to roads coming in and out. That will also ease our traffic woes. But that’s something for the future.

What about police reforms?Police reforms , there are two parts to that. One is, most of the reforms that I have seen is in strengthening the police infrastructure. I think you need more police-public interfacing. And there needs to be mechanism where the police are sensitised to listening to people. But, you know, as regards to people, I would say we always agitate when the police take action, but the police ultimately have to take action. I am not holding out a candle for them; I have myself constantly spoken against the Delhi police. But I think a little more breathing space needs to be given to them, and of course gender sensitisation in Delhi police has to be severe. You just cannot do without that; it’s not just a matter of bringing in more women policemen. Women policemen are not the only solution. I have not seen women policemen being more or especially sensitive to women. Maybe if there are 30% of them, 40% of them that might make a difference. I have seen them frisking women, dealing with women during political agitations, talking to girls when they have a problem, them dealing with people in thanas. I am not talking of senior officers, but at the operational level, in my experience, women policemen are not particularly different from male policemen. I think it’sprobably the matter of culture of the organisation, the norms that have come, their practices, their behaviours, their attitudes. I think that needs to change.

In 1984, some of the worst hit riot areas were in your constituency, in Trilokpuri. Most of the survivors have moved out, but there are still some people there and feel that adequate justice or compensation has not been given to them. Is there any way you can bring up this issue?Yes, good that you brought it up, because there are about 50-55 families that I am in touch with. And over time, they have also become good friends. They initially came to me very, very aggressively. But over time we have been able to help them out. In some places the home ministry and the government of India was very dogged about it, so we got the Delhi government to become more sensitive. When they went to court the government helped them out. As regards to compensation, there are still about 20-25 cases that I personally know are remaining. Maybe there will be more. If there are any, they should come to me. Trilokpuri has also been an area where a lot of perpetrators have been punished.

There is a large Muslim population in your constituency – Okhla, Jamia Nagar, Kondli, Patparganj, Kalyanpuri... How do you assess the needs of the minorities in this area, and how can they be addressed better?One is of course sanitation and water. But that is not the case in the Yamuna paar area. That’s more of the case in Jamia Nagar. For the Rs 300-400 crore project that the Jal Board launched about a year ago, work is still on. The main lines have been put in, sewage treatment plants (STPs) have been put in. It will take two, two-and-a-half years, but once that happens, the entire area is going to get a sewage connection.

It’s a terribly congested belt with unplanned development all around, and so there’s the challenge of putting in civic infrastructure like water pipelines, sewage pipeline etc. But work is still on. And in some areas where work has happened, I have seena bit of a transformation. We had a major problem, you know the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had a put a restriction on 23 or 25 of those colonies, saying they could not be authorised because of some ASI mound, which was there centuries ago which couldn’t be found. Thankfully the ASI withdrew their objections. So, some of the remaining works in terms of local gallis and things that need to get cemented could get done.

Another thing that Muslims are looking for is access to the vast resources they have in terms of scholarships, bank loans, etc., through the Sachar Committee Report – that has been taken on in southern India much more. There’s very little reach in Delhi or Northern India. I think in that Muslims must make their own organisations, institutions and reach out to government. Through the Maulana Azad Education fund, we have got schools sanctioned for the Jamia area. Now we are only waiting for the two-and-a-half or three acres of land, which we have not been able to get. But fortunately now DDA has earmarked two-and-a-half acres of land along with Asifji, the local MLA.

Are you satisfied with how you have kept in touch with your constituency?Partly so. I have three offices and I sit at home also. Every week, I do at least one or two rounds. But rounds are not really satisfactory. Being an MP, you also have this problem of long sessions, tours and other work. And I was, fortunately or unfortunately, the deputy chief whip and then chief whip, which means my parliamentary duties become severe. That cut off a lot of my time from public contact this time, but we still do manage to reach out to people on the ground. But formal communication through electronic, visual or print media has not been as effective because I really don’t know the mechanisms by which we can do those that are cost effective. Perhaps with growing media, more local newspapers coming in, I think that gap in future may get reduced.

10 years is a very long time. How serious a factor is anti-incumbency?Well, it is there but there is also pro-incumbency because of the work that is done.

There is a lot of talk of the traditional Congress voters, particularly groups like Muslims moving towards the Aam Aadmi Party. Is that something you feel you can address through your campaign? No, Muslims are not moving. Sure, Kejriwal is attacking Modi. But please remember, he has attacked Modi only on his development agenda, not a single word about the principle objection to Modi, which is the 2002 riots. What is your communal agenda or your secular agenda? Answer that first. And the Aam Aadmi Party has not asked a single question with regard to that. You look at the fact that in Delhi, even when a minister tried to unfairly impose himself on a station house officer, a policeman, the Aam Aadmi Party went ahead on a dharna. Every time something happened to a girl because it was politically suiting them, they went to a dharna. Where we they in the Muzaffarnagar riots? That is because secularism is not on their agenda. We are first challenging Modi on what his idea of India is. How will he look at humanity? Does he really believe that all of us have equal rights? And if he does, what did he do in 2002? Or what is he doing subsequent to that?

What are the new challenges of this campaign? How is it different from 2004 and 2009?In 2004, we were attacking the NDA. When you are in a negative mode it’s much easier, you didn’t have to say much. In 2009 there was a very positive attitude for the Congress. This time, there is positivity for what’s been done, but there is also a large negativity which we need to counter. Most of it is actually rhetoric without any substance. But even rhetoric needs to be countered. How do we counter that, how do we speak in a language that actually tells people that what is being said against us is in fact completely untrue?

Do you see social media playing a big role?I’m not a social media person.

You are on Twitter.I mean, for me even sending an SMS is a challenge. I only interact on social media occasionally. My only basic concern about this media is that it doesn’t look at the authenticity of a claim. I’ve been a social science student and I’ve been brought up in a tradition that any claim has to be backed by logic and by facts, or by authority. But here a claim or a statement is a true statement unless proven otherwise. I don’t know how seriously to counter that, because I can’t fathom the mind of a person who takes any information at face value. There are others helping me with social media, so I hope they are able to meet that challenge.

Do you feel that Congress has recovered some ground from December?Yes. Two reasons, one is that the Aam Aadmi Party government was evidently selling dreams. And I was sure that they would run away. I have seen governments running and I know what is possible and what is not. I mean you cannot take over people’s lives and give them everything on a platter. Maybe to an extent if you take recourse to cheap populism. They told people, “Your life is slightly difficult because everyone is corrupt and therefore if we will get honest people there, then your life will become super easy.”

Life is not difficult or easy just because of the government. It is because of circumstances, because of the economy, because of society, because of international issues. And they had a very, very simplistic idea because most people are simple. But parties and governments can’t be simple. With regard to Modi and his claims, I think the less said, the better. Even his campaigns seem to be a bit of a damp squib. He’s not been able to really project once he’s come out of Gujarat. Everyone’s challenging what he did there and in people’s minds, they’re pausing and sitting back and thinking that what we’ve seen wasnot news but a kind of a propaganda. People are also starting to say that UPA is not as bad as we thought it was.","2014-04-02 19:30:00","0","87.0","27.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","151.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","3220","47.35","72.03","30.38","50.71","15.05","17.11","85.16","55.75","13.73","7.61","1.86","1.99","1.71","0.68","1.37","6.12","7.14","11.96","11.71","5.96","7.17","1.96","18.04","3.54","1.68","2.14","2.14","2.48","4.04","2.67","1.34","0.00","0.47","0.12","10.03","0.16","0.09","0.59","0.87","11.80","1.93","1.68","1.68","2.89","1.06","4.07","1.52","0.68","0.56","0.25","0.43","0.16","0.19","0.00","0.09","9.88","3.07","1.52","3.57","1.61","0.47","4.19","12.27","1.12","12.42","2.02","7.73","2.76","4.04","0.47","0.37","0.40","0.31","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.06","0.16","0.06","0.00","15.78","6.52","5.43","0.00","0.06","0.78","0.00","0.65","0.06","1.77","0.43","0.06","14317","6.79","15.535545023696683","4466","3188","228","74.19","9.6","6.4","9.21","7.6","497","5.25","13.835884567126726","980","14.24","75","0.54","0","135","52","288","0","364","210","12","6","42","378","263","0","185","0","0","249","39","195","12","1","17","73","1","116","102","64","91","162","114","32","23","0","25"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-experts-believe-bombay-high-court-order-on-reservation-slap-on-previous-government-2035093","Experts believe Bombay High Court order on reservation slap on previous government","The Bombay High Court on Friday stayed Maharashtra government's decision to give 16% reservation to Marathas and reservation to Muslims in government service.

Reacting to the interim order passed by the Bombay High Court, Congress-NCP leaders expressed opinion that the decision by the erstwhile government was taken after considering proposals made by various committees. However, many experts believe that court's order is a slap on the former state government.

NCP leader Nawab Malik said, The BJP government should clear their stand on the issue of reservation for Muslims and Marathas. Are they in favour of it or against it. CM Devendra Fadnavis says they will look into Maratha reservation, but there is no clarity on Muslims reservation. Devendra Fadnavis should explain this disparity.”

Questioning the petition filed by Ketan Tirodkar and Anil Thanekar, Malik Malik further added, “The relation between the BJP and petitioners needs to be probed.”

Admitting a batch of Public Interest Litigations, a bench headed by Chief Justice Mohit Shah said the Supreme Court had already laid down the law for reservation which cannot exceed 50% of the total seats.

Political analyst and Editor in Chief of Zee 24 Taas Dr. Uday Nirgudkar said, “Since the report on the reservation was submitted by the committee and not a Commission, it had its own limitations. But by passing the order, the court has rejected Rane committee's report.”

He further said, ""The decision taken by the erstwhile Congress-NCP government was a political move keeping elections on mind. Earlier, the government had said that they had taken opinions of the experts. But when the court has passed the order, the question is who are the experts they are talking about?”

Stating that the reservation is also being demanded by the Dhangar community and other backward classes Nirgudkar added, “The Congress-NCP always maintain their stand that they had given justice to backward classes by giving reservation. However, the courts order is a 'slap' on the face of Congress, NCP and 'Maratha Brigade'

“If the Supreme Court upholds the decision given by the High Court, it would be surprising”, said Nigudkar.

However, the court was of the view that the comparative data provided by the government justified its decision to introduce reservation for Muslims in government educational institutions.

Former Minorities Development Minister Nasim Khan said, “The Supreme Court has allowed quotas for Muslims in educational institutions and I welcome it. However, we will read the court's interim order on staying reservation to Muslims in government service.”

He further said, “Maharashtra government should appeal in Supreme Court for reservation in government jobs, as the decision was taken after considering the proposals made by various committees.”

Welcoming the move activist Vaibhay Chaya said, ""The decision taken by the erstwhile Congress-NCP government was taken for political benefits. Reservation is given on the basis of social backwardness. Reservation given to make the opportunity available for development. It is not a concession.”

He further added, “Many Politicians are Marathas and major sugar factories, co-operatives and businesses are owned by them. They have all the facilities available openly. The reservation is against the Constitution.”

""We expect the state government to challenge the decision of the court in the Supreme Court, "" said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.","2014-11-14 17:40:00","0","75.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","152.0","202.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","542","96.33","66.44","13.53","70.87","19.36","32.84","76.01","42.44","6.09","2.77","0.18","0.37","0.00","0.55","1.66","3.32","11.44","12.92","7.01","1.66","4.24","0.74","15.50","4.24","2.40","0.55","0.55","1.66","2.77","2.58","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.18","7.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.55","9.41","3.32","1.48","1.29","0.92","0.74","2.77","2.95","0.55","2.21","0.00","0.74","0.18","0.18","0.00","0.37","12.73","1.29","0.92","9.04","2.03","0.00","8.49","5.35","0.55","9.96","2.03","5.90","1.85","9.59","0.18","0.00","0.18","1.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.79","5.17","4.98","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.92","3.69","1.48","0.00","0.37","2837","7.99","27.3","880","537","29","52.7","14.2","10.5","14.62","13.7","117","7.800000000000001","18.115083798882683","242","23.65","10","0.42","0","15","3","64","0","66","28","0","0","6","91","89","1","27","1","0","19","4","14","1","0","1","10","0","12","29","13","24","12","12","1","1","0","1"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-maharashtra-assembly-polls-36-of-58-candidates-who-defected-to-bjp-failed-to-woo-voters-2028119","Maharashtra assembly polls: 36 of 58 candidates who defected to BJP failed to woo voters","Even after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's heavy campaigning, many candidates who defected from other parties to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to woo voters in the Maharashtra state assembly elections. Only 22 out of 58 of these candidates could manage to win the polls, while 36 failed to win. Success eluded even candidates like Ajit Ghorpade and Babanrao Pachpute who had left the Congress and NCP respectively to join the BJP.

After the break-up of Shiv Sena-BJP's 25-year-old alliance, BJP had contested all 288 seats and had imported 58 candidates from various parties. 22 candidates were from the NCP, 20 from the Congress and 10 from the Shiv Sena, five from smaller parties and 1 independent.

Given that the assembly polls were also seen as the first major test of Narendra Modi's popularity after the Lok Sabha polls, the prime minister had conducted 27 rallies for BJP candidates in Maharashtra.

10 out of 22 erstwhile NCP leaders fighting for BJP failed to win. Former NCP president Babanrao Pachpute, who joined BJP on the eve of the Assembly polls couldn't cross the finishing line even after PM Narendra Modi conducted a rally for him. He was defeated in the Srigonda seat of north Maharashtra by 14,000 votes, where voters reposed faith in NCP nominee Rahul Jagtap. Ajit Ghorpade, formerly with the Congress and the NCP, had recently joined the BJP only to lose to former Home Minister RR Patil in Tasgaon who won by more than 22,000 votes. Other candidates who lost include Jagdish Valvi from Chopda, Advai Heere from Nandgaon, Arvind Chavan from Jalna, Yogendra Gode from Buldhana, Rajendra Pipada from Rahata, Abhay Agarkar from Ahmednagar, Sharad Butte from Khed Aalandi, Shantaram Patil from Bhiwandi, Balasaheb Gawde from Baramati

However, Vijay Kumar Gavit, formerly with NCP and minister in the earlier state government, Kisan Kathore from Murbad, Laximan Jagtap and Manda Mhatre were among the 10 NCP candidates who won the election. Mhatre won the seat by defeating former NCP Minister Ganesh Naik. Other candidates who won include, Sanjay Savkaare from Bhusaval, Rahul Kul from Daund, Pratap Chiklikar from Loha, Shivaji Kardile from Rahuri, Bhimrao Dhonde from Ashti, Monika Raajale from Pathardi, Snehalata Kolhe from Kopargan and Santosh Shetty from Bhiwandi.

While campaigning in Satana in Nashik district, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had criticised the BJP for importing candidates saying, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi calls us corrupt. A few years ago, the BJP had disrupted proceedings of the house over the allegations of corruption on NCP ministers. But today, those same 'corrupt' people have become saints for them after joining BJP.""

Several turncoats from the Congress who joined the BJP in the run up to the Assembly polls to improve their political fortunes, also did not reap the benefits of the saffron party. Madhav Rao Kinalkar from Bhokar, Manohar Badne from Dhule, Anand Bharose from Parbhani, Rajan Teli from Sawantwadi, Sanjay Dudhgaokar from Osmanabad, Manikrao Kokate from Sinner, Sanjay Devtale from Chandrapur and five others also lost.

Prashant Thakur, an erstwhile member of the Rahul Gandhi brigade, retained his Panvel seat by 14,000 votes on a BJP ticket. Other winners include Sunil Deshmukh, Sameer Meghe, Shivajirao Naik, Balasaheb Murkute, Amal Mahadik and Pankaj Bhoyar.

All the candidates who had joined BJP from Shiv Sena also failed to win. Vaibhav Naik lost his seat to Sandeep Naik, who is the son of former NCP Minister Ganesh Naik.

Former MNS MLA Ram Kadam who joined BJP a few days ahead of filing nomination forms, won the seat by a margin of 42,000 votes. Anil Gote who joined BJP from Lok Sangram party defeated Congress candidate Rajwardhan Raghujirao Kadambande by 13,000 votes. Independent candidate Prashant Bamb who contested on BJP's ticket in Gangapur constituency won the seat by 17,000 votes defeating Shiv Sena's Ambadas Eknath Danve.

Three other candidates who lost the election include alliance partner and Shiv Sangram's leader Vinayak Mete, Sangita Raje Nimbalkar and Sanjay Gavhane. So it looks like voters don't really appreciate blatant political opportunists.","2014-10-21 18:51:00","0","71.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","151.0","202.0","0.0","288.0","0.0","2.0","3","678","98.16","65.49","2.45","47.60","25.11","26.11","55.31","34.07","4.57","1.03","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.59","0.29","3.54","6.78","15.34","2.80","2.06","3.39","0.44","6.78","3.69","3.24","2.21","4.42","1.18","5.90","3.54","2.36","0.00","0.29","1.33","5.90","0.15","0.15","0.00","0.74","2.95","0.29","0.29","0.29","0.00","0.44","1.62","0.59","0.29","0.15","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.50","2.95","4.57","6.05","2.06","0.74","6.05","2.06","0.15","8.11","0.15","3.69","4.13","2.80","1.18","0.29","0.15","1.77","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.15","14.75","3.98","8.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.59","0.29","1.47","0.29","0.00","3395","8.83","25.40740740740741","1012","668","27","54.86","13.9","11.7","13.52","15.7","168","8.2","21.93988023952096","349","22.81","34","0.34","0","15","28","49","0","96","32","3","0","1","48","229","0","47","0","0","5","3","18","0","0","0","12","0","12","41","9","12","7","4","0","14","0","1"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/india/standpoint-will-there-be-no-one-to-take-bal-thackeray-s-legacy-forward-2036010","Will there be no one to take Bal Thackeray's legacy forward?","Bal Thackeray, the charismatic Shiv Sena supremo who died on this day two years ago, left behind an uncertain future for his party. With the changing times, the spark within the party which was once known for its aggression, has certainly dimmed.

So far, son Uddhav is barely managing to run the party and keep the flock together. In 2006, Thackeray's nephew Raj Thackeray broke away from Shiv Sena to form the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). This was when Uddhav was appointed as the leader of Shiv Sena after Bal Thackeray's retirement from active politics. Once touted to be a force to reckon with, Raj Thackeray is now fearing being left out in the cold after suffering a dismal electoral reverse.

So the question of who will succeed in carrying the legacy of Bal Thackeray forward and stake claim to the cause of the Maratha maanus has no clear answer since his demise.

“If Uddhav or Raj have to come together, a situation that seems difficult, they will have to take into consideration the views of both the 'Shiv Sainik and the 'Mann Sainik',"" says political analyst and Editor-in-Chief of Zee 24 Taas Uday Nirgudkar.

Predicting tough times ahead for the Shiv Sena, Nirgudkar adds, “Though Uddhav is running the party, Shiv Sena will find it difficult to be in the opposition in the assembly as they are in alliance with the BJP at the Centre and in various civic bodies. One cannot be a friend in the morning and a rival in the evening.”

Senior journalist Pratap Aasbe is of the opinion that if Bal Thackeray was alive, he would not have been so desperate to be a part of the government. “Even after breaking the 25-year-old alliance with BJP, Uddhav Thackeray was able to win 63 assembly seats which is a great achievement. But now he is showing how desperate he is for power. The leader himself is in two minds and this is dangerous for the party. If this situation continues, it will demoralise the Shiv Sainiks,” says Aasbe.

Shiv Sena and MNS are the only parties in Maharashtra staking claim to the cause of the Marathi maanus, a cause that national parties cannot take up successfully. Though the importance of national parties in the state politics is growing, the relevance of the regional parties cannot be ruled out. TMC in West Bengal, Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, AIADMK and DMK in Tamil Nadu, JD(U) in Bihar and other parties are still playing a major role because of their ideologies. Therefore, the importance of the parties fighting for the 'Marathi manus' still remains relevant.

However, Nirgudkar feels that the aspirations of the 'Marathi manus' are changing. “Both Uddhav and Raj will have to come together in the near future for their own survival. Today, the masses are not united and even in this situation, regional parties are harming the common man rather than fighting for their cause.”

Bal Thackeray was known for remaining firm on his stand. But this is not the same with Uddhav. He may be running the party, but lacks his father's leadership qualities. Even after having 63 MLAs, Uddhav is unable to pack a punch. On the other hand, Raj Thackeray, who has the qualities and style of the late Bal Thackeray, has failed to appeal to the masses. His party was decimated to 1 seat in 2014 from the 11 seats he had won 2009.

Stating that Shiv Sena is facing a paralysis of position, Nirgudkar says, ""The flip-flops by Shiv Sena has shown them in a poor light. A credible and strong leader can make a difference, but Uddhav is yet to achieve this.""","2014-11-17 21:15:00","0","71.0","12.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","151.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","630","93.28","67.16","22.71","61.90","21.00","19.37","75.40","49.37","6.35","2.86","0.00","0.00","0.16","1.75","0.95","3.49","10.95","15.08","9.21","3.33","5.56","1.11","13.33","4.76","1.59","1.11","2.22","0.95","6.83","4.29","2.38","0.63","0.48","0.48","8.89","0.48","0.16","0.00","2.38","8.10","1.43","1.90","0.95","1.59","0.32","3.49","1.90","0.95","0.48","0.48","0.79","0.32","0.48","0.00","0.00","9.52","3.33","2.70","3.17","1.59","0.79","2.70","9.37","1.59","14.29","1.59","7.94","4.92","3.02","2.86","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.48","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.08","4.76","5.40","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.79","1.59","1.59","0.63","0.00","2829","7.48","22.607142857142858","886","624","30","67.28","12.2","9.0","10.1","11.2","111","6.583333333333333","17.435384615384617","304","20.04","10","0.47","0","20","12","77","0","81","41","0","0","8","77","104","0","26","0","0","11","9","29","0","0","4","17","0","25","15","21","11","9","27","4","3","0","2"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-we-re-in-a-mess-i-can-t-spell-it-out-manohar-parrikar-2047967","We are in a mess, I can't spell it out: Manohar Parrikar","The defence sector is set to do business in a way that is subtle and pronounced. Giving a spin to the Make-in-India pitch of the Narendra Modi government, defence minister Manohar Parrikar has made a strong case for getting Indian institutes like IITs on board.

This, he said, will reduce the country's dependence on imports and will do away with the system of blacklisting firms.

The policy of blacklisting companies had been used to ""create a situation of single tender."" That is, rivals were blacklisted to suit certain companies and this had left the ministry with hardly any option in many areas, Parrikar said.

In a free-wheeling interaction with the faculty and alumni at IIT Bombay campus, where he was felicitated as a distinguished alumnus, on Sunday, Parrikar said, ""We are in a mess that I can't spell out"".

Parrikar said he was keen to strengthen defence research base through tie-ups with institutes like IITs for two key: to reduce costs and dependence on imports and to ensure self-reliability in case of emergencies.

""None of the systems – be it American, Russian or Israeli – are free from trouble at all times. Our import bill in defence last year was $6 billion. Most countries do not rely so much on imports,"" he said.

While pointing out that there was no concrete decision on any of these ideas, he said policies giving shape to his ideas would be in place soon.

""By May-June next year, there will be a lot of synergy; the direction will be clear."" A platform for interaction with senior defence personnel, for seamless applicability of research projects, would be created even earlier than that, he said.

Indicating his dissatisfaction with DRDO, Parrikar said that while the defence research organisation gels well with the navy, it is not working as well in most other programmes. The involvement of IITs will ""put defence acquisitions in a different orbit,"" he said.

Parrikar said he would work out an alternative way of penalising errant contractors and companies, so that it doesn't affect future purchases. Secondly, middlemen would be weeded out. ""You won't find any kickbacks in my regime,"" he said.

Prof S P Sukhatme, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, said the two primary areas of cooperation with academic institutes like IITs would be the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) and the Main Battle Tank (MBT).

The Arjun MBT was a good idea, but its execution and management were not that good, he said. Tejas, an LCA, was finally into production after decades. Cold weather protection rooms, night vision and bullet-proof equipment are some of the other areas for collaboration.

Modi's 'Make-in-India' mission, in one shot, sought to create employment, technology enhancement, and strengthening the country's capabilities on all fronts, Parrikar said.","2014-12-30 07:30:00","0","73.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","298.0","0.0","2.0","3","469","91.26","63.35","13.92","53.85","20.39","23.67","77.83","45.84","7.25","3.62","0.43","0.43","0.21","2.56","0.00","3.62","7.04","15.78","8.96","2.35","4.05","1.71","15.35","4.05","2.56","0.21","1.28","2.77","6.18","3.84","2.35","0.00","0.21","0.00","7.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.56","10.02","1.28","1.92","1.07","2.35","1.07","2.56","3.84","0.64","2.99","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.00","6.61","1.28","1.49","2.77","0.64","0.43","6.82","5.33","1.92","13.86","0.64","9.38","3.84","6.18","0.00","0.21","1.28","0.43","0.21","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.43","0.00","19.83","4.90","7.25","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.00","1.92","2.56","1.71","0.85","0.21","2240","8.53","20.652173913043477","704","462","23","59.53","12.4","9.9","12.36","12.7","114","8.3","19.91012987012987","266","19.57","10","0.45","0","13","5","42","0","67","32","0","2","11","81","50","0","38","0","0","16","5","15","1","0","4","9","0","22","28","9","10","4","6","2","0","0","1"

The report said that the ""opaque, literary style"" of such contracts defeat the organisation's intent of processing data to users.

While Facebook's terms and conditions run up to 20,000 words and would take up to one hour and 45 minutes to read, Google's contract runs to eight A4 pages and Twitter's terms of service is 3,500-words long.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/editorial-dnaedit-manufacturing-a-revolution-2021116","#dnaEdit: Manufacturing a revolution","Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mega meeting this Thursday with leaders of global industrial enterprises is, as they say, a necessary but not sufficient step for bringing about a manufacturing revolution in the country. The Prime Minister, in his recent Independence-Day speech, identified “Make in India” as one of his top priorities. He urged global manufacturers as well as Indian industrialists, to seriously consider India as a manufacturing destination. This is not the first time such an idea has been floated. The UPA government, too, had hit upon this strategy and set up the National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council. But the move had yielded no results.

Meanwhile, manufacturing, continued to languish. Going by the indices of industrial production during the last few years, manufacturing was stagnating without any growth prospects.

Why is a robust manufacturing sector vital to the economy and productivity-linked growth? When India’s services sector was growing and pushing up the overall GDP to near double-digit levels, we smugly believed that India had already arrived at the post-industrial stage of a services-led economy. We perceived ourselves to have acquired a seat in the league of the advanced developed economies, dominated by the services sector. But that was clearly a mistaken notion.

The lack of a vibrant manufacturing industry stymied job opportunities. Let’s not forget that it’s the manufacturing sector which primarily catalyses economic development. Britain became the world’s leading manufacturer after the Industrial Revolution on the back of steam power. United States developed its industry after finding abundant raw materials. Japan became a major economy after the Second World War on the strength of its manufacturing industry. South Korea developed into a specialised manufacturing hub and became a leader in ship building to automobiles. Last but not the least, China emerged as a economic super power rivalling United States because of manufacturing muscle.

Modi’s intention to ‘ walk his talk’ by meeting global manufacturing industry leaders is surely welcome. But should he not have rather prioritised his meetings with state chief ministers, industry ministers and lower level bureaucracy and urged them to facilitate manufacturing units to operate or start new green-field projects. Industry leaders are only one part of the new manufacturing project. Often eager to invest in India, industrialists retreat in the face of daunting red tape. Only recently, some company heads complained of the difficulties they encounter in operating their businesses in India.

The key to turning India into the next manufacturing hub lies in the hands of state governments. Enough policy reforms already exist on paper to attract investment in India. But investment projects are getting locked up in procedural and political tangles.

Manufacturing is old-time real economy. It can only take off by meeting certain basic production criteria: land, labour, capital as well as entrepreneurs. Here in India, land acquisition continues to be difficult — not just for its shortage, but also for political reasons. The argument amply illustrated by the deadlocked Singur and Niyamgiri projects. Labour is surplus but often not skilled enough. Skill development, therefore, has to be a top priority.

India also has the unique advantage of having energetic entrepreneurs. But they are hemmed in by the red-tape of clearances. Environmental clearances mean running from pillar to post — from state to Centre. These are just some of the problems of setting up new manufacturing units in India. They need to be urgently sorted out. And the Prime Minister can initiate this process by first meeting the heads of states to straighten these knots before he can usher in a manufacturing revolution.","2014-09-24 05:05:00","0","56.0","5.0","2.0","0.0","50.0","0.0","144.0","196.0","0.0","274.0","0.0","1.0","1","594","95.11","56.02","41.42","28.57","15.23","31.14","82.32","43.77","5.39","2.86","0.00","0.67","0.00","1.18","1.01","2.53","8.42","15.99","5.22","4.38","5.22","1.52","8.92","6.23","3.20","0.51","1.01","1.18","4.21","2.19","2.02","0.00","0.67","0.17","5.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.18","9.93","2.02","2.36","1.01","1.18","0.67","3.20","1.18","0.51","0.34","0.17","1.35","0.84","0.67","0.00","0.00","9.76","1.01","3.54","5.39","1.18","0.84","2.53","6.23","0.51","16.67","2.36","8.75","5.39","15.32","0.17","0.00","1.85","0.84","0.17","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.34","0.00","13.47","6.40","3.70","0.17","0.00","0.17","0.00","1.35","0.51","1.18","0.00","0.00","3153","8.73","15.384615384615385","1031","589","39","39.23","12.7","11.5","14.14","12.1","162","8.75","19.04169779286927","330","14.64","2","0.42","0","19","2","60","0","71","56","1","1","4","99","51","2","45","0","0","14","8","36","0","0","6","18","0","21","21","21","17","10","14","1","0","0","2"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-dismantling-agriculture-2048227","Dismantling agriculture","So it’s all working according to the plan. The latest round of National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) report on the “Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households” for 2012-13 clearly shows what was largely expected. Agriculture is not only in a terrible crisis, but is fast decaying.

I am not surprised. After all, the demise of Indian agriculture is on the lines suggested by the World Bank way back in 1996. The World Bank had estimated that in the next 20 years, by 2015, the number of people migrating from rural to urban areas in India will be equal to the combined population of Britain, France and Germany. The combined population of these countries is 20-crore, and the World Bank had anticipated that 40-crore people would be moving out of the rural areas in India by the year 2015.

This is only possible by creating conditions that make farming uneconomical, forcing farmers to quit agriculture and migrate to the cities looking for menial jobs. In its 2008 World Development Report, the World Bank had wanted India to hasten the process of taking people out of agriculture by going in for land acquisitions and launching a network of training institutes across the country to train the younger people in rural areas with skills that make them eligible to become industrial workers.

With over 300,000 farmers committing suicide in the past 17 years, and with 42 per cent farmers wanting to quit agriculture if given a choice, the deliberate effort to keep agriculture starved of public sector funding, and thereby help the exodus process is finally becoming clearly visible. With no efforts to remove the scourge of growing indebtedness, and with over 58 per cent farmers sleeping hungry, there is not much that farmers can do but to migrate. The Census 2011 tells us that more than 2,400 farmers quit agriculture and migrate to the cities every day. Many independent estimates point to the number of people migrating to the cities as around 50-lakhs a year.

Raghuram Rajan had echoed the same sentiment when he took over as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. He had said that the real growth in India would be when we are able to move people out of agriculture into the cities. He is not the only economist to say so. Most mainline economists have been parroting the same argument for several decades now thereby influencing the public policies to ignore farming. Agriculture has disappeared from the economic radar screen of the country.

With 70 per cent of the farmers owning less than one hectare of land, and with over 40 per cent of the farmers in possession of a MGNREGA job card, it only shows how uneconomical farming has become over the years. According to the survey report, an average household of five people earns Rs3,078 a month from crop cultivation, and another Rs765 from dairy. Add to it an average of Rs2,069 from wages/salaries and Rs514 from non-farm activities, the total monthly income for a household stands at Rs6,426.

In other words, crop cultivation and livestock rearing brings a monthly income of Rs3,843 to a family. Put another way, agriculture brings only 60 per cent of the monthly income for an agricultural household. If this is what the Indian farmers earn after 45 years of Green Revolution isn’t this a national shame? Does it not mean that the intensive farming techniques that were aggressively pushed in the name of technological development have failed to usher in economic prosperity for the farmers?

Although, the NSSO tells us that 57 per cent of the 15.61-crore rural households are engaged in agriculture, which means they have at least one person who does farming or has dairy animals, the number of farming families now stand at 9.02-crore. But even these agricultural households are a victim of continuous neglect and apathy. In the 11th Plan Period, the total budgetary support for agriculture was Rs1-lakh-crore. For the next five years of the 12th Plan, the budgetary support was increased to Rs1.5-lakh-crore. This year, in 2014-15, agriculture which employs 58 per cent of the population, received only Rs24,000-crore. The industry sector on the other hand got tax concessions of Rs5.73-lakh-crores this year.

Incidentally, even MGNREGA gets a higher budgetary support than agriculture.

With agriculture being deliberately starved of funding, the deleterious impact it has on the viability of the farms was expected. The only saving grace being the Minimum Support Price (MSP) being paid to farmers. But in the past three years, MSP for wheat and rice has been raised by a paltry Rs50/quintal every year. This is not even enough to offset the rate of inflation that the country has witnessed. On top of it, all efforts are now on to dismantle the procurement system, which means removing the MSP and leaving farmers to face the vagaries of the markets. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) itself has been demanding the removal of MSP for farmers and letting the markets decide the prices that farmers should be getting.

What is however not being spelled out is that only 8 per cent of India’s farmers get the benefit of MSP every year. In any case, 92% of the country’s farmers remain dependent on the private trade which has been ruthlessly exploiting them. Punjab farmers for instance get an assured MSP every year whereas Bihar farmers do not. Removing the MSP would mean that Punjab farmers too are forced to resort to distress sale as is the practice in Bihar. A beginning has already been made by the Food Ministry directing the state governments not to provide any bonus over and above the MSP that is announced by the Centre.

The deliberate destruction of the food self-sufficiency that has been so assiduously achieved is being attempted at a time when globally it is now recognised that food shortages will trigger the next world war. Whether it is because of the impact of climate change or the corporate control over agriculture, food is likely to be the biggest political concern in the years to come. A warning was sounded in 2007-08 when a sudden spike on food prices led to an unprecedented global food crisis resulting in ‘food riots’ in 37 countries.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-ukraine-russia-insanity-must-be-brought-to-an-end-1966543","Ukraine-Russia insanity must be brought to an end","What happened to international diplomacy? Where are the global efforts at making the world a peaceful place to live in heading to? Is this what we – the highly evolved and continuously evolving human beings – have made of ourselves? We need to scratch our heads to find an answer to these and so many similar questions which come to our minds after getting to know the possibility of a full-fledged war between Ukraine and Russia.

No one can deny the imbalance of power between the two nations; there is hardly any comparison. Ukraine cannot, even with the best of preparation and performance, stand against Russia’s might. It is seeking and will continue to seek support – men, machine, material, money, military expertise, etc. – from its allies, mostly European, and the US may also jump in to settle innumerable scores with Russia. It won’t be wrong to say that stubbornness and high handedness are almost synonymous with the name of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is a matter of serious concern that Putin, for his own selfish political motives, would not hesitate to trigger a war between the two countries, which has the potential of negatively impacting the entire world, politically and economically.

Whatever the differences between Ukraine and Russia, it is undesirable and quite insan e that a powerful nation like Russia would resort to brute force simply to make a point in the comity of nations. It is most unfortunate that in this age of technology, when the threat of nuclear weapons is a great deterrent in itself, and simply the thought of even the slightest use of these weapons in any war can make the entire body go numb even of the boldest and most courageous persons, the Russian president had the audacity and imprudence of getting Parliamentary approval of attacking the neighbour. It simply does not make sense for Ukraine to go to war against Russia, however, it would be left with no option but to defend itself with whatever military power it has, and then keep on hoping for the best, while making all the efforts to garner support from the international community.

What Russia wants to do by using military force is to turn the clock back and show to the world that peace, prosperity, international trade and business do not make any sense to a nation led by an individual who doesn’t exhibit the capacity of behaving in a rational manner, neither for its own people not for the entire world. Russia would like to get the first mover advantage, cause huge damage to life and property in Ukraine and thereafter force it to surrender.

It is shocking and unbelievable that this could happen so soon, within a quarter of a century of the disintegration of the erstwhile Soviet Union and formation of Ukraine as an independent nation in 1991, when policies like glasnost and perestroika became words of everyday use in global vocabulary. It was the dawn of a new era, with the Iron Curtain lifted and Cold War ended. The last two decades or so saw rapid strides in global business with the nations of erstwhile Soviet Union becoming trading partners with so many nations in the world because of their richness in oil, gas, minerals, heavy engineering, etc., and also rich culture, which attracted tourists also. Sharing boundaries and being in close proximity with European countries is also a major reason for business relationships with so many countries, including India, to move in a positive direction. Despite the Russian dominance in that region, newly-formed independent states provided an opportunity to conduct trade and business without the sword hanging from Moscow, but, alas, it’s all back to square one, until and unless better sense prevails in Moscow.

If that doesn’t happen, and insanity prevails in Moscow and permeates in the entire region, the end result will remind us all of the barbaric and autocratic rulers who believed in narcissism and used to legitimise their own perverted thoughts and aspirations into national interest. It is a test for the entire international community, particularly the so-called super powers of the world, to exercise restraint and practise the fine art of diplomacy to its best so that the world lives in peace. Insanity must be handled in a deft manner, so that the least damage is done.","2014-03-03 19:57:00","0","56.0","5.0","2.0","0.0","50.0","0.0","144.0","196.0","0.0","274.0","0.0","1.0","1","723","91.23","52.21","21.09","30.44","31.43","25.31","84.51","50.48","7.47","1.38","0.00","0.97","0.00","0.14","0.28","6.09","9.41","16.74","6.22","4.29","7.88","1.80","12.31","4.56","2.21","1.80","1.11","2.35","6.36","3.32","3.04","0.28","1.52","0.00","3.73","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.28","12.31","2.07","3.32","1.52","2.63","1.66","2.35","1.52","0.41","0.14","0.41","0.97","0.28","0.55","0.14","0.00","9.68","2.07","1.94","4.84","1.66","0.83","2.07","7.75","1.80","13.42","1.38","9.27","3.04","2.77","0.41","0.28","1.38","0.00","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.93","2.90","6.36","0.00","0.14","0.41","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.69","0.00","0.00","3469","8.84","31.652173913043477","1117","724","24","49.28","14.7","13.9","11.85","16.8","170","7.833333333333334","23.472265193370166","365","27.04","1","0.46","0","35","5","82","1","99","67","1","6","12","124","37","0","38","1","0","19","8","38","0","2","0","31","0","40","12","19","9","7","20","6","5","0","3"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-enough-of-vodafone-tax-dispute-1964787","Enough of Vodafone tax dispute","One of the most important indicators of the maturity of business environment in any country is the time taken to resolve business disputes and going by this indicator, India, unfortunately, ranks very low despite taking pride in having one of the finest, independent, fearless and effective judiciaries in the world. This is most unfortunate, particularly as evidenced by the Vodafone tax dispute, which seems to be going on and on, senselessly. The most intriguing aspect in this entire issue is that the Supreme Court decided the matter two years ago and yet the matter has not reached its logical conclusion.

Without going into the merits of the case, and without commenting on the decision of the Supreme Court of India, we need to understand that a high degree of finality is reached when the Supreme Court of any country pronounces its decision and it is for the legislature and executive of that country to honour the decision of the court, which surely is a sign of mutual respect in a democracy practising separation of powers. Changing the law and applying it retrospectively just to nullify the effect of the highest court’s pronouncement is making a mockery of the system, which very well recognises the power of judicial review of legislative and executive actions, with which the Supreme Court is armed, and these powers can be exercised even in the case of retrospective application of the law.

As is quite obvious, Vodafone did not opt for this available option and tried its best to somehow negotiate and settle it with the powers to be; however, of late, uncertainty about the political future of the ruling coalition, and along with that, the high level of uncertainty of honouring any out-of-court settlement with the individual political masters acting for and on behalf of the people of India, is a big risk as no one knows who will be making the decisions and running the government in a couple of months’ time. Vodafone clearly wants to play safe, but at the same time also keep its options open and not be blamed for sleeping over the matter.

In this scenario, Vodafone has initiated proceedings for arbitration – an alternative dispute resolution mechanism with appointed arbitrators, who are typically experts in the chosen domain, and whose decision is binding on the parties, with the provision of being challenged in a court of law on very few and narrow grounds – between India and the Netherlands regarding bilateral investment promotion agreement, an agreement between two countries guaranteeing all measures to protect investment mutually and reciprocally.

Just two years back, India lost face in international business community when an international investment arbitration was decided against it in the matter of White industries, an Australian company, primarily on the ground that even when the Australian company had won the arbitration award, long delay in its execution due to challenge in the courts in India resulted in denial of efficacious and speedy dispute resolution mechanism, ultimately meaning lack of availability of proper measures to protect investment in India.

It is a feeling of déjà vu in the Vodafone case, but this time it’s not the delay in the judicial pronouncement, it’s a lot of confusion and uncertainty on the part of government, which is to be blamed. From whatever perspective one looks at, and whatever may be the final outcome, one feels a bit bored and disappointed as to why the matter is lingering on for such a long time, which undoubtedly is casting a gloomy shadow on a number of prospective investments in India. The time spent by courts, legal experts, bureaucrats and political masters on matters like Vodafone tax issue could have been better utilised for the benefit of a large number of people of India, who deserve the undivided attention, devotion and commitment for finding suitable and prompt solution to their innumerable problems.

It would be most unfortunate that the mess created by the ruling coalition would be handed over to the new government, which, hopefully, would use a little bit more of everyday reasonableness and prudence. Fairness in business dealings is still a virtue, cherished all over the world.","2014-02-24 19:35:00","0","56.0","5.0","2.0","0.0","50.0","0.0","144.0","196.0","0.0","274.0","0.0","1.0","1","694","97.45","48.85","31.78","64.02","49.57","28.24","83.29","50.43","6.05","0.29","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.14","5.76","11.24","18.44","6.34","3.75","5.62","1.01","10.23","4.18","2.16","2.45","1.15","2.45","7.20","4.61","2.59","0.58","0.43","0.58","2.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.54","3.75","2.02","1.30","2.88","1.59","1.87","0.86","0.58","0.00","0.29","0.43","0.29","0.14","0.00","0.00","8.93","0.43","2.45","5.04","1.30","0.86","1.87","6.20","1.30","13.83","0.86","9.22","3.89","5.19","0.58","0.00","1.73","0.00","0.14","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","9.51","2.02","6.48","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.58","0.00","0.00","3439","9.9","49.785714285714285","1123","694","14","21.13","19.7","22.6","13.07","27.3","167","18.666666666666668","31.46536023054755","325","38.71","0","0.48","0","30","7","92","0","116","59","1","3","7","134","28","0","34","0","0","9","6","31","1","4","0","15","0","23","7","23","18","4","28","9","3","1","4"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-fdi-curse-in-retail-1953861","FDI curse in retail","There is a popular advertisement on the TV. A child is running and falls down in mud. His mother comes running, picks up the child, dusts his clothes and says: “Beta, get up. Don’t worry, Surf Excel hai naa!” In a country where nearly 3 lakh farmers have committed suicide, farm incomes are plummeting, rural infrastructure is in a shambles, middlemen rule the roost, and the nation is witnessing a jobless growth, FDI in retail is being promoted as an excellent cure to the problems.

An impression is being given that once FDI in retail comes in, it will address all the ills plaguing the food and agriculture sector, and also boost employment.

In the mid-1980s, when Pepsico came up with a proposal to bring in a second agricultural revolution in Punjab, it, too, was hailed as a path-breaking initiative that would put an end to the continuing distress on the farms. It was expected to usher in the latest technology, improve farm research and extension, create supply-chain infrastructure, and provide marketing linkages from farm to the fork. I remember the kind of excitement that prevailed all around. Politicians, bureaucrats, economists, agricultural scientists and even the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) joined the chorus.

Some 15 years after the project was approved, Pepsico’s horticultural revolution is all but forgotten. Agriculture has gone from bad to worse. The food bowl of the country has also become a major hot spot for farmer suicides.

Arvind Kejriwal’s scrapping of the FDI in retail in Delhi has renewed the debate over one of the most contentious of policy issues. Commerce Minister Anand Sharma has expressed displeasure saying that the AAP’s decision will send a wrong signal to foreign investors. FDI advocates feel that FDI in retail will lay out back-end infrastructure, bring in a chain of cold storages and improved transportation, thereby reducing crop losses; removing middlemen who rob the farmers of profits, and provide higher prices for their produce; bring in improved technology to help in crop diversification; and, of course, create millions of jobs.

Let us examine how true these claims are. Walmart, Tesco, Sainsbury, Carrefour and a host of other big retail players are expected to increase farm income. In the US, where Walmart has completed 50 years, if farmers were getting a better income, why would the number of farmers decrease to less than one per cent of the population? US farmers survive not due to Walmart, but because of massive subsidy support, which includes direct farm income. Between 1997 and 2008, Rs12.60 lakh crore was provided as income support to farmers. A UNCTAD-India study shows that if these subsidies, classified as Green Box in WTO parlance, are removed, agriculture in the US would collapse.

In Europe, despite the dominance of big retail, every minute one farmer quits agriculture. Europe provides the highest amount of subsidies, including direct income support. But because 74 per cent of these subsidies are cornered by corporations and big farmers, small farmers are quitting the profession. In France, farm income had come down by 39 per cent in 2009, down from 22 per cent in 2008. In OECD, the richest trading block comprising 30 countries, Rs14 lakh crore was the farm subsidy support in 2009 alone. It is not big retail, but direct income support that keeps farmers in agriculture.

Studies show that in the US, some 50 years back, if a farmer sold his produce for one dollar, his income would be 70 cents. In 2005, it had fallen to 4 per cent. With the middlemen wiped out, I thought the farmer’s income would go up. No, it is the new battery of middlemen — quality controller, standardiser, certification agency, processor and such like —who walk away with the farmer’s profits. In the process, the number of middlemen, operating under the same hub, actually increases.

Take the example of an earlier Walmart-Bharti tie-up for wholesale marketing in Punjab. Baby corn is bought by Walmart-Bharti at Rs8 per kg, sold at Rs100/kg in wholesale by the big retail, and ultimately the consumer price hovers around Rs200/kg. It’s a clear example of how the middleman squeezes farm incomes and fleeces consumers. This is not an isolated case. Much of the farm produce is bought at very low prices across the globe. Primarily for this reason, dairy farmers in UK are quitting on a large-scale. They are asking the UK government to set up a fair price mechanism that big retail should be directed to adopt.

There is no evidence that big retail creates back-end infrastructure. In US and Europe, rural infrastructure has been created through government support which came in the form of agricultural subsidies. To say that 40 per cent agricultural food that goes waste in India will be drastically reduced is also an illusion. Even in the US, 40 per cent food is wasted and much of it is after processing where Walmart should have played a more important role. More than 50 per cent vegetables/fruits rot in supermarket stores. If big retail failed to reduce food wastage in the US, I wonder why we expect them to perform a miracle in India?

Regarding employment generation and poverty alleviation, lessons need to be drawn from a 2004 study of Pennsylvania State University by Stephen Goetz and Hema Swaminathan, which showed how higher levels of poverty prevailed in areas where Walmart stores had come up, compared to the states where big retail was absent. In any case, for a $450 billion turnover, Walmart employs only 2.1 million people. Whereas, for an estimated $460 billion market, Indian retail employs 44 million people. If Walmart is allowed entry, what has to be understood is that for every job it creates, it will displace at least 20 workers.

Yes, there is a need to improve rural infrastructure, provide a sophisticated supply chain, and offer better income to farmers. The milkman of India, late Dr Verghese Kurien, had shown us the way. The cooperative dairy structure, which led to the evolution of the Amul brand, is the right approach.

If he could do it for milk, which is a highly perishable commodity, there is no reason why it can’t be replicated in fruits, vegetables and other agricultural commodities. The solution to the plethora of problems on Indian farms does not lie in the West, but in our own backyard.

""Naxalites should come in the mainstream like Maoists in Nepal, who left the path of violence and came into the mainstream of participatory politics. Naxalites should also do that. If they feel Congress is the right party, then they are most welcome to join the party,"" Singh said on the sidelines of the ongoing state Congress 'Chintan Shibir' in Goa.

Singh, who had reportedly made a similar statement during the recent Jharkhand poll campaign, was criticised by BJP MP Prahlad Singh Patel in Lok Sabha without naming him.

Singh, however, said he is sure about what he had mentioned during the Jharkhand poll campaign.

""What I said? I have said that Naxalites must come out of the politics of violence and should join the mainstream democratic politics. I had said that they should participate in the democracy and at the same time I say they should defeat the politics of communalism, violence and politics of hatred,"" he said.

To a question whether he was referring to BJP of doing politics of communalism, Singh said, ""I am obviously referring to the BJP.

""They are dividing the society on religious lines, they are inciting communal violence,"" he said and added that, therefore, they should be opposed.

He accused the Central government of trying to act against the Constitutional provisions and violate the fundamental rights.

Referring to the recent debate on anti-conversion laws, the senior Congress leader said he is against any form of conversion by inducement or by force.

""Religion is a personal thing. I feel I should be allowed and should have the liberty to practice any religion of my choice,"" he said.","2014-12-14 16:10:00","0","70.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","50.0","0.0","148.0","201.0","0.0","293.0","0.0","2.0","3","292","87.91","86.35","4.19","12.23","19.47","26.71","83.22","50.00","11.64","8.56","2.74","0.00","0.00","3.42","2.40","3.08","8.90","14.73","9.59","1.37","4.79","0.34","17.81","4.79","2.05","1.71","0.00","1.37","5.48","2.05","3.08","0.00","1.03","0.00","16.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.42","12.33","3.08","1.71","3.42","2.40","1.37","2.40","4.45","0.00","3.77","0.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.99","4.11","1.37","6.85","0.34","0.00","6.85","7.88","0.34","9.25","1.37","5.14","2.74","5.82","1.03","0.00","0.00","1.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.07","4.79","5.82","0.00","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.34","3.08","0.68","0.00","0.00","1401","8.13","19.466666666666665","439","291","15","60.24","13.0","9.7","11.89","12.0","65","8.8","18.694707903780067","147","16.93","11","0.49","0","9","0","29","0","41","16","0","0","9","39","32","0","14","0","0","23","2","5","0","1","0","8","0","14","20","9","5","8","4","0","4","0","0"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-resignation-row-hrd-ministry-probing-legality-of-mou-2047971","Resignation row: HRD ministry probing legality of MoU","A day after the IIT Delhi Director Raghunath Shevgaonkar's resignation, alumni association of IIT-D stood by him and warned HRD ministry against any interference with the IIT affairs. He had left two years of service and he abruptly put in his papers apparently over a controversy involving his signing an MoU with Mauritius.

Shevgaonkar's resignation is yet to be accepted, but the HRD ministry has constituted an inquiry committee to look into the MoU that the institution signed with Mauritius Research Council for setting up an IIT Research Academy in Mauritius. The academicians too feel that the director is being made a scapegoat for sharing his proximity with the Congress.

The alumni association's resolution reads, ""We resolve that the autonomy of the IIT system being extremely important for the development of the nation, should not be interfered by the HRD Ministry in order to have smooth functioning of the IITs.""

Sources in HRD ministry informed that the ministry, one and a half months back had formulated a one man committee to look into the legitimacy of the MoU signed between IIT-D and Mauritius. An inquiry into the same is also being conducted. The ministry denied having put any pressure on Sevagaokar and has said that his resignation has not been accepted.

The HRD ministry by its order passed in August 2004, had allowed all central universities including the IITs and IIMs to engage in exchange programs with foreign universities without any formal approval of the ministry. The IIT-D had signed the MoU under the same pretext.

IIT-D had started running an off shore campus in Mauritius and was also to award degrees to the students. However the IIT Act, does not allows IITs to award degrees to overseas institutions. ""Had IIT amended the act before signing an MoU, there would have been no controversy,"" said an officer of the ministry.

If the MoU signed had been restricted to research, the ministry would have no objection, but awarding degrees is against the act. The MoU was signed in 2013, when Pallam Raju was the HRD minister in UPA 2 term.

However academicians feel that Sevagaokar is not alone to be blamed for violating the IIT Act. Some feel he is being targeted for sharing proximity with the Congress. The IIT director wrote speeches for Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi. IIT board and the then HRD minister was aware of the MoU. So why is the director being pressurised,"" said an academician.

IIT Delhi meanwhile issued a statement saying that the Director had resigned because of ""personal reasons"" and it was ""not connected to any other matter being reported in the press"". The IIT statement issued by the acting registrar said the campus in Mauritius is not an ""extension campus of IIT-D"" but an independent research academy named 'International Institute of Technology Research Academy' (IITRA). ""IIT-D's role is only advisory in nature,"" it said.

It said the original proposal to start International Institute of Technology Delhi Research Academy was initiated on the recommendation of the IIT Council on January 21, 2011 but its nomenclature was later changed to IITRA on the advice of the HRD Ministry. ""The final MoU was okayed by HRD Ministry and it was signed in the presence of the then HRD Minister on November 19, 2013 in Mauritius,"" the IIT statement said.","2014-12-30 07:10:00","0","70.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","560","96.84","57.10","13.80","35.11","22.40","27.86","76.07","47.14","4.11","1.61","0.00","0.18","0.00","1.43","0.00","2.50","12.68","14.29","8.75","2.68","4.29","1.61","14.46","1.61","0.89","0.36","1.96","1.07","4.29","2.32","1.79","0.36","0.36","0.89","6.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.61","9.29","2.68","1.79","0.71","1.25","0.36","3.04","2.86","0.36","1.61","0.89","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.07","0.71","0.89","4.29","0.54","0.18","7.14","4.46","0.36","10.89","0.89","6.07","3.75","8.04","0.18","0.00","0.18","2.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.68","4.46","3.04","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.07","2.68","1.07","0.36","0.00","2694","8.24","22.56","871","554","25","48.94","13.6","11.9","11.84","13.3","123","13.5","19.76086642599278","240","20.16","39","0.48","0","14","10","79","0","73","20","0","0","3","77","100","1","16","0","0","9","6","22","0","0","1","14","0","13","36","19","29","3","16","0","0","0","2"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-bjp-hints-at-a-possible-alliance-with-shiv-sena-to-form-government-in-maharashtra-2028153","BJP hints at a possible alliance with Shiv Sena to form government in Maharashtra","Describing Shiv Sena as a ""natural ally"", BJP today dropped hints that it would prefer the estranged saffron party to be a partner in its government in Maharashtra even while NCP's unconditional support continues to be on offer.

As speculation continued over government formation in the state, union minister and senior party leader Arun Jaitley referred to the congratulatory telephone calls made by Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah and some other leaders, saying it is a ""signal"" (of possibility of alliance).

""... we have two proposals at hand. Sena has been a natural ally, NCP has announced unconditional support... For BJP and Sena to become allies in the Maharashtra government could be a matter of course but if there is some difficulty that arises you also have unconditional offer as far as NCP is concerned,"" he told NDTV in an interview.

Jaitley said there have been ""not much"" talks with Sena so far but emphasised that the two parties are still together at central level as well as municipal level in Mumbai.""Surely, in two out of the three tiers of government we are allies... the fact that we are congratulating each other itself is a signal,"" he said.

He said things will be clear in a few days.

BJP's Maharashtra election in-charge Om Mathur also made suggestions on the similar lines and said his party would be ""happy"" if ""natural ally"" Sena comes back.""We think the party which has been with us for years... If the natural ally, which was with us returns, we will be happy.

But if it doesn't, then all options are open in politics,"" Mathur told Times Now.

BJP has won 122 seats in the 288-member state Assembly, falling short of the majority mark by 23 seats. Sena has 63 seats while NCP has 41.

Asked if he was ruling out an alliance with Sharad Pawar-led NCP, Jaitley said, ""Nothing is ever ruled out in politics"".

He went on to add in a lighter vein, ""We are in a 'swayamvar' situation and therefore we have to decide at an appropriate stage after a dialogue has taken place.""","2014-10-21 18:41:00","0","70.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","50.0","0.0","149.0","202.0","0.0","284.0","0.0","2.0","3","363","79.79","88.18","15.37","80.64","24.20","18.73","79.06","48.48","8.26","4.41","0.00","2.48","0.28","1.65","0.00","3.86","6.89","14.33","10.74","3.31","6.89","0.83","16.80","6.34","2.48","0.55","2.48","2.20","3.86","3.31","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.95","0.00","1.38","0.00","1.65","9.09","1.38","1.10","2.48","2.48","1.65","3.03","2.48","0.28","1.93","0.28","0.55","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.40","7.16","0.83","4.13","0.83","0.28","5.23","11.02","0.83","14.60","1.10","9.37","4.41","3.86","1.38","0.00","0.00","0.55","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","19.83","7.16","4.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.83","5.51","1.38","0.55","0.00","1622","7.95","24.4","530","358","17","58.52","12.1","10.3","10.44","11.6","74","12.375","18.708156424581006","197","22.4","11","0.46","0","8","9","29","0","52","23","0","0","5","52","44","0","19","0","0","19","2","19","0","0","2","7","0","10","15","5","12","13","17","2","0","0","0"

"http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-rising-transparency-gains-confidence-1958472","Rising transparency gains confidence","The transformation in real estate over the past few years, has taken place on multiple levels. While there are more corporates, more trained professionals and a greater use of technology on one hand, one can also see a much greater emphasis on transparency than there used to be earlier.

The last two years have witnessed the emergence of a new customer, who is better informed and prefer dealing with developers who provide specific details and work in a systematic manner.

Year 2014 is expected to see developers who raise transparency benchmarks even higher finding favour with such customers as they are becoming more and more discerning than ever before.

Driving this change are real estate industry bodies like MCHI-CREDAI, which have promoted openness and fair dealing among the developers, promoters and customers by adopting a code of conduct.

MCHI-CREDAI’s code of conduct, enforced among its developer members, deals with the five major clauses - full disclosure on property title, agreement for sale on carpet area basis, possession details, any additional charges details and arbitration and mediation. These are aimed at bringing in more transparency in customer interaction. Let us look at some of the key aspects.

Title

The title of the property under development shall have a true disclosure in the ‘title certificate’ from a solicitor/ advocate showing the rights and obligations of the developer along with the agreement of sale.

Inspection of sanctions

All sanctions from the sanctioning authorities like approved plans and commencement certificate, N. A. permission, etc., shall be made available for perusal of the purchaser at the time of signing the agreement of sale.

Carpet area

The developer shall disclose the carpet area of the premises in accordance with provision of MOFA. Any area that is specific to the flat/ premises exclusively to be enjoyed by the premise owner will also be disclosed and whether chargeable separately.

Guarantee as to non-violation

Customers would be assured that the building laws would be complied with and would be guaranteed of assured protection from any possible adverse consequences of violation.

Some of the leading developers in Mumbai have set an example and become a role model for others to follow. Read on to see where and how they are making a concrete difference.","2014-01-31 12:26:00","0","74.0","14.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","151.0","202.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","376","97.45","60.50","18.82","79.19","22.12","30.85","79.52","45.48","3.46","0.80","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.53","2.66","9.31","17.55","8.24","2.66","5.59","0.00","11.70","6.65","4.79","1.86","1.33","3.72","4.52","3.72","0.80","0.00","0.53","0.00","4.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.23","2.66","2.66","1.33","1.60","2.39","1.86","1.60","1.33","0.00","0.27","0.53","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.59","0.80","1.86","2.66","1.06","0.53","1.86","7.98","1.60","12.50","1.33","8.24","2.93","6.38","0.00","0.80","2.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.90","4.79","3.72","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.06","0.27","0.53","0.00","0.53","1919","9.28","25.133333333333333","595","373","16","47.83","14.2","12.4","13.87","15.3","106","13.125","22.687292225201073","214","22.27","7","0.43","0","14","5","41","1","62","27","7","0","8","74","15","0","33","0","0","3","1","8","3","0","0","7","0","16","1","11","16","12","4","2","3","0","2"

"http://www.dnaindia.com/sports/column-is-bcci-not-accountable-to-people-and-government-2039309","Is BCCI not accountable to people and government?","The average cricket lover always saw it coming. But N Srinivasan and his bunch of merrymakers thought otherwise. After all, several Union ministers, chief ministers and ministers, Members of Parliament from various political parties are literally prostrating before the BCCI's top bosses for important positions.Over the years, various questions asked by me in Parliament have been stonewalled. The cosy club in BCCI never cared about the government. It is only natural that the cricket lover looked towards the Supreme Court for deliverance.The apex court has observed that Chennai Super Kings should be ""terminated without further inquiry"" because one of its officials, Gurunath Meiyappan, has been indicted for betting by the Justice Mukul Mudgal Committee. Srinivasan is himself facing allegations of conflict of interest. The court wanted to know the exact shareholding pattern of India Cements, the owners of CSK.According to the IPL rulebook, if a team official is found indulging in corrupt activities like betting and match-fixing, the franchise can be terminated. The Mudgal panel has said in its report that Meiyappan was a team owner and indulged in betting and sharing team information.The apex court even went to the extent of terming Meiyappan's leaking team information to ""insider trading"".

Now let me highlight the government's reply to to my starred question on November 25...The BCCI is an autonomous body registered under the Societies Registration Act. Recognition has not been granted by the government. However, given that the ICC recognises the BCCI as the apex national federation responsible for promotion of cricket in India, a team selected by BCCI is considered as the Indian team. The ministry only grants the BCCI permission to participate in international events and for holding international matches in India at no cost to the government. This is subject to clearances from the ministry of external affairs from a political angle and the ministry of home affairs from the security one.During the past, controversies surrounding the BCCI, including betting and match-fixing in the IPL, have come to the notice of the government. Various agencies of the government, like Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax Department and Directorate General of Service Tax, have conducted probes.That the BCCI is a public body — refer to Section 2(h) of the RTI Act — was raised before the Central Information Commission (CIC) which, in turn, sought the views of the government. This government has already made written submissions to CIC on December 16, 2011, and January 9, 2012, pleading to bring the BCCI under the RTI Act. The CIC issued a notice for hearing the matter on July 25, 2013. The BCCI then filed a writ petition (WP No.20229/2013) in the Madras high court. The court ordered an interim stay of all other proceedings.

However, there are a few questions that come to mind. Let us all ask our administrators the following:1) Selecting players to represent India is a state function. Why should it be left to a body that's not recognised by the Indian government and vice versa?2) Surely, if the ICC recognises the BCCI as the apex national federation responsible for promotion of cricket in India, the Indian government, in the prevalent exceptional circumstances, can apply for recognition by floating an NSF for cricket. In one shot, the government can get rid of this monstrous, arrogant and irresponsible body.3) The very fact that the BCCI requires political approval from the external affairs ministry and security clearance from the home ministry means that the government can exercise control over the BCCI. So why does it seem so helpless? Is it not true that powerful politicians do not allow any control over this uncontrolled body?4) Is the BCCI absolutely free to do what it likes, without any care in the world for norms and issues of good governance? Is it not accountable to the Indian people or to the government? It is shameful to learn that several government agencies have carried out long-drawn probes against the BCCI. But the fact is that no action has been taken.5) It is surprising that despite the government having expressly stated in writing to CIC on December 16, 2011, and subsequently on January 9, 2012, that the BCCI may be brought under RTI Act, even the CIC seems to be as helpless as the Indian government to do so. It seems that the ploy to get a stay from Madras high court has succeeded in putting a lid on such an attempt to bring sanity in the functioning of the BCCI. The logical question is: what steps have been taken by the CIC or the Indian government to get this stay vacated?I bet the average cricket lover would love to get some answers.","2014-11-29 05:15:00","0","63.0","12.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","794","97.30","52.02","21.41","68.55","27.38","27.46","77.71","46.47","5.54","1.01","0.50","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","4.53","12.09","15.37","7.18","2.52","4.28","1.39","12.47","3.65","1.89","0.63","2.77","2.02","3.53","2.90","0.63","0.25","0.00","0.25","4.53","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.38","9.95","3.53","1.01","0.76","2.52","1.39","2.39","0.76","0.50","0.25","0.00","1.39","0.63","0.13","0.38","0.13","11.84","2.14","1.64","7.30","1.89","0.25","3.27","8.44","0.38","10.83","2.14","6.42","2.64","6.80","2.02","0.25","1.64","1.01","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","12.97","4.41","4.66","0.25","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.38","0.50","0.50","1.39","0.13","3832","8.11","27.517241379310345","1232","777","42","52.7","13.3","10.5","12.18","11.7","175","5.857142857142857","18.409009009009008","367","23.41","35","0.45","0","19","22","109","0","108","57","0","0","8","122","89","0","38","1","0","15","5","29","0","0","1","27","0","30","16","21","31","10","32","3","2","0","2"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-budget2014-to-tax-and-please-retrospective-taxation-and-vodafone-1998059","#Budget2014: To tax and please- Retrospective taxation and Vodafone","“To tax and to please, no more than to love and to be wise, is not given to men”. - by Edmund Burke

The Tale

One can hardly imagine a situation wherein “X” an articulate business man goes to buy a shop for an amount “Y” and in return gets to a situation wherein after consulting his financial advisors and lawyers; he does not pay any tax as he is advised. “X” simultaneously gets to know the way things happen in the “jurisdiction” where his shop is located when he is asked to pay a hefty amount as tax. The person again takes financial and legaladvice goes to court and gets an order in his favour. Issue settled? Not exactly.

The government of the jurisdiction comes out with a retrospective amendment to change the meaning of the law itself and to undermine the decision of the court. Suddenly X finds himself in a precarious position as to whether the decision to invest in the jurisdiction was a sound one or not.

This may look as a distant and confusing story but it indeed is the greatest saga of the way tax is collected in India and how an investment by a Multinational Telecom Company (Vodafone) is plagued by the notices from the courts and Income Tax Department. It can be said that Vodafone has got its own version of the Zoozoo following it with the slogan “Wherever you go we follow”. Though the aggression of the tax authorities since last few years in mopping of tax revenues to close in the bulging hole in government’s coffers has also converted efficient tax paying multinationals like Nokia into a tax defaulter but the case of Vodafone is unparalleled.

Prologue to the story

It all started long time ago in 2007 When Vodafone popularly known as Vodafone International Holdings BV decided to expand its footprint in the Indian mobile phone market by buying out Hutchison Essar. But instead of taking a straight forward route it decided on going around the tree. It’s subsidiaries exchanged cash for shares with a similar holding company for Hutchinson Essar, in far of Cayman Islands. (Yes while most of us might not know this but you can actually buy a Company having its operations in India without actually coming to India). It was clear that Vodafone believed that they were not liable to pay any tax in India because the deal was an offshore one clearly complying with the Indian laws as far as the matters of taxation were concerned. It was then that Vodafone actually discovered the Zoozoo in form of the Indian tax authorities.

The Legal Battle

A protracted legal battle followed, involving the Bombay High Court (which even gave a judgment in favour of the tax authorities) and then the Supreme Court. It was finally held by the Supreme Court in 2012 that the deal was within the four corners of law. The Court while interpreting section 9 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (as it stood before the 2012 amendment) also asked the authorities to “look at” a transaction and not look “through it”. It was believed that the Zoozoo had been finally laid to rest.

It was then that the Government of the day came out with a retrospective amendment to the Income Tax Act, 1961 incorporating the concept of look through into Section 9 clearly negating the effect of the Supreme Court judgment for Vodafone. An international outcry followed criticizing the move with even the British Prime Minister raising the issue with his Indian counterpart. The incumbent Finance Minister (The Current President of India) took a hard stand when he aired his views on prime time television by stating that India was not a tax haven and the government was within its rights to realize revenue due to it.As a result of bad international publicity, an expert committee under Dr.Parthasharthi Shome was constituted to review the tax laws which eventually came out with a clear cut report stating that the law related to tax has to be clear and devoid of any retrospective changes. It suggested the government to do away with retrospective changes in the law to make policy clear.The expert committee recommended that the amendment which is not merely clarificatory in nature should be made prospectively and where it is made with retrospective effect, the payer should not be proceeded against and the provisions be applied to the payee to whom the income actually belongs.

Even though there was a change of guard at the Ministry of Finance but Mr. Chidambaram also accepted the view taken by the tax authorities. The retrospective amendment was further followed by whole scale aggressiveness on part of revenue authorities to close the revenue deficit. As a result other Multinationals like Nokia also faced a lot of heat in form of Show Cause notices and resulting court cases. Nokia had to face a situation wherein their deal with Microsoft to sell of the mobile phone business went into jeopardy as a result of the department threatening to attach the factory in Tamil Nadu. Finally the day was saved by a stay from the Delhi High Court.

Meanwhile the Vodafone saga started getting more bitter with the government trying to settle the tax issue by having close room discussions. These were again followed by breakdown of talks and Vodafone threatening Arbitration under the Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (Also known as BIPA between India and the Netherlands)or conciliation under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNICITRAL) rules

The Indian Government has not yet relented in its stand but with a new government sworn in, the expectation to do away with retrospective amendments has gained momentum.Legal Validity of retrospective tax amendments

The Supreme Court has held in the case of Ujagar Prints v. Union of India that a competent legislature can always validate a law which has been declared by courts to be invalid and such a validating law can always be made retrospective. It was also observed by the Supreme Court in MunicipalCommittee, Patiala v. Model Town Residents Assn. and Ors, that‘the basis of the law can always be altered retrospectively”. It can thus be concluded that the interpretation of constitutional laws with respect to the retrospective amendments clearly gives the authority to Parliament to change the laws retrospectively.

Having come to the said conclusion we can clearly move to the fact that even though the government of the day might have the adequate parliamentary strength for an amendment but would it be a viable decision economically?

The Final Decision

The Tax AdministrationReform Commission, headed by Parthasarathi Shome, has again stated in its recent report to the new Finance Minister Arun Jaitley that the retrospective amendments to tax laws should be avoided as a principle. The commission has also come up with an argument that Countries such as Brazil, Greece, Mexico, Mozambique, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, Romania, Russia, Slovenia and Sweden have prohibited retrospective taxation. It has been the case of countless other foreign institutional investors that for foreign direct investment to come into India at a high speed, India needs to make its law clear and prospective in its application.

The retrospective tax ball has now fallen into the court of the current Indian Finance minister with a looming budget in sight. It will be seen that whether the new government which has come to power on the promise of good days for development and economic growth takes a call in favour of sending the message straightaway or would it stick to the high handed way of its predecessor in realization of tax revenue at all costs.

The words of Edmund Burke would clearly be tested once the Indian Finance Minister gets up to present his budget in the Parliament.","2014-06-26 21:05:00","0","79.0","15.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","288.0","0.0","2.0","3","1301","96.75","51.23","27.70","35.15","29.57","24.37","80.78","49.65","6.15","1.38","0.00","0.23","0.15","0.85","0.15","4.77","12.07","16.68","6.61","4.00","5.53","1.08","11.99","3.38","2.00","1.15","0.92","1.23","2.46","1.46","0.92","0.31","0.61","0.00","3.84","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.00","9.68","2.31","1.77","0.61","1.08","1.46","2.84","1.61","1.08","0.38","0.08","0.23","0.08","0.08","0.00","0.00","7.46","0.61","1.00","5.23","1.08","0.46","4.53","6.84","1.08","13.76","2.46","7.46","4.00","8.22","0.31","0.15","5.46","0.46","0.08","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","8.30","3.61","1.77","0.00","0.08","0.15","0.00","0.08","1.38","0.15","1.08","0.00","6261","8.14","31.047619047619047","1979","1296","47","51.92","14.3","12.9","11.67","15.6","257","17.5","20.9720987654321","537","26.38","8","0.46","0","35","11","165","1","183","86","1","2","18","199","154","1","44","0","0","34","16","65","2","0","8","50","0","51","46","28","44","4","40","7","1","0","7"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/sports/comment-if-srinivasan-s-appointment-as-icc-chairman-was-not-depressing-enough-lou-vincent-comes-up-with-a-confession-1999009","If Srinivasan's appointment as ICC chairman was not depressing enough, Lou Vincent comes up with a confession","""My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat. I have abused my position as a professional sportsman on a number of occasions by choosing to accept money in fixing”, said former New Zealand cricketer Lou Vincent, before being banned for life. The credibility of our gentlemen’s game has come under scrutiny at regular intervals in the recent past and this is another dent in it.

In 1995, Mark Waugh and Shane Warne had passed information about the pitch and weather to a bookie. In 2000, Hansie Cronje confessed his involvement in match fixing, which shocked the world. Not long after that, Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja were banned for life and five years respectively. Former Pakistan captain Saleem Malik was also in the same boat.

In 2007, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, during the World Cup, was found dead in his hotel room under mysterious circumstances, to say the least. Some facts and reports after his death did not suggest a natural death.

However, these are relatively older examples. In 2010, Mohammad Asif, Mohammad Amir, and Salman Butt were banned for life. Then came last year’s IPL scandal, which still lingers on. The alleged perjury of MS Dhoni, arrest of Gurunath Meiyyapan under the involvement in heavy betting and trading of inside information to bookies, and interrogation of Raj Kundra were accompanied by it. Moreover, after the hullaballoo over the murky IPL-6, IPL-7 was shifted to UAE of all the places, which was the biggest black comedy after Jaane Bhi Do Yaron.

Recently, Ian Chappell, writing for Cricinfo, remarked, ‘Given the damning information overheard in cricket corridors - even without cocking an ear - and Ed Hawkins' informative book, Bookie Gambler Fixer Spy, the officials are hard-pressed to claim lack of available information as a defense. Many of Vincent's allegations involve T20 matches, which should concern administrators considering the high value placed on that format to fortify the game's financial future’.

Ironically, as the graph of dark days for cricket sees an upward surge, it finds a man called N Srinivasan, aka conflict of interest, as the chairman of the ICC, a body which is responsible to clean up the rot in the system. However, BCCI, unsurprisingly, believes that ‘The responsibility of guiding the game in these challenging times could not have found a better leader than Mr. Srinivasan’.

Let us see if BCCI’s statement can be mocked here.

Leaving aside the fact that Meiyyapan happens to be Srinivasan’s son-in-law; it is too hard to overlook that he was the Team Principal of Chennai Super Kings, the IPL team owned by Srinivasan. The report submitted by Mudgal committee, led by the retired High Court Judge Mukul Mudgal, not only indicted Meiyyapan but also held Srinivasan's company, India Cements, responsible for Meiyyapan's actions and stated that the Chennai Super Kings franchise was in violation of the agreement, which may result in its termination. The Supreme Court of India stripped off Srinivasan’s BCCI presidency too, as it found ""nauseating"" that he should hold on to the post despite various courts reprimanding him. A case against him is pending in the Supreme Court on grounds of conflict of interest as well, because the initial BCCI regulation, which was tweaked unfairly later on, did not allow BCCI members to own stakes in IPL teams. Apart from that, Srinivasan was one of the main investors in several of Jaganmohan Reddy's ""suitcase companies"" and is a subject of investigation in the Rs 3000 crore-corruption case.

The angst over Srinivasan’s appointment is also about the formation of the ‘Big Three Club’, which has given India, England and Australia a lion’s share of the profits and a substantially more power than the rest. Srinivasan was the driving force behind it.

When a person with as rotten a past is India’s chief administrator in the field of Cricket, it fortifies the popular belief that India is plagued with corruption and has very few credible names. It is not just a sad truth about the game but a reflection of the society.

Four years back, when three Pakistani players were found guilty of spot fixing, a frustrated Shane Watson had remarked, ""Maybe they [ICC] don't want to get to the bottom of it [fixing] because it might run too deep.""

However, now we are expected to believe that something that the ICC has not been able to fix for the longest time would be fixed under the leadership of a man who has espoused shady deals and controversies with a frequency little less than that of a sunrise.

Talk about irony and you will find few better examples than this.","2014-07-01 00:35:00","0","73.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","773","94.43","58.19","22.96","39.66","24.94","24.06","75.94","46.44","6.99","2.07","0.52","0.39","0.13","0.91","0.13","4.92","9.57","15.91","6.99","3.49","5.05","1.16","11.00","6.73","4.14","1.42","1.55","1.42","3.88","2.33","1.55","0.13","0.78","0.13","6.21","0.13","0.00","0.13","1.68","8.41","2.59","0.78","1.03","1.03","0.52","2.72","1.94","0.52","0.78","0.52","0.91","0.39","0.52","0.00","0.00","7.76","1.81","1.55","4.14","0.65","0.52","4.79","5.43","0.78","12.68","1.03","7.24","4.40","4.14","2.46","0.13","1.16","0.65","0.52","0.39","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","16.43","4.14","6.86","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","1.03","1.42","2.33","0.00","0.52","3689","8.6","25.451612903225808","1136","769","31","54.76","12.5","11.8","11.96","14.5","182","9.0","21.386840052015607","443","22.97","20","0.45","0","20","11","84","1","114","51","4","3","8","124","119","0","33","1","0","20","7","37","1","0","3","16","0","21","29","15","26","10","20","8","1","0","2"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/sports/column-whose-business-is-it-anyway-1972798","Whose business is it anyway?","Thank God for small mercies! Srinivasan is ready to 'step aside' (not step down!) – as he did last year, to ensure fair probe into the IPL betting and spot-fixing scandal, the Supreme Court (SC) was told on Thursday.

In response to BCCI's proposal, the apex court said it has to think hard for the benefit of cricket and pass order. BCCI has also reportedly offered to the SC that the Chennai Police may conduct a time-bound probe into the scam.

Meanwhile, the petitioner's lawyer Harish Salve said MS Dhoni was guilty of corrupt conduct, and gave false statements to Justice Mukul Mudgal panel. Salve has also accused Dhoni's deposition on Meiyappan as being incorrect and in face of such allegations, CSK should be suspended.

The sealed cover report had talked about the alleged involvement of ""six India capped players"" in IPL irregularities. The bench intended to open the sealed cover report and read it out in open court. The bench acceded to the request not to do so, but dismissed BCCI's promise to take corrective measures based on the recommendations in the Justice Mudgal panel report to rid cricket of its maladies.

The way the judge admonished the BCCI legal counsel CA Sundaram and showed him a portion of the confidential report, it may not be beyond the realms of possibility that Srinivasan's name also figures in the probe committee report. More importantly, the court has said it will pass an order if Srinivasan doesn't step down. The BCCI's strategy to adopt a wait-and-act policy is difficult to decipher.

If the Supreme Court indeed passes an order against Srinivasan, his entire career as a sports chief will be ruined. At least morally, he will lose face to represent India at the ICC.

In 2004, Srinivasan had ganged up with Lalit Modi and Sharad Pawar to overthrow Jagmohan Dalmiya. Today, Modi and Srinivasan are enemies, and Dalmiya became interim BCCI chief when Srinivasan stepped aside for a few weeks last year. BCCI, I feel, could find itself in a similar position if SC appoints an independent person to run the board till all the IPL scams are resolved and punishment meted out.

It would have been advisable for Srinivasan to have quit and appoint a man from among the vice-presidents to run the board. This would have been an 'honourable' solution that would have also not hindered his appointment in the ICC because there was still no conviction. It is foolhardy to defy the highest court.

Further, the SC has proposed that Sunil Gavaskar take over as the interim chief of BCCI in place of Srinivasan. The SC bench also wants no one associated with Srinivasan's company India Cements to be part of BCCI or IPL.

I really wonder if there is any modicum of respect left for any institution in India. How is it that BCCI has come to believe that it is above the law of the land?

The constitution of BCCI, as indeed that of state associations, allows the same guys to have a vice-like grip on the associations. Many of the associations by virtue of being not-for-profit companies, abuse the system of proxies, and retain control by controlling the memberships.

The BCCI uses India in their logo, they use government land for stadium, they use state security for conducting matches, yet they are not agreeable to come under the RTI Act! The politicians who are now entrenched in BCCI ensure that the government cannot act against BCCI.

What is then the way out?

The Supreme Court is the only hope for cricket, not these smart administrators and politicians. If SC orders its own monitored inquiry, on the lines of Justice Mudgal Committee, truth will come tumbling out. Action has to be taken on the directions of only the Supreme Court and no one else.

In the meantime, a person of the eminence, credibility and administrative competence of Bishan Bedi or Mohinder Amarnath should be asked to run BCCI's affairs. The public will then look forward to clean cricket. It is all left to Supreme Court to now crack the whip, starting from today.","2014-03-28 07:45:00","0","56.0","5.0","2.0","0.0","50.0","0.0","144.0","196.0","0.0","274.0","0.0","1.0","1","694","94.36","50.58","16.39","64.02","19.28","20.61","75.36","47.55","5.04","1.59","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.72","0.58","3.46","10.09","15.85","8.21","3.31","5.91","1.73","14.55","3.17","1.73","0.58","0.58","1.44","4.03","3.03","1.01","0.14","0.43","0.29","5.04","0.00","0.14","0.14","1.01","9.37","1.59","1.87","1.87","2.16","1.15","2.88","1.15","0.29","0.43","0.43","0.29","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.36","0.58","1.01","5.76","0.86","0.58","2.88","9.37","1.59","12.97","2.31","7.35","3.17","4.32","0.72","0.00","0.43","0.14","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.00","13.40","4.47","4.32","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.43","1.15","0.29","1.87","0.58","0.00","3192","8.19","19.52777777777778","1000","687","36","60.55","10.8","9.6","10.68","10.8","157","7.583333333333334","18.78119359534207","343","18.11","33","0.46","0","19","2","78","0","90","38","0","2","13","118","96","0","26","1","0","19","5","33","1","0","5","28","0","42","19","7","23","9","23","1","2","0","1"

The Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) price index, which measures monthly price changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy, meat and sugar, averaged 203.9 points in July, down 4.4 points or 2.1 percent from June.

The figure was 3.5 points or 1.7 percent below July 2013.

FAO's cereal price index averaged 185.4 points in July, down 10.7 points or 5.5 percent from June, and as much as 36.9 points below the year-ago level, mainly due to excellent production prospects in many major producing countries and the expectation of abundant exportable supplies, FAO said.

FAO raised its outlook for global cereal production by 18 million tonnes to 2.498 billion tonnes.

FAO revised its estimate for world cereals stocks at the end of the 2015 season to 604.1 million tonnes, 5 percent higher than its previous estimate of 576 million tonnes.","2014-08-07 14:01:00","0","66.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","50.0","0.0","148.0","201.0","0.0","285.0","0.0","2.0","3","178","98.93","45.52","66.74","25.77","29.67","21.35","68.54","29.78","2.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.81","5.06","16.29","0.56","0.00","6.18","0.00","2.25","2.25","2.25","1.12","11.80","3.37","1.12","0.56","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.56","1.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.30","0.56","2.81","0.56","2.81","0.00","2.25","3.93","0.00","1.12","0.56","5.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.06","3.93","0.00","0.56","3.37","0.00","0.00","3.37","0.00","1.12","21.35","1.69","11.24","8.43","3.93","0.00","0.00","3.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.61","3.37","7.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.12","0.00","1.12","1.12","0.00","846","7.47","31.833333333333332","256","176","17","69.38","8.8","6.2","10.65","7.6","37","3.125","14.56909090909091","111","28.0","5","0.29","0","9","32","9","0","22","14","1","0","0","34","17","0","23","0","0","0","3","6","0","0","1","3","0","0","11","2","0","1","1","2","0","0","0"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-the-cpi-m-appears-to-be-confused-over-its-own-history-2031856","The CPI-M appears to be confused over its own history","The CPI (M) general secretary Prakash Karat’s 2,721-word article on the 50th anniversary of the first party congress after the CPI split — both in 1964 — has indulged in falsification about the birth of the Communist Party of India. But he is not the first among the CPI(M) leaders to have resorted to historical distortion. The author of this historical distortion was Muzaffar Ahmed, one of the founders of CPI.

Almost immediately after the split of CPI in 1964, Ahmed discovered that the Indian Communist Party (CP) was founded on October 17, 1920, in Tashkent and among the founders were MN Roy, Abani Mukherji, Mohammad Shafiq Siddiqui, Rafiq Ahmed, MPBT Acharya, Evelyn Trent Roy and Rosa Fitingof. Ahmed published a facsimile of front page of Vanguard (editor MN Roy), organ of Indian CP, which stated that the party was a section of Comintern. (Comintern affiliates were called ‘sections’). But this is a half-truth. There is no direct proof that the party, founded in Tashkent, was a section of Comintern. Comintern scholar AB Reznikov, too, stated that the Indian CP was never recognised by Comintern as a section of Comintern. Roy, one must note, was not a representative of Indian CP in the Comintern. He represented the CP of Mexico of which he was one of the founders.

Karat should have verified facts instead of parroting Ahmed or his predecessors like P Sundarayya and HK Surjeet. In 1958, BT Ranadive, one of the founding politburo members of CPI, officially communicated on behalf of the undivided CPI to the PKI (CP of Indonesia) that the party was born at the Kanpur conference (December-end 1925). He wrote in as a sequel to a detailed discussion and a unanimous decision, thereof, at a meeting of CPI’s central executive council (CEC), subsequently endorsed by the CPI’s national council (NC). Ranadive was then a member of both CEC and NC and Ahmed was in the NC panel. Sundarayya, Surjeet, EMS and Jyoti Basu were present in the aforesaid CEC and NC meetings.

Karat argues, parroting the top leaders in the CPI split-process, that the party was split asunder as a sequel to inner-party battle, and not out of inspiration by the CP of China. This, too, is a suppression of truth. True, there were sharp — at times bitter – inner-party squabbles, often crossing the comradely exchange of views, but the break was not inevitable. It was the CPC that kept inspiring the Left faction to quit the CPI and form a new one, as an appendage of Mao line as it branded the majority of the CPI brass as stooges of Soviet revisionism. This was very much pronounced after the Chinese aggression of India (October 1962). In March 1964, an editorial in Renmin Ribao (People's Daily), captioned ‘Mirror for Revisionists’ directly attacked the then CPI chairman S A Dange and appealed to party members to chuck out “the Dange clique”, which the editorial wrote, ""believes that Nehru and his Congress Party can be depended upon to realise socialism, what need is there for a Communist Party controlled by Dange and company?”. This was widely circulated inside the CPI by ‘pro-Chinese’ faction in the run- up to the decision to float a new party at a convention in Tenali in July 1964. All this is now an open secret.

The rest is history but some in the Left faction in the NC like Bhupesh Gupta, Ranen Sen and Sohan Singh Josh did not join the splitters as they believed that potentials of inner-party struggle didn’t yet run out. They remained in the CPI. History, Karat knows, was called by Hegel as “ a slaughterhouse’.

The other day when I was going to Europe, I was passing through Marseilles, where a bull-fight was being held. All the Englishmen in the steamer were mad with excitement, abusing and criticising the whole thing as cruel. When I reached England, I heard of a party of prize-fighters who had been to Paris, and were kicked out unceremoniously by the French, who thought prize-fighting very brutal. When I hear these things in various countries, I begin to understand the marvellous saying of Christ: “Judge not that ye be not judged.” The more we learn, the more we find out how ignorant we are, how multiform and multi-sided is this mind of man.

I did not vote in 2004 or 2009. I have lost all faith in the system,” says Ashok Mochi.

We are sitting on a footpath in Ahmedabad’s Dilli Darwaja area where Mochi repairs shoes. He has painted the wall he sits against and hung a clock on it. A tattered cloth stretched over a pole creates a makeshift roof, giving shade. This is the only corner in the world Mochi lays any claim to. He does not own it, nor does he pay any rent for it. But it is his inheritance nonetheless. His father, who passed away when Mochi was all of 10, used to repair shoes from this very place. Other than the monsoons, Mochi can be found in this corner every day.

“VIP convoys pass by here regularly. Other street vendors are removed when they come, but no one bothers me because my corner is hardly noticeable. Advani, Modi, President Abdul Kalam sab aake chale gaye mere saamne se. Main kaam karta raha.”

Mochi turned 39 on April 13, “one day before Babasaheb’s birthday,” he says emphatically. He lives nearby, in Shahpur, in a single room for a monthly rent of Rs 1,000. “Mostly Dalits live there,” he says. “Dalits, who are poorer than everyone else.”

Mochi speaks loudly, assertively no matter what he is saying. He is a proud man who orders several rounds of tea and packets of mineral water for us but refuses to entertain my offer to pay for them. Customers stop by, flinging a chappal or a sandal on the ground before him. Mochi picks it up without a pause in our conversation, fixes it, hands it back and takes his Rs 5 fee for the job without so much as looking up. A customer interjects while Mochi is telling me his story, to ask him to hurry up with his boots. Mochi gives him a piece of his mind, as he does to a passer-by who asks for directions. He hates being interrupted.

“I am the most educated man in my area. I passed my SSC (Class 10) exams. My older brother’s children who are from a new generation also haven’t studied beyond Class 7,” he says. “I have always been very fond of reading but I can’t read VIP books like novels so I subscribe to one paper and borrow two from the neighbouring shop. I read three Gujarati newspapers daily,” he tells me. Not difficult to believe given how well he knows his current affairs.

“This is a reserved seat,” says Mochi. “The BJP candidate is the sitting MP, Kirit Solanki.” He does not care to remember the name of the Congress candidate as he is not going to vote for him in any case. “The Congress is very weak in Gujarat. The BJP is not too strong either, but they take advantage of the Congress’s weakness. They have no leader who can match up to Modi,” he explains.

Mochi won’t vote for the BJP either. “I am a poor man. But I am not a weak man. I don’t get swept up by waves,” he says. “Solanki hasn’t shown his face here in the last five years but he will win because people here don’t vote on local or caste issues. They vote on national issues. This is why regional parties don’t do well. After the 2002 riots, all votes here are cast on religious lines and Hindus are a majority, so the BJP will win.”

Not because of development? “Please talk about development with those who claim to have seen it. People more educated than me are driving rickshaws because they cannot get jobs. And people who are 10th pass like me have become government clerks. Nothing happens without paying bribes or getting a politician’s recommendation. All I have seen in the name of development in this area is the riverfront being made like Chowpatty (Mumbai) and two over-bridges. It has nothing to do with poor people like me.”

Mochi is single. He did not get married because he would not want his wife or children to suffer the poverty he grew up in. In his twenties he was in love with a girl in his neighbourhood but she was from a slightly higher caste – an OBC, so her family did not approve of the match. She was married off elsewhere and he gave up on the idea of marriage altogether. “I cannot even afford a wedding let alone a marriage,” he exclaims.

Mochi makes Rs 4,000 in a month, on an average. He would have liked to start a shop of his own selling readymade footwear, but he does not believe that will ever happen. He will never be able to afford it. He will stay where he is. “I am no ordinary face. I am a face that is world famous but has any political party ever come to ask after me? No. Then what will they do for ordinary poor people?” he asks.

His face became “world famous” in 2002 when a picture of his was carried in a daily newspaper – wearing a saffron band around his forehead, an iron rod in one hand, arms outstretched, fists clenched, mouth open, letting out a war cry. The picture became symbolic of the violence that followed the burning of a train carrying kar sevaks in Godhra, of the thousands of rioters who rampaged across Gujarat killing, looting, and raping Muslims and breaking their dwellings, mosques and shops.

The anger we see in the picture, Mochi says, was more about the disruption of his daily life and work rather than hatred for a community. At the time he thought it was one of the “regular riots” that erupt over small issues in the city. He did not realise it was a “high-level danga,” he claims. He tied a saffron band only so the other rioters didn’t mistake him for a Muslim because of his beard.

Mochi claims the photographer asked him about his views on the Godhra incident and said he wanted to take a picture, so he posed for him. He wasn’t a part of any mob, nor did he riot. A case was lodged against him only because of the picture, he claims. He spent Rs 10,000 over two years on a lawyer and court fees before he was finally acquitted. But the prosecution has appealed against the acquittal so now he has to fight the case in the High Court.

There are many discrepancies in his account of what happened on that day. In an earlier interview he had confessed to acts of assault and arson to “avenge my Hindu brothers’ lives”, a statement he denies having made. The account given to me by Sebastian D’Souza, the photographer who took the now iconic image, is also at odds with Mochi’s.

“There was this big mob. They were in a frenzy. I saw some policemen there and asked them why they were not doing anything to stop them. The police told me, “Hum ko order hai, dekhne ka bhi nahin (We have been asked to look the other way). The mob was burning vehicles. After that the whole mob moved in the direction of a mosque they burnt. People were telling me as they passed by, “Come with us.” But I didn’t want to do that. I went on shooting from far. I could do so because I had a 300mm lens. I would really not ask anyone to pose for me, or even talk to anyone, in such a situation. I saw Mochi climb up on a signboard and spread his hands. It seemed as if he was saying, “I am the king.” He looked threatening. I don’t remember seeing whether he actually burnt something or beat someone up. I saw him, I shot him in the middle of taking many other pictures. That’s it,” says D’Souza.

There is no way for me to know what Mochi did or did not do on that day either, but he desperately wants his version of events to be true. In his version there is no hatred or suspicion between communities, the Muslims in his area regard him as one of their own and all is well. An idea contradicted by his own evaluation of the political climate in the city. “Religion is toxic, it has intoxicated people here. They are told that the minorities are being appeased and this upsets them. After 2002, when Modi was criticised, he told the people of Gujarat that the attacks on him are attacks on them, on Gujarat ki asmita. He is a political mind. He knows how to manipulate Gujaratis. But I am on to him because I am also a Gujarati. I know how he thinks. Not that I have ever met him. But I have heard him talk. He had come to give a speech in my area. The stage was put up exactly where my picture was taken in 2002. Until 2007, he used to talk of Hindutva, of Sohrabuddin (Sheikh’s) encounter, of Pakistan. From 2012, he only talks of development. Because he knows that to win India, Hindutva is not enough. Political mind,” he says pointing a finger to his forehead for emphasis.

Mochi thinks Modi is Gujarat’s “majboori” not “​marzi”. That if the Gujarati people had a real option they would choose neither the Congress nor the BJP. “One new option had come up with Arvind Kejriwal and the public supported him in Delhi. But he proved to an irresponsible leader. Usko jawaabdaari ka bhaan hona chahiye naa. Why did he resign? Why didn’t he stay and fight? Isliye thappad khaa raha hai ab.”

Mochi’s disillusionment with political parties went a step further in March this year. He was invited to attend the launch of Qutubuddin Ansari’s biography in Kerala. Ansari became the face of the terrorised Muslim in 2002 in another iconic photograph published at the time, in which he was seen crying, pleading for his life with folded hands. Mochi accepted the invitation and travelled out of Gujarat for the first time ever. Only, when he got there, he found that the event was organised by the CPI (M). Over the next five days he was taken to several such events where leaders of the party criticised the BJP and the Congress. Mochi would be on stage but he could not understand much of what was being said in Malayalam. He was reduced to a symbol yet again.

Even so, he is grateful for the experience. “Muslims from there thought I was a shaitaan (a monster) earlier. Once they found out I was an ordinary person they gave me a lot of respect. My image became okay again,” he tells me.

There is nothing more Mochi wants from his life. There is nothing else he is looking forward to. “Except voting,” he says, to my surprise.“This year I will vote after a decade because of NOTA (None of the Above – a new option in electronic voting machines (EVMs) that allows voters to reject all candidates),” he explains. “It is a very important tool. I know that in Gujarat not many people will use it because here people vote for parties, not MP candidates. But I will use it. In the years to come, if more and more people use NOTA, political parties will be forced to stop repeating the same bad candidates over and over again,” he explains. “Only then will we have a real choice in India.”","2014-04-26 20:15:00","0","81.0","24.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","287.0","0.0","2.0","3","1936","65.35","62.37","20.06","19.59","13.44","15.60","83.42","54.65","14.77","10.95","3.31","0.36","0.00","6.20","1.08","3.82","7.59","13.64","8.63","4.55","5.27","3.00","16.74","3.62","2.07","1.70","2.07","2.01","3.82","1.70","2.12","0.31","0.93","0.41","13.89","0.52","0.10","0.26","6.46","11.16","1.96","1.70","0.88","1.60","1.14","4.80","2.74","1.29","0.93","0.46","1.76","0.98","0.52","0.05","0.15","7.23","1.50","0.83","4.34","0.88","0.31","5.42","9.40","0.88","12.96","1.60","7.64","3.87","2.17","0.77","0.31","1.19","0.77","0.10","0.36","0.00","0.15","0.05","0.15","0.00","17.67","7.23","4.55","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.15","3.25","1.39","0.83","0.00","8029","6.71","14.518518518518519","2569","1930","144","83.25","8.4","5.0","7.42","5.8","295","5.3125","13.4739896373057","741","13.65","59","0.53","0","58","34","182","0","234","100","6","0","21","269","125","3","86","0","0","187","42","99","5","1","13","45","0","78","92","38","51","56","90","6","15","0","16"

He is currently a Rajya Sabha MP and a general secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC). He has been in charge of the party in UP, Kerala, Lakshwadeep and Karnataka. He has also worked extensively on the party’s MNREGA scheme and the Forest Rights Act. For the Lok Sabha elections 2014, he has been involved in the ticket distribution process as part of the Election Coordination Committee and is contesting against the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, from Vadodara.

The Wikipedia entry on you and several reports online say you were a member of the RSS until 1995. Is that correct?I was never a member of RSS. I don’t know where they got this. It’s rubbish.

So your first brush with political activism came with trade unions?Yes. From 1969.

You have studied development and worked in the social sector as well as been an activist. What made you join active politics after all this?When you deal with peoples’ issues, especially when issues are related to the state government, when you want to resolve those issues, there is a limit to creating outside pressure either through unions or through organisations. Unless you are in politics or in a political party that governs the state, it is difficult to resolve issues related to the masses. At one stage, I thought I would even form a political party. So in 1992 we had a meeting of 20 people from Gujarat to form a party.

Was this also because, over time, trade unions were beginning to become less relevant?Yes. People like Medha Patkar and other social activists are going that way now. I had been telling them for years that without involvement with political parties you can’t do much. Many of these activists are hobnobbing with political parties behind the scenes, but on the outside they don’t want to associate with them because they want their image to be holy and honest.

Do you feel that the stigma associated with openly endorsing a political party is becoming lesser now?Maybe, maybe not. I didn’t care. Before, when I was not in a political party, I was a good, honest person, according to people. Nobody bothered with me. The day I joined a political party I was being labelled a bad person, a corrupt man.

Why the Congress?I have had good relations with the Congress party for years. People from the Congress supported me very much. In the organisation, also in the trade union, we supported the Congress. I supported them because it was the only party which was close to the ideology we had.

It’s interesting that you say the Congress had the closest ideology to the one you were working towards. Why not the Left Front? Why was that not an option?There was no role of the Left in Gujarat, nor were they interested. They have just confined themselves to the organised sector, banks, insurance and so on, as a trade union, while I was organising forest labourers, agricultural labourers, casual labourers working in mines, construction labourers – all the masses nobody had ever bothered with. In fact, the Left sometimes even played against them, becoming a hindrance to organising them. People associate me with being an NGO-wallah, but in my mind, I’m still the general secretary and president of a number of unions.

How do you balance politics with activism today?It’s reciprocal. What you see at the ground, you take it to the political sphere, raise the issues and present it over there. Like when the Forest Rights Act was first drafted. I took the entire bill into my constituency, called all the people, village people, sarpanches, got it translated into Gujarati, organised meetings for them to suggest changes, if they wanted any. Then I took it back and suggested amendments, which I could do because I was on the committee.

There is the sense that the Congress in Gujarat has not been able to provide a strong opposition to the Modi administration, something that even Mani Shanker Aiyer spoke about in a recent interview. Why do you think this is?I wouldn’t say anything. These are organisational matters. And if I have to make any suggestion, say anything, I would rather call a forum and keep it within the party. I wouldn’t say anything outside.

Fair enough. You have supervised the party in Kerala and Karnataka, both states the party has fared well in. And you were also made in charge in UP. Was that more of a challenge, and if so, why?Every state has its own characteristics, its culture, economic activity, opportunities available, etc., and the political behaviour of individual workers and the organisation on the whole reflect the culture of that particular state. So yes, UP is a big state, highly politically volatile, very active, maybe poor, but very understanding. Kerala has the other extreme of understanding. So, every state is different in its own way, and one has to accept that challenge to work it. It can’t be a readymade solution that applies everywhere.

In Kerala and in Karnataka, despite the rise of regional parties, the Congress has held its own. In UP, ever since regional parties have started becoming stronger, the Congress has lost its ground. How do you analyse this?In UP, over the years, caste emerged as the dominant factor. So, the entire subaltern class have been organising on the basis of caste, because they want recognition. When one caste is recognised, other smaller castes also want to be recognised vis-a-vis the bigger caste. So, there is a proliferation of political parties. A number of political parties in UP are along the lines of caste, and they want representation in order to improve their socio-economic conditions. That is the issue and that is why a situation may arise in the future where all small castes will have to organise into confederation or a federation because they are a very small number. The Congress is the only party which offers upward mobility for all, so you see Siddaramaiah becoming chief minister. He is kuruba, a lower caste.

Coming to your own electoral battle in Vadodra, this is one of the 16 places the Congress held primaries in. Why then did the party decide to not field the winner of the primaries, Narendra Rawat, and field you instead?I was told he expressed his inability to contest. He wrote a letter to the Congress president saying so. I was keen to contest because I find Modi manipulative. He doesn’t have the guts to face those who challenge him, those who question his mind, those who question what is going on. So he has created a kind of facade with the help of financial resources. That’s why there is so much protection around him, not to get him exposed.

Does this wave that people are talking about make your battle tougher? There is a sense that you have little to lose given you are already a Rajya Sabha MP.First, I have political workers and political activists with me so I don’t lose confidence. Second, I feel I will not be able to justify myself if, knowing the things I know about Modi, I don’t expose him. It will be an injustice to this nation and to the people. This vote is not a vote for me, it’s a vote for the next generation. What kind of country do we intend to pass on as an inheritance? That’s what worries me. When you begin to treat people as your subjects and not as human beings, it’s the end of this country. This is precisely what is going to happen. I’m telling you now, on record, if this man ever becomes PM, there would be war between India and Pakistan or Bangladesh – Muslim countries. And there are a lot of outside agencies who will play a role.

Agencies within this country or agencies within Pakistan, Bangladesh you mean?Outside. Agencies which are against the Muslim world.

What are some of the local issues on which you are fighting this election?Local issues are the state itself. Where is the development? I am not asking this, the people of Vadodara are asking this. I had thought this city is his fortress and it hardly has any Congress presence. But when I came and started meeting people, I found that the scenario is quite different. There are pockets of BJP presence, but there is also support for the Congress. It’s all down to the workers. When the workers get motivated, no one can stop them.

And is that something that is happening now in this election with Congress workers?Yes, very much.

You’ve been with the ticket distribution this time. What did your party set out to achieve when you were planning ticket distribution, and to what extent are you happy with the way tickets have been distributed?My job was to look at the background information in every parliamentary constituency and to give that input. That was one component but there were other components also. There were other people as well. Candidate A has one plus point, B may have another, C may have a third. You have to choose. That choosing was done by a number of people, not me alone.

And are you happy with the way the ticket distribution has happened?Oh yes, for the first time...

Why so?In every state, almost every state, young people have been put forth, good people have been put forth. Whether they win or lose is another thing altogether, but the characteristics of the party are changing. Elections are where you have to infuse new blood. And 36%-37 % of our candidates this time must be below 40 or 45 years – no small number in the Congress. And, without any patronage.

How has the national campaign fared so far? What do you think are its strengths and weaknesses?I have not been involved much in the national campaign, just some bits of the manifesto. I am more invested in the seat-wise campaign. What is being done on the ground in constituencies matters. National campaign may affect a floating vote to some extent, maybe some new votes, but it doesn’t affect the communitarian vote.

You were in the news for tearing off a BJP poster recently. What made you do that?I didn’t tear it. Unfortunately the media does not cross-check before reporting such things. The issue was that we should get a fair opportunity to display and to campaign. I have a trade union background. I come from a labour class. I am proud of it. I gave them a day’s notice, saying that by the next day, if I’m not given space I will put my poster over Modi’s. I wrote to the Election Commission, I wrote to the police commissioner, like we give notice of a strike, that if this demand was not made out from such and such day, we will go on strike. I’m not someone to back down. I don’t bother about police and cases and such. I even forget I’m a general secretary, I always feel I’m just an activist.

You were not being given adequate space? Could you elaborate a little?The Election Commission’s directive says even if you’ve given a contract in one area, that contract stands null and void in favour of equal opportunity being given to all candidates for displaying their billboards, hoardings and so on. In Baroda, there are certain roads on which there are 100 poles, roads that 100,000 people use, and all the poles are given to the BJP. So you see only Modi’s posters.

They told us, we can give you a pole outside, where even 5,000 people don’t pass. I said it was unacceptable. I said, let them have one pole with his picture for one pole of ours. If there is a third candidate, let every third pole go to them. But here, the machinery is influenced by the BJP government since they have been around for so many years. Nobody was ready to take a decision, not even the Election Commission of Gujarat. They were being shifty for two-three days because they had to take off Modi’s poster. That was the issue.

Rahul Gandhi has taken on a much larger role in the party in these elections. What are some of the changes you feel he’ll be able to bring to the organisation, and what do you think are his biggest challenges? Many. We’ll have to wait till the outcome of the election.

I meant in the long term, not just for this election.I’m not talking about the long term. The outcome of this election, I feel, will change the very colour of the party, and it should. I feel, with the new challenges in the party’s future, you need to stir the entire water; it just can’t be one odd change here or there.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/report-inner-truth-savour-then-renounce-2026136","Inner Truth: Savour, then renounce","Inactivity should be avoided by all means. Activity always means resistance. Resist all evils, mental and physical; and when you have succeeded in resisting, then will calmness come. It is very easy to say, ""Hate nobody, resist not evil,"" but we know what that kind of thing generally means in practice. When the eyes of society are turned towards us, we may make a show of non-resistance, but in our hearts it is canker all the time. We feel the utter want of the calm of non-resistance; we feel that it would be better for us to resist. If you desire wealth, and know at the same time that the whole world regards him who aims at wealth as a very wicked man, you, perhaps, will not dare to plunge into the struggle for wealth, yet your mind will be running day and night after money. This is hypocrisy and will serve no purpose. Plunge into the world, and then, after a time, when you have suffered and enjoyed all that is in it, will renunciation come; then will calmness come. So fulfil your desire for power and everything else, and after you have fulfilled the desire, will come the time when you will know that they are all very little things; but until you have fulfilled this desire, until you have passed through that activity, it is impossible for you to come to the state of calmness, serenity, and self-surrender. These ideas of serenity and renunciation have been preached for thousands of years; everybody has heard of them from childhood, and yet we see very few in the world who have really reached that stage. I do not know if I have seen twenty persons in my life who are really calm and non-resisting, and I have travelled over half the world.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-analysis-will-the-iraq-conflict-mean-higher-oil-bills-for-india-1996268","Analysis: Will the Iraq conflict mean higher oil bills for India?","Media reports have been dwelling on the possibility of fuel costs going up because of the Iraq conflict with rebels. That, they say, could mean higher prices of almost everything, thus stoking inflation further.

But talk to those in the oil industry, and they shake their heads perplexedly. That’s because an increase in oil bills for India is not very certain at this stage.

First, because the fighting between Iraqi forces and armed rebels is taking place in the North and Northwest. Most of Iraq’s oil wells and the export hubs are in the South and South East. Second, it is not yet certain whether India has long term oil contracts with Iraq, or whether it has opted to purchase on a spot basis. If it has long term contracts, any increase in oil prices could spare India. If they are on a spot basis – well, India could be in a bit of a spot.

Third, only 23% of India’s energy requirement comes from oil.

Much of the rest is met through domestic sourcing. India has conventionally depended largely on coal, though the share of biomass and waste has been increasing steadily. India also imports some of its gas requirement.

Fourth, Iraq accounts for just 13% of India’s fuel import.

And the share of Iran in India’s import basket has been climbing steadily. Fifth, oil prices continue to hover under $105.5 per barrel. The increase in prices, therefore, has not been very significant as of now. Moreover, if India imports petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL), it also exports POL items.

The net difference between the two is not too large to worry a but overmuch. But there is no denying that India is still heavily dependent on oil imports. India is the fourth largest consumer of oil and petroleum products after the United States, China, and Japan. It is also the fourth largest importer of oil and petroleum products.

Hence, India could see some increase in fuel prices. However, the situation may not go out of control thanks to the enormous leakages that already exist in the domestic oil distribution network.

Consider, for instance, the theft of subsidised diesel and kerosene (and naphtha) which contribute substantially to fuel adulteration (truckers are known to mix relatively expensive diesel with significantly cheaper kerosene and naphtha). A careful tweaking of such leakage points could easily help the government offset any price increases that oil prices could cause. Ditto with the issue of subsidised cooking gas to households.

Conclusion: It is too early to say if there will be an increase in oil prices. But expect the government to clamp down hard on leakage points in the oil sector. Expect postponement of any gas price increases based on the Rangarajan committee report.","2014-06-17 21:40:00","0","75.0","17.0","2.0","0.0","54.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","291.0","0.0","2.0","3","462","87.59","39.74","23.51","33.23","15.40","22.94","75.54","46.10","4.33","0.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.87","3.46","7.14","14.50","7.79","5.19","7.36","1.30","11.26","2.81","1.95","0.65","2.38","1.73","3.03","1.73","1.30","0.65","0.65","0.00","2.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.20","1.30","3.46","2.60","3.25","0.65","4.11","4.11","0.22","0.43","0.22","0.43","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.22","5.63","0.87","0.43","4.11","0.22","0.22","1.73","8.23","1.08","13.85","2.81","8.66","2.38","2.81","0.22","0.65","3.46","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","15.15","6.49","5.19","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.08","1.30","0.65","2195","7.68","15.6","672","463","31","64.81","10.0","7.9","10.78","9.3","97","7.333333333333334","16.34012958963283","242","14.63","3","0.43","0","19","5","42","0","69","23","2","2","8","91","45","1","33","0","0","9","2","38","0","0","1","10","0","17","1","8","9","10","19","2","0","0","0"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-100acchedin-no-radical-changes-yet-but-narendra-modi-has-brought-back-decisiveness-in-governance-2015337","#100AccheDin: No radical changes yet, but Narendra Modi has brought back decisiveness in governance","Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as a master orator, is known to coin sarcastic one-liners or terms that cut right to the bone while attacking opponents. During the run up to the elections that brought the BJP-led NDA to power in May this year, his repeated use of the term Shehzada (Prince) to describe Rahul Gandhi irritated his opponents and regaled his supporters no end.

After assuming office, Prime Minister Modi has been restrained and statesman-like in his speeches but occasionally, he does make a considered statement that raises the hackles of the opponents. Addressing Indian Army troops in Leh, he made a remark that at once conveyed what has often been left unsaid and at the same time, riled Pakistan no end.

“The neighbouring country has lost the strength to fight a conventional war, but continues to engage in the proxy war of terrorism,” the Prime Minister told the jawans, in an obvious reference to Pakistan's continued support to the proxy war against India. In making that statement, he also drove home the point that Pakistan is now a country that is far behind India in every respect, not just militarily. As a country besieged by internal strife, economically weak and riven by sectarian violence, Pakistan is barely surviving as a nation.

That stinging remark and its timing, in my eyes, are symptomatic of Narendra Modi's style: separating the ritualistic from hard reality. His diplomatic decisions are so far marked by unconventional thinking and ability to catch almost everyone off guard.

Take the initiative to invite all Heads of States from the SAARC countries for his swearing-in ceremony. It was completely out-of-the-box and caught Pakistan in particular, by total surprise. For Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, responding to the invite was a Hobson's choice: damned if he accepted, damned if he didn't. So Sharif came to Delhi amidst much fanfare and rising expectations. Much was written and spoken about in the media about a possible breakthrough in the fraught relationship between New Delhi and Islamabad after their meeting. That’s where the Prime Minister again surprised observers. In his mind, the optics of a ceremonial gesture (swearing-in) were never going to overshadow the hard reality of the India-Pakistan relationship.

So when Islamabad insisted on meeting the Kashmiri separatist leaders before official talks with New Delhi, the Modi government drew the red line: talk to us or continue to talk to the separatists. Seasoned diplomats and Pakistan experts may have slammed the decision to call off talks, but in doing so the Modi government has sent a clear signal: New Delhi has changed. The status quo is not the norm anymore. Successive governments, including that of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, may have allowed the ritual of Hurriyat leaders meeting the Pakistan High Commissioner in New Delhi before every India-Pakistan confabulation. But it is not going to be acceptable anymore.

Similarly, most commentators expected Narendra Modi to be bitter about the shabby treatment the United States meted out to him over the past decade and more. But as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has seemingly kept aside his perceived personal pique and decided to reboot ties with Washington the moment the Obama administration reached out to him in the wake of his massive electoral victory. In fact, the world, it seems wants to reach out to Modi. This September, he will be meeting President Obama, China’s President Xi Jingping and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in quick succession. His talks with Abe, a personal friend, have the potential to alter the geopolitics in Asia, as both India and Japan find ways to jointly deal with an increasingly assertive China.

His trips to Tokyo and the US will be watched very keenly in Beijing even as China is keen to take its relations with India on a much higher plane than its current status. Modi, a pro-business leader, too is clear that India must take advantage of Chinese investment and expertise in infrastructure development. The Prime Minister is pragmatic enough to understand that India has a lot to catch up on with China, both militarily and economically, and therefore it is wise to keep engaging with China on economic matters even as India seeks to build its military strength to a level that can act as a deterrent against any Chinese military provocation. His security managers however stress in private that Modi will draw a lakshman rekha on boundary negotiations with Beijing, notwithstanding his desire to have good economic relations with China.

Engaging big powers apart, the Prime Minister’s diplomatic outreach to smaller neighbours in South Asia also signals a welcome change from the recent past. That he chose to travel to Bhutan, perhaps India’s closest ally, for his first visit outside India, was an indication that the Modi government will try and carry the immediate neighbourhood along since he believes a stable periphery is a must for India to progress. His trip to Nepal— the first bilateral visit by an Indian Prime Minister in 17 years—was aimed at repairing the fractured relationship with a country that remains an important part of India’s geostrategic calculus.

The diplomatic initiatives apart, to me, the first three months of the new government have been marked by a series of small but significant steps in boosting the morale of the neglected armed forces. The decision to build the National War Memorial at a site abutting the India Gate, for one. Allowing 49% foreign direct investment in the defence manufacturing sector may not be enough to attract long term investment in this crucial field, but it’s a start. But more importantly, Modi has begun meeting the three service chiefs one-on-one, once a month, a practice that gives the armed forces an opportunity to directly keep the Prime Minister apprised of the issues that need his immediate attention. Of course, restoring pay parity of military officers with their civilian counterparts and full implementation of the One Rank One Pension principle remain pending, but both should be done by the end of the year, according to officials in the know.

For anyone who expected radical—and dare I say drastic—changes to India’s military and diplomatic policies after Modi took office, his initial months may seem mildly disappointing. What the Prime Minister has however done, is restore the authority of his office and bring in a sense of decisiveness in governance that was sorely missing in UPA II. That, to my mind, is the highlight of Modi’s first 100 days in power.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-oak-emery-lehman-graham-lehman-20180129-story.html","Driven to success: Backyard competitions pushed Oak Park brothers Emery and Graham Lehman into different pursuits","When the weather turns nice, the stone-paved courtyard at Marcia and David Emery's Oak Park home becomes a place to relax and gather.

With Adirondack chairs painted blue and red, a weathered picnic table, stackable PVC chairs and a gas grill, it's a destination for neighborhood cookouts. The portable basketball hoop with the chain net is the only thing that offers a glimpse of the patio's past. The 15- by-25-foot courtyard used to be the site of epic battles between two of the village's top athletes.

When he was growing up, Emery Lehman always thought he was better than his brother, Graham, who was two years older. Graham Lehman thought otherwise. The place to prove superiority was the basketball court.

""Looking back on it, it was pretty small,"" Graham Lehman said. ""Sometimes we would put the backboard on the grass. We adjusted it so it would be eight feet so we could dunk it.""

Emery Lehman was tall for his age, but Graham Lehman was stronger than his younger brother. The game was one-on-one, first to 10 wins.

""We would play to 10 but we'd never finish a game,"" Emery Lehman said. ""It was never friendly; I always wanted to be the winner.

""It would start slowly. We'd accuse each other of cheating, then slowly it would make it up to pushing and fighting each other.""

The battles on the courtyard were emblematic of the relationship between the brothers when they were growing up.

""We picked at each other,"" Emery Lehman said. ""[Graham] and I fought a lot growing up. That was our relationship. We were mean to each other. My parents knew we were going to fight and would make us take it outside.""

Graham and Emery Lehman, the only children of Marcia and David, competed against each other in not only sports, but in academics as well.

""I remember when we got report cards we’d brag about our grade-point average,"" Graham Lehman said. ""If one of us had lower grades, he'd say maybe it was because the other guy had easier classes or we [were busy with] practice.""

Forged by years of competition, the two Lehman boys are now enjoying great success athletically and academically. You might have seen Emery Lehman competing in long track speedskating on television at the Sochi Olympics. The senior at Oak Park-River Forest was the youngest male member on the United States Winter Olympic team.

As for Graham Lehman, he played tennis at OPRF and last spring placed fourth in doubles at the state tournament. He now is studying engineering at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., and playing for the Mountain Hawks after walking on to the team.

Emery Lehman's never-likes-to-lose attitude is one of the reasons he pursued speed skating in the first place.

""I think it started because he was competitive with Graham,"" David Lehman said while in the kitchen with Emery, who was home after a send-off pep rally at Oak Park-River Forest. ""Because Graham was older, they were always fighting, trying to do better.""

David Lehman then turned toward Emery Lehman as he continued speaking: ""When you were 7, 8, 9, you started getting more comfortable in your skin.

""We were trying to find an activity that he can do separate from Graham. Because all they do when they're together is fight, about who is better, and they say their stuff and we didn’t want to deal with that.""

Growing up, Emery Lehman couldn't find a productive outlet for his energy. He tried soccer, judo, tennis, diving and baseball. Baseball seemed to be just more of the same: The siblings were more concerned about competing against each other than winning.

""He was put on a [baseball] team that was a lot younger than he was,"" Graham Lehman said. ""I was put on a team where I was youngest. He hit like three home runs and I struck out three times. He was gloating and I was so angry.""

Emery Lehman then took learn-to-skate lessons at Ridgeland Commons ice rink in Oak Park and discovered Saturday morning house league hockey. He and other 7- and 8-year-olds would lace up their skates, grab their sticks and bounce up and down on the ice for an hour.

It seemed like he had found his sport. He liked being on the ice.

Not long after he began playing hockey, his mom took him to the Franklin Park Ice Arena to play. She spotted a flyer for a speedskating class at the arena and, already aware of his competitive spirit, Marcia Lehman signed her son up, thinking that would make him a better player.

""[My mom] kind of forced me to do it,"" he said. ""At first, I didn't want to wear [racing tights], but when you start skating around, you want to get faster and more competitive. You're going to have to, because you want to be the fastest.""

While he continued to play hockey, he competed in some short track speedskating races and that's where he discovered he was pretty good compared to west suburban skaters. Soon he began traveling out of town for short track meets. While he proved he belonged, he also was no longer assured of grabbing first-place medals.

""When I got to nationals [in Ohio, at age 10], I got my first taste of not winning,"" Emery Lehman said. ""I was getting fourth and fifth, which was good, but I wanted to win, because I was so competitive. After that I was really bummed. I didn't take losing that well.""

So he began making regular trips to Milwaukee and pursued long track speedskating. In 2009, he participated in time trials in Milwaukee and shaved five seconds off his personal best in the 500 meters and cut 14 seconds in the 1,000.

By high school, he was playing hockey for the Huskies and competing and training in Europe for months at a time.

After establishing himself as one of the top junior skaters in the world, Emery Lehman made the U.S. team for the Sochi Olympics. He placed 16th in the 5,000 and 10th in the 10,000 at the Winter Games.

While it seemed as though success came quickly and easily, he remembered all the commutes he made to Milwaukee with his mom at the wheel and all the time he spent on the ice.

""It's been a progression, a 10-year progression,"" he said. ""I think a combination of skating on three different kinds of skates [hockey, short track and long track] in two days really gives you a better feel for the ice. I have a good ice feel.""

David Lehman also points to his son’s training.

Kirbey Ingold, 23, who has no home address, was charged in U.S. District Court in Chicago with the Oct. 14, robbery of the BMO Harris Bank branch at 1701 Sheridan Rd. in Wilmette, according to the FBI.

Ingold appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheila Finnegan on Tuesday where she was ordered held pending her next court appearance, officials said.

FBI officials said that the woman is also suspected in the Oct. 7 bank robbery of the PNC Bank branch, 5033 W. Dempster in Skokie.

According to the criminal complaint, a teller working in the Wilmette bank told investigators that a woman went into the bank last month and asked to open an account. The woman placed a piece of paper on the counter that the teller had trouble reading because of faint handwriting.

""The robber stated, 'Just give me the money,'"" according to the complaint.

After the teller told the woman that she did not have the keys to the teller drawer the woman allegedly put her hand in her pocket and said, ""Give me the money, I'm armed.""

The robber left with $1,780, according to the complaint.

According to the complaint, Skokie police got a tip that led to the suspect's arrest from a person who had seen a surveillance photo of the robber on the news.

The tipster told police that Ingold had a young daughter and was staying at a hotel. She intended to leave the Chicago area, ""due to unspecified things she had recently done,"" according to the complaint.

Officials said the woman was wanted on two different warrants for previous traffic-related arrests, according to the complaint.

FBI investigators found out that Chicago police had arrested the woman on the outstanding warrants and officials located her at Cook County bond court where she was interviewed and where she admitted the bank robberies, according to the complaint.","2014-11-12 16:41:00","0","21.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","35.0","0.0","42.0","22.0","0.0","100.0","4.0","14.0","0","409","98.98","84.78","9.70","5.19","17.04","21.76","73.11","42.79","6.11","3.18","0.73","0.00","0.00","2.44","0.00","2.93","14.67","12.96","5.62","1.22","2.20","0.49","12.96","2.20","1.47","1.71","2.69","0.24","1.96","0.00","1.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.98","0.24","0.00","5.62","0.00","3.91","1.96","0.73","0.49","0.24","0.00","0.49","3.42","1.96","1.22","0.24","0.73","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.24","3.18","0.00","0.24","2.44","0.24","0.24","9.29","3.42","0.00","12.96","1.22","8.80","3.18","4.65","0.49","0.49","3.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.60","6.85","5.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.24","1.47","0.98","2.44","0.24","1870","6.94","21.736842105263158","585","407","26","72.46","10.2","7.1","10.44","9.1","65","4.111111111111111","14.668206388206386","176","19.42","19","0.43","0","7","11","59","0","42","13","0","0","0","75","59","0","16","0","0","11","2","4","0","0","1","17","0","6","39","15","18","1","9","1","4","0","3"

whatdoctorsknow.com

High blood pressure and stress are the proverbial chicken and egg. It works like this: if a person eats lots of sugars and grains, insulin receptors get wonky and shut down, meaning blood cells can no longer absorb magnesium, one of the brain's most important sources of stress relief.

Stressful situations can cause your blood pressure to spike, if only temporarily, and long-term stress can lead to long-term hypertension problems.

If you find yourself stuck in the hamster wheel of stress and hypertension, there's plenty you can do to ease the pressure, literally. And it needn't take long. Our bodies have a remarkable ability to heal themselves. Good health is a lifelong investment, but a little loving care can improve blood pressure almost instantaneously.

TIPS

1. Take a shot of cayenne pepper. Cayenne opens up blood vessels and helps increase blood flow. This decreases blood pressure naturally, by increasing the rate that blood flows through your system.

Easy fix: Mix a half-teaspoon of cayenne into a glass of warm water and honey each morning. This is not only good for blood pressure, but helps to prepare your tummy for digestion for the rest of the day.

2. Take an omega-3 oil. Omega 6:3 ratio is important. A lot of us get way too much omega-6 in our diets, which is what's caused the omega-3 craze. Refined vegetable oil is one of the main culprits, and found in almost all processed foods, and even some orange juices. Because we have way too much omega-6 in our systems, we need to compensate by taking some form of omega-3 oil. Decreasing your intake of processed foods will have a similar effect.

Easy fix: A teaspoon of omega-3 oil (flaxseed oil, walnut oil or, by far the best option, krill oil) every night does more than just balance your omega rations: it assists in desensitizing your insulin receptors, promotes cell rejuvenation and healthy sleep, and will help you to wake up feeling fresh and alive.

3. Quit soda. One 12-ounce can of soda contains about 40 grams of fructose, one of the leading high blood pressure risk factors in North America. Consuming 74 or more grams of fructose per day increases your risk of high blood pressure by 77 percent. For people accustomed to drinking a can or two of soda daily, cutting the pop can have a dramatic effect on blood pressure, even eliminating the problem altogether.

Easy fix: Switch to coconut water. It's a super sweet and satisfying drink, and all those extra electrolytes have been shown to lower blood pressure. If you're used to drinking several sodas a day, in addition to fruit juice and other processed beverages, try eliminating at least one a day and substituting another for coconut water.

4. Cut down on processed food. Just about all processed foods contain huge amounts of fructose, particularly fruit drinks or any fruit-flavored products. Fructose is hidden all over the supermarket, even in the most unlikely places: processed meats, breads, pasta sauces and dressings. Fast food chains love fructose. The only thing they love more is vegetable oil.

Easy fix: If eliminating all processed foods feels like too big a leap, start reading nutritional information and putting back anything containing high-fructose corn syrup, vegetable oil or canola oil.

5. Take apple cider vinegar. In addition to lowering blood pressure almost overnight, apple cider vinegar has a myriad of fringe benefits. Apple cider vinegar helps with indigestion, especially if you suffer from diarrhea. It also soothes sore throats, cures hiccups instantly, and lowers cholesterol. Most importantly, it helps with weight loss by improving metabolism and reducing water retention -- and a healthy weight is key to normalizing blood pressure.

Easy fix: Three teaspoons per day of apple cider vinegar can lower your blood pressure significantly within a week. If the taste is too much, mix it with a little warm water or add it to your favorite beverage (as long as it's not a sugary soda).

6. Add garlic to everything. If you're already suffering from high blood pressure, eating garlic regularly can reduce your blood pressure by about 20 points, or 10 to 15 percent. When garlic is crushed it releases allicin, which decreases blood pressure and acts as a natural anti-inflammatory. Make sure you let your garlic sit for about 15 minutes after chopping or crushing, to allow the allicin to release. Cook on a low temperature to get the maximum benefit, as a high temperature will kill many of garlic's healing properties.

Easy fix: Take garlic capsules if you don't like the taste of garlic, or can't stand to have garlic breath. Garlic capsules are just as effective as the real deal, and sometimes more so if you have a habit of overcooking your food or don't give the allicin time to release.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-adler-planetarium-summer-20140716-column.html","Adler Planetarium: Contemplating the infinite","Go to Adler Planetarium if you're feeling big in your britches, a little prideful about our species' role in things.

In Chicago's lakefront astronomy museum, there's no escaping what a little grain of sand on an enormous beach we are.

Video presentations take visitors on voyages to some of the billions of other galaxies. The information surrounding a scale-model Earth reminds us what a happy accident it is that our planet can sustain life.

Even Adler's layout, including a deep-basement theater, semicircular exhibit galleries and a nowheresville ""Mid Level,"" conspires to teach visitors that it's hard to be master of one smallish museum, never mind of the universe itself.

It is ironic, then, that of the three institutions on Chicago's Museum Campus, Adler is the little guy, drawing fewer than 500,000 visitors annually, while the Field Museum tops 1 million and Shedd Aquarium 2 million.

Shedd takes on Earth's aquatic life, and Field its natural history. Adler handles merely the cosmos. You know, the place that is immeasurably, mind-numbingly vast, progenitor of such fundamental contemporary questions as what is dark matter and how did the universe begin?

In the middle of all this cosmological import is Grainger Sky Theater, the central dome that pokes up out of the classic 1930 main building. A star in its own right, the theater was retrofitted in 2011 with sound and video systems that have made it the envy of any theater or planetarium in the world.

It doesn't use 3-D technology, but thanks to an array of 20 high-grade digital projectors working in concert, images projected on the interior of the Grainger's 71-foot-diameter dome are so alive that the moon comes at you like a physical object, and seeing the sun's surface in vivid, festering close-up makes the room feel hotter. As I wrote in reviewing the first show in the rehabbed space, there are times when your eyes and your mouth compete to be open wider.

The planetarium offers the choice of two Grainger shows at any one time, keeping them fresh by rotating in a new one every year. Be sure to see at least one of them for the combination of contemporary science, cutting-edge intergalactic imagery and just plain wow factor.

There are two other theaters too. Where the film presentations at most museums steal time that could be devoted to browsing the galleries, Adler video — images brought back from deep and distant space and prepared for public display by the planetarium's own Space Visualization Laboratory — are essential.

""Our calling card is to see a show,"" longtime President Paul Knappenberger said in 2011.

""Night Sky Live!"" — in Adler's second domed theater, the Definiti — has a live narrator give visitors a crisp demonstration of stars, planets and constellations that can be seen locally at night, even through Chicago's scrim of light pollution.

And ""Welcome to the Universe,"" in the 3-D Johnson Star Theater on the lowest level, made a repurposed show from the Grainger come to life again. If summer campers aren't using them, try watching from the beanbag chairs right up front.

When you're not seated in a theater, the planetarium — thank goodness — has ample signage to keep you from losing your way in a building that definitely does not follow the same grid system as Chicago's streets.

""Yeah, but then I think we turned around and went back in here,"" a mother was overheard saying to her son.

The original Adler, the first planetarium in the United States, was endowed by Sears, Roebuck executive Max Adler and is situated on some of the city's best real estate, a point that juts into Lake Michigan and looks west toward Grant Park and the Loop and north to Navy Pier.

Clad in polished brown granite, the 12-sided art moderne building (dodecagon, if you're scoring at home, one side for each sign of the zodiac) is an architectural gem, like the main Shedd Aquarium building visible just to the west along the shoreline.

And like Shedd, it was augmented in the 1990s by a big, glass-faced addition that greatly increased the institution's user-friendliness and usable space without stifling the vintage charm.

In Adler's case, architect Dirk Lohan's C-shaped skirt of a building, which added galleries and a lakeside restaurant, also allowed the museum to do away with the unfortunate result of previous additions. Those saw visitors enter via a subterranean hallway rather than getting in by going skyward, up the dramatic, steeply pitched front steps, as the original designer intended.

Adler's exhibition halls have been greatly reworked in recent years too. Below the Grainger, in the main building, there's a fine survey of ""Astronomy in Culture"" and a stunning collection of ancient telescopes, said to be among the world's finest. If you love astrolabes and diptych sundials, this is the place for you.

The great globe known as the Atwood Sphere is a kind of ride, sort of steampunk, utterly charming. A 1913 mini-planetarium that's 17 feet in diameter, it has visitors ride a mechanized sled into the star dome. Nearly 700 holes in the stainless steel skin allow light that represents known stars, and the guide points out the constellations.

The newest exhibition, ""The Universe: A Walk Through Space and Time,"" effectively communicates the scope of space as well as such current questions as whether it will all end in the ""Big Chill,"" the ""Big Rip"" or the ""Big Crunch."" Have a nice day.

Upstairs on the main floor, in addition to cafeteria space overlooking the lake, a gallery devoted to our solar system includes meteors, a piece of Mars and the latest on Pluto, demoted from planet to ""trans-Neptunian object.""

There's a charming little-kids play area, Planet Explorers, separated by walls and watchful guards from the rest of the museum. Wee ones can manipulate scale-model planetary rovers and even crawl underneath the landscape to pop their heads up into clear bubbles as the rovers are driven around them.

Already home to the Gemini XII capsule of astronaut James Lovell (a board member), Adler has exhibits waiting in the wings.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/hub/chi-iin-illinois-high-tech-businesses-bsi-hub-story.html","Illinois' share of high-tech businesses is among the nation's top states","With almost 400,000 businesses and an employment base of more than 5.7 million, Illinois leads the Midwest in volume of both companies and jobs. As discussed in the April 2014 issue of the Index, high-tech employment is on the rise in Illinois. This growth is an indication of the shifting distribution of employment by industry; in the coming years, an increasing percentage of job creation will likely be in innovative sectors driven by science and technology. In Illinois, the share of establishments in high-tech industries is on the rise. Specifically, of the state’s 392,000 private businesses in 2013, approximately 5.28 percent were in high-tech industries, indicating rapid growth in the number of high-tech businesses over the past two decades.

Illinois ranks third among most populous states by concentration of high-tech establishments

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reveals the state's high-tech business growth has more than kept pace with the nation. In 2013, 5.28 percent of Illinois businesses were in high-tech industries — exceeding the national average of 4.47 percent. Among the ten most populous states, Illinois ranked 3rd for concentration of high-tech establishments in 2013. This performance is up from 4th in 1990, when high-tech industries made up only 2.46 percent of Illinois establishments.

Notably, California dropped from a first-place ranking among the most populous states in 1990 to tenth place among the same group in 2013. Despite a 104 percent increase in the number of high-tech establishments in California, its total establishments across all industries grew faster, resulting in high-tech companies making up a smaller portion.

Chicago's tech job growth ranks sixth among top U.S. markets

The statewide trends observed among high-tech industries have also been felt in employment numbers, particularly in Chicago. Recently, Crain's Chicago Business reported that data compiled by CBRE reveal the number of jobs at tech companies in Chicago grew 19.3 percent from 2011 to 2013 — a rate that puts the city at sixth on this measure among the nation's top 20 tech markets. This growth rate was slightly behind that of Silicon Valley (19.9 percent) and ahead of Seattle (16.9 percent), Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina (16.8 percent), and Boston (15.7 percent).

Illinois Innovation Index Illinois Innovation Index

The growth trend in technology employment is also reflected in online job postings data. According to Help Wanted Online (HWOL), online job postings related to high-tech industries reached 9,063 postings in August 2014, the highest level since 2010. This total represented growth of 23.8 percent compared with the previous year. In fact, with a month-over-month rate of 1.1 percent in this period, growth in high-tech job postings outpaced that of all industries, which grew at 0.7 percent a month.

The majority of Illinois' growth in high-tech job postings can be attributed to IT jobs in computer systems design and related services; postings in these positions increased from 46 percent of all high-tech industry online job postings in September 2010 to 54 percent in August 2014.

California medical tech company Medacta relocates to Illinois

When Medacta USA relocated its corporate headquarters from Southern California to 1556 W. Carroll Avenue in Chicago this past summer, the reason was clear: the region's leadership in medical technology innovation as well as its superior infrastructure were a solid investment in the company's future.

“The city combines a deep technical talent pool with the opportunity to collaborate with some of the world’s best orthopedic researchers and practitioners at leading medical institutions,” said Medacta USA President Eric Dremel. “Chicago’s central location also makes it an excellent base from which to tap into the stream of medical technology and orthopedic innovation centered in the Midwest.”

Medacta USA's parent company, Medacta International, operates in 30 countries and is a global leader in orthopedic implants, neurological systems, and instrumentation. The company was founded in 1999 by entrepreneur Alberto Siccardi after a personal experience with joint replacement; today, Medacta International is one of the fastest growing orthopedic companies in the world. The Chicago headquarters united Medacta USA’s operations, product development, sales, and marketing functions to bring more than 50 jobs to the city.

Looking forward

Government and civic organizations across Illinois — including two Index partners, the Illinois Science and Technology Coalition (ISTC) and World Business Chicago (WBC) — have recently developed specific strategies to enhance high-tech business development by targeting anchor institutions and promoting local industry and technology clusters. In its Illinois Economic Development Plan, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) outlined state-driven strategies related to the development of high-tech industries, including reducing costs for university-based tech starts-ups, supporting clean tech start-ups, and establishing a technology transfer fund. In alignment with the Illinois Economic Development Plan, ISTC recently released the Illinois Science and Technology Roadmapoutlining strategies to promote growth through targeted support for technology clusters where Illinois demonstrates exceptional research and development performance.

Likewise, WBC emphasized innovation and entrepreneurship in its Plan for Economic Growth and Jobs, a coordinated effort to assess and expand Chicago’s economy.

The Illinois Innovation Index will continue to monitor and report on the state's performance in attracting and growing high-tech businesses in Illinois.","2014-10-15 11:00:00","0","19.0","16.0","3.0","0.0","27.0","0.0","24.0","12.0","0.0","92.0","4.0","16.0","0","873","99.00","55.92","61.04","53.78","28.16","35.28","70.10","33.91","2.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.41","7.22","17.64","2.52","1.26","3.78","0.00","4.58","5.96","2.86","0.57","5.73","3.78","1.60","1.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.95","0.11","0.11","0.00","0.00","4.93","1.15","1.49","0.11","0.69","1.15","0.46","0.92","0.57","0.11","0.11","1.26","0.00","1.26","0.00","0.00","7.33","0.69","3.32","4.24","0.57","0.00","2.29","2.41","0.92","21.19","3.89","14.43","3.55","11.68","0.11","0.00","2.41","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.00","16.49","3.78","5.04","0.11","0.34","0.00","0.00","3.09","0.46","1.60","2.06","0.00","4731","8.88","31.03448275862069","1473","847","43","43.02","14.5","12.2","16.42","15.8","229","7.833333333333334","20.694639905548996","390","26.62","16","0.33","0","25","59","78","0","132","74","4","3","3","178","122","1","72","0","0","1","5","15","1","3","2","17","0","14","28","19","16","3","19","3","0","0","3"
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/hub/chi-iin-exports-growing-in-illinois-hightech-sectors-august-index-bsi-hub-story.html","Exports growing in Illinois' high-tech sectors","The volume of goods and services exports is an important indicator of connectivity with global markets and, more broadly, national and local economic health. Last August, the Index highlighted how goods exports in Illinois outpaced average national growth from 2002 to 2012.

This issue of the Index focuses on state-level export data from 2009 to 2013 to understand how Illinois has performed post-recession. Since 2009, goods exports have increased 58.8 percent, from $41.6 billion that year to $66.1 billion in 2013; this growth outpaced the national average of 49.6 percent over the same period.

Illinois exports outpaced national average growth in eight high-tech industries

Four of Illinois' 14 high-tech[1] industries—precision instruments, pharmaceuticals, communications equipment, and magnetic and optical media—notched record goods export values in 2013. Moreover, from 2009 to 2013, eight of Illinois’ high-tech industries saw goods exports grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) exceeding the U.S. average. In fact, Illinois more than tripled the national average CAGR in pharmaceuticals from 2009 to 2013.

Illinois ranks among top states by value of high-tech exports

In aggregate, Illinois' high-tech goods exports constitute 20.2 percent of total goods exports from the state. This portion translates to $13.4 billion in high-tech goods exports in 2013, a volume that places Illinois among the nation's top states. Illinois also performs well in non–high-tech goods exports ($52.7 billion in 2013), especially agricultural commodities and heavy machinery, with local Fortune 100 companies such as Archer Daniels Midland, Caterpillar, and Deere exporting worldwide.

Illinois Science & Technology Coalition Illinois Science & Technology Coalition

Illinois' high-tech goods exports grew at a CAGR of 4.5 percent from 2009 to 2013, slower than the national average CAGR of 7.4 percent. This performance suggests that Illinois could benefit from expanding its goods export base beyond agriculture and machinery and by encouraging more companies, specifically small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to pursue global opportunities.

Driving exports among small and medium enterprises (SMEs)

Illinois is home to many major exporters and, similar to our peer states, has rebounded strongly since the recession. However, Illinois could further increase exports by encouraging growth beyond the state's largest companies. In 2011, the most recent year for which data from the International Trade Association

are available, Illinois SMEs fell below the national average, accounting for only 90 percent of the state's exporters (compared with 98 percent nationally) and 23 percent of goods value exported (compared with 33 percent). As a result, several national and local agencies have identified SMEs as priority targets.

Illinois Science & Technology Coalition Illinois Science & Technology Coalition

In 2010, President Obama launched the National Export Initiative (NEI), which was followed by four years of record-breaking exports and the growth of U.S. exports from $700 billion in 2009 to $2.3 trillion in 2013. Earlier this year, the administration announced a new phase of this strategy, NEI/NEXT, which is designed to institutionalize this progress and serve as a framework for the development of new export initiatives.

In alignment with NEI/NEXT, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity's (DCEO) Economic Development Plan and World Business Chicago’s (WBC) Plan for Economic Growth and Jobs both outlined concrete strategies to promote export growth by connecting local companies with more global market opportunities. These strategies build on an existing suite of Illinois programs such as the Illinois State Trade and Export Promotion (ISTEP) program, which provides technical and financial assistance to SMEs to participate in trade missions; in a trip earlier this year, 15 SMEs secured future deals worth an estimated $14 million. This initiative—along with other resources offered by the state's Office of Trade and Investment, the U.S. Export Assistance Center, the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, and others—provides a solid foundation on which to build more connections between SMEs and export markets around the world.

The Index will continue to monitor and provide updates on Illinois export performance.

About the data

All state export statistics in this report are drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau's Origin of Movement (OM) state-based export series.[1] This data set assigns all export value to the state that manufactures the final product to be exported; in some industries, components are manufactured in one location but assembled in states with ports to ease transport costs. As a result, most of the top export states by origin of movement have active ports.","2014-09-04 14:00:00","0","19.0","10.0","3.0","0.0","35.0","0.0","29.0","12.0","0.0","105.0","4.0","16.0","0","737","98.54","53.26","31.94","66.84","30.71","33.51","66.21","33.11","3.39","0.14","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.26","5.97","16.69","2.17","1.90","4.88","0.00","3.12","8.28","3.80","0.95","7.06","4.34","2.17","2.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.61","0.27","1.90","0.27","0.41","0.95","0.81","0.41","0.27","0.00","0.14","0.41","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.00","5.70","0.68","2.44","2.71","0.81","0.14","0.95","2.44","0.54","17.37","2.85","10.72","3.53","8.14","0.00","0.14","2.71","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","18.72","4.48","5.43","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.00","1.63","0.00","1.49","2.99","2.31","3947","8.9","29.153846153846153","1193","716","37","43.32","13.3","12.0","16.19","15.4","195","4.111111111111111","20.65385474860335","341","25.85","21","0.33","0","26","62","60","0","106","66","6","2","3","114","112","0","76","0","0","0","2","11","2","1","0","21","0","13","20","8","15","9","14","7","0","0","2"

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/la-fi-banks-reform-extension-20141219-story.html","Banks win Fed extension on Volcker Rule provision","The Federal Reserve extended by two years the time that big banks have to comply with a new rule that requires them to dispose of investments in hedge funds, private equity firms and other risky operations.

The provision is part of the so-called Volcker Rule, embedded in the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking reform law and designed to seal off risky bank assets and operations from deposits insured by taxpayers.

The decision is the second big regulatory win recently for big banks. A section of the omnibus spending law approved last week repealed another Dodd-Frank provision that would have forced banks to shift the trading of complex derivatives to separate entities. Under the amended law, government-insured banks can continue derivatives trading.

In its action, the Fed extended the deadline for banks to divest private equity and hedge funds until July 2017, saying the extra time would allow them to do so in an “orderly manner.”

The extension doesn't apply to the more widely known portion of the Volcker Rule, effective next July, that prohibits depository institutions from engaging in proprietary trading.

Still, the Fed decision, following Congress’ move on derivatives trading, drew scathing criticism from lawmakers and reform groups pushing for stricter bank regulation.

“Delaying the Volcker Rule is one more giveaway that lets Wall Street have more time to make risky bets using taxpayer-backed money,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), an outspoken Wall Street critic.

Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets Inc., a Washington nonprofit focused on financial reform, said the Fed should have forced the banks individually to make public applications for the extensions to demonstrate why they needed more time.

“This proves the wisdom of the [Dodd-Frank] law in prohibiting such illiquid, impossible-to-sell and difficult-to-value investments, a high-risk activity in normal times and a disaster in times of market stress when asset liquidity can mean the difference between a bank failing or not and, therefore, needing bailouts or not,” he said.

Banks and banking groups cheered the Fed's move.

“We're grateful the Federal Reserve will give banks of all sizes the time they need to comply with this rule, thus minimizing the potential disruption from hastily unwinding these funds,” said Frank Keating, president the American Bankers Assn.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-mccormick-land-zoning-20140529-story.html","Compromise proposed for final McCormick district land","There’s movement with the final piece of the McCormick Place entertainment district puzzle.

The final land that could complete the city’s dream of a revitalized Motor Row district has been locked up in litigation with a construction executive who had plans to turn the land into a data center.

In a sign of compromise, James McHugh, the owner of the land, has submitted a new zoning application to City Council, proposing to build both his desired data center and a boutique hotel the city wants on that property. McHugh proposes a 320-foot-tall, 650-room hotel on part of the land between Michigan and Indiana avenues and Cermak Road and 23rd Street in the South Loop. The proposed data center would be 142 feet tall and take up more than half of the total plot.

The city originally wanted to build a 1,200-room Marriott hotel on the McHugh land, but moved those plans north to Prairie Avenue and Cermak Road in order to move forward with plans to choose a construction team by September and break ground in early 2015. The project includes a 10,000-seat basketball arena for DePaul University, the Marriott, the rehabilitation of the American Book Co. building into office and retail space and another data center.

In order to stay on budget, the city has said in the past that the boutique hotel would have to be privately developed.

A McHugh spokesman said he thinks the city could ultimately support the proposal, “but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”

Peter Strazzabosco, deputy commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development, said the proposal would require a plan commission hearing. If it passed the plan commission, it would move on to the City Council for approval.

“City support, or lack thereof,” he said in an email, “is expressed upon presentation to (the) Plan Commission.”

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/chi-explosive-airbag-recall-increases-story.html","Explosive airbag recall increases to 7.8 million vehicles","The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration now says owners of 7.8 million vehicles fitted with airbags manufactured by Japan's Takata Corp. are in danger, and should have those vehicles seen by their dealers immediately.

The vehicles are at risk of airbag failure or, worse, airbag explosions, which could spray metal debris into the driver or passenger area, with potentially fatal consequences.

Many of the vehicles have already been the subject of safety recalls. But many have not been returned to dealers to have their airbags checked or replaced.

The vehicles involved include automobiles made by Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Chrysler, Ford and BMW -- with Honda vehicles making up the bulk of the NHTSA list.

Concerned automobile owners can check their vehicle identification numbers, or VINs, against a NHTSA listing by going to this website and choosing the ""Search for Recall by VIN"" option.

(The NHTSA website, though, was temporarily shut down mid-morning Wednesday, perhaps as a result of increased inquiries from vehicle owners.)

The affected vehicles, many of them manufactured between 2000 and 2004, are equipped with airbags made or containing parts made at Takata factories in the U.S. and Mexico. A problem with the airbags' propellant can cause the safety restraint systems to fail during a collision, or even to deploy when no collision occurs.

Multiple accidents and some fatalities may be connected to the spontaneous explosion of the airbags, and the resulting spray of shrapnel into the driver's seat.

Vehicles being operated in areas subject to consistent high heat and humidity are especially at risk. NHTSA is particularly concerned about cars being driven in Florida, areas of Texas near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia, along with Hawaii, Virgin Islands and certain South Pacific areas, like Guam, Saipan and American Samoa.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/chi-car-seat-safety-guidelines-20140123-story.html","Car seat safety: Feds propose new guidelines","Two actions this week by the government aim to strengthen child safety seat guidelines. Yesterday the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed a first-ever side impact test to ensure safety of a child passenger under 40 pounds in a car seat. The other action is a reduction of NHTSA’s weight-limit guidelines for the Latch system for child safety seats.

The side impact test proposal will give parents and car seat-makers information on how car seats perform in side crashes, says Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.

The T-bone test, or sled test, simulates a vehicle at 30 mph striking the side of a small passenger vehicle going 15 mph. In addition to testing that includes a 12-month-old child dummy, the stricken car will also be test with a 3-year-old child dummy.

The tested car seats must prove that they can prevent harmful head injury from the oncoming vehicle, and reduce crash-force injuries to the head and chest area.

NHTSA estimates that the proposed safety standard would save 5 lives and prevent 64 injuries a year.

LATCH system safety

The revised LATCH system, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children, goes into effect in February. The changes apply only to the frame-mounted brackets that can be found between the rear seats, along with crushed goldfish crackers and mashed crayons. There is no proposal to change the top tether requirement, says Dr. Ben Hoffman, a pediatrician and spokesperson for the Amercian Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Top tethers should be used with seat belts or lower anchors, Hoffman says.

Essentially, NHTSA is lowering the maximum weight of a child in a car seat utilizing the lower anchors of the LATCH system from 70 pounds to 65 pounds combined weight of the seat and child. Recent studies have found that seat belts are safer than the LATCH system anchors for kids at that weight level.

Every car seat and nearly every vehicle manufactured since 2002 has the system, which is intended to simplify safe and proper installation of child seats in cars.

During the testing of a 77-pound, 10-year-old test dummy in a 30 mph crash, NHTSA discovered that the Latch anchors became overloaded and did not work properly, according to Jennifer Geiger for Cars.com. As a result, the agency is instituting a 65-pound combined child and car seat weight limit.

The burden falls on car seat makers to determine the maximum child weight allowed on the various seats. The revision mandates that car seat makers factor in car seat weight to the maximum total weight allowed. Current labels have a age, weight and height range, and an expiration date that is usually about six years, according to Safekids.org.

Weight, height or age?

NHTSA’s use of a 77-pound, 10-year old test dummy raises some questions about when it is advisable to shift kids from car seats to booster seats to seat belts only. While NHTSA provides a comprehensive chart and recommendations for car seat safety, the info is based on age moreso than weight or height. Weight limits should be indicated on all car seats, and starting in February, the limit will be reduced to 65 pounds in car seats with a harness.

Another, albeit less precise, way to determine if your child is ready to switch from a car seat with harness to a booster seat with seat belt is to see if the child's shoulders are above the top harness slot and if the child's ears are above the top of the car seat, according to Safekids.org.

In what may complicate things, the legal requirements for child seat safety vary by state. For the most part, NHTSA recommendations are far more rigid—and proven—than state legal requirements as listed on the Governors Highway Safety Association. The average legal age for a child to ride with an adult seat belt without other restraint is between 7 and 8. In Florida, for some reason, a kid can legally ride in an adult seat belt only at 4 years old.

If you are unsure, check with local police and fire departments, who often offer clinics on child seat safety and can help install car seats properly.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/chi-five-thoughts-on-2015-vehicles-story.html","Five thoughts on 2015 vehicles at automotive rally","Every affiliation has its conventions and automotive ones are interactive. There’s no better place to be as far as work goes. Over 80 new models were available to 70 members of the Midwest Automotive Media Association during its annual fall rally at the Autobahn Country Club in Joliet, Ill., on Wednesday. For some members, it's the first time they’ll see cars that are forthcoming on dealer lots, while other members are reminded of models vying for year-end votes on the industry’s most coveted awards. Either way, the day-long program helps automakers prep their presentations before it hits the public. With temps in the low seventies and sunny skies streaked with clouds, the rally at the Autobahn was a high point of the year before auto show season shifts into first gear.

1. Too much BMW?

Like Bruce Dickinson and the cowbell, some folks have a fever, and the only prescription is more BMW. Since 2007, BMW has nearly doubled its product line from seven models to thirteen, and nearly tripled its trim levels from 33 to 82. Fortunately, the world’s biggest luxury car maker had only four models at the rally, but one of them was arguably the most scrutinized luxury launch of the year: the i8, BMW’s plug-in hybrid supercar. Since there are currently only eight in the country, there was a wait for the harbinger of BMW’s hybrid powerplants. The 357-horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque come from a small electric motor up front and rear-mounted, turbocharged, 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine. Take a second to soak up that last part, because in no way does it feel like a three-cylinder anywhere. Acceleration is fairly linear, though not as much as a pure electric vehicle, but theres no questioning its reported 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds. Wide sills make getting in and out a stretch, but once inside we were surprised at the roominess and comfort for both passenger and driver. The rear seats are useless.

As exciting as it was, I was more smitten by the M4 coupe, which in guided track laps only gave me a hint of its capabilities. Whatever comes of the i8, the M4 remains the paragon of BMW.

2. American speed

News broke yesterday that the 2015 Corvette Z06 was insanely fast, hitting the 60 mph mark in 2.95 seconds, making it the fastest front-engine rear-wheel drive production car. It wasn’t available for test laps but the Z28 was and it’ll rock your rib cage.

Then there’s Dodge. While the rest of the auto industry tends to maximize fuel efficiency, Dodge is out parading a four-door family sedan that makes 701 horsepower. The Charger Hellcat was not to be driven, but the full stable of Challengers, including the bat out of Hellcat, were there. As was the Viper, in case Dodge wanted to out-Dodge itself. American muscle car lovers rejoice, the renaissance is in full swing.

3. 2015 Ford Mustang

I feel like we’ve been covering America’s beloved pony car a lot in the past 10 months, partly because we love 50th anniversaries and partly because there’s a 1968 Ford Mustang convertible in the family.

Ford offered up the 2.3-liter EcoBoost and the 5.0-liter V-8 available for test laps yesterday. I took the EcoBoost first, and was impressed with the interior styling—a mix of race-car like switches and round cluster gauges. The miniscule buttons of MyFord Touch are still present on the touchscreen, but redundant steering wheel controls minimize the need to use it. The steering wheel is busy with buttons, which is a turn off. The EcoBoost had plenty of pep, and got in and out of corners without any roll. But it’s nothing compared to the hungry V-8. That beast wanted out of guided laps, wanted to overtake whatever was in its path. Starting at $32,100, there’s a lot to love about the 2015 Mustang GT.

4. Year of the truck?

There were a lot more trucks on display at this year’s fall rally, including the American-made full-size SUV lineup and a GMC Yukon made for police fleets (no sirens, that’s up to the buyers from each municipality). The most notable were GM’s two all-new midsize offerings, the GMC Canyon and the Chevy Colorado, which are injecting life into a moribund segment. While GM is hoping to lure in owners of outdated Ford Rangers or steer potential buyers away from the segment-dominating Toyota Tacoma, the big play is to bring people back who had bought into the crossover craze. The inside seats five comfortably and has more refinement than you’d expect from a pickup. I drove the Canyon with a V-6 over a rutted off-road path, and it seemed equally capable of going through work zones and hunting grounds as it would cruising city streets. The V6 gets 26 mpg highway and is versatile in a way not normally associated with pickups. For people who use an SUV as much for hauling or towing as other duties, the new fangled midsize pickup may be the better bet.

5. Off-roading is more fun than guided track laps

I’d forgotten how much fun a Jeep is. In the wooded area in the center of the North track at the Autobahn Country Club, Jeep set up an off-road course through hill and dell, across a sticky creek with steep descents. The course was guided at every point, but splashing up mud and tilting over hills was a blast, especially since Jeep’s hill descent technology and other features made negotiating the course dummy proof.

Guided track laps can minimize a car from showcasing its abilities, whereas the off-road course really puts the vehicle through a workout. Even the Subaru Outback seemed happy dipping along the rutted truck path that skirted the off-road forest course.","2014-10-02 14:16:00","0","27.0","2.0","0.0","0.0","32.0","0.0","47.0","19.0","0.0","100.0","4.0","17.0","0","990","96.40","48.38","42.71","56.28","19.04","18.59","71.11","44.14","5.25","1.41","0.61","0.30","0.20","0.00","0.30","3.84","10.51","15.35","6.57","2.63","5.66","1.01","10.61","4.85","3.33","0.81","4.95","3.43","2.83","2.22","0.61","0.00","0.30","0.30","3.23","0.30","0.20","0.00","0.00","8.38","0.51","2.02","0.81","2.53","0.71","2.42","1.01","0.61","0.00","0.51","1.31","0.30","0.61","0.10","0.20","6.06","1.72","1.72","2.02","1.01","0.00","4.24","5.96","0.91","17.17","2.42","10.51","4.55","2.42","1.21","0.30","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.86","5.15","5.15","0.10","0.00","0.20","0.00","2.83","0.00","2.12","0.20","0.10","4417","7.71","19.53846153846154","1346","960","51","69.31","10.5","8.3","10.56","10.6","191","10.6","17.478333333333335","512","17.88","26","0.43","0","36","46","120","1","127","74","6","3","3","182","81","1","57","0","0","25","10","35","3","3","9","16","0","19","44","25","15","22","36","8","2","0","1"
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/chi-jaguar-launches-2016-xe-compact-sport-sedan-20140909-story.html","Jaguar pounces on compact sport sedans with all-new 2016 XE","Jaguar pounced into the high-stakes world of compact sedans Monday with the introduction of its 2016 XE, an all-new model that bets heavily on lightweight aluminum.

When the sleek four-door sedan goes on sale in the U.S. in 2016, it will look to steal sales from entrenched competitors like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and Lexus IS. It’s the first time Jaguar has competed in the largest luxury segment in the U.S. since 2007.

""We know this is a great segment to be in,"" said Jeff Curry, vice president of Jaguar North America. ""Jaguar is coming in as a challenger brand. We’re not doing another [BMW] 3 Series, and that’s why we feel so excited that this car truly starts from a clean sheet of paper.""

The 2016 Jaguar XE announced Monday is the top-end S model and comes with a 340-horsepower, supercharged V-6 engine, an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel-drive.

An XE with at least one all-new turbocharged, four-cylinder engine is expected to be announced in the coming months, and Jaguar said the sedan also has ""the capability of accepting all-wheel-drive.""

Pricing hasn’t been announced for any of the XE models, but most of the cars Jaguar is targeting in the compact luxury sport sedan market sell for between $35,000 and $55,000.

""It’s hugely important for Jaguar to expand its lineup and compete across a wider span of the luxury segment,"" said Alec Gutierrez, a senior analyst at kbb.com. ""If anyone is going to get out there and change the landscape of this segment and really push the other guys, Jaguar is the one to do it.""

Jaguar is in the middle of an aggressive makeover that has reinvigorated a staid brand with the swagger and sex appeal it was known for decades ago (the sultry F-Type coupe and convertible bear this out).

Sales were up 41% in 2013, though they’re down slightly for 2014. Despite last year’s growth, Jaguar sells only a small fraction of the number of vehicles that Mercedes or BMW sell in the U.S. each year.

Moving into the compact car segment is essential for Jaguar to boost sales and profits. Small sports sedans are the largest luxury segment in the U.S., selling around 670,000 units in 2013, according to kbb.com’s data.

Higher volume models like the XE and an unnamed compact crossover due in 2016 will help Jaguar become a more approachable brand with a lower entry price point than it currently has. Automakers relish the idea of using entry-level models to pull in first-time buyers who, they hope, will then stay with the brand as their tastes and bank accounts mature.

""The XE is a natural extension for Jaguar and a way to really open up the brand to the next generation of buyers,"" Gutierrez said.

The automaker could easily sell between 20,000 and 30,000 XE sedans a year, giving it a huge boost over the nearly 17,000 cars it sold in 2013, Gutierrez said.

The XE’s lightweight aluminum body structure will be one of the key factors that helps it stand out in a crowded and cutthroat group of competitors. The XE S weighs 3,250 pounds, Jaguar said, which is at least 350 pounds lighter than comparable V-6 versions of the BMW, Mercedes or Lexus.

""Increasingly within the auto industry, people are waking up to the fact that aluminum is a great material to build great volume vehicles out of,"" Curry said.

He pointed out that Ford’s upcoming F-150 will be the highest-volume vehicle yet to rely on an aluminum body to cut down on weight and improve efficiency. And recent versions of several Range Rover models -- built by Jaguar’s corporate cousin Land Rover -- have also shaved more than 700 pounds by using aluminum.

Because the XE will likely be Jaguar’s best-selling car and its most efficient, the automaker’s overall average fuel economy gets help with fuel regulations around the globe. A lighter curb weight will also help make the sedan more nimble and responsive, an essential trait in the compact sport sedan segment.

Jaguar last played in this segment between 2002 and 2007, with the X-Type sedan and station wagon. Ford owned Jaguar at the time and built the X-Type on a platform used on lesser models like the Ford Mondeo and Contour.

Jaguar maintains that the car was a success, selling as many as 75,000 copies a year globally. But the X-Type was plagued by reliability issues and poor build quality compared with other brands.

The Indian company Tata Motors bought Jaguar from Ford in 2008. Designers started with a clean sheet of paper when they set out to build the new XE.

""In the past, our company never had a blank slate,"" Curry said. ""We had an awful lot filled in that you had to work around. This really is a no-compromises approach.""

The styling of the XE will look familiar to fans of Jaguar’s midsize XF sedan. Low-slung headlights give the face a scowl, while the long hood and short trunk lid lend it a coupe-like profile. Overall, Jaguar played it more conservative with the XE than some of its competitors.

""We don’t make cars that date too quickly,"" Curry said. ""This is not a Lexus IS with very aggressive details on it. Our car will have a more timeless look.""

Despite room in the luxury compact sedan segment for a new and unique player like Jaguar, the XE isn’t a guaranteed success. If the demand isn’t up to Jaguar’s expectations and the automaker is forced to use heavy incentives to sell the XE, it could hurt the automaker for years.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/chi-recalled-vehicles-not-repaired-20141230-story.html","Majority of recalled vehicles have not been repaired","Each day, attorney Terry Harris sets out in his trusty 2002 Honda Civic, which has 150,000 miles — and has been recalled for a variety of defects considered dangerous by safety regulators.

Two are for air bags that can explode, sending shrapnel into the cabin. Another aims to fix a wiring problem that could make the headlights shut off suddenly.

""I think probability works in my favor. I don't feel that it is urgent,"" Harris said. ""If I ever take the car into the dealership, I will get it fixed. But it is not at the top of my things-to-do list.""

Automakers recalled about 60 million vehicles in the U.S. this year, almost double the previous record set a decade ago.

But as many as 35 million of these vehicles have not been repaired, according to some estimates — even though many have defects that have been linked to multiple fatalities.

""Any vehicle that is unrepaired is a risk,"" said David Friedman, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's deputy administrator.

GM has repaired a little more than 60% of almost 2 million older cars equipped with a defective ignition switch linked to at least 42 deaths. But that leaves about 700,000 unrepaired cars on U.S. roads. At any minute, the ignition switch can shift off, causing the driver to lose control.

If I ever take the car into the dealership, I will get it fixed. But it is not at the top of my things-to-do list. — Terry Harris on his 2002 Honda Civic

It's not the only potentially deadly problem. About 14 million vehicles from Honda, Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Ford, Chrysler and other brands were recalled this year because they have defective Takata air bag inflaters. In a crash, the air bags can fail to deploy correctly and can shoot metal fragments inside the car.

The problem is connected to at least five deaths, according to the Center for Auto Safety. Less than 10% have been fixed, said Clarence Ditlow, the center's executive director.

Automakers have repaired only about 40% of all vehicles recalled in the U.S. this year, he said.

""There's no doubt someone else is going to die,"" Ditlow said.

The families of two women killed in separate crashes earlier this year — Lara Gass and Brittany Alfarone — suspect they died after defective switches caused them to lose control of their GM cars.

Both were driving recalled cars. The replacement part for Gass' car wasn't available when she crashed. Alfarone attempted unsuccessfully to get a dealer to fix her car, according to the family.

Several obstacles slow the rate of vehicle repair, Friedman said. Automakers can't always immediately get the parts they need to make fixes, he said.

""That's even a bigger challenge for older vehicles,"" Friedman said.

The GM cars with the bad switch, for example, are all from the 2003 through 2011 model years. None is still in production.

Automakers and parts suppliers need to get replacement parts into the supply chain more quickly, Friedman said.

About 70% of recalled cars are repaired in the 18 months after the program is announced, according to Friedman. NHTSA doesn't track repair rates over a longer period.

Late-model cars have the highest repair rates because people tend to take them to dealers for service. Most dealers run a check of the vehicle's identification number to see if there is a recall, then make the repairs. Automakers reimburse dealers for their work.

Some vehicles don't get fixed because people decide their car is running well, and they don't want to take the time, Friedman said. Others never learn of the recall.

""How do you target people who don't have English as their primary language, who are not on Facebook or Twitter?"" Friedman asked. ""We have to start thinking about marketing recalls in the same way automakers sell new cars.""

That's what GM is trying to do. The automaker is dealing with one of the biggest recall scandals in automotive history — and being investigated by the Department of Justice, Congress and NHTSA for not recalling the cars with the ignition switch problem much earlier.

Judging from the $1.2-billion federal fine Toyota paid out earlier this year — after admitting that it misled regulators and consumers about recalls — GM is likely to pay a similarly high penalty. Already, it has set up a compensation fund expected to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to those injured in crashes or to survivors of those killed.

""We have used every possible communications channel to try to motivate people to bring their vehicles in,"" said Ryndee Carney, a GM spokeswoman.

First there were traditional methods: direct mail, telephone calls and asking dealers to reach out to their customers. There's also been pervasive news coverage, including congressional hearings and NHTSA announcements.

""Over 99% of the people in the U.S. were aware of the recall, but we still did not have as many people as we wanted coming in to get their cars fixed,"" Carney said.

GM handed the problem to its marketing team, which researched why owners weren't responding.

Many were the third, fourth or even fifth owner of the car; any link to dealer service was broken several owners ago.

Many owners also didn't know they could get a loaner car during the repairs and weren't willing to give up their vehicle for a day. Older owners were confused by the recall process. There might not have been replacement parts available when they contacted a dealer, and they didn't know they could try again, Carney said.

GM set up a call center with 72 agents to contact owners of unrepaired cars, who turned out to be concentrated in Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Chicago and New York.

Because the communities with a high percentage of unrepaired vehicles have a large number of Spanish speakers, GM brought in bilingual agents.

The automaker tried to lure younger owners by offering $25 gift cards to seven national retailers if they would get their cars fixed. That program continues through January. Tens of thousands of people have taken advantage of it, Carney said.

In Dallas, GM offered tickets to the Texas State Fair and courtesy transportation back and forth from dealer repair shops. That brought in more than 700 vehicles.

It tried the same in Los Angeles, with free tickets to the L.A. Auto Show last month, but fewer than 200 people responded.","2014-12-30 15:55:00","0","50.0","3.0","0.0","0.0","32.0","0.0","37.0","21.0","0.0","102.0","4.0","16.0","0","1068","89.54","59.99","35.23","12.20","16.69","22.10","76.69","44.29","7.68","3.75","0.84","0.37","0.09","0.56","1.87","3.93","7.30","14.98","7.68","3.56","4.21","2.06","14.33","5.06","3.46","0.94","3.93","3.09","3.18","1.03","2.06","0.28","0.19","0.37","8.33","0.19","0.09","0.28","0.37","11.89","2.90","1.87","1.69","2.43","0.75","3.37","1.87","0.19","1.59","0.09","0.09","0.09","0.09","0.00","0.00","8.33","1.12","1.87","3.18","1.50","1.40","4.96","8.99","0.75","13.86","2.34","6.84","4.96","3.00","1.22","0.19","1.59","0.00","0.66","0.19","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.09","0.00","17.23","6.74","5.43","0.09","0.09","0.09","0.00","0.56","1.69","1.87","0.00","0.66","5000","7.46","17.333333333333332","1540","1067","67","72.26","10.7","7.1","11.02","9.8","205","6.0","16.045098406747893","490","16.32","30","0.44","0","25","35","97","0","118","56","8","5","12","139","100","1","109","0","0","35","16","45","5","0","8","43","0","49","50","22","33","36","24","8","4","0","4"
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/chi-nhtsa-issues-airbag-warning-on-47-million-vehicles-20141020-story.html","NHTSA issues airbag warning on 4.7 million vehicles","If you drive a car made in the early 2000s, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants you to see your dealer -- right now.

The federal agency issued a rare alert Monday, warning that owners of vehicles fitted with airbags made by Takata Corp. should have their vehicles inspected as soon as possible. The airbags could fail to deploy properly, the agency said.

The warning is particularly urgent for owners of vehicles in Florida and Puerto Rico, as well as certain other regions of the Caribbean and South Pacific, because humid weather could aggravate the problem.

The warning affects more than 4.7 million vehicles made by Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, BMW and General Motors. A full list of the affected cars and model years is below.

At the same time, Toyota Motor Sales issued its own Takata-related warning, saying it would conduct a “supplemental safety recall” of 247,000 of its own Corolla, Matrix, Sequoia, Tundra and Lexus SC vehicles manufactured from 2001 to 2004. These vehicles are all equipped with the same suspect Takata airbags.

The Takata airbag problems have resulted in several previous Toyota recalls.

In humid areas, Toyota warns, the problem is more acute. Though the company reports no accidents or injuries related to the recall, it said owners of the affected vehicles in “consistently high absolute humidity areas” should contact dealers.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/chi-safest-used-cars-for-teens-story.html","Safest used cars for teens rated by Insurance Institute","Many teens are driving cars that are poorly matched to their driving skills, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

The institute released its first list of recommended used vehicles for teens Wednesday after finding in a survey of 500 parents that 83% bought a used, rather than new, car for their teen to drive.

The institute reviewed crash ratings and safety features -- such as electronic stability control systems(ESC) -- for used cars and then obtained price data from Kelley Blue Book to build its list.

Mindful that families can have varying budgets, IIHS recommended cars along a broad spectrum of prices. It recommended, for instance, the Lincoln MKS from the 2009 model year, which starts at about $15,500, but also 2006 to '08 Volkswagen Passats, which start at about $5,000 on the used market.

“These lists of recommended used vehicles can help consumers factor in safety in addition to affordability,” said Adrian Lund, the group’s president.

IIHS found that teens tend to drive small or subcompact cars that don’t offer good crash protection and also older cars, from the 2006 model year or earlier. That's a problem because older vehicles are less likely to have important safety features such as electronic stability control and side air bags.

Teenagers killed in crashes are more likely than adults to have been behind the wheel of small and older vehicles, IIHS said. Among fatally injured drivers ages 15 to 17 from 2008 through 2012, 29% were in small or subcompact cars. That compared with 20% for drivers ages 35 to 50.

When picking a car for their new driver, parents should follow these guidelines:

* Avoid high-horsepower vehicles that could tempt teens into speeding.

* Select bigger cars that have the mass to protect occupants in an accident.

* Put young drivers in vehicles equipped with electronic stability control, which helps a driver maintain control of the vehicle on curves and slippery roads. Such systems are as important as seat belts, the insurance group said.

* Parents should also pick vehicles with good IIHS and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety ratings.

“You don’t want to get your kid the spiffy red BMW that will be tempting to race,” said Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Safety and Reliability.

Parents purchasing a used car for their teen should also check to see if the vehicle has been recalled but not fixed, Shahan said.

“There are something like 36 million cars out there that have a pending recall,” Shahan said.

The insurance group found that, on average, parents spend about $9,800 on a car for a teen. But the median point of car purchases for teens is far lower, at just $5,300.

“Unfortunately, it's very difficult to get a safe vehicle for a teenager at the prices most people are paying,” said Anne McCartt, IIHS senior vice president for research. “Our advice to parents would be to remember the risks teens take and consider paying a little more.”

All the cars on the IIHS list have electronic stability control and provide good crash protection.

The group's “best choices” for less than $20,000 also have good ratings for side crash protection, good head restraints and seats for rear crash protection, and good roof strength to protect occupants in rollover crashes.

Vehicles considered “good choices” for less than $10,000 have good or acceptable side crash protection and head restraints rated better than poor.

Prices on the “best choices” list start at $7,300, while the least expensive “good choice” is $4,000.

Here are the lists:

BEST CHOICES:

Recommended used vehicles for teens starting under $20,000

Vehicles on this list earn good ratings in the IIHS moderate overlap front, side, roof strength and head restraint tests. If rated by NHTSA, they earn 4 or 5 stars overall or 4 or 5 stars in the front and side tests under the old rating scheme. All come with standard ESC.

Prices, rounded to the nearest $100, were taken from Kelley Blue Book on July 1, 2014, for the lowest trim level and earliest applicable model year based on the following criteria: vehicle in good condition, typical mileage and private party purchase in Arlington, Va.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/chi-shifting-gears-automakers-split-over-best-transmissions-20140625-story.html","Shifting gears: Automakers split over best transmissions","As automakers race to meet a federal mandate for an industry-wide fuel economy average of 54.5 mpg by 2025, engineers are squeezing more efficiency out of every part of their vehicles, including transmissions.

In addition to manual or automatic transmissions with a fixed number of gears, automakers are employing dual-clutch transmission and continuously variable transmissions with an infinite number of gear ratios.

But for automakers and consumers alike, the shift to these new-breed automatics hasn’t been entirely smooth.

Vehicle owners have complained about the performance of continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) and dual-clutch units, and automakers have had to recalibrate their electronic controls to make the transmissions feel more like conventional automatics. Other manufacturers have backed away from CVTs and dual-clutch transmissions in favor of traditional step-gear automatics with more gears.

Chrysler introduced a nine-speed automatic on the 2014 Jeep Cherokee, and General Motors and Ford are collaborating on a 10-speed automatic that both companies could produce as early as 2016.

Nissan, which offers CVTs on all of its front-drive-based models and sells more than any manufacturer in the U.S., maintains that its customers appreciate the smoothness and fuel economy of a continuously variable transmission.

Most Nissan drivers, however, may not be aware that they have a CVT.

“They know they have an automatic, and they like the smoothness and the fuel economy,” Pierre Loing, vice president of product planning for Nissan North America, said in an interview. “For the huge majority, customers don’t know what a CVT is.”

Unlike a conventional automatic, continuously variable transmissions don’t have a set number of gears. Instead, they have an infinite number of ratios as a belt or chain changes positions on pulleys based on engine speed. CVTs operate similar to a lamp with a dimmer switch instead of one with a three-way bulb. There is no “shift shock” as the transmission changes gear ratios, and proponents say that CVTs yield an estimated 2 mpg higher fuel economy than other types of automatics.

CVTs are commonly used on front-drive-based hybrid vehicles, and Nissan, Honda and Subaru are among those that offer CVTs on high-volume, non-hybrid models. Most versions of the 2014 Toyota Corolla also come with a CVT.

As manufacturers try different types of transmissions, they are experiencing different results.

Charles Gray, Ford’s director of transmission and driveline engineering, said customer feedback on the CVT in the Five Hundred and Freestyle models from 2004 to 2007was “fairly positive,” but Ford reverted to a conventional automatic for “a variety of reasons. That’s not to say the technology wasn’t good, it just didn’t fit our needs at the time. The advantage for fuel economy wasn’t significant enough to continue on that path for that application.”

Gray doesn’t rule out that Ford might try CVTs again, but he said the current focus is on conventional automatics, which U.S. car buyers seem most comfortable with.

“Our primary thrust is working on the next generation with nine speeds and even 10 speeds to get even more fuel efficiency for our customers,” he said in an interview. “There’s a lot of room to continually improve them.”

Chrysler also tried CVTs in its Jeep Compass and Patriot SUVs, but for 2014 backed away after complaints from customers and media criticism. A CVT is still available, but only on bottom-end models and versions equipped for off-road use. Most Compass and Patriot models are now sold with a six-speed automatic.

“The CVT hasn’t received much acceptance in the marketplace. It’s different from what customers expect,” Chrysler spokeswoman Kathy Graham said of the change. In contrast, customer feedback on the new six-speed automatic offered on the Compass and Patriot has been “very favorable,” she said.

At Nissan, however, it’s still pedal to the metal with CVTs. The company has sold more than 13 million vehicles globally with CVTs.

“Certainly, we believe that for the midterm (the next 10 years or so) in North America the CVT will remain a huge part of automatic transmissions for Nissan cars,” Loing said, citing the smoother operation, higher fuel economy and lighter weight of CVTs compared to other automatics.

But Nissan also has had issues with recent CVTs.

Some buyers of 2013 Nissan Altimas and Pathfinders complained that their CVT shuddered at low speeds. Nissan notified owners that they should have a dealer reprogram the transmission control module to eliminate belt slippage that could accelerate wear. The reprogramming was done at no charge to owners.

The 2013 Sentra was roundly criticized by automotive media for the sluggish performance of its CVT, and Nissan addressed that by adding a “D-Mode step shift” for 2014 that enables the CVT to perform more like a conventional automatic by mimicking downshifts in hard acceleration and other aggressive driving. The Altima’s CVT also has that feature.

Loing said customer feedback provided part of the impetus for the change on the Sentra.

“In some respects, yes, but it’s also driven by the latest improvements in CVTs overall. You keep the smoothness that is typical of this transmission, because it has an infinite number of gears, but it gives you more of a feel that sometimes people may desire,” Loing said. “D-Mode step shift will be progressively introduced in most if not all our CVTs as time goes by.”

Dual-clutch automatics also have had mixed results.

After owners of the 2011-13 Fiesta and 2012-13 Focus complained of harsh shifts at low speeds and other issues, Ford reprogrammed the six-speed dual-clutch automatic on those cars for 2014 to be smoother and behave more like conventional automatics. The transmissions on older models can be reprogrammed by dealers at no charge.

Ford’s Gray said, unlike European customers, American drivers didn’t like the feel of the dual-clutch transmission.

“We’ve found the American customers very sensitive. Their whole experience has been basically seamless shifts with automatic transmissions,” Gray said. “With dual-clutch transmissions, it has been challenging to live up to that expectation.”

Chrysler recently reduced availability of a dual-clutch automatic on the Dodge Dart compact sedan after customers expressed a preference for a conventional six-speed automatic.

The range of transmission options has created a lot of competition among automakers, says Gray. “And the benefactor is the customer.”

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/chi-spare-tires-vanishing-from-trunks-20140702-story.html","Spare tires vanishing from trunks","Get a flat tire in a newer model car and you might be asking, “Dude, where’s my spare?” Go to the trunk and you may find a can of sealant, small air compressor, or neither.

In an August 2013 survey by AAA that includes 2014 models, there are 145 vehicles that don’t come standard with a spare. The question is, “Why?”

“Spare tires are disappearing from new vehicles to save space, to make vehicles lighter and to reduce parts complexity,” said Robert Saul, Bridgestone Americas’ senior product manager.

Not carrying a spare eliminates the weight, space, and expense. To compensate, automakers equip their cars with miniature air compressors, inflator kits, or run-flat tires.

According to General Motors, a temporary “doughnut” spare weighs 30 or more pounds. A full-size spare weighs 50 or more pounds. Inflator kits are just 5-6 lbs. When improving fuel economy, ounces count. While cars like the Chevrolet Cruze Eco have space for an optional spare, fuel economy ratings are achieved without one on-board.

Other cars, like the Cadillac ELR, do not. There’s no space for a 20” wheel in the cargo hold and its weight would be detrimental to all-electric driving range. I was driving one until it had an unfortunate kiss with a pothole and had to be towed. As if changing a flat tire is not hassle enough.

Driving without a spare doesn’t have to elicit fear. In the past, run-flat tires were viewed as costly with a harsh ride. New run-flat tires, like those from Bridgestone, provide peace of mind without the downsides.

“Drivers can travel up to 50 miles at a maximum speed of 50 miles per hour after a puncture or loss of pressure,” Saul said. “So, rather than be stuck on the side of the road changing a flat tire or waiting for help, DriveGuard tires allow drivers to keep moving so that they can get to a safe and convenient location to have their tire repaired or replaced.”

Given the pressure on automakers to improve fuel efficiency, and drivers’ desire for the style of large-diameter wheels, the trend away from spares shall continue. Until airless tires become common, the best advice may be to join AAA.","2014-07-02 15:06:00","1","14.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","18.0","0.0","31.0","19.0","0.0","73.0","4.0","14.0","0","375","93.09","34.44","60.95","35.06","16.30","18.93","71.47","43.20","3.73","1.87","0.53","0.00","0.53","0.00","0.80","1.87","8.80","14.67","8.27","2.13","6.40","2.67","14.13","6.40","3.47","0.80","3.20","0.80","3.73","2.13","1.60","0.80","0.00","0.27","3.47","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","9.87","1.07","1.87","1.07","3.73","0.27","4.80","1.60","0.27","0.53","0.80","1.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.07","5.33","0.80","1.60","2.13","1.33","0.80","2.67","10.93","1.07","17.33","4.27","8.53","4.27","1.60","0.27","0.00","1.33","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.80","5.60","7.47","0.00","0.00","0.53","0.00","2.13","3.47","1.60","0.00","0.00","1672","7.87","18.95","505","367","23","72.16","10.0","7.2","10.32","9.2","80","7.25","17.119346049046325","233","17.55","5","0.41","0","16","12","35","0","43","35","4","1","8","65","21","1","30","0","0","5","4","10","0","0","0","15","0","22","10","11","5","12","8","1","0","0","3"
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/ct-rides-1225-illinois-autolease-tax-20141222-story.html","New Illinois sales tax law lowers the cost of leasing a car","Leasing as a percentage of new vehicle sales has nearly doubled to 26 percent nationally over the last five years, but Illinois has lagged well behind that growth spurt because of sales tax laws that make leasing less attractive than in other states.

That could start to change Jan. 1, when a new law that reduces the taxes on leased vehicles takes effect and dealers step up advertising touting the virtues of leasing.

Currently, Illinois taxes the entire capitalized cost of the vehicle (the negotiated ""price"" in the lease agreement) – even though it's a long-term rental, not a purchase. For a suburban Cook County resident who leases a $30,000 car, the 8.25 percent vehicle sales tax would be $2,475. The tax can be paid upfront or rolled into the monthly lease payment.

Starting Jan. 1, the Illinois law will change so that sales tax applies to the down payment and monthly lease payments. If the down payment is $2,000, the tax on that would be $165. If the monthly payment is $300, the sales tax would be $24.75 each month. The total tax for a 36-month lease would be $1,056, or $1,419 less than under the current formula.

Tax rates vary by county, and in the city of Chicago the sales tax is 9.5 percent, so the impact of the law will differ by location.

In addition, Chicago levies an 8 percent use tax on leased vehicles on top of the sales tax. The combined cost of those taxes helped relegate leasing to about 8 percent of the new vehicles registered in the city in 2013, lower than even the Illinois statewide average of 14 percent, according to data from Polk, an automotive data research firm.

Peter Sander, president of the Illinois Automobile Dealers Association, could not estimate how much leasing would increase in Illinois because of the new tax law, but he said because it will encourage more consumers to lease, vehicle sales and sales tax revenue should go up. A leased vehicle is counted the same as a sold vehicle and is registered in the lessee's name, the same as a purchased vehicle.

""It's a win for the state, it's a win for dealers and it's a win for consumers because it will be easier for them to get into a new vehicle more often if they choose to lease,"" Sander said.

Another new wrinkle in Illinois for 2015 is that trading in a vehicle will no longer affect the sales tax on a lease. Currently, because a trade-in lowers the capitalized cost, it also reduces the applicable sales tax. That provision ends with the new law because the cap cost is no longer taxed.

With the changes in Illinois, Texas will be the only state that still taxes the capitalized cost of a leased vehicle. In other states, generally only the monthly lease payments are taxed, similar to the new law in Illinois.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/sc-cons-1030-toyota-key-midterms-20141027-story.html","Key midterms: Toyota refreshes Camry, Yaris and Sienna","Automobiles must evolve to remain competitive. To keep their cars fresh, automakers run product cycles that typically last four to seven years before a vehicle is redesigned from the ground up. In between, cars are treated to a ""midcycle refresh"" that usually includes new front and rear fascias, updates to infotainment systems, the addition of the latest safety technologies, and perhaps new interior designs.

For the 2015 model year, Toyota is refreshing three of its vehicles, the subcompact Yaris, the Sienna minivan and America's best-selling car, the midsize Camry. The Yaris and Sienna get typical midcycle updates, but the extent of the changes to the Camry goes beyond that. And Toyota may need it to recapture its hard-earned U.S. market share, which peaked at 17 percent in 2009 and now hovers between 13 and 14 percent.

More emotional Camry

Last redesigned for the 2012 model year, the Camry for 2015 gets a striking new look, a higher quality interior and suspension tweaks. It gets these changes despite strong sales. The Camry remains the best-selling car in America, and through September sales are up 5 percent while the segment is down 1 percent.

""We see an opportunity for more expressive styling and a more premium interior. We also heard some desires for more spirited driving experience,"" said Camry marketing chief Rick LoFaso. ""Happening at the same time was a direction from our president, Akio Toyoda, that consumers shouldn't buy a car just because it's the right choice, they should also buy a car because they want to buy it. Not just a rational reason, but also an emotional reason.""

The new exterior is the most obvious expression of that new emotional direction. Every body panel, except the roof, is new, and the new design trades Toyota's usual conservative approach for a much bolder look.

When it was redone for 2012, the Camry's interior featured some new soft-touch materials, but it also suffered from some cheaper materials that smacked of cost-cutting measures. The new model gets a new dashboard design and more soft-touch surfaces.

The interior also gets the next generation of Toyota's Entune infotainment system. This system, which controls the entertainment, communications and navigation functions, now comes with a customizable home screen, swipe capability, voice recognition training, and cache radio that can rewind up to 20 minutes of programming.

To further extend the emotional element, Toyota is expanding the Camry's sport-tuned offerings. A new XSE model gets even firmer suspension settings than the SE model, which had been the sportiest in the lineup, plus 18-inch wheels instead of the SE's 17s. The hybrid also adds an SE model. Toyota says the 2012-14 SE model, which also had those sport features, accounted for 45 percent of sales and drew a buyer with a median age of 45 versus 57 for the rest of the lineup.

Most of the 2015 models are hitting dealer lots in the third quarter of 2014. Here's a look at redesigned or all-new 2015 vehicles.

Our take: All told, these changes do make for a more emotional Camry. The exterior design is truly attractive and is now a reason to buy the car. The interior changes may be more important. The new interior looks and feels much more substantial, placing it at or near the top of the class. The suspension changes, on the other hand, do little to change Camry's conservative driving dynamics. The good news for those with a sportier bent is that Toyota is now offering more sport-oriented models. Our advice, however, would be to choose the Mazda6 or Honda Accord if sportiness is your main concern.

Minor minivan update

The Sienna was last redesigned for the 2011 model year, and the new changes are more like a typical midcycle refresh. Toyota put most of its focus on the interior. ""We analyzed consumer feedback and rejection reasons and we identified the interior styling as one of the main consumer feedback items that needed improvement,"" said Cooper Erickson, the Sienna's marketing chief.

Interior changes include the same next-generation Entune system the Camry has, additional soft-touch surfaces on portions of the dashboard, and a new instrument panel design with a multi-information display between the gauges.

Other changes include retuned shocks and springs, increased rigidity, aero fins on the taillights, LED daytime driving lights upfront, a new grille design for most models, and an available blind spot monitor.

All models go up in price between $840 and $1,455.

Our take: While the Sienna's interior changes do make it more comfortable and usable, the soft-touch surfaces are added sparingly and the look is something less than upscale. However, that's the norm for this class. The updated Entune system helps the Sienna stay in touch with the times, and the additional spot welds and suspension tuning provide an extra bit of composure. The added equipment makes the Sienna a better value, especially in the important $35,000 range.

Better-looking Yaris

Offered only as a hatchback since the 2013 model year, Toyota's entry-level car also gets refreshed for 2015. The new look is most obvious on the sport-oriented SE model, which features a black front grille, black exterior trim, a rear spoiler, and 16-inch alloy wheels.

""The focus there was primarily on exterior styling, but more so interior,"" LoFaso said. ""We had more customer feedback on the interior appointment of Yaris than we did on Camry."" Those interior changes include a soft-touch dash face, a new instrument panel with a multi-information display between the gauges, new seats, and less noise thanks to an acoustic glass windshield and more sound-deadening material.

Our take: The Yaris' new look is indeed an improvement, especially for the SE model with its black-accented alloy wheels. The other models continue with wheel covers and the entry-level look they impart. The interior is a bigger improvement. It's quieter, the seats are more comfortable, and it adds soft-touch surfaces to a class that doesn't often have them. However, these materials feel more spongy than supple, and the Yaris is still obviously built to its mid-$14,000 starting price.","2014-10-29 13:54:00","0","24.0","7.0","0.0","0.0","36.0","0.0","28.0","15.0","0.0","99.0","4.0","17.0","0","1036","94.75","57.28","31.16","51.03","19.92","23.94","75.39","40.44","5.79","1.64","0.00","1.06","0.10","0.00","0.48","4.15","11.97","10.42","4.73","3.38","5.98","0.29","9.46","8.59","4.34","0.58","3.57","4.34","3.09","2.22","0.87","0.10","0.00","0.19","3.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.88","1.35","2.41","0.87","1.93","1.16","2.22","4.54","1.83","0.97","1.64","0.58","0.29","0.10","0.00","0.19","6.18","1.35","1.16","2.12","2.32","0.19","1.93","8.01","0.19","15.35","2.80","6.85","5.79","1.93","2.03","0.10","2.32","0.10","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.00","18.24","5.21","7.05","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.51","1.16","1.64","0.00","0.39","4960","8.09","20.25","1560","1007","53","60.65","12.4","9.5","12.59","12.3","224","10.1","18.497715988083417","453","18.73","11","0.41","0","42","36","138","1","95","113","13","7","6","203","68","0","71","0","0","21","12","42","10","2","2","16","0","21","29","12","10","29","42","10","0","0","1"
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/sc-cons-1218-autocover-leasing-20141212-story.html","To lease or to loan? The pros and cons of auto financing","New-car sales have bounced back since the recession to levels not seen since 2007, and a significant portion of that rebound is due to a record number of vehicles being leased.

Twenty-six percent of new vehicles in the second quarter were leased, Experian Automotive data show. That is nearly double the level during the depths of the recession in 2009 and well above the pre-recession record of 21 percent.

Industry analysts cite several factors for leasing's growth, including: an abundance of low-cost capital to finance leases; a tendency for consumers to focus on monthly payments; high resale value on used cars, which lowers the overall cost of the lease.

Luxury vs. mainstream

Leasing has long been a staple of the luxury market and currently accounts for about 45 percent of luxury vehicle sales, says Tom Libby, an analyst with IHS Automotive. Now, though, it is also widely touted by mainstream brands like Toyota, Honda, Chevrolet and Ford.

""A major driver is that the manufacturers and finance sources have expanded leasing beyond the luxury market into non-luxury categories,"" Libby said. ""One reason for that is that the domestic companies have become more competitive in the non-luxury segments like compact and midsize cars. The Asian manufacturers have expanded their leasing operations into these non-luxury categories to help them maintain sales leadership.""

Manufacturers and dealers promote leases, most of which are for 36 months, because it brings customers back sooner than if they buy and gives them first crack at another lease or sale, Libby said.

Another driver is that the luxury market is ""moving downstream"" with entry-level models that start around $30,000, such as the Mercedes-Benz CLA, Audi A3 and BMW 318 sedan, he said. Nearly 80 percent of those compact luxury sedans are leased, and a low monthly payment is the lure.

""They're promoting a low monthly payment, and the price (of the vehicle) becomes very much secondary,"" Libby said.

Lease vs. loan

But while leasing continues to grow, a decades-old debate about whether it is financially beneficial compared to buying a vehicle continues to rage.

Eva Rosenberg, a federally licensed tax specialist and publisher of TaxMama.com, a website that answers tax-related questions, says luxury vehicles are the ""only area where leasing tends to make economic sense"" and only if car expenses can be deducted as a business expense.

""When it comes to higher priced vehicles, you can pretty much deduct most of your payment on your tax return if you're using your vehicle for business. Owning means you can deduct only a very small part of the cost,"" she said.

For example, the business depreciation limit on a passenger car bought in 2014 is $3,160 the first year and $5,100 the second — even if the monthly payments on the car are $10,000 per year. Fully depreciating a car bought for business could take 19 years under current IRS regulations.

In comparison, with a leased vehicle, ""If you use it 90 percent for business, you can deduct 90 percent of the (monthly) payment,"" said Rosenberg, author of ""Small Business Taxes Made Easy"" and other books on tax issues. Even then, she added, leasing isn't a slam-dunk as the smarter choice.

""Does Warren Buffett lease?"" she asked. Buffett owns; he recently traded a 2006 Cadillac DTS for a 2014 Cadillac XTS.

""Smart people who are not living for show buy their stuff because it makes more sense. People who are trying to put up a big front (tend to) lease. When you look at the reality of what we've been through these last few years, you find that a great many of the people who lease are living beyond their means, and that needs to stop.""

Equity vs. reality

Business considerations aside, she concedes that leasing can be a viable option for someone who has little money to put down on a new car or can't afford the monthly payments of a loan.

""Leasing becomes attractive when you can get some of these really low leases for like $200 a month or less. Those are good for someone in the first couple of years of driving, and that has to be more affordable than making monthly payments on a $30,000 car,"" she said.

For example, Experian Automotive says the average lease payment on a Honda Civic is $247 per month, compared to $357 for the average loan payment.

""For some people, considering the high price of a new car, that may be the only way they're going to be able to afford it,"" Rosenberg said.

Libby concurs, saying, ""You're basically able to afford a vehicle that you would otherwise not be able to afford. The downside is that you don't own it. At the end of a lease you have nothing, whereas with a loan you have at least some equity, hopefully.""

Long-term, Rosenberg suggests that buying a late-model used vehicle would be better because at some point the car payments will end.

""I'm really a fan of not leasing wherever possible. My philosophy is, if you want payments for the rest of your life, please, lease. If you want to free yourself of debt and build equity, buy the stupid thing, whatever it is,"" Rosenberg said.

Tax change coming to Illinois

Leasing will get a boost in Illinois Jan. 1 when a new law lowers the sales tax on leased vehicles. Currently, Illinois residents who lease pay sales tax on the entire capitalized cost. As a result, only 14 percent of new vehicles are currently leased in Illinois, according to Experian Automotive.

Starting Jan. 1, sales tax will apply only to the monthly lease payments in Illinois, a significantly lower amount that dealers expect will make leasing more attractive. With that change, Texas will be the only state that still taxes the full capitalized cost of a leased vehicle.","2014-12-23 10:41:00","0","37.0","6.0","0.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","36.0","18.0","0.0","80.0","4.0","14.0","0","988","88.70","70.08","28.05","32.73","21.48","20.95","80.97","44.64","8.60","3.64","0.20","0.10","2.02","0.71","0.61","4.96","8.70","12.96","7.19","3.74","4.86","0.81","12.15","4.76","2.63","1.62","3.95","3.54","2.23","1.32","0.91","0.00","0.20","0.71","6.78","0.00","0.00","0.51","0.20","9.31","2.23","2.33","1.52","2.83","0.20","2.63","1.92","0.40","1.32","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","4.76","0.20","1.32","2.63","0.91","0.30","2.23","9.21","1.21","14.68","2.13","6.88","5.87","6.17","0.20","3.54","11.54","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.00","18.83","4.96","6.68","0.10","0.30","0.10","0.00","1.42","2.83","1.01","0.61","0.81","4515","7.7","22.681818181818183","1425","969","45","58.11","12.0","10.5","11.2","12.5","184","12.5","18.195459236326112","449","20.93","9","0.42","0","22","31","101","0","127","86","3","3","16","168","67","0","66","0","0","39","8","38","5","0","3","24","0","39","15","24","22","37","36","7","6","0","5"

Police officer Jim Elwart, member of the Wheeling Police Department in Wheeling, Ill., makes a traffic stop triggered by a headlight being out. The driver received only a written warning.

WASHINGTON _ After the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, the government called on police to become the eyes and ears of homeland security on America's highways. Local officers, county deputies and state troopers were encouraged to act more aggressively in searching for suspicious people, drugs and other contraband. The departments of Homeland Security and Justice spent millions on police training. The effort succeeded, but it had an impact that has been largely hidden from public view: the spread of an aggressive brand of policing that has spurred the seizure of hundreds of millions of dollars in cash from motorists and others not charged with crimes, a Washington Post investigation found. Thousands of people have been forced to fight legal battles that can last more than a year to get their money back. Behind the rise in seizures is a little-known cottage industry of private police-training firms that teach the techniques of ""highway interdiction"" to departments across the country. One of those firms created a private intelligence network known as Black Asphalt Electronic Networking & Notification System that enabled police nationwide to share detailed reports about American motorists — criminals and the innocent alike — including their Social Security numbers, addresses and identifying tattoos, as well as hunches about which drivers to stop. Many of the reports have been funneled to federal agencies and fusion centers as part of the government's burgeoning law enforcement intelligence systems — despite warnings from state and federal authorities that the information could violate privacy and constitutional protections. ""Encouraging police to initiate searches for the purpose of seizing cash or other assets, rather than to seize evidence to be used in a prosecution, is a dangerous development,"" — Clifford Fishman, a law professor at Catholic University and former New York City prosecutor. A thriving subculture of road officers on the network now competes to see who can seize the most cash and contraband, describing their exploits in the network's chat rooms and sharing ""trophy shots"" of money and drugs. Some police advocate highway interdiction as a way of raising revenue for cash-strapped municipalities. ""All of our home towns are sitting on a tax-liberating gold mine,"" Deputy Ron Hain of Kane County, Illinois wrote in a self-published book under a pseudonym. Hain is a marketing specialist for Desert Snow, a leading interdiction training firm based in Guthrie, Oklahoma whose founders also created Black Asphalt. Hain's book calls for ""turning our police forces into present-day Robin Hoods."" Cash seizures can be made under state or federal civil law. One of the primary ways police departments are able to seize money and share in the proceeds at the federal level is through a long-standing Justice Department civil asset forfeiture program known as Equitable Sharing. Asset forfeiture is a powerful law enforcement tool that allows the government to take cash and property without pressing criminal charges and then requires the owner to prove their possessions were legally acquired. ""It's all about the money,"" — James Eagleson, owner of the 4:20 Group, who also once worked at Desert Snow. The practice has been controversial since its inception at the height of the drug war more than three decades ago, and its abuses have been the subject of journalistic exposes and congressional hearings. But unexplored until now is the role of the federal government and the private police trainers in encouraging officers to target cash on the nation's highways since 9/11. ""Those laws were meant to take a guy out for selling $1 million in cocaine or who was trying to launder large amounts of money,"" said Mark Overton, the police chief in Bal Harbour, Florida who once oversaw a federal drug task force in South Florida. ""It was never meant for a street cop to take a few thousand dollars from a driver by the side of the road."" To examine the scope of asset forfeiture since the terror attacks, The Washington Post analyzed a database of hundreds of thousands of seizure records at the Justice Department, reviewed hundreds of federal court cases, obtained internal records from training firms and interviewed scores of police, prosecutors and motorists. The Post found: * There have been 61,998 cash seizures made on highways and elsewhere since 9/11 without search warrants or indictments through the Equitable Sharing Program, totaling more than $2.5 billion. State and local authorities kept more than $1.7 billion of that while Justice, Homeland Security and other federal agencies received $800 million. Half of the seizures were below $8,800. * Only a sixth of the seizures were legally challenged, in part because of the costs of legal action against the government. But in 41 percent of cases — 4,455 — where there was a challenge, the government agreed to return money. The appeals process took more than a year in 40 percent of those cases and often required owners of the cash to sign agreements not to sue police over the seizures. * Hundreds of state and local departments and drug task forces appear to rely on seized cash, despite a federal ban on the money to pay salaries or otherwise support budgets. The Washington Post found that 298 departments and 210 task forces have seized the equivalent of 20 percent or more of their annual budgets since 2008. * Agencies with police known to be participating in the Black Asphalt intelligence network have seen a 32 percent jump in seizures beginning in 2005, three times the rate of other police departments. Desert Snow-trained officers reported more than $427 million in cash seizures during highway stops in just one five-year period, according to company officials. More than 25,000 police have belonged to Black Asphalt, company officials said. * State law enforcement officials in Iowa and Kansas prohibited the use of the Black Asphalt network because of concerns that it might not be a legal law enforcement tool. A federal prosecutor in Nebraska warned that Black Asphalt reports could violate laws governing civil liberties, the handling of sensitive law enforcement information and the disclosure of pretrial information to defendants. But officials at Justice and Homeland Security continued to use it. Justice spokesman Peter Carr said the department had no comment on The Washington Post's overall findings. But he said the department has a compliance review process in place for the Equitable Sharing Program and attorneys for federal agencies must review the seizures before they are ""adopted"" for inclusion in the program. ""Adoptions of state and local seizures — when a state and local law enforcement agency requests a federal seizing agency to adopt a state and local seizure for federal forfeiture — represent an average of only 3 percent of the total forfeiture amount since 2007,"" Carr said.

The Justice Department data released to The Washington Post does not contain information about race. Carr said the department prohibits racial profiling. In 400 federal court cases examined by The Washington Post where people challenged seizures and received some money back, the majority were black, Hispanic or another minority. Too much cash For many innocents caught in the seizure net, the biggest misstep was carrying more cash than police thought was normal for law-abiding citizens. A 55-year-old Chinese American restaurateur from Georgia was pulled over for minor speeding on Interstate 10 in Alabama and detained for nearly two hours. He was carrying $75,000 raised from relatives to buy a Chinese restaurant in Lake Charles, Louisian. He got back his money 10 months later but only after spending thousands of dollars on a lawyer and losing out on the restaurant deal. A 40-year-old Hispanic carpenter from New Jersey was stopped on Interstate 95 in Virginia for having tinted windows. Police said he appeared nervous and consented to a search. They took $18,000 that he said was meant to buy a used car. He had to hire a lawyer to get back his money. Mandrel Stuart, a 35-year-old African American owner of a small barbecue restaurant in Staunton, Virginia, was stunned when police took $17,550 from him during a stop in 2012 for a minor traffic infraction on Interstate 66 in Fairfax. He rejected a settlement with the government for half of his money and demanded a jury trial. He eventually got his money back but lost his business because he didn't have the cash to pay his overhead. ""I paid taxes on that money. I worked for that money,"" Stuart said. ""Why should I give them my money?"" Private firms train police on vigilance since 9/11 Steven Peterson, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent who arranged highway interdiction training through a company called the 4:20 Group, said that patrol officers used to try to make their names with large drug busts. He said he saw that change when agency leaders realized that cash seizures could help their departments during lean times. ""They saw this as a way to provide equipment and training for their guys,"" Peterson said. ""If you seized large amounts of cash, that's the gift that keeps on giving."" There is no question that state and federal forfeiture programs have crippled powerful drug-trafficking organizations, thwarted an assortment of criminals and brought millions to financially stressed police departments. Advocates of highway interdiction say it plays a important role in protecting the public and that officers take care to respect the rights of citizens. ""We don't go hunting for money in general,"" said Officer Mike DeWald, a member of the police department in Sandy Springs, Georgia who has served as a trainer for 4:20. ""I never have been pressured to go after money. We are in pursuit of the criminal element."" Police trainers said that their work has helped make the country safer by teaching police to be more vigilant in identifying drug smugglers and terrorists. ""9/11 caused a lot of officers to realize they should be out there looking for those kind of people,"" said David Frye, a part-time Nebraska county deputy sheriff who serves as chief instructor at Desert Snow and was operations director of Black Asphalt. ""When money is taken from an organization, it hurts them more than when they lose the drugs."" Frye and Desert Snow's founder, a former California highway patrolman named Joe David, defended Black Asphalt, which David started in 2004. They said they have taken steps in recent years to ensure that the informal police network complies with state and federal laws. David declined to speak to The Washington Post. ""The Black Asphalt is not flawless, however the intent behind it is,"" David and Frye wrote in a letter in 2012 sent to police and obtained by The Washington Post. ""The information being moved through the system has proven itself reliable on hundreds of occasions. Much more reliable than any criminal informant. The results have been staggering. It has proven itself an extremely valuable tool for law enforcement."" Hain, Desert Snow's marketing official, said ""the operational and software platforms of the Desert Snow site and Black Asphalt site are completely separate."" He said Black Asphalt is ""a secure system for intelligence sharing"" and does not store information. ""No personal identifying information from seizure reports have ever been collected or stored by the Black Asphalt,"" Hain said. ""The Black Asphalt software is simply a pass-through system that allows the user to input data, which is then sent directly, via email, to a select group of law enforcement (i.e. local investigators, ICE Bulk Cash Smuggling Center, DEA agents, etc.). Again, none of the personal information is held within the system, only the summary of the seizure. And then the seizure narratives are only maintained for 21 days before they get purged."" The Washington Post obtained hundreds of Black Asphalt records from law enforcement sources with access to the system. Among Black Asphalt's features is a section called BOLO, or ""be on the lookout,"" where police who join the network can post tips and hunches. In April, Aurora, Colorado Police Officer James Waselkow pulled over a white Ford pickup for tinted windows. Waselkow said he thought the driver, a Mexican national, was suspicious in part because he wore a University of Wyoming cap. ""He had no idea where he was going, what hotel he was staying in or who with,"" Waselkow wrote. The officer searched the vehicle with the driver's consent but found no contraband. But he was still suspicious, so he posted the driver's license plate on Black Asphalt. ""Released so someone else can locate the contraband,"" he wrote. ""Happy hunting!"" Waselkow's department did not respond to a request for an interview. Stops and seizures: How it's done The Washington Post's review of 400 court cases, which encompassed seizures in 17 states, provided insights into stops and seizures. In case after case, highway interdictors appeared to follow a similar script. Police set up what amounted to rolling checkpoints on busy highways and pulled over motorists for minor violations, such as following too closely or improper signaling. They quickly issued warnings or tickets. They studied drivers for signs of nervousness, including pulsing carotid arteries, clenched jaws and perspiration. They also looked for supposed ""indicators"" of criminal activity, which can include such things as trash on the floor of a vehicle, abundant energy drinks or air-fresheners hanging from rearview mirrors.

One recent stop shows how the process can work in the field. In December 2012, Frye was working in his capacity as a part-time deputy in Seward County, Nebraska. He pulled over John Anderson of San Clemente, California, who was driving a BMW on Interstate 80 near Lincoln. Frye issued a warning ticket within 13 minutes for failing to signal promptly when changing lanes. He told Anderson he was finished with the stop. But Frye later noted in court papers that he found several indicators of possible suspicious activity: an air freshener, a radar detector and inconsistencies in the driver's description of his travels. The officer then asked whether the driver had any cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin or large amounts of cash and sought permission to search the BMW, according to a video of the stop. Anderson denied having drugs or large amounts of cash in his car. He declined to give permission for a search. Frye then radioed for a drug-sniffing dog, and the driver had to wait another 36 minutes for the dog to arrive. ""I'm just going to, basically, have you wait here,"" Frye told Anderson. The dog arrived and the handler said it indicated the presence of drugs. But when they searched the car, none was found. They did find money: $25,180. Frye handcuffed Anderson and told him he was placing him under arrest. ""In Nebraska, drug currency is illegal,"" Frye said. ""Let me tell you something, I've seized millions out here. When I say that, I mean millions. . . . This is what I do."" Frye suggested to Anderson that he might not have been aware of the money in his vehicle and began pressing him to sign a waiver relinquishing the cash, mentioning it at least five times over the next hour, the video shows. ""You're going to be given an opportunity to disclaim the currency,"" Frye told Anderson. ""To sign a form that says, 'That is not my money. I don't know anything about it. I don't want to know anything about it. I don't want to come back to court.' "" Frye said that unless the driver agreed to give up the money, a prosecutor would ""want to charge"" him with a crime, ""so that means you'll go to jail."" An hour and six minutes into the stop, Frye read Anderson his Miranda rights. Anderson, who told Frye he worked as a self-employed debt counselor, said the money was not illicit and he was carrying it to pay off a gambling debt. He would later say it was from investors and meant to buy silver bullion and coins. More than two hours after the stop had begun, he finally agreed to give up the cash and Frye let him go. Now Anderson has gone to court to get the money back, saying he signed the waiver and mentioned the gambling debt only because he felt intimidated by Frye. A magistrate has ruled at a preliminary step in the case that Frye had reasonable suspicion to detain Anderson. Frye said he always follows the law and has never had a seizure overturned. Legal scholars who viewed the video of the stop told The Washington Post that such practices push constitutional limits. Officers often are taught not to tell the driver they have a right to leave at any time after a traffic stop is concluded. But extended stops in which the officer uses psychological pressure on the driver without charges or Miranda warnings can cross the line. ""Encouraging police to initiate searches for the purpose of seizing cash or other assets, rather than to seize evidence to be used in a prosecution, is a dangerous development,"" said Clifford Fishman, a law professor at Catholic University and former New York City prosecutor. ""It is particularly troubling if police officers are trained to manipulate the suspect into forfeiting the assets or waiving the right to contest the search."" David Harris, a University of Pittsburgh law professor, said Frye's stop crossed the line when he detained the driver while summoning a canine. ""You cannot elongate the stop to bring in the dogs,"" he said. ""In doing that, you're detaining the person without probable cause. That ain't kosher."" Civil asset forfeiture law

Civil asset forfeiture law is among the more unusual areas of American jurisprudence. It does not involve evidence of a crime or criminal charges. It is a civil action against an object, such as currency or a boat, rather than a person. It has its basis in British admiralty law, which allowed the taking of a ship to recover damages. In 1970, Congress turned the federal civil asset forfeiture law into a weapon against the illegal drug trade, allowing for the seizure of aircraft, boats and vehicles used to transport drugs. The federal law was eventually expanded to include cash tied to drug trafficking and to allow the money to be shared with local and state police, who could keep up to 80 percent of the seized assets. It was a much more effective tool for federal prosecutors than criminal forfeiture, which required the conviction of a defendant with proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Most significantly, the law places the burden of proof on the property owner to demonstrate that an object is not tied to criminal activity. As the drug trade ramped up throughout the 1980s, Justice's federal forfeitures increased from $27 million in 1985 to $556 million in 1993. (They reached $2.6 billion in 2007.) Some of that increase was driven by Operation Pipeline, a nationwide DEA program launched in 1986 that promoted highway interdiction training for state and local police. Several newspapers later wrote exposes about innocent people being caught up in the forfeiture net and police spending on luxuries. The Orlando Sentinel won a Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for pointing out that the Volusia County Sheriff's Office had used state seizure laws to take $8 million from motorists, nine out of 10 of them minorities. The attention prompted Congress to reform federal seizure laws in 2000, allowing owners to be reimbursed for their legal fees after successful lawsuits. But a key reform was cut. It would have removed what some lawmakers called the ""perverse incentive"" to target cash — the sharing of money between the feds and locals. It died after police and Justice waged a ""voracious lobbying"" campaign, according to former Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.

""We didn't have the votes,"" said Frank, who is still an ardent critic of asset forfeiture. ""There is this terrible unfairness. It is about as fundamental a denial of their constitutional rights as I can think of."" Intersection of war on drugs and homeland security After Sept. 11, 2001, civil forfeiture and the war on drugs became entwined with efforts to improve homeland security. Smugglers of all kinds turned away from airports because of the tightened security and took to the nation's interstate highway system. With federal encouragement, police from small towns, rural counties and big cities sought specialized training. Among those that met the demand was Desert Snow, a family-owned company founded in 1989 by Joe David, a California highway patrolman. Other firms also stepped up, including the 4:20 Group, Caltraps, Hits, Diamondback Training, and Global Counter-Smuggling Training Consultants. Soon more than a dozen companies were competing for millions in state and federal grants and contracts, along with fees from local departments across the country. The training had an immediate effect in some areas. After the Kansas Highway Patrol arranged sessions through Desert Snow for state and local police in 2005 and 2006, the amount of cash flowing into police budgets from seizures nearly doubled, from an average of $2.6 million a year between 2000 and 2006 to $4.9 million a year after 2007. After 25 Wisconsin State Patrol officers received training from Desert Snow in 2010, the agency's cash seizures the following year more than doubled to $585,657. ""It creates a surge period,"" said Sgt. Nate Clarke, a state patrol supervisor. ""These guys get all fired up because they're seeing photo after photo of seizures on the PowerPoints."" The number of agencies participating yearly under Equitable Sharing went up 22 percent to 2,842 between 2003 and 2007, while cash seizures without search warrants or indictments during that period rose more than 50 percent, to $242 million. Under the Obama administration, police have made more than 22,000 such seizures worth about $1 billion through the Justice Department program. Federal support helped drive the surge. In Florida, Indiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wisconsin alone, police spent a total of at least $1 million during the last decade in Justice and Homeland Security grants for Desert Snow training. The DEA, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and others spent another $2.3 million in contracts on Desert Snow training for police, records show. The DEA also paid more than $2 million for training from the 4:20 Group. Individual local and state police forces across the country paid millions more for the training using seized cash, one of the uses permitted by Equitable Sharing rules. The police trainers estimate they have taught more than 50,000 police officers in the more aggressive techniques during the last decade. Some trainers say they worry that an overemphasis on seizing money has distorted policing. ""Over a period of a single decade, the culture was now totally changed,"" said Shawn Pardazi, a detective in Pearl, Mississippi and owner of Global Counter-Smuggling Training Consultants and a former Desert Snow trainer. As the demand for training grew, the competition among the firms for business became fierce. ""It's all about the money,"" said James Eagleson, owner of the 4:20 Group, who also once worked at Desert Snow. Affects on cash seizure to motorists Decisions that police make during brief roadway stops take motorists who challenge the seizures a year on average to undo, according to a Washington Post analysis. For 350 owners, it took more than two years to get their money back. Last year, Ming Tong Liu, 55, a Chinese-born American from Newnan, Georgia was stopped on I-10 in Alabama for driving 10 miles over the speed limit while heading to Louisiana to buy the Hong Kong Chinese restaurant in Lake Charles for himself and his investors — two daughters and another relative. A Mobile County sheriff's deputy gave Liu a ticket for speeding and asked for permission to search the car. The deputy found $75,195 in a suitcase in the back seat, neatly wrapped in white napkins and placed in a black plastic bag and then took the money after the deputy said Liu gave conflicting accounts of his travel plans. The deputy took Liu to a sheriff's department office and called for an officer from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which stood to share in the money. Liu's attorney, Rebecca Ding-Lee, said the officers overstepped their authority, held Liu for nearly two hours and searched his car unlawfully without a warrant. ""He cannot speak English,"" she said. ""He didn't understand what the police said."" Ten months after the cash was seized, customs officials agreed to return the money, documents show. Police often rely on drug-sniffing dogs to justify warrantless searches when a driver refuses to give consent. In 48 cases examined by The Washington Post, dogs alerted to the presence of drugs but the officers found only money. In October 2008, Benjamin Molina, 40, a permanent resident from El Salvador, was traveling through Virginia on I-95 when an Emporia police officer pulled him over for tinted windows. A carpenter, Molina was going from North Carolina to his home in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The officer wrote him a warning ticket and began asking him questions, including whether he had cash in the car. Molina told the officer that he was shopping for a used car and had $18,000 in his pockets. Molina's face began to tremble, which police said they took as a sign of possible wrongdoing. Molina said his cheek twitched from medication he was taking for a health condition that included kidney disease. Molina also had duct tape in his car, which police said is ""commonly used by traffickers."" The officer asked Molina, who had no criminal history, to hand over the cash. The officer placed the money in an envelope, which he set down on the ground alongside two empty envelopes. A dog called to the scene sat down next to the envelope with the cash, indicating the presence of drugs, according to police. The police took the money, but Molina took steps to get it back. He hired David Smith, an Alexandria, Virginia attorney and former federal prosecutor who once headed the federal government's forfeiture program in the Eastern District of Virginia.","2014-09-08 16:37:00","0","120.0","8.0","0.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","37.0","18.0","0.0","114.0","4.0","15.0","0","4410","96.85","64.43","20.91","26.14","20.42","27.19","77.07","41.93","6.28","3.11","0.43","0.11","0.16","1.63","0.77","3.17","9.30","15.40","4.65","2.45","4.85","0.91","11.34","3.36","2.38","1.27","4.24","2.11","3.15","1.54","1.52","0.36","0.36","0.18","7.23","0.07","0.07","0.05","1.68","7.62","1.72","1.88","0.45","1.43","0.54","2.47","2.65","1.34","1.13","0.14","2.43","0.23","1.47","0.14","0.59","10.95","0.91","1.38","6.80","1.18","1.25","6.08","4.63","0.41","13.61","1.90","7.07","4.74","5.85","0.61","0.18","2.77","0.07","0.09","0.02","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.02","0.00","15.67","5.12","5.26","0.25","0.00","0.02","0.02","0.73","2.31","1.00","0.14","0.82","21492","7.45","20.566820276497698","6646","4366","225","60.24","12.3","9.7","12.24","12.2","789","4.388888888888889","16.98858451672011","1411","18.95","37","0.41","0","147","166","446","1","563","253","15","4","21","756","452","3","337","0","0","132","38","121","11","1","21","129","0","128","268","108","110","71","88","27","23","1","18"
"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/to-his-neighbors-suspect-was-a-good-guy-who-liked-to-hunt-and-knew-everybody-1.8867366","To his neighbors, suspect was a 'good guy' who liked to hunt and 'knew everybody'","Neighbors know John Bittrolff as a friendly, regular guy, a devoted father of two boys who likes to hunt deer and raise animals in his yard.

A carpenter and home improvement contractor, he won friends by plowing their snow and doing odd jobs around their houses. ""He's a nice guy. He's liked throughout the community,"" said Roger Schwarting, who has lived next door to Bittrolff for more than a decade. ""He's helped everybody. That's why it's so shocking.""

Another neighbor, Stephanie, who did not want her last name used, said she literally fell to her knees and started praying Tuesday morning when she heard Bittrolff had been arrested on double murder charges dating back two decades.

""I love the family. I hope our Lord and savior pours out his love, grace, kindness and mercy to everyone involved. It just is so sad for everybody,"" she said.

A third Manorville neighbor, who did not want his name used, said, ""If somebody said to me 'That guy's a murderer,' I wouldn't have thought it in a million years. It doesn't seem to be in his nature or character.""

Bittrolff, 48, was a hard worker who went to jobs most days and built his own home, including a garage and a playhouse for his children, Schwarting said. The two men often would share a beer on Friday evenings on Schwarting's deck, he said.

They bonded over the horses they both owned, with Bittrolff helping Schwarting clear trees to make room for his horses, Schwarting said.

""He was a happy-go-lucky guy. He was always smiling,"" Schwarting said. He added that Bittrolff did some work on his house, including installing bay windows.

Bittrolff liked to go deer hunting upstate, where he has a second home, neighbors said. Sometimes he offered them deer meat.

He also had a variety of animals in his backyard, including pigs and goats, neighbors said.

One said he had bought pygmy goats from Bittrolff. ""He was always a good guy to us,"" he said. ""He was a big animal lover.""

Stephanie said she was worried about how the charges would affect Bittrolff's wife and children. ""His wife is a wonderful person,"" she said. ""His family is loved"" in the community. ""They would do anything for you.""

She said she could not fathom that Bittrolff may have killed two female prostitutes. ""I don't think it's true but I don't have all the facts,"" she said. ""I don't think he did it, honestly. There's no way.""

If Manorville had a mayor, Schwarting said Bittrolff was so well-known and popular he'd be a good candidate. ""He knew everybody in every store, and had connections,"" he said.","2014-07-22 22:17:00","1","44.0","76.0","28.0","0.0","33.0","1.0","232.0","49.0","0.0","127.0","0.0","24.0","0","477","50.47","98.23","1.00","92.58","13.25","20.34","84.49","48.43","16.98","12.37","1.47","0.84","0.42","8.39","1.26","4.61","6.29","10.06","9.85","2.94","5.03","1.89","19.92","4.19","1.05","1.89","2.10","2.10","6.92","5.45","1.26","0.21","0.63","0.21","24.95","1.05","2.73","2.73","7.97","10.27","1.47","1.26","2.31","2.73","2.31","1.68","5.03","0.42","4.40","0.21","1.89","0.21","0.21","0.42","0.42","8.81","4.82","0.84","2.31","1.26","0.00","10.48","7.76","0.63","10.90","0.84","6.29","3.98","1.26","1.26","3.77","0.42","0.63","0.63","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.00","25.37","7.55","7.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.84","5.45","3.98","0.00","0.00","2120","6.89","13.75","621","474","36","83.46","9.0","4.9","9.61","7.7","78","6.0","13.862278481012659","262","13.14","8","0.47","0","15","7","34","0","38","30","1","0","5","74","32","0","35","1","0","47","18","16","0","1","3","11","0","14","49","15","13","13","13","0","5","0","4"

Legendary Jets and Giants quarterbacks Joe Namath and Phil Simms will do the ceremonial coin toss before the Seahawks and Broncos kick off.

Namath’s Jets won the coin toss and the game in Super Bowl III. The Giants lost both coin tosses in Super Bowls XXI and XXV but took home the Lombardi Trophy after both.

The coin toss is always a popular prop bet of the Super Bowl. The past five seasons the result has been heads, but the complete history is just about even — with heads landing up 24 times and tails 23. Comparably, the coin toss winner is 23-24 all time in the Super Bowl.

"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/montaukett-indians-say-state-is-ignoring-their-attempt-to-restore-recognition-1.9711732","Montaukett Indians say state is ignoring their attempt to restore recognition","The Montaukett Indian Nation is losing patience in its effort to restore its state recognition more than a year after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo vetoed legislation that would have cleared the way for the process, a tribal leader said.

Montaukett chief Robert Pharaoh last week said he hasn't heard from the state since receiving an initial letter from Secretary of State Cesar A. Perales in March. The letter says the state may contact Pharaoh as part of research into a ""legal framework"" to recognize the tribe at an unspecified time.

Since then, there's been no communication at all, Pharaoh said, adding that he's ""disappointed but not surprised. We've been disappointed by the last hundred years by the justice system.""

State Department spokesman Laz Benitez said the agency was preparing a ""thorough evaluation of the pertinent facts to determine whether recognition of the Montaukett Indians is warranted."" The work, he said, ""takes time,"" but the agency expects to begin requesting information from stakeholders ""within the next few months.""

The tribe and factions have worked for decades to undo the devastating impact of a 1910 State Court decision that declared the tribe ""disintegrated."" Tribal members have pushed to change state law, filed paperwork for federal recognition, and tallied a membership roster of more than 1,000 members. Recognition would provide health and other state benefits, and secure a parcel for a research and cultural center in Montauk, Pharaoh said.

In June 2013, a bill to regain the tribe's state by Assemb. Fred Thiele (I-Sag Harbor) and Sen. Kenneth LaValle (R-Port Jefferson) passed in the legislature with widespread support, including unanimous passage in the Senate. But Cuomo vetoed the bill three months later, saying the state ""does not have the extensive resources to conduct such an investigation"" of recognition using federal standards, as the law sought.

According to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Law request, the state held only a single meeting with an outside expert. The state declined to provide information about the April meeting.

""Recognizing an Indian tribe is a decision that can have a significant impact on the state and community in which the tribe would have governmental jurisdiction,"" Robert C. Batson of Albany Law School's Government Law Center wrote in an email to Newsday, stressing the view was his own and not the state's.

""An Indian tribe governs its territory to the exclusion of the town or other municipality in which it is located, and its property is exempt from all real property taxes,"" he said.

Among the ""essential"" considerations is whether the Montauketts can produce a treaty with the United States or a Colonial-era deed that ""demonstrates they held land as an Indian tribe,"" Batson said.

Montauketts lived on Indian Fields on what is now county parkland in Montauk until 1878, according to a tribal document, when East Hampton Town trustees partitioned the land for sale to developers Arthur and Frank Benson. Montauketts were evicted a year later, and remained displaced despite numerous legal attempts to reverse the sale and eviction.

Batson said the state would ""need to know the location of the territory they [the Montauketts] intend to govern and the parcels within the territory . . . ""

Pharaoh has said the tribe is not seeking land for anything other than a tribal museum, cultural and research center.

In a letter to the State Department in March, Pharaoh said the tribe's chief aim was to undo the 1910 decision by state Supreme Court Judge Abel Blackmar, who wrote, ""There is now no tribe of Montauk Indians. It has disintegrated and been absorbed into the mass of citizens.""

In his letter to the state, Pharaoh said Montaukett tribal members consider Blackmar's decision ""judicial genocide upon the tribe,"" and called the ruling ""arbitrary, prejudiced, a violation of civil rights and clearly biased toward affirming the acquisition of Montaukett territory by the Benson estate and the Long Island Rail Road.""

"" . . . We do not envision any material gain"" from state recognition, Pharaoh wrote. ""Our motive is to simply restore the former status of the Montaukett people to honor our ancestors and instill a sense of pride in our present and future generations."" The state never responded to the letter, Pharaoh said.","2014-12-13 19:56:00","1","46.0","77.0","28.0","0.0","29.0","0.0","233.0","49.0","0.0","120.0","0.0","22.0","0","735","98.44","69.75","23.16","30.36","21.00","25.85","75.10","43.27","4.90","2.31","0.14","0.95","0.14","0.82","0.27","2.59","12.65","14.69","5.17","1.50","4.63","1.22","10.48","3.13","1.63","0.95","1.22","1.22","2.18","1.22","0.95","0.14","0.27","0.54","8.30","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.82","9.25","3.13","0.95","1.09","0.82","0.82","2.86","2.99","0.41","2.45","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","9.39","4.08","1.50","3.40","0.82","0.27","4.76","5.85","0.68","12.38","0.54","7.07","4.63","5.31","0.14","0.00","0.82","0.00","0.14","0.27","0.00","0.14","0.14","0.00","0.00","17.69","5.44","4.90","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.54","4.63","1.36","0.54","0.27","3653","8.77","20.694444444444443","1128","730","34","58.11","12.8","10.5","13.05","13.9","188","7.583333333333334","20.9013698630137","371","18.69","5","0.42","0","26","8","97","0","84","52","2","0","7","143","101","3","27","1","0","12","11","16","0","0","0","24","0","26","40","15","14","6","19","6","2","0","1"

But his public comments were no more brash than the majority of his Jets teammates were in privately expressing confidence the 1968 AFL champions were better than the NFL champion Colts.

Namath's victory ""guarantee'' before Super Bowl III was met with widespread ridicule. The oddsmakers' line making Baltimore an 18-point favorite reflected public sentiment. But Namath's comment at the Miami Touchdown Club three days before the game reflected the attitude in the Jets' locker room.

On the Wednesday before the game, tight end Pete Lammons spoke out in a team meeting, saying, ""We've got to stop watching these films. We're going to get overconfident.''

Recalling that moment, Jets running back Emerson Boozer said, ""That's true. Pete Lammons said the Colts couldn't beat us.''

Left tackle Winston Hill added, ""Pete was expressing the sentiment of all of us.''

Namath received a scolding from coach Weeb Ewbank, who feared such a bold comment might inspire the Colts, who had a 15-1 record entering the game.

""Weeb believed it, too,'' Hill said, ""but he wanted to quietly go in and get the trophy.''

The Jets' 16-7 victory laid to rest any notion of a vast talent gap in favor of the NFL, whose Green Bay Packers scored knockout victories in the first two NFL-AFL Championship games. Nothing Namath said publicly could have fired up the Colts any more than the 18-point spread did for the Jets.

""We couldn't understand how they could make us 18-point underdogs,'' said Boozer, who still is a Huntington resident. ""The coaches and players in the AFL came from the same pool [as their NFL counterparts]. We were champs. We didn't get there by stumbling to it. We won a lot of close games. They didn't understand how good we were on defense, and we had a running game.''

All the public saw was the flamboyant Namath, a gunslinger on the field and a swinger off it, but the Jets' defense was first in a league known for innovative offense. The Colts, who had outscored NFL foes by an unfathomable 258 points in 14 regular-season games with NFL MVP Earl Morrall at quarterback instead of injured great Johnny Unitas, couldn't imagine being stopped.

Rather than rely strictly on Namath's arm, which produced 206 passing yards, the Jets (13-3 overall) put their faith in defense and a rushing attack that featured Matt Snell, who carried 30 times for 121 yards and caught four passes for another 40 yards. The Jets had 43 rushes to 23 for the Colts and controlled the ball for 36 minutes, 10 seconds. On defense, cornerback Randy Beverly had two of the Jets' four interceptions, including the last one from Unitas.

Snell scored the Jets' only touchdown on the same play the Jets ran repeatedly -- ""19 straight,'' a power play behind Hill, using Boozer as lead blocker. ""That was our bread-and-butter play,'' Boozer said. ""We ran it constantly.

""You've got to have a lead back to hit the linebacker. It's a long day. You buckle up your chinstrap . . . Winston Hill did a monstrous job on the defensive end.''

Hill was blocking Ordell Braase, a veteran who had embarrassed Hill so badly in his rookie training camp in Baltimore that the Colts cut him.

""I was nervous because I couldn't block Ordell Braase for my life,'' said Hill, who called Boozer pro football's best blocking back. ""Braase was tough, but he came out of the game in the second half. That was the highlight of my career.''

Namath won the MVP award over Snell.

""It was a close call,'' Hill said. ""Joe controlled the game. A lot of plays were sent from the sideline, but the quarterback called plays as well and changed plays.''

Boozer added, ""Namath was the same positive guy he was all season long. He called the play he wanted. He was as calm and cool as he could be.''

"https://www.newsday.com/sports/football/jets/dolphins-late-fg-drops-jets-to-2-10-1.9671336","Jets control everything but final score; Rex Ryan: 'I feel sick'","This is how you lose a football game: You miss two field-goal attempts, you allow a punt to be partially blocked and you handle your quarterback with kid gloves.

Despite a sterling effort by running back Chris Johnson, the Jets couldn't muster enough offense or make enough field goals to keep the Dolphins at bay in a 16-13 loss Monday night at MetLife Stadium.

Caleb Sturgis' 26-yard field goal with 1:57 left gave Miami its first lead of the game and the victory.

""I feel sick. We can't buy a win,"" Rex Ryan said of his 2-10 team, which entered the season with a surplus of $21 million in salary-cap space. ""I can't believe we're 2-10. It's a joke.""

The Dolphins (7-5), who still are fighting for an AFC wild-card playoff spot, tied it at 13 on a 4-yard run by Lamar Miller with 10:24 left in the game. On the ensuing possession, to the delight of the raucous Dolphins fans who invaded MetLife Stadium, Nick Folk hooked a 45-yard field-goal try wide left.

""I just missed it. Plain and simple,"" Folk said.

On a night when a flash mob of fans held up ""Fire John Idzik"" banners in the upper deck, the postgame stat sheet painted a picture of pure dominance by the Jets: a 277-74 advantage in rushing yards and a 326-291 edge in total yards. Yet they still couldn't close it out.

""If you look at the stats, there's no way you would think we were supposed to lose that game,"" said outside linebacker Calvin Pace, who dropped an easy interception.

The loss was ""heartbreaking"" and ""unsettling,"" players said. But it also raised questions about the coaching staff's faith in Geno Smith. In his first start since Oct. 26, the Jets did everything in their power to ensure that he wouldn't lose the game for them. Smith completed 3 of 6 passes for 22 yards in the first half and wound up throwing only 13 passes, the fewest by any NFL team this season. He completed seven for 65 yards and had a quarterback rating of 35.7.

""We thought what gave us the best chance to win the game was to run the football,"" said Ryan, adding that running the football so much ""had zero to do"" with a lack of faith in Smith.

But some Jets seemed frustrated by the game plan.

""I'm not the coordinator. I'm not the guy in charge. He's got to call it the way he sees the game,'' receiver Eric Decker said. ""But you think the way you run the football, yes, you got to still have a good passing game to be successful and to win.""

The Jets controlled the first half, rushing for 210 yards, and Smith was the ultimate game manager. That strategy worked, as the Jets took a 10-0 lead behind a 47-yard run by Johnson (105 yards on 17 carries), a 20-yard end-around touchdown by Greg Salas (who injured his hamstring on the play and did not return) and a 40-yard field goal by Folk. But the Jets inexplicably did not make adjustments after the Dolphins changed things up to stop the run. And it cost them.

""Would we like to pass the ball more as receivers? Selfishly, yes,"" added Decker (two catches, 18 yards). ""I would like to get some more touches. All the receivers would like to get more touches. But that's not in our control.""

Smith -- who said it was his decision not to be introduced pregame with other members of the offense -- said he didn't think the game plan showed a lack of faith in him. ""The goal of the team is to win and to execute the game plan,"" he said. ""And for the most part, I think we did a pretty good job of that. When the situation came for us to pass the ball and win the game, we fell short.""

Folk made it 13-6 with 7:17 left in the third with a 45-yard field goal that hit off the crossbar and went through, but special-teams gaffes reared their ugly head again. Folk missed a 48-yard field-goal attempt and Ryan Quigley had a punt partially blocked by Dion Jordan. After Sturgis' field goal, Smith's interception finished the Jets.

""It's kind of the theme of our season,"" Pace said. ""We just didn't make enough plays and they did.""

Chrebet honored. Wayne Chrebet was inducted into the Jets Ring of Honor at halftime along with the team's former owner, the late Leon Hess. In his 11-year career with the Jets, Chrebet caught 580 passes for 7,365 yards and 41 touchdowns.","2014-12-02 01:57:00","0","45.0","79.0","28.0","0.0","32.0","0.0","233.0","49.0","0.0","122.0","0.0","23.0","0","811","94.26","80.24","16.03","43.77","16.90","14.55","76.08","44.14","9.74","6.04","0.86","1.60","1.36","1.48","0.74","3.70","10.60","13.56","4.69","2.22","4.19","1.73","13.93","2.84","1.36","1.23","7.64","1.73","5.43","3.21","2.22","0.12","0.74","1.11","10.73","0.00","0.12","0.00","1.60","8.51","1.36","1.60","1.23","1.73","0.74","2.59","2.84","0.49","1.48","0.74","0.62","0.37","0.37","0.00","0.00","12.08","3.95","5.43","3.33","3.33","0.99","6.78","6.41","0.37","12.95","3.33","6.17","3.95","3.08","4.81","0.99","0.37","0.37","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.00","22.56","5.80","4.69","0.62","0.00","0.12","0.00","3.45","4.07","2.71","0.99","0.12","3286","6.64","17.680851063829788","978","784","47","88.36","8.3","5.1","8.35","8.0","108","8.7","14.190204081632652","388","16.3","9","0.44","0","27","53","95","0","86","36","1","3","6","144","66","1","39","1","0","48","12","26","2","0","4","22","0","36","63","10","11","19","7","3","6","0","3"

"https://www.newsday.com/sports/high-school/football/sjb-s-prendergast-leads-li-defense-in-empire-challenge-1.8571836","SJB's Prendergast leads LI defense in Empire Challenge","Back in December, rivals Lawson Prendergast and Joe Sotomayor found some common ground and bonded at the CHSFL All-Star football game.

Chief among the things they held in common was a passion for playing high school linebacker.

St. John the Baptist's Prendergast and St. Anthony's Sotomayor found themselves teammates again Wednesday night in the Empire Challenge All-Star football at Hofstra's Shuart Stadium. This time, the talented duo entered with an idea and left a mark.

""We had a plan for this game,"" Sotomayor said. ""The plan was to dominate and make the CHSFL known for even better football. From the first day of practicing for this game, I just knew him and I would do well in this game.""

Sotomayor couldn't have been more correct. Prendergast had seven tackles, including three for a loss, and returned an interception 25 yards for a touchdown late in the fourth as Long Island held NYC scoreless in the first half and hung on to win, 24-18. Sotomayor added six tackles and forced a key fumble late in the third quarter.

Prendergast's TD sealed the game with 3:14 left. It put L.I. ahead 24-11.

""I just jumped the route in the flat and no one was near me so I took it to the house,"" Prendergast said.

The play was another example of L.I.'s defense making a critical stop with NYC driving. Justin Rivera (Sachem North) added six tackles and Farmingdale's Joe Lee added three. ""Our defense proved that scoring against Long Island is a pretty hard thing to accomplish,"" Sotomayor said. ""Almost every time we needed to, we made key stops and killed their momentum.""

Sotomayor provided a prime example of that with eight seconds left in the third quarter. He ripped the ball loose from NYC's William Solomon near the 50 with L.I. leading 11-8. Sewanhaka cornerback Elijah Smith recovered the fumble, which was the game's first turnover. L.I. scored on the ensuing drive.

Earlier, it was Prendergast who helped lead another game-changing defensive stance. After L.I. went ahead 8-0, NYC again went on a lengthy drive -- until Prendergast thwarted another scoring opportunity. Prendergast made consecutive tackles for a loss of yards as NYC quarterback Anthony Cruz twice tried to rush against him.

""They were running the same plays over and over and I had been just reading the tackle,"" Prendergast said. ""As soon as the quarterback steps out, I know it's a run so I just try to get something done explosively.""

With NYC threatening in the red zone on its first drive of the game, Prendergast made a diving tackle for a loss of 3 yards on a first-and-10 running play. Huntington linebacker Levar Butts then made consecutive stops inside the 20. Babylon defensive back Jake Carlock broke up the fourth down pass attempt.

It was a tone-setting defensive stop and afterward Prendergast celebrated with a jubilant scream toward the sky as blood streamed from the top of his nose -- a small injury he suffered while making the tackle.

""It was nothing a band-aid couldn't take care of,"" Prendergast said. ""Nothing was going to keep me off the field in this game.""","2014-06-26 00:20:38","1","40.0","73.0","27.0","0.0","33.0","0.0","231.0","48.0","0.0","124.0","0.0","23.0","0","561","94.97","63.94","44.32","25.77","14.38","20.50","77.18","43.32","9.27","5.35","2.50","0.89","0.36","0.89","0.71","3.92","9.63","14.26","4.10","2.50","4.63","0.89","12.48","4.46","1.96","0.36","6.60","1.96","5.35","2.67","2.67","0.18","0.71","0.89","6.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.89","6.24","1.25","1.96","0.71","0.89","1.25","0.36","2.14","0.18","1.25","0.53","0.89","0.71","0.18","0.18","0.00","12.48","2.85","4.81","3.21","2.32","1.78","8.73","2.50","1.25","17.65","3.57","8.20","5.88","1.78","4.10","0.36","0.00","0.36","0.18","0.53","0.18","0.00","0.18","0.18","0.00","19.61","8.02","3.21","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.67","3.21","1.96","0.36","0.00","2534","6.96","15.026315789473685","747","543","35","72.66","10.7","7.0","10.96","9.5","88","5.5","14.682504604051566","302","14.05","26","0.41","0","16","21","66","0","64","32","1","0","1","90","84","0","13","0","0","31","6","23","2","0","4","11","0","11","54","18","9","7","5","1","1","0","0"

Beforehand — or afterward — consider one of these five eating places:

MARONI CUISINE, 18 Woodbine Ave., Northport, 631-757-4500

Chef-owner Michael Maroni’s freewheeling tasting menu takes you all over the place — in high style. Maroni, whose meatballs beat Bobby Flay’s in a Food Network throw-down, keeps it coming with such dishes as lobster roll, Kobe beef sliders, linguine with clams, Memphis-style ribs — and/or whatever else pops into his mind. Outdoor courtyard dining in nice weather.

TIM’S SHIPWRECK DINER, 46 Main St., Northport, 631-754-1797

This vintage railroad-car model is a nexus for local movers and shakers, who dig into the appealing omelets, oatmeal, blintzes and pancakes at breakfast. At lunch, there are burgers (bison or beef), fish and chips and BLTs. Outdoor eating in warm weather. No dinner, though.

MAIN STREET CAFE, 47 Main St., Northport, 631-754-5533

Great burgers and big salads headline this cozy — perhaps cramped — bar and cafe decorated with vintage photos from the town’s past.

"https://www.newsday.com/sports/horseracing/belmont-stakes/belmont-stakes-analysis-2014-1.1971225","Belmont Stakes analysis 2014","Here is a look at contenders for the 2014 Belmont Stakes as California Chrome goes for the Triple Crown on Saturday, June 7, at Belmont Park in Elmont. The field of 11 horses is the largest for a Belmont Stakes where the Triple Crown was on the line.

1 — MEDAL COUNT Trainer: Dale Romans

Jockey: Robby Albarado

Last 3: 8-2-1

Odds: 20-1

Comment: Inspired some buzz during Derby week, but a bad trip (shuffled back early, steadied at the eighth pole) canceled him. He wasn’t going to beat California Chrome but would have been a lot closer if not for all that trouble. Romans is an excellent big-race trainer, and I’m willing to draw a line through the Derby. Son of top distance sire Dynaformer shouldn’t have stamina problems, and although only 1-for-4 on dirt, I like him to finish strongly for second behind Chrome.

2 — CALIFORNIA CHROME Trainer: Art Sherman

Jockey: Victor Espinoza

Last 3: 1-1-1

Odds: 3-5

Comment: ""The people's horse"" is heavily favored to end the Triple Crown drought that began in 1979. If he doesn’t, the racing world and his bandwagon of millions will be very disappointed. On paper, he’s clearly the best, but the past 11 Kentucky Derby-Preakness winners found a way to fail at Belmont. His tactical speed should help keep him out of trouble, unless the other jockeys gang up on him. The 1 1/2-mile distance is always the great unknown. Maybe this time something bad won’t happen to the most logical winner.

3 — MATTERHORN Trainer: Todd Pletcher

Jockey: Joe Bravo (pictured)

Last 3: 4-3-10

Odds: 30-1

Comment: It would take a quantum leap for this 1-for-4 colt to have a peak experience. He hasn’t been close this year (0-for-3, beaten 34 lengths), and if Pletcher’s Danza were in top form and if Constitution and Intense Holiday hadn’t gotten hurt, it seems unlikely that Matterhorn would be in the Belmont. If he finishes in the money, it will be a big surprise.

4 — COMMANDING CURVE Trainer: Dallas Stewart

Jockey: Shaun Bridgmohan

Last 3: 2-3-6

Odds: 15-1

Comment: Deep closers usually are up against it in the Belmont, with Jazil (2006) the most recent to go from last to first. He’s also only 1-for-7, and it seems unlikely there will be a strong pace to set up his late run. Closed well to be second at 37-1 odds in the 1 1/4-mile Derby, but it would be a rookie mistake to assume the extra quarter-mile of the Belmont will favor him. It’s counterintuitive -- but true -- that the longer the race, the better it is to be within striking distance of the lead. I don’t like his chances.

5 — RIDE ON CURLIN Trainer: Billy Gowan

Jockey: John Velazquez

Last 3: 2-7-2

Odds: 12-1

Comment: Rallied in the Preakness, and for a few strides it looked as if he might get to California Chrome. The 1 1/2-length margin is the smallest for “Chromie” this year, yet how a big finish at 1 3/16 miles translates to 1 1/2 miles is anyone’s guess. Always tries hard, in the money in four of five graded stakes at 3. Still, he’s 2-for-11, winless beyond 6 furlongs, and on a five-race losing streak. Pedigree (Curlin out of a Storm Cat mare) is excellent for distance. Mixed signals produce more skepticism than confidence.

6 — MATUSZAK Trainer: Bill Mott

Jockey: Mike Smith

Last 3: 2-3-3

Odds: 30-1

Comment: I always give Hall of Famer Mott’s horses second and third looks, regardless of their past performances, but it’s hard to have faith in a 1-for-8 colt who’s lost seven in a row. He’s never been in a Grade I and wasn’t close in two Grade II tries. On paper, he’s one of quite a few throwouts in this “Test of the Champion.”

7 — SAMRAAT Trainer: Rick Violette

Jockey: Jose Ortiz

Last 3: 5-2-1

Odds: 20-1

Comment: Very tough, speedy New York-bred never has run a bad race and gave his typically gutsy performance when nosed for fourth in the Derby. Likely to be near the pace, and if it’s moderate, he should be lurking at the top of the stretch. Don’t know if he wants to go much farther than 1 1/8 miles, but few modern thoroughbreds do. A horse with heart and tactical speed always has a shot, regardless of the distance, and the colt bred in the Hamptons will give his backers a run for their money.

8 — COMMISSIONER Trainer: Todd Pletcher (pictured)

Jockey: Javier Castellano

Last 3: 2-6-3

Odds: 20-1

Comment: Distance pedigree couldn’t be better (sired by 1992 Belmont winner A.P. Indy out of a mare by 1997 Belmont champ Touch Gold), so he should like 12 furlongs better than most. His 0-for-4 record in graded stakes, with an average margin of eight lengths, inspires zero confidence. I could see using him underneath in exotics, because he might be plodding on late past exhausted horses, but forget a win bet.

9 — WICKED STRONG Trainer: Jimmy Jerkens

Jockey: Rajiv Maragh

Last 3: 4-1-4

Odds: 6-1

Comment: Many handicappers are touting this deep closer, especially after his brilliant 5-furlong work Sunday, even though the Wood Memorial is his only strong stakes performance. Had a bad trip in the Derby and stayed on to be fourth. If he has to stay nearer the lead, it may blunt his finishing kick, and his late-pace figures aren’t great. Like Tonalist, he strikes me as an underlay. Of course, they could finish 1-2, because I gave 13-1 winner Palace Malice no chance last year, although I had Union Rags the year before.

10 — GENERAL A ROD Trainer: Mike Maker

Jockey: Rosie Napravnik

Last 3: 4-11-3

Odds: 20-1

Comment: Front-running colt had bad trips in the Derby and Preakness, when he couldn’t establish his usual early position and never contended. Expect Napravnik to set or press the pace, and he’ll run hard for as long as he can stay. He could be over the top after three hard races in Florida plus two classics.

The statement continued: “Today, a St. Louis County grand jury released its decision that no charges would be filed in the case involving Officer Darren Wilson. From the onset, we have maintained and the grand jury agreed that Officer Wilson’s actions on August 9 were in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern the procedures of an officer.

“In a case of this magnitude, a team of prosecutors rightfully presented evidence to this St. Louis County grand jury. This group of citizens, drawn at random from the community, listened to witnesses and heard all the evidence in the case. Based on the evidence and witness testimony, the grand jury collectively determined there was no basis for criminal charges against Officer Wilson.

“Law enforcement personnel must frequently make split-second and difficult decisions. Officer Wilson followed his training and followed the law. We recognize that many people will want to second-guess the grand jury’s decision. We would encourage anyone who wants to express an opinion do so in a respectful and peaceful manner.

“On a side note, Officer Wilson would like to thank those who have stood by his side throughout the process. This continued support is greatly appreciated by Officer Wilson and his family. Moving forward, any commentary on this matter will be done in the appropriate venue and not through the media.”

His attorney, Neil Bruntrager, characterized the past few days as “tense” for Wilson.

“For him, none of this ends,” Bruntrager said. “People have made threats against his life, he will continue to be concerned about his family’s security and his own. (Not being indicted) is a brief respite, but certainly not the end of things for him.”

Bruntrager would not comment on whether his client plans to resign from the Ferguson Police Department. Officials have said they would have no reason to fire him should there be no indictment, but that an internal affairs investigation would have to decide whether the shooting was within department policies.

Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson declined to comment.

Wilson has not made any public statements regarding the situation.

He married his girlfriend, Barbara Spradling, Oct. 24 in Overland, Mo. She also is a Ferguson police officer, but went on sick leave about two weeks ago due to stress at work, Bruntrager said.","2014-11-24 22:20:00","1","40.0","83.0","27.0","0.0","32.0","0.0","232.0","49.0","0.0","124.0","0.0","23.0","0","448","86.38","75.56","6.34","67.93","14.93","27.01","79.46","45.54","9.60","5.36","0.00","0.89","0.22","4.02","0.22","4.24","7.81","13.17","7.37","1.79","4.91","2.46","13.62","4.02","1.12","1.12","1.34","2.01","5.58","3.79","1.56","0.67","0.45","0.22","11.38","0.45","0.22","0.22","3.79","11.83","3.35","1.34","2.46","1.34","0.67","3.12","2.01","0.22","1.56","0.22","0.67","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.22","10.27","2.46","0.89","6.25","0.45","0.67","4.24","6.70","1.12","11.83","2.23","5.80","4.46","4.46","0.67","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","16.74","6.47","5.36","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.45","2.90","0.67","0.45","0.00","2201","8.37","18.791666666666668","675","446","29","64.3","11.9","8.1","12.0","10.5","112","11.625","18.204843049327355","256","17.67","0","0.43","0","15","4","49","0","53","25","0","1","12","67","58","0","23","0","0","14","12","16","0","0","0","12","0","22","24","8","13","10","8","1","2","0","1"
"https://www.newsday.com/opinion/use-discretion-in-arming-our-police-editorial-1.9146561","Editorial: Use discretion in arming our police","Police departments shouldn't be equipped like armies. But the Ferguson, Missouri, police department looked like one recently when officers in full body armor and military-style vehicles fired tear gas and trained assault weapons on people protesting after a police officer shot and killed black teen Michael Brown, whose funeral was Monday.

Armies wage war. Police are supposed to keep the peace. That distinction was blurred dangerously in Ferguson by the provocative display of military hardware, much of it made available by the federal government. Some protesters looted stores. A few threw rocks and Molotov cocktails. There was scattered gunfire. But the oppressive response by militarized police aggravated rather than cooled tensions.

Department of Defense programs have funneled more than $5 billion in weapons, vehicles and other hardware to police in the United States since 1997. The Nassau County Police Department got gear including Humvees and a mine-resistant vehicle; the Suffolk County Police Department got Humvees, heavy-duty cargo trucks and more. There are situations when such equipment can be put to good use. Among them are terrorist attacks and natural disasters, like this month's flash flood, when Suffolk police in Humvees rescued motorists trapped by rapidly rising water.

But the indiscriminate flow of military equipment should be reined in. President Barack Obama has ordered a review of the programs. Congress is gearing up for hearings and legislation. The type of equipment available should be limited. Do police really need 14-ton ""mine-resistant ambush-protected"" vehicles designed to withstand roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan? Police should have to document a clear need for the equipment they seek. And restrictions should be imposed on how it can be used.

Police shouldn't be outfitted for war. The people they are sworn to protect and serve are not the enemy.","2014-08-25 18:40:00","1","28.0","65.0","27.0","0.0","14.0","0.0","209.0","36.0","0.0","108.0","0.0","15.0","0","300","87.59","43.37","3.37","1.00","13.64","31.33","74.33","40.33","3.67","1.67","0.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.00","2.00","6.33","12.67","9.33","3.00","6.33","1.00","13.00","4.00","3.00","1.67","1.67","2.00","6.00","0.67","5.33","0.67","3.33","0.00","3.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.67","0.00","2.33","3.00","1.00","0.67","3.33","2.00","1.67","0.00","0.33","1.00","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.67","13.33","0.00","0.33","10.33","1.00","1.67","3.33","8.00","0.00","9.00","1.33","5.00","2.67","8.67","1.00","0.00","0.67","0.00","1.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.33","7.00","2.67","0.00","0.33","0.33","0.00","2.00","0.67","1.00","0.00","0.33","1572","8.49","13.772727272727273","459","294","22","57.87","11.2","8.5","14.14","11.2","78","4.5","17.972244897959182","192","13.09","1","0.39","0","15","5","21","0","31","26","2","0","6","46","36","1","26","0","0","5","0","10","0","0","1","6","0","14","15","4","16","8","2","0","0","1","4"

"https://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/lane-filler/decision-on-race-in-america-is-in-after-ferguson-lane-filler-1.9650752","Decision on race in America is in","It turned out we didn’t need to know what the verdict was in the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, to confront some ugly facts and emotions.

In the afternoon came word that the grand jury considering the fatal police shooting of the 18-year-old had reached a decision. The cable news channels began to roll out talking heads, and show video of Ferguson. They pictured the streets where nothing had been announced, and shared learned analysis of the big thing that hadn't happened yet.

And then the preparations for potential violence began in Ferguson, and the speeches from the governor and other politicians, and the worrying of Americans who remember past riots, and the worrying of other (or the same) Americans who remember black men gunned down and cops uncharged.

As I write this it is nearly 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, meaning the announcement of the decision is about an hour away. But I don’t think we’ll know much more after the announcement, because we know so much now.

We know we are a nation with a nearly 400-year history of racial strife. We know each of these racially charged incidents, those that involve cops and those that don’t, from Rodney King to Trayvon Martin to Abner Louima to Michael Brown, take their place on the timeline of American race relations.

Brown was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. The shooting brought on huge protests and the wildly militaristic overreaction to the protests by the cops shocked the nation.

So there is a grand jury. And deliberations. And the politicization that always accompanies such situations.

It seems like we’re not getting anywhere with race relations anymore. It seems like progress has stopped. It seems like every time something like this happens so many people pick sides based on who looks more like them, who earns more like them, who lives more like them or talks more like them.

It will be hard to judge the grand jury decision once it is released. I won’t have heard the evidence. That’s true of everyone else, too, but many will judge the decision as right or wrong, instinctively, the minute it is announced.

And there may be violence. And there may not.

But in the hours building up to the announcement, as we watched the news and worried and waited and discussed it all on Twitter and Facebook and, in many cases, took our pre-assigned and pre-decided sides without a whit of information, I felt I was learning quite a bit.

We are a terrified nation, scared of “the other.” We are an angry nation, sure that “they” are getting away with something. We are a frustrated nation, feeling unheard and convinced that the other side always gets the megaphone.

We are a devastatingly divided nation, because of our history, our behavior and our prejudices.

Regardless of the decision. Regardless of the response to the decision.

"https://www.newsday.com/opinion/oped/small-town-tyrannies-preserve-race-inequities-clarence-page-1.9481871","Page: Small town tyrannies preserve race inequities","What a disappointment. Officials have retracted their promising report that voter registration surged by more than 3,000 in Ferguson, Missouri since August 9, when the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, by a white police officer touched off sometimes-violent protests.

The St. Louis County Election Board now says only 128 new people registered. The original figure turned out to be the number of previously registered voters who had re-registered to change their address or other personal information, Rita Days, St. Louis County's director of elections, said.

That's still good news for democracy, although not as much as I hoped. Racial unrest in Ferguson has underscored how much elections matter. Although 67 percent of its 21,000 residents are black, the mayor and five out of six council members are white, and only three members of its 53-person police force are African-American.

Yet shortly after liberal organizers set up voter registration booths near where Brown died, Matt Wills, the Republican National Committee's executive director for Missouri, expressed outrage. ""Injecting race into this conversation and into this tragedy,"" he said to the conservative Breitbart News, was ""disgusting,"" ""completely inappropriate,"" and ""fanning the political flames."" It is better to fan political flames, I would say, than to ignite real ones. Democracy fails when civic engagement is weak. In our system, if you feel misruled it is not only your right but your civic obligation to vote the old rascals out, even at the risk of voting new ones in.

Otherwise you leave the choice up to other people who may not have your community's best interests in mind.

Ferguson's tragedy has put a spotlight on a situation that is hardly unique. Mostly black cities with mostly white councils are a fact of life in scores of American cities, particularly in the South, according to a recent New York Times report.

Professor Jessica L. Trounstine, a political scientist at the University of California, Merced, has found the most common reasons include voter apathy in low-visibility local elections, transient populations and lack of information about the candidates and election days.

Off-year election turnouts tend to be older, more white and include more homeowners than the voters in presidential election years.

Ferguson's racially tilted government, many reasonably believe, reflects a similar disparity in voter turnout in its local elections. Blacks and whites had very similar turnout rates in Ferguson in the 2012 presidential year, according to an analysis by the Washington Post and the Catalist data-collection organization; however, white Ferguson residents in the April 2013 municipal elections were three times more likely to vote than the black turnout rate, which was only 6 percent.

Ferguson matters, then, not only as a racial tragedy unfolding in news media, but also as a symbol of what The New Republic's editor Franklin Foer recently called ""boom times for provincial autocrats"" across the country.

As much as some politicians howl about ""big government,"" Ferguson raises larger questions about threats to liberty posed by small governments.

One well-known example highlighted by the Ferguson unrest was the militarization of local police, causing local peace officers to look and behave more like an invading army.

A less visible menace is posed by what Professor Trounstine calls ""political monopoly,"" unobstructed one-party rule that leaves incumbents and their cronies free to abuse the privileges of their safe seats.

The most egregious example of this era of virtually unchallenged state and local abuses, as Foer argues, may be civil-asset forfeiture. Intended originally to go after drug lords and the like, civil-asset forfeiture allows law enforcement in many states to seize a person's cash or property without ever charging him or her with a crime.

All the authorities have to do is claim they believe the property was acquired illegally. Although this tactic is often used legitimately, horror stories include a SWAT team raid on a party at the Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit in May 2008.

Guests were knocked to the ground and forced to hand over their cars. Their offense? Partying in a space that wasn't properly permitted.

Justice Department investigators are looking into a similar abuse in Ferguson, where police processed an average of three warrants for each household. Millions in fines and court fees were collected from the city's poorest residents to fund various city operations.

Those are the same sort of residents who are least likely to turn out and vote in local elections. I expect their future turnout to improve significantly.

Or, as the Rev. Al Sharpton told local residents after Brown's death, their abysmal voter turnout ""is an insult to your children."" I don't often quote Rev.

Listen to Howie Hawkins and Michael McDermott","If you spend much time talking to mainstream politicians, you can get bored. As they bicker over who wants to cut property taxes more without coming up with ways to limit the expenditures the taxes pay for, the eyelids droop. As they joust about the (largely nonexistent) difference between giving people here illegally a path to citizenship, a path to legal residency and a garden path to sweep at substandard wages while awaiting deportation, the mind wanders.

""Is that all there is?"" you think, which inevitably leads you to wonder whether Peggy Lee, who so famously asked that question, is still alive.

You rouse yourself back to attentiveness, just in time to catch a ferocious agreement.

""Unlike my opponent, I will end the waste, fraud and abuse that is taking hard-earned dollars from taxpayers.""

""I oppose waste, fraud and abuse as much as you do . . . times infinity. Also, I'm like rubber, while you more closely resemble glue, and I think the voters know what that means.""

I wish someone would come out in favor of waste, fraud and abuse, just for variety: ""Many of my constituents benefit greatly by snatching ill-gotten crumbs falling from the huge and wasteful government maw, and I stand with them.""

There are, though, candidates who want to talk about big ideas. It's just that we've largely defined them as fringe folk, figures of fun who have no chance of seeing their ideals come to fruition and get little platform to espouse them.

Spend an hour talking to New York gubernatorial candidates Howie Hawkins of the Green Party or Libertarian Michael McDermott and you will not be bored. Both support actual ideologies they express honestly. And you don't have to agree with them, particularly on tactics, to recognize that their goals deserve discussion.

Hawkins wants 100 percent clean, renewable energy by 2030, and plenty of government funding to ensure it. McDermott sees the same future of sustainable energy dominating and fossil fuels waning, but via the free market, not government subsidies. And both oppose hydrofracking for natural gas in New York. They don't sort of think that maybe if the interminable studies officials have ordered not to be finished ever get finished, then with certain safeguards designed by supertintelligent robots, it might be or might not be safe to blah blah blah.

Hawkins wants a big state income tax increase on the wealthy and the reinstatement of a levy on every share of stock traded on Wall Street to let the state cut property taxes and send more money to municipalities, schools and universities. McDermott wants to abolish the state income tax over four years, which would return $40 billion a year to New Yorkers, and huge cuts in state spending.

Hawkins wants free, single-payer health care for everyone. McDermott wants individuals to have the freedom to pay for health care as they see fit.

I have spoken to at least 60 people seeking elective office in New York over the past two months and Hawkins and McDermott are the only two who've said they support legalizing marijuana for recreational use. These are big ideas. They are worth discussing, and mostly are rooted in laudable goals, even if the methods Hawkins and McDermott support are difficult to stomach. Big solutions to big problems are always difficult to stomach. The solutions that don't come with sacrifice don't work.

McDermott and Hawkins will debate Republican candidate Rob Astorino and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democrat, on Oct. 22 in Buffalo. It's the only debate scheduled and the best chance to hear Hawkins and McDermott. Astorino and Cuomo will get the attention, but that's not all there is, even if there are mainstream politicians who'd prefer you think so.

"https://www.newsday.com/opinion/oped/don-t-let-another-child-be-lost-to-heroin-linda-ventura-1.6982647","Ventura: Don't let another child be lost to heroin","I was on the Long Island Rail Road headed for Penn Station. As on every workday, I was preoccupied with meeting agendas, my hectic schedule, and the responsibilities of being the single mother of three.

Suddenly, my phone rang. I will never forget the uncontrollable sobbing in the voice of my youngest son, Andrew, as he choked out the words: ""He's dead, Tom's dead!""

I sat in shock on the moving train for what seemed forever before it occurred to me that I had to get home to Kings Park. As my body shook, I went from car to car in search of a conductor. I then blurted out: ""My son is dead, stop this train!""

The conductor ordered an emergency stop in Cold Spring Harbor. With no taxis or police cars in sight, I wandered the station aimlessly. A woman rolled down her car window and said, ""If you will trust me, I will take you wherever you need to go.""

When I arrived home, Suffolk police had sealed my house as a crime scene. Heroin had claimed my 21-year-old son, Thomas, on March 14, 2012.

The rawness of that tragic day came back to me last week when Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman died at 46 from an apparent heroin overdose -- casting a spotlight on the nation's heroin epidemic.

The deaths of Hoffman and my son underscore that sobriety is a lifelong journey -- and tenuous at best. Hoffman had unlimited funds and access to treatment, but that was no guarantee that sobriety would be permanent. And for addicts of lesser means, there's insufficient treatment.

That's why 50 Long Islanders and I lobbied in Albany last week for Senate Bill S4623, which would give decision-making authority for addiction treatment, including which type of care and for how long, to a medical professional.

The legislation amends state insurance law to ensure that patients suffering from drug and alcohol dependency get the lifesaving care they need when they need it by directing insurance companies to greenlight authorization and payment. If you pay your insurance premiums, you should be able to get treatment.

We need this legislation.

For a decade, heroin has strolled down Long Island's tree-lined streets, luring our young with its cheap cost and wide availability. Once it grabs hold, heroin morphs into the beast of addiction.

Thomas was a bright adventurous boy who grew into a sensitive young man, a star athlete at Kings Park High School who dreamed of playing lacrosse in college. But from age 19 until his death, my son attended several outpatient rehabilitation programs, several five-day detox programs and two 28-day inpatient programs.

He had been home for just one day from a 21-day rehabilitation center when he died. The night before, Thomas was clearheaded, talking about what he wanted to accomplish. It's a memory I cherish most: My daughter, Jennifer, was not home, but my two boys were being brothers, roughhousing, laughing and eating. At 7:15 the next morning, Andrew found Thomas dead of an overdose.

Our family dynamics began to change in 2004: Within three short years, my children lost three grandparents, and my husband and I divorced. My middle child began to use drugs and his life ultimately became consumed by heroin.

Amid all the stress of losing loved ones, Thomas began to self-medicate with marijuana, which opened the door to other drugs. As a family, we watched powerlessly as a healthy, vibrant teenager quit sports, and became broken and imprisoned by this insidious opiate. Heroin robbed me of my precious Thomas and left an unrecognizable young man. He became a mean, deviant thief.

Thomas's story will repeat itself if we don't act. About 669,000 people older than 12 used heroin in 2012, according to a survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. About 156,000 of them used the drug for the first time.

Thomas tried to quit heroin several times before he died. Like Hoffman and many others, he left this world far too early.

Let's try to end that trend.

"https://newrepublic.com/article/119083/prison-labor-equal-rights-wages-incarcerated-help-economy","It's Time to Pay Prisoners the Minimum Wage","In 1981, at the age of 42, Bob Sloan left prison a new man. Convicted of a “white-collar crime” in 1981, Sloan went to prison in Florida to serve a ten-year sentence. There, he got a degree in architectural design and worked as a draughtsman for a company called PRIDE, a prison industries company that also focuses on rehabilitation. He’ll be the first to tell you that the work he did in prison transformed him. “When I got out of there, job placement worked with me and I got two different jobs with them. I got on my feet—got my own home, my own car. I was on probation, and got all that taken care of. [Prison labor] introduced me back into society. That was a big impact and a big help.”

While in prison, Sloan was able to pay off all $10,000 of his restitution through his work as a draughtsman. He left prison in 1990, having paid off his debt to society and having gained the ability to contribute in a concrete way through the skills he developed “on the inside.” Sloan’s experience turned him into an advocate of rehabilitation of the incarcerated through labor programs. Having gained a sizeable following on the left, he now writes a blog for Daily Kos, chronicling and investigating the issues that surround prison labor in the United States, all while working on a book about prison labor in the United States.

With 2.4 million people currently incarcerated, the United States has the highest incarceration rate on the planet. 18% of those who are in federal prisons work in some capacity; the number of employed in state penitentiaries varies since some states require that all able-bodied prisoners work, while others provide very few programs. Yet these laborers—who frequently receive wages as low as 25 cents an hour, and whose maximum wage in Federal prisons is $1.15—may be the key to many states’ budget crises. To alleviate the increased strain on public services, more and more local jurisdictions are looking to prisoners as a cheap source of labor. While it’s difficult to quantify how much inmate labor has helped budgets as it varies on a case-to-case basis, The New York Times reported that Florida managed to save $2.4 million a year by employing inmates as farmers.



But the reason that prison labor saves money is that inmates aren’t treated like the rest of the country’s labor force. Sloan, for instance, has seen a shift in prison labor since he left his program. “It’s no longer dedicated to improving skills of inmates but directed to getting the highest profits [prison labor organizations] can get.” These prisoners lack virtually all of the basic rights that Americans “on the outside” take for granted: minimum wage, worker’s compensation if injured in an accident, the right to unionize. It may seem like this is saving us money, but in fact our economy loses out because of it. Estimates vary, but some analyses show that prisoners’ potential economic output could add up to $125 to each US citizen annually, if inmates worked at the minimum wage. So not only does this present problems on basic humanitarian grounds, but the economic benefits of prison labor would be even greater if the prisoners were afforded the same working rights as America’s free population.","2014-08-15 00:00:00","0","23.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","53.0","26.0","0.0","115.0","0.0","15.0","2","561","95.10","60.55","23.06","35.09","22.44","21.39","83.42","46.17","9.09","4.63","1.60","0.53","0.18","2.14","0.18","4.46","8.91","16.93","4.99","2.67","5.88","0.53","11.76","4.99","3.21","0.89","3.03","2.67","2.32","1.43","0.89","0.18","0.00","0.36","6.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.50","7.49","0.53","1.43","1.25","2.50","1.07","2.14","0.89","0.71","0.00","0.00","1.07","0.53","0.71","0.00","0.00","13.37","0.89","3.92","5.88","2.67","0.89","4.63","6.24","0.71","15.69","1.07","10.34","4.63","9.45","0.36","0.18","3.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.69","4.46","4.81","0.18","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.89","1.78","1.78","0.00","1.60","2564","8.0","26.0","816","552","27","59.23","12.4","10.1","10.73","11.5","117","7.25","18.638260869565215","308","22.91","6","0.46","0","13","18","64","0","84","38","2","2","5","98","23","4","41","0","1","23","8","18","1","0","4","17","0","14","27","11","17","12","15","5","2","1","2"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119102/what-white-st-louis-thinks-about-ferguson","White St. Louis Has Some Awful Things to Say About Ferguson","""The kid wasn't really innocent,"" chimed in a woman at the other end of the table (they all declined to give their names). ""He was struggling with the cop, and he's got a rap sheet already, so he's not that innocent."" (While the first point is in dispute, the second isn't: The police have said that Michael Brown had no criminal record.)

If anything, the people here were disdainful and, mostly, scared—of the protesters, and, implicitly, of black people.

""I don't think it's about justice for Michael Brown's family,"" said the teenage boy. ""It's just an excuse for people to do whatever they want to do.""

One man I talked to, a stay-at-home dad who is a landlord to three black tenants and one white one in Ferguson (""my black tenants would never do that,"" he clarified) was more sympathetic to Brown and also had the sense that the police had overdone it a bit. But he was scared of the protests. I told him that the protest that day was entirely peaceful, festive almost. ""You know,"" he said. ""I have a wife and three children, and if something were to happen to me, that would be very bad.""

As for the protests, well, they weren't about justice; they were just an excuse. ""People are just taking the opportunity to satisfy their desire for junk,"" said one woman, knowingly. As if black people, the lust for theft encoded in their DNA, are just barely kept in line by authority.

""When they kill each other, we never hear about it,"" one of the Starbucks women said. This, she meant, was a good thing. ""When it's black-on-black violence, we never hear about it.""

I asked why she thought that was.

""Because, basically, they hate whites!"" her friend chimed in. ""Prejudice, reverse prejudice. Prejudice goes both ways.""

The others signalled their agreement.

""It's not Ferguson people. It's a lot of outside people coming in.""

This was a sore subject with several of the people I spoke to. A major problem with the protests—and they very clearly did not mean the militarized police response to the protests—was that they were tarnishing St. Louis's image as a nice place.

""I'm embarrassed to say I'm from St. Louis,"" the ""bullshit"" woman grumbled.

""Me, too,"" said her friend. ""I don't tell people I'm from St. Louis anymore.""

""This is not representative of St. Louis,"" said one of the older women, back at Starbucks. ""St. Louis is a good place. And Ferguson is a very good place.""

""We have never had anything like this in St. Louis!"" her friend exclaimed, flustered, as if trying to clear the city's good name. ""Ever!""

As the women grew uncomfortable, one of them hit on a way to fight back.

""Where are you from?"" she asked me.

""Washington,"" I said.

""Well,"" she said, satisfied. ""You people have trouble too sometimes.""

"https://newrepublic.com/article/117853/obama-shoah-and-syria-hypocrisy-genocide","Obama, the Shoah, and Syria","The love and the loyalty that I feel toward the United States is not only an expression of conviction. It is also an expression of gratitude. This country took in my parents when they were broken people looking for a beginning after an ending. They were two of the saving remnants of Polish Jewry, living traces of an erased world. They were seeking, well, life after death, and here they found it. But in the haven of refugees in which I was raised the feeling about America was more complicated. America had helped Jews after the war, but America had not helped Jews during the war. There had been no significant exertions of rescue. The reverence of the American Jewish community for Roosevelt (a friend once told me of his father, a retired garment worker, standing at Roosevelt’s grave at Hyde Park and saying kaddish for him) was not shared by the recent arrivals. The survivors were interventionists. It was a corollary of their experience in hell.

In the formation of my views about morality and power, and of my sense of an obligation to imagine the desperation of doomed people, this became a kind of primal scene. In 1944, for example, it was proposed to various officials of the American government that the Allies bomb the rail lines that carried the Jews of Hungary to the extermination camps in Poland, and that they bomb the gas chambers at Auschwitz. In May, Michael Dov Ber Weissmandel, a Slovakian rabbi, pleaded: “How guilty will you feel in your hearts if you fail to move heaven and earth to help us in the only ways that are available to our own people and as quickly as possible? ... For God’s sake, do something now and quickly.” In July, John J. McCloy, the assistant secretary of war, dismissed the proposal as “impracticable” and wrote that “the War Department fully appreciates the humanitarian motives which prompted the suggested operation but . . . the operation suggested does not appear justified.” The mention of McCloy always fills me with repulsion: he became my supreme cautionary example of the collapse of human responsibility in foreign policy. Thirty years ago I invited Lucy Dawidowicz to review in these pages The Abandonment of the Jews: America and The Holocaust, 1941–1945 by David Wyman. She submitted a defense of American inaction about Europe’s Jews against Wyman’s withering indictment of it, noting that America had after all won the war, which in her view was all it had to do, and (in a bout of misplaced neoconservatism) accused Wyman of anti-Americanism. I refused to publish the piece. Candidly if a little grandiloquently, I told her (I never had occasion to say this to a writer before or since) that my conscience would not allow it. We never spoke again.

The question of the relevance of the Holocaust to humanitarian intervention is somewhat fraught. There are those who are offended by any analogy between the genocide of the Jews and other instances of systematic exterminatory evil; and there are others for whom such an analogy, always imprecise, is one of the central lessons of modern history. Whereas “none of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust, they demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference, and that our empathy leads to action”: President Obama spoke those words in Los Angeles recently. I would admire them coming from anybody. Coming from him, they sicken me. Syria, man, Syria! About his concluding reference to action, the president hastily added in exculpation of himself, “And that’s not always easy,” as if anybody thinks that it’s always easy. Obama’s statement reminded me of “the War Department fully appreciates the humanitarian motives which prompted the suggested operation but ...” It displayed the same sensitive insensitivity.

The president was in Los Angeles to accept an award from the Shoah Foundation. “In the face of acts of inhumanity, President Obama has not stood by,” Steven Spielberg foolishly declared when he presented the award. In the president’s remarks, you can track his decline from moral largeness into historical smallness: “Every day when I wake up, and I think about the young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria—when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids—and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think drop by drop by drop, that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.” He begins exquisitely and ends pusillanimously. He wants big emotions but not big actions. And what do people do who wish to emote but not to act? They tell stories. Instead of using American power, whose magnitude the president is anyway unclear about “at any given moment,” he mawkishly proposed to assist Assad’s millions of victims “by keeping memories alive, by telling stories, by hearing these stories,” and in this way “we can do our part.” This credible threat of a barrage of American narrativity will no doubt bring Assad to his knees.","2014-05-22 00:00:00","0","11.0","4.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","40.0","26.0","0.0","100.0","0.0","15.0","2","858","86.93","67.94","34.02","14.50","20.43","23.19","82.40","52.45","13.29","7.11","2.33","1.40","0.47","1.75","1.17","6.18","8.62","16.43","5.83","3.61","5.36","1.75","10.96","3.38","1.63","1.98","0.93","1.52","4.90","1.98","2.80","0.58","1.17","0.58","10.02","0.23","0.12","0.47","1.63","10.14","3.15","1.05","0.93","2.33","1.05","3.03","1.98","0.70","0.70","0.35","1.63","0.58","0.70","0.00","0.23","8.39","2.56","1.05","4.55","0.58","0.70","4.43","5.24","0.93","12.70","2.10","6.06","4.90","3.50","0.23","0.00","0.12","1.63","1.75","0.35","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.12","16.43","5.36","5.59","0.58","0.12","0.23","0.12","0.12","2.56","1.05","0.70","0.00","4037","8.23","22.842105263157894","1298","856","42","59.23","12.4","10.1","11.08","11.8","194","5.785714285714286","19.225420560747665","440","19.37","12","0.51","0","31","5","93","0","128","54","0","0","8","120","69","3","47","1","0","54","16","45","1","0","4","22","0","29","47","16","12","24","16","8","6","1","4"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119131/kentucky-democrats-go-after-mitch-mcconnell-coal","Now Even Republicans Are Being Accused of Waging a War on Coal","It’s not very often that Democrats can accuse Republicans of launching a war on coal. In Kentucky, Mitch McConnell’s opponents are savoring the chance.

A report from Chris Moody at Yahoo News earlier in August found that the Senate Minority Leader’s wife, Elaine Chao, sits on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies—a non-profit that donated $50 million toward the Sierra Club’s efforts to shut down at least 16 coal plants in Kentucky. Kentucky Democratic state representatives have since seized on the report. They are urging Chao to resign from the board (something Chao and McConnell’s camp have said she will not do) and, naturally, making as big a fuss as possible about it. ""If you're going to be a champion of coal then you can't play both sides,"" Steve Beshear, the state’s Democratic governor, told reporters on Thursday.

McConnell isn’t the only Kentucky Republican fielding such attacks. Rand Paul has said that Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat running against McConnell, “she sells her soul” to “the same ones who hate Kentucky coal. (Yes, that rhymes—he was doing it in poem form.) A Democratic party spokesperson responded that Paul is a hypocrite, because of a 2008 remark in which Paul said coal is a “very dirty” energy source.

Hypocrisy is always fair game in politics. But it’s hard—and a little silly—to suggest that Kentucky’s Republicans have been insufficiently loyal to coal. In 2013, the League of Conservation Voters gave Paul a rating of 15, out of a scale of 100. They gave McConnell a straight zero. It’s easy to see why. He voted in defense of oil tax breaks, for the Keystone XL pipeline, against EPA rules targeting coal pollution, and against the confirmation of the EPA chief Gina McCarthy. McConnell has also said, “For everybody who thinks [the planet] is warming, I can find somebody who thinks it isn't.” And that’s just the start of a very long list.","2014-08-19 00:00:00","0","12.0","2.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","56.0","26.0","0.0","118.0","0.0","14.0","2","323","90.09","66.77","11.94","48.77","17.94","20.74","70.90","46.13","9.60","3.10","0.31","0.00","0.62","1.55","0.62","6.50","9.29","14.24","8.05","3.10","3.72","1.55","14.86","4.64","1.55","1.55","2.48","0.62","4.95","3.10","1.86","0.00","0.93","0.31","8.67","0.31","0.00","1.24","0.62","8.36","1.24","1.86","0.31","1.86","0.62","3.10","3.41","0.31","1.86","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.19","1.55","0.93","3.41","0.62","0.31","4.33","9.60","0.93","11.15","0.93","7.74","2.48","3.10","1.24","0.00","1.24","0.31","0.31","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.31","0.00","0.00","21.05","5.57","5.88","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.31","2.79","4.33","1.24","0.93","1505","7.74","19.823529411764707","453","318","18","70.43","10.9","7.8","11.31","10.9","65","8.9","17.25610062893082","204","18.12","6","0.47","0","6","7","30","0","47","19","0","1","4","50","54","3","10","0","0","15","1","12","1","0","1","7","0","12","14","9","2","9","17","2","3","0","1"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119078/ferguson-civil-rights-cold-war-russia-protests","Ferguson Will Make It Harder for America to Set a Good Example Abroad","The America we pitched them, acting unwittingly in our homesickness as the best P.R. agents this country ever had, was a place of reason and measure, a place where there was dialogue even about the most difficult and thorny subjects. “Every system makes mistakes,” we told them. “It’s how the system addresses them.” The idea was that America fixed its mistakes, and actively, brightly fought the long shadows of slavery and the fact that there are still people around who are not very old who had to drink at different water fountains than other people. We dealt with these things, we told our Russian friends, empathizing with them, stuck as they were with a corrupt and cynical government. And we believed it.

We were not original in this. In the 1950s and 60s, the White House was painfully conscious that the civil rights movement was going to either be a boon or a thorn for their foreign policy when it came to grappling with the Soviet Union. The U.S.S.R, after all, was about equality, at least on paper. The now sacred Russian tactic of “whataboutism” started with civil rights: Whenever the U.S. pointed to Soviet human rights violations, the Soviets had an easy riposte. “Well, you,” they said, “lynch Negros.”



And they had a point.

And it made a difference. When the Voting Rights Act was gutted last summer, Louis Menand wrote about the role of civil rights in an America made self-conscious in its fight with the Soviet Union.

Southern mayors and governors were playing to their electoral bases. But American Presidents were trying to run a Cold War. They could live with Jim Crow when it was an invisible regional peculiarity, but once conditions were broadcast around the world they experienced an urgent need to make the problem go away. The pressure of world opinion was crucial to the speed with which civil-rights gains were made after 1954. It forced American Presidents to do something Presidents rarely do, which was to get out ahead of domestic opinion on the subject of race. When a bus carrying Freedom Riders was firebombed outside Anniston, Alabama, on Mother’s Day, 1961, and a photograph appeared the next day on the front page of the New York Times, John F. Kennedy was horrified. He had never heard of the Freedom Riders and had no idea what they were doing in Alabama. (They were testing the integration of interstate bus terminals pursuant to a recent Supreme Court decision. They were obliged to conclude that the decision had had little impact. Kennedy called the one person in the White House with a civil-rights brief, Harris Wofford. “Can’t you get your goddamned friends off those buses?” he said. “Stop them.” Sixty-three per cent of the American public disapproved of the Freedom Riders, but American public opinion was not Kennedy’s concern. His first summit meeting with Nikita Khrushchev was scheduled to take place in Vienna in three weeks, and he could see Khrushchev waving the Times in his face. As Mary Dudziak explains in her important book “Cold War Civil Rights” (2000), the trick was to turn a failure of government into something that looked like a triumph of government. Civil rights had to become a story about how American democracy confronted an injustice and eradicated it. The nation that had liberated Europe from racist domination had gone to the rescue of another captive people. It was important to do this heroically, not apologetically. No elected official relishes having to deal with a charismatic popular leader; the usual forms of leverage are not effective. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson did not especially like dealing with King. But they needed him, because they needed a hero whose vision the democratic system could realize. The triumphalist narrative demanded it.

Unwittingly, we carried on that triumphalist narrative, long after the Cold War was won, as was, we were told, the fight over civil rights. Bush was gone, Obama was the president, and we could once again represent a just and luminous America. It was so much easier for everyone that way, both for our Russian friends who felt imprisoned by a deeply unjust system, ready to annihilate them at a moment’s notice, and for us, living swaddled in that society. We liked to think we had a just a lovely place to go to home to, and that these few just and lovely Russians could escape there with us.

Watching the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, it’s hard not to wince looking back at that, at our foolish idea of our country. Russian police arrested journalists at protests, not American cops. And, even if the chances are higher that heads will roll here for something like this than in Russia, it’s hard not to notice one thing: Even at the height of the race riots in Moscow, at the height of the crackdown on the opposition, even the Russian police did not use rubber bullets.","2014-08-14 00:00:00","0","21.0","4.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","39.0","26.0","0.0","100.0","0.0","15.0","3","830","84.34","78.33","20.91","27.77","18.04","21.33","79.40","50.96","11.33","5.54","0.00","2.17","0.36","0.84","2.17","5.78","9.40","14.22","7.83","4.34","4.82","1.69","14.10","4.34","2.65","1.81","1.33","1.20","5.66","2.89","2.77","0.12","1.57","0.24","9.88","0.12","0.36","0.24","0.84","9.52","2.29","1.45","1.45","1.33","0.84","2.77","2.29","0.96","0.36","0.84","0.84","0.24","0.36","0.00","0.24","8.55","2.89","1.45","3.73","1.08","0.72","8.43","3.86","0.36","13.37","1.69","7.47","4.46","2.41","0.36","0.60","0.12","0.12","0.48","0.48","0.12","0.24","0.00","0.12","0.00","16.39","6.14","6.14","0.24","0.12","0.12","0.00","0.48","1.93","0.84","0.36","0.00","3851","7.86","20.463414634146343","1179","823","46","70.23","11.3","7.9","10.61","10.4","174","7.0","17.616865127582017","418","18.44","9","0.48","0","26","9","94","0","99","65","2","2","6","107","85","4","43","0","0","48","13","41","0","1","2","25","0","27","75","15","17","8","4","5","4","1","8"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119161/100-percent-renewable-added-july","All of the U.S.'s New Electricity in July Came from Renewables","Clean energy still counts for a pretty small portion of our energy. While coal provides 39 percent, renewables like solar and wind add up to just 13 percent of our total supply. But policies to improve our energy mix—tax credits for wind and solar, state-level standards requiring utilities to rely more on renewables—are having a real impact. You can see it July's Energy Infrastructure Update, which the federal government just released.

Last month, a full 100 percent of the new electricity generating capacity added at the utility level came from wind, solar, and water in the U.S. This counts renewables that power utilities in the energy grid—but doesn’t include solar installed on the rooftops of homes and businesses. Wind and solar added 379 megawatts and 31 megawatts respectively for July, bringing the two sources' total installed capacity to 6 percent of the utility sector.

But natural gas is still the main new source of electricity this year, even if the oil and gas sector saw no growth last month. Natural gas accounted for 46 percent of new installations for the first seven months of the year, compared to over a quarter each for wind and solar. While natural gas emits less carbon emissions than coal, it's not necessarily ""cleaner."" Its methane emissions—a greenhouse gas—are 34 times as potent as carbon over the long-run.

FERC’s monthly data tends to be volatile, but it also shows the slowdown in new coal installations. The coal industry added 16 percent of capacity by this time last year. So far this year, coal added zero.","2014-08-21 00:00:00","0","12.0","2.0","6.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","49.0","26.0","0.0","116.0","0.0","14.0","2","267","94.18","48.50","47.33","80.17","20.54","21.72","71.91","38.20","5.24","1.50","0.00","1.12","0.37","0.00","0.00","3.75","7.49","13.48","3.00","3.00","7.12","1.12","4.87","6.74","3.00","0.37","5.24","5.99","3.00","3.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.24","0.00","1.12","0.37","0.75","1.12","2.62","1.50","1.12","0.00","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.37","6.37","1.12","0.75","2.62","1.87","0.00","2.25","4.87","0.00","18.35","1.50","7.49","9.36","3.37","0.00","0.37","1.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.48","5.62","4.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.75","0.75","1.87","0.00","0.00","1251","8.2","19.428571428571427","393","260","14","61.06","11.9","9.4","11.66","11.4","60","7.166666666666666","18.67076923076923","158","18.29","3","0.38","0","12","11","26","0","33","27","0","0","1","66","11","0","22","0","0","4","4","14","2","0","0","6","0","5","8","4","3","4","8","1","0","0","0"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119190/anti-obamacare-lawsuit-gets-even-more-shameless","Republican Lawyers' Latest Sneak Attack on Obamacare Is Their Most Brazen Yet","In fact, insurance market jitters have not materialized, and Carvin’s “clawback” specter is wrong, as a matter of law, as health law expert Timothy Jost has noted. But more important, a do-over by the full D.C. Circuit will do, quite literally, nothing to exacerbate these and other horribles paraded in Carvin’s brief. Carvin fears that the Supreme Court may well stay its hand, if the case is reheard at the appellate level. But the choice will still be up to that Court. If the justices consider it urgent to impose their take, rather than wait to see if the elimination of a circuit split vitiates the necessity for intervention, the lower court’s en banc deliberations certainly won’t stop them. On the contrary, a decision not to rehear the case will wrest the wait-and-see option from the high court, increasing pressure for it to intervene before the appellate process has run its course. In effect, Carvin seeks to bluff the D.C. Circuit into turning the usual roles of the courts of appeals and the Supreme Court upside down.

Carvin’s brief also hints at the strategy that he and his allies are settling on to carry the day if their case reaches the Supreme Court. Although the only question for the D.C. Circuit is, at least nominally, whether en banc review is warranted by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, a full one third of the brief is devoted to defending the substantive case Judge Thomas Griffith made to justify invalidating federal exchange-based premium assistance. Significantly, that case is narrower and different from the line of argument on which Carvin and his allies have relied for the past two years. They have insisted that, far from being a mere “glitch” with “unintended consequences,” Congress actually barred premium assistance through federal exchanges on purpose—to “incentivize” states to set up their own exchanges, by depriving their residents of premium assistance if the states opted out. Judge Griffith backed their bottom line, but he jettisoned the “purpose” part of their argument, pointedly observing that they “fail to marshal persuasive evidence in support of [key elements of] their theory.” In effect, he retreated to opponents’ original approach: insist that, viewed in isolation, the ACA’s reference to exchanges “established by the state” can mean only exchanges operated by a state government, not the federal government; then caricature—as “rewriting the text” to serve some hypothesized, non-textual “purpose”—contextual reading of that phrase, that avoids effectively nullifying numerous other provisions, and rendering unworkable the exchanges the statute was enacted to create. Never mind, Griffith acknowledged, that that interpretation “bodes ill” for “millions of individuals receiving tax credits through federal Exchanges and for health insurance markets more broadly”—the very constituencies and markets the ACA aimed to benefit.

ACA opponents have jumped to push out Griffith’s hard-nosed approach. “Halbig v. Burwell: Plain Language Trumps ‘Purpose,’” National Review Online blared, in a typical headline. They evidently believe their chances of winning all five members of the Supreme Court’s conservative bloc will rise, if this brow-furrowing squabble over dense legislative terminology can be framed as an epochal front in a three-decade-old holy war between two schools of jurisprudential theory about how judges should interpret statutes. On one side, led by Justice Antonin Scalia, with prominent conservative judges and battalions of academics in support, are self-styled “textualists.” They turn the unobjectionable notion that deciding what a law means must start with its actual text, into an intense preoccupation with dictionary definitions of particular statutory words. Their adversaries, on whom they have hung the awkward label, “purposivists,” are led by former Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice Stephen Breyer, likewise supported by high-profile federal judges and academic legions. They counter that this loaded brand of textualism is inherently ""conservative,"" and an excuse for using isolated legislative language to “turn laws on their heads,” and “defeat the purpose for which a provision was enacted.”

“Purposivist” disciples may be tempted to seize upon the ACA premium assistance challenges to skewer their philosophical adversaries. Indeed, the day after Judge Griffith’s decision, University of California law professor Richard Hasen put the blame on “unfeeling” Scalian textualism, spotlighting the purposivist “counterargument that courts have an obligation to make laws work … especially these days, when Congress is not working.” But thus broadening the stakes in these lawsuits is a mistake. The better—and accurate—tack is that opponents’ route to interpreting federal exchanges into self-immolation is so hyper-blinkered that it flouts bedrock axioms common to all legitimate interpretational theologies. Justice Scalia has often reiterated that “Statutory construction is a ‘holistic endeavor.”In a June 2014 decision, he referenced the “fundamental canon that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme"" adding that a statutory ""provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme … because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law."" As determined by six of the eight judges who have ruled on the matter to date, when judges of any stripe conscientiously fulfill this “duty to construe statutes as a whole,” in the words of one of those judges, Richmond, Virginia Federal District Judge (and Reagan appointee) James Spencer, the ACA readily authorizes premium assistance on all exchanges, state or federal.","2014-08-25 00:00:00","0","14.0","8.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","51.0","26.0","0.0","105.0","0.0","14.0","2","915","95.58","55.64","14.47","24.04","29.52","31.15","71.69","42.73","7.32","2.84","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.66","2.19","4.48","9.07","14.75","5.36","2.19","4.81","0.77","8.85","4.15","2.08","0.98","1.42","1.20","4.26","2.08","2.19","0.44","0.44","0.66","4.81","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.66","11.04","3.06","2.62","1.20","2.51","1.53","2.62","0.66","0.33","0.00","0.22","0.87","0.33","0.44","0.11","0.00","8.42","0.33","1.97","5.25","0.98","0.66","1.09","6.01","0.98","10.82","1.97","6.34","3.06","4.26","0.00","0.11","1.75","0.22","0.11","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.11","0.00","19.02","4.04","6.01","0.22","0.11","0.00","0.00","1.42","5.46","1.31","0.22","0.22","4751","9.59","35.53846153846154","1475","894","31","42.24","16.9","14.5","15.33","19.0","256","7.583333333333334","24.974138702460852","482","30.73","11","0.42","0","23","11","98","0","124","91","3","1","12","145","84","0","67","0","1","14","18","34","2","0","4","28","0","37","18","21","28","19","28","7","3","0","3"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119045/cities-are-liberal-urban-states-are-weaker-us-senate","Cities Are Liberal, But Urban States Are Weaker in the U.S. Senate","The chart that all the political junkies are sharing today is about the politics of cities. It plots public opinion in 51 large cities on a left-right axis, relative to (what I gather is) the typical American voter. The Economist produced the chart, using a study written by Chris Warshaw of MIT and Chris Tausanovitch from UCLA and published in the American Political Science Review. Here's what it looks like:

The results aren’t all that surprising. The residents of San Francisco are the most liberal, followed in succession by people living in Washington, D.C., Seattle, Oakland, and Boston. But the real takeaway, as Adrianna McIntyre points out at Vox, is that the vast majority of the 51 cities are on the left end of the spectrum. Less than a dozen skew conservative. They are mostly cites in the South and interior West, such as Colorado Springs and Virginia Beach, known for large populations of religious conservatives.

Assuming that I've read the data correctly and that it holds up to scrutiny, the chart is interesting for its own sake. But it’s also a reminder of a fundamental problem with our democracy, one that’s baked into the constitutional order. I’m talking, of course, about the United States Senate, where the apportionment of two seats for each state can give rural states disproportionate power—power that comes at the expense of urban states, the ones with lots of the left-leaning cities.","2014-08-11 00:00:00","0","12.0","4.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","51.0","26.0","0.0","116.0","0.0","15.0","2","241","97.33","51.66","17.33","40.72","21.91","22.41","73.86","45.64","7.88","2.07","1.24","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.41","5.81","12.03","16.18","5.81","2.90","4.56","0.41","11.62","5.81","2.49","1.24","2.07","2.90","1.66","1.24","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.47","0.83","1.24","0.41","2.07","1.66","1.66","0.83","0.83","0.00","0.00","1.24","0.00","0.41","0.41","0.41","6.22","1.24","0.00","4.15","0.00","0.83","2.49","7.88","0.00","12.03","0.83","9.54","0.83","4.98","0.41","0.83","0.83","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.01","5.39","7.05","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.83","0.00","2.49","0.83","0.00","1139","8.62","22.454545454545453","355","237","12","59.84","12.5","9.8","11.72","12.0","60","6.833333333333333","20.046582278481015","159","20.27","7","0.48","0","8","4","31","0","42","22","0","0","1","29","30","1","18","2","0","8","2","5","0","1","1","2","0","3","2","7","4","9","11","1","2","0","1"

Human rights groups have criticized military commissions as lacking the due process protections that are guaranteed in federal courts. But Martins said that the top priority for the commissions is to ensure that “a fair trial and national security are upheld. The American people should be able to have both of those.”

The defense lawyers representing the 9/11 detainees tell a very different story. In the same press conference, defense attorneys Walter Ruiz and James Connell described the military commissions as a system that is more committed to hiding evidence of torture than giving the prisoners a fair trial. For nearly an hour, the two lawyers rattled off examples of the U.S. government’s misconduct in the 9/11 case.

Ruiz represents Mustafa Al Hawsawi, one of the alleged 9/11 planners. Last month, he filed a motion arguing that the conditions of his client’s detention violate international human rights law. Specifically, he referenced solitary confinement, the ban on making phone calls (including to family members), and restrictions on the detainees’ ability to worship as a group. Ruiz has not yet been able to visit his client in Camp 7, the highly secretive facility that houses the high-value detainees. (Details of his client’s detention conditions come from reports by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The ICRC has made more than 90 visits to the Guantánamo Bay since 2002, but records from their visits are treated as classified. Last year, the defense team got access to the reports through a court motion.)

Another 9/11 detainee, Ammar al Baluchi, has not been allowed to send letters to people outside of the prison, a privilege afforded to prisoners in high-security prisons in the U.S. “We’re not talking about writings about jihad,” said Connell, who represents him. “I had in my possession a letter from my client to an important mitigation witness saying, ‘This is my lawyer, please talk to him.’”","2014-08-11 00:00:00","0","16.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","47.0","26.0","0.0","106.0","0.0","15.0","3","371","97.93","79.07","8.96","40.29","21.82","28.03","75.20","43.13","8.09","4.31","1.35","0.81","0.00","1.89","0.27","3.77","11.05","15.63","4.85","1.89","2.70","1.08","10.78","5.66","3.23","0.81","3.77","1.89","4.58","2.70","1.89","0.00","1.08","0.00","11.86","0.27","0.00","0.00","1.89","7.01","1.35","1.35","0.81","0.54","0.81","2.16","2.43","0.27","1.62","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.78","2.16","1.35","5.12","0.54","2.16","2.16","6.20","0.00","10.78","2.43","5.39","2.70","4.04","0.54","0.54","0.00","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.68","5.66","5.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.54","2.96","1.89","1.62","1.62","1787","9.0","25.2","567","365","19","51.99","13.2","10.8","12.71","12.5","102","8.8","20.858082191780824","224","22.87","8","0.43","0","5","14","46","0","45","24","1","0","1","60","35","0","36","0","0","9","7","9","1","0","1","15","0","8","10","11","11","12","11","3","3","0","0"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/117838/putins-far-right-european-admirers-run-european-parliament-may","Putin Has Far-Right Admirers All Over Europe, and They're Up for Election This Month","Since the mid-2000s, the Kremlin has courted the European far right. The Continent’s rightists, in turn, have pledged allegiance. Extremist parties in Eastern Europe supported Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008, reserving special criticism for Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili’s pro-American policies. Nick Griffin, the leader of the UK’s xenophobic British National Party, commended Russia for having “a robust, transparent and properly democratic system” after the rigged parliamentary elections in 2011. Last year, Italy’s Fronte Nazionale praised Putin for his opposition to homosexuality.

Of all of Europe’s far right, however, it is Hungary’s Jobbik party with which the Kremlin has the closest relationship. The largest right-wing party in Eastern Europe and the third-largest party in Hungary (it won over one-fifth of the vote in last month’s parliamentary elections), Jobbik counts Nazi sympathisers and anti-Semites amongst its supporters. Jobbik’s pro-Russia policies are clear: It wants Hungary to turn its back on the EU and join Putin’s Eurasian Customs Union, and it seeks to maintain the EU’s gas dependence on Russia. Last year, Jobbik’s leader spoke at the prestigious Moscow State University and met with members of the Duma. Jobbik’s website heralded the visit as “a major breakthrough” which made “clear that Russian leaders consider Jobbik as a partner.”

In exchange for their support, many of these parties are rumored to be funded by the Kremlin. For its part, however, Russia does not just gain from its propaganda being legitimized in European political institutions. It also furthers its geopolitical designs to destabilize Europe by seeing pro-Russian politicians and governments come to power on the Continent.

Why does this matter? Between May 22 and 25, voters across the EU will choose their representatives at the European Parliament. Amid the continuing financial crisis and failing public trust in mainstream politicians in Europe, the elections are likely to deliver considerable success for populist and extremist parties, including those on the far right who are closely aligned with the Kremlin. Bulgaria’s Ataka Party—with its ultranationalist, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic rhetoric—even launched its campaign for the elections in Moscow.

For years, the far right’s passion for Putin was known only to its own members. But as right wing parties increasingly wade into the mainstream, their secrets can’t remain hidden for long. Nigel Farage, leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), recently announced that Putin was the world leader he most admired, while also blaming the EU for “destabilizing” Ukraine. This is the same Farage who parrots Putin’s propaganda in his regular appearances on the state-owned television channel RT. While UKIP targets the same electorate as the far right—making key issues out of immigration, European integration, the perception that political elites are out of touch and threats to national identity—it does so with a polish that many of its Continental counterparts lack. The rise of competent far right parties such as UKIP poses the same threat as the rise of the EU’s rightist extremists for those concerned about Putin’s growing influence in European politics.","2014-05-21 00:00:00","0","15.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","74.0","26.0","0.0","120.0","0.0","15.0","3","509","97.11","73.52","18.05","82.17","22.13","31.43","70.53","40.67","6.68","1.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.59","0.59","5.50","8.64","15.91","3.93","2.36","5.11","0.39","7.27","6.48","2.95","0.98","1.38","0.98","5.30","4.13","0.98","0.39","0.79","0.20","7.66","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.59","4.91","0.98","1.38","0.39","0.59","0.59","0.98","1.57","0.98","0.20","0.20","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.00","11.20","3.73","2.36","6.09","0.59","1.18","1.77","4.72","0.59","14.54","1.96","10.61","2.55","5.30","2.55","0.00","0.59","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.20","0.20","0.00","0.00","18.27","4.32","5.50","0.20","0.00","0.20","0.00","1.96","1.57","3.73","0.79","0.00","2671","9.52","24.0","804","495","23","49.65","13.6","11.7","15.26","15.8","151","6.916666666666667","22.802020202020202","285","21.59","10","0.42","0","13","6","50","0","72","61","0","3","2","64","85","0","34","0","0","7","14","22","0","1","1","9","0","11","17","13","11","12","14","3","2","0","1"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119071/michael-brown-shooting-we-know-about-racial-profiling-dont-act","Michael Brown Shooting: We Know About Racial Profiling But Don't Act","For the last 14 years, Missouri officials have been unusually meticulous about keeping track of potential racial profiling in their state. Thanks to a 2000 law passed by the state’s general assembly, one of the first of its kind in the nation, Missouri police officers are required to record the age, gender, and race of every driver they pull over, as well as whether they searched, issued a citation to, or arrested the driver. The Missouri attorney general then compiles the data and issues an annual Vehicle Stops Report for every city in the state. Because of these reports, we know that in 11 of the last 14 years, the likelihood of a black driver being pulled over and searched by the police in Missouri has increased.

These reports are also why we know an awful lot about the racial breakdown of traffic stops in Ferguson—the St. Louis suburb where, on Saturday afternoon, an unarmed African-American teenager named Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer. According to last year’s Vehicle Stop Report for Ferguson, African-American drivers there represented 86 percent of all traffic stops despite making up only 67 percent of the city’s population; white drivers, by contrast, accounted for only about 13 percent of the traffic stops in Ferguson despite making up 29 percent of its population. Meanwhile, African-American drivers accounted for nearly 93 percent of the arrests and whites only 7 percent, despite the fact that, when Ferguson police did search drivers, they found contraband on more than a third of their white targets and only a fifth of their black ones. Long before a police officer pulled up his car alongside Brown, who was walking in the middle of the street, and allegedly told him to “get the fuck on the sidewalk”—long before, depending on whose version of events you believe, Brown reached into the car and the officer shot him, or Brown put his hands in the air and was shot by the officer—black residents of Ferguson had ample reason to distrust and resent their police force.

And we had ample evidence to explain and understand their distrust and resentment. The problems of being a racial minority in America are hardly a secret. The statistics—on everything from racial profiling to health disparities to income inequality—are out there and can be found in university libraries or data-journalism websites. The problem is the divide between knowledge and action. As a recent St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial notes about those attorney general reports, “Every year these numbers come out to little fanfare.” And that’s a big problem—because, until something horrendous like Brown’s death occurs, there are thousands of less-horrendous-but-by-no-means-trivial injustices that go unaddressed.

What’s more, there are many types of injustices that don’t end in gunfire. That’s obviously a good thing—but too often it means these injustices are ignored. As I wrote this week in my story about the end of the civil rights movement, just because African-Americans in the South are no longer being attacked with billy clubs and police dogs doesn’t mean they aren’t being harmed in other, more insidious ways—whether by new voter ID laws or their governor’s refusal to expand Medicaid.","2014-08-14 00:00:00","0","11.0","2.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","48.0","26.0","0.0","102.0","0.0","15.0","2","548","93.18","55.07","42.66","5.92","28.84","25.18","77.74","47.63","7.85","3.83","0.55","0.55","0.18","0.73","1.82","4.01","8.76","16.97","5.66","4.38","6.57","0.91","10.40","5.29","2.74","1.46","2.74","3.10","3.28","0.73","2.55","0.00","1.28","0.00","5.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.73","10.04","2.55","1.64","0.55","2.19","1.28","2.92","2.37","2.19","0.00","0.18","0.73","0.18","0.36","0.18","0.00","8.21","0.73","0.36","4.93","0.36","1.82","3.10","5.84","0.36","15.15","2.37","7.48","5.11","3.83","0.18","0.18","0.55","0.00","0.36","0.36","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","14.05","3.47","5.47","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","2.19","0.73","2.01","0.00","0.00","2618","8.33","34.9375","795","528","19","51.72","14.0","13.0","12.77","16.6","111","11.375","21.52909090909091","290","29.56","2","0.46","0","23","11","59","1","86","46","4","0","1","93","35","1","41","0","0","12","11","25","1","0","4","11","0","9","20","11","15","19","10","2","2","1","3"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/117843/levin-brothers-want-end-tax-inversion-gop-refuses","U.S. Corporations Are Exploiting a Huge Tax Loophole, but the GOP Doesn't Want to Close It","The brothers Levin—Senator Carl Levin and Representative Sander Levin—are fed up with domestic companies merging with foreign firms to lower their tax bill, especially when the new entity’s business and management remains located in the United States. So on Tuesday, they introduced bills in the Senate and House respectively that would crack down on this tax-avoidance strategy, known as tax inversion.

American companies have exploited this loophole by merging with foreign firms and transferring their official address to the foreign country. Under current U.S. tax law, if the American company transfers at least 20 percent of its shares to the foreign firm, it can avoid paying the 35 percent U.S. corporate rate. Instead, it would fall under jurisdiction of the foreign nation. “In that situation, I would say it’s not really a new company,” said Steve Wahmoff, the legislative director at Citizens for Tax Justice. “It’s still the same American company, it just gobbled up some smaller company. They haven’t changed. They’re still managed in the U.S. They’re still doing most of their business in the U.S.”

Companies have been using tax inversion to lower their tax bill more frequently in recent years, with 14 firms doing so since 2011, according to Bloomberg. Pharmaceutical firms have been particularly active in merging with smaller pharma companies in Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is just 12.5 percent. The most prominent of these was Pfizer’s attempted purchase of AstraZeneca for $119 billion—with Pfizer potentially saving $1 billion a year in U.S. taxes in the process. The deal fell apart because AstraZeneca believed that Pfizer was buying it for cost and tax-minimization purposes.

The Levin proposal, which mirrors one in President Barack Obama’s budget, would curtail this strategy by raising the threshold from 20 to 50 percent. In other words, foreign shareholders must own the majority of shares of the new entity for it to avoid U.S. taxes. In addition, if management and control of the company remain in the United States, it must pay the U.S. corporate tax.","2014-05-21 00:00:00","0","14.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","54.0","26.0","0.0","119.0","0.0","14.0","2","341","93.12","59.26","20.84","17.28","22.73","29.03","75.37","43.99","7.33","2.05","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.76","5.28","7.62","15.54","6.74","4.40","3.81","0.59","9.09","4.40","3.23","0.88","3.52","2.93","2.35","0.88","1.47","0.88","0.00","0.59","5.57","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.29","8.21","0.59","1.76","2.35","1.76","1.17","2.35","0.59","0.00","0.59","0.00","0.88","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.59","9.09","0.88","1.17","6.16","0.00","0.88","3.23","4.40","0.29","15.25","1.47","9.38","4.40","10.85","0.00","0.88","7.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.48","8.50","5.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.59","1.17","2.35","0.00","0.59","1692","8.74","23.8","527","336","19","53.51","12.8","10.2","12.87","12.1","90","8.4","19.794285714285714","191","21.47","15","0.43","0","6","13","32","0","47","25","2","2","7","58","42","2","20","0","0","14","5","16","1","1","3","7","0","10","10","12","7","8","3","2","0","0","2"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119070/michael-browns-death-leads-scrutiny-ferguson-white-police","Ferguson’s Police Force Is 94 Percent White—And That’s Basically Normal in the U.S.","The police forces in large cities tend to be the most diverse, reflecting their populations—cities of one million or more average police forces that are 56 percent white, and 17.6 percent black. Generally, police forces get less diverse as you move down in population size.

Of course, these are just averages and they do not take into account the diversity of the cities themselves. Research also suggests, though, that representation makes a difference in how a community views and trusts police. For example, a 2011 study from the Department of Justice found that a driver stopped by an officer of the same race was more likely to think the reason was legitimate than a driver stopped by an officer who looked different (83 percent vs. 74 percent viewing the stop as legitimate). In Ferguson, blacks are stopped 86 percent of the time and searched 92 percent, though few are found with contraband.

Diversity of officers is not the answer to all of the problems in the law enforcement system, Nusrat J. Choudhury, an attorney with the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program, told me. The New York Police Department is the most diverse force in the country, but a judge found its Stop and Frisk program violated people of color’s civil rights. The disparity in New York’s Stop and Frisk program look a lot like Ferguson’s issues—83 percent of the stops targeted minorities who made up half of the city’ population. And 90 percent of the people stopped were innocent.","2014-08-13 00:00:00","0","13.0","4.0","6.0","0.0","14.0","0.0","53.0","26.0","0.0","112.0","0.0","14.0","2","250","97.73","51.60","22.16","25.77","22.73","24.40","79.20","42.00","4.80","2.00","0.40","0.00","0.40","0.00","1.20","2.80","12.00","14.00","4.40","2.40","6.00","0.80","11.60","6.80","4.80","1.20","4.80","6.80","1.60","0.80","0.80","0.00","0.40","0.00","4.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.00","2.80","3.20","0.40","2.40","0.40","3.60","3.20","3.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.80","0.40","0.00","7.60","0.80","4.00","5.60","6.40","0.00","10.00","0.40","5.20","4.40","5.60","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.80","4.80","5.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.00","0.80","0.00","1175","7.58","25.5","369","248","13","60.55","12.0","9.6","11.14","11.2","47","7.916666666666666","17.220645161290324","154","22.5","2","0.44","0","9","12","33","0","33","19","2","0","0","44","23","0","20","0","0","4","2","5","1","2","1","3","0","3","12","2","5","11","5","1","2","0","1"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119057/obama-immigration-policy-critics-have-irrational-fear-precedent","The Liberal Fear of Obama's Executive Action Is Irrational","I can’t claim to know (yet) whether a presidential administration has identical discretion over tax law as it does over immigration law, so I don’t know whether this would pass the threshold test of legality. I suspect the president has more discretion over the latter than the former, and if deferred action for recently deceased wealthy people were slam-dunk illegal, I would oppose it on those grounds. But assuming President Ted Cruz could plausibly shield estates valued below, say, $20 million from tax, within the bounds of the law, my instinct would neither be to scream “Caesar!” nor to blame Obama for setting a bad precedent, but to note that Cruz was insane. It’d be crazy for any president to apply tax law more leniently to people who hit the estate tax threshold than to regular people who don't accrue much if any wealth, and I believe they’d ultimately lose that fight in the political realm, either through legislation or at the ballot or upon the election of a Democratic president who would resume strict enforcement.

Note, though, that the right's response to DACA 2.0 isn't to press Democrats to vote for the Steve King plan to resume deportation of DREAMers, or to take comfort in the knowledge that a Republican president will undo all this some day, but to scream ""lawlessness!"" sight unseen. Because, substantively, the politics aren't on their side.

This brings us back to the question of method, which opponents of any action will invariably deploy as shells for their ideological priors. But even a limited debate over procedure isn’t a slam dunk, either for opponents of deferred action, or for those who worry about partisan blowback. Congress gave Obama the discretion he’s planning to use and Congress can take it away. Congress won’t do that, though, just like Congress hasn’t created a pathway to citizenship for eleven million immigrants currently living in the country without authorization. At least not yet. I’m not sure how we get from this impasse to the conclusion that Obama’s establishing a uniquely troublesome norm on purely procedural grounds. By what standard is the broad but legitimate use of enforcement discretion a categorically worse violation of political norms than capricious imposition of the Hastert rule? Is there a number of deferred action beneficiaries past which executive action loses its legitimacy and becomes a dangerous norm violation?

I don’t think you can get there without trespassing into substance and politics. And substantively I think the arguments for deferred action are much stronger—morally and practically—than the status quo. The day after Obama’s order takes effect, almost nothing will change for the vast majority of U.S. citizens, while the beneficiaries (most of whom are unlikely to be deported anyhow) will enjoy much-needed breathing room and glorious new tax obligations. This is part of what makes it a more politically attractive use of discretion than the consequential, conservative alternatives Chait imagines, which entail environmental damage, higher deficits, class warfare, and discrimination.

Moreover, I think we're situated at a unique moment, where there's a compelling and exigent moral case for this kind of supposed ""norm violating."" Congress is very likely one to three years away from passing a law that will give permanent protection to this same class of people. But it isn't quite there yet. Under the circumstances, Obama's move wouldn't just constitute a judicious allocation of resources, but an eminently humane reprieve for the hundreds or thousands of unlucky duckies who'd otherwise get ensnared in the deportation process between today and the day Congress ultimately gets its act together. And if the politics of immigration change dramatically in the next one two three years, deferred action will disappear along with it.

In this way, it's unlike any other act of discretion I can imagine in the current environment. If Ted Cruz becomes president and his Republican Congress gets to work on a comprehensive tax reform plan that would (among other things) abolish the estate tax, a decision to defer estate tax enforcement through 2017 might make sense (again, assuming legality) to avoid penalizing people who have the misfortune of dying before Cruz can sign the bill. If that bill were to fail, enforcement would surely resume at some point. Norms wouldn't have very much to do with it.","2014-08-12 00:00:00","0","24.0","8.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","56.0","26.0","0.0","125.0","0.0","14.0","3","716","84.98","29.77","38.67","10.06","24.69","25.98","81.28","47.91","9.08","2.79","1.54","0.42","0.14","0.28","0.42","6.28","7.68","15.22","7.96","3.35","5.87","2.65","12.57","6.15","3.63","2.23","1.82","2.79","4.61","1.68","2.93","0.28","0.98","0.42","4.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.42","15.64","2.93","1.96","2.23","4.05","0.84","6.28","0.98","0.28","0.42","0.14","0.28","0.14","0.14","0.00","0.00","10.34","0.56","1.26","6.42","1.26","1.40","1.26","9.78","1.54","11.03","1.82","5.87","3.35","6.56","0.28","0.14","1.82","0.14","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.22","3.77","5.17","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.28","0.28","0.84","3.35","1.12","0.14","3588","8.54","26.535714285714285","1129","713","30","47.32","14.0","12.6","13.18","14.9","168","12.625","20.944964936886397","383","24.18","13","0.46","0","27","11","73","0","100","58","5","2","19","139","30","1","36","1","0","25","6","45","2","0","0","25","0","42","11","11","10","26","19","6","9","0","2"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/117817/leon-wieseltier-remarks-ukraine-thinking-together-conference","""The Russian War on Ukraine Is One of the Proving Grounds of Principle in Our Time""","Below are Leon Wieseltier’s opening remarks at the Ukraine: Thinking Together conference in Kiev, given on May 17. We will be publishing other contributions from the conference in the coming days.

This gathering in Kiev is the result of a casual remark. Last March, as I watched the progress of Putin’s imperialism beyond his borders and fascism within his borders, I ruefully remarked to Frank Foer that the moment reminded me of what I used to call my Congress for Cultural Freedom-envy—my somewhat facile but nonetheless sincere regret at having been born too late to participate in the struggle of Western intellectuals, some of whom became my teachers and my heroes, against the Stalinist assault on democracy in Europe. And all of a sudden, pondering the Russian aggression in Crimea, and the Russian campaign of destabilization in Ukraine, I realized that I had exaggerated my belatedness. I was not born too late at all. Our time is not lacking for fundamental historical challenges and the obligation to choose sides. Passivity—even sympathetic passivity—in the face of a war on freedom is as inadequate now as it was then. So I exclaimed to my friend, “But this is 1950!” As our predecessors went to Berlin, so we would go to Kiev. We contacted our comrade Timothy Snyder, whose eloquence about Ukraine has been fully the equal of his scholarship, and I proposed this event. Tim kindled instantly to the idea, and, with his extraordinary colleagues in Vienna and Kiev, we made a plan. And here we are.

All historical analogies are imperfect, but they are not for that reason false. The analogy between 2014 and 1950 is in some ways imprecise and hyperbolic: Putin is not Stalin, for example. But Putin is bad enough. Putin is very bad. It is not only evil in its worst form that we must resist. The discontinuities of recent histories must not blind us to the continuities. It is also the case—here is another discontinuity—that the United States and its European allies are not inclined now toward a geopolitical struggle that would in any way resemble the Cold War, which many Westerners regard as a dark and cautionary tale. I am not one of those Westerners: Unlike many American liberals, among whom I otherwise count myself, I regard the Cold War as a mottled tale of glory, because it ended in the defeat and the disappearance of the Soviet Union, which was indeed (for American liberals this is a heretical prooftext) what Ronald Reagan said it was—an evil empire. Some of us have been agitating back home for a more powerful Western response to Putin’s depredations in Ukraine; others among us have been more patient with the pace and the modulation of the American and European policy. But the discussion of policy must be preceded by a discussion of principle. The Russian war on Ukraine is one of the proving grounds of principle in our time. The Maidan is one of the primary sites of the modern struggle for democracy. History sometimes provides hours and circumstances that expose, and test, one’s beliefs, and the beliefs of the politics and the culture of one’s society. The crisis in Ukraine is such an hour and such a circumstance. Here in Kiev you are not only clarifying yourselves; you are also clarifying us.

The Ukrainian desire to affiliate with the West, its unintimidated preference for Europe over Russia, is not merely a strategic and economic choice; it is also a moral choice, a philosophical choice, a societal decision about ideals, a defiance of power in the name of justice, a stirring aspiration to build a society and a state that is representative of some values and not others. We have come to Kiev because we accept what you accept and we reject what you reject—because we share the principles that you have elected to represent. We have come to say that we admire your revolution for those principles—not because they are ours but because they are right; because they are justified by reason and by decency; because they are, conceptually if not yet historically, universal. In America and in Europe, it no longer requires courage to champion these principles—the spectacle of our complacencies is plain for all to see; and so we are genuinely humbled by your courage, by your ethical obduracy, by your spiritual preparedness for the dangers and the obstacles and the cruelties that await you along your road to democracy.","2014-05-19 00:00:00","0","19.0","4.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","41.0","26.0","0.0","103.0","0.0","15.0","3","754","75.13","72.46","32.66","14.73","23.56","24.40","81.96","56.23","13.79","8.36","2.52","3.05","1.59","0.53","0.66","5.44","8.75","14.85","7.56","3.71","7.69","1.86","10.61","3.05","1.59","1.19","0.93","2.12","5.44","2.25","3.05","0.53","1.19","0.53","9.15","0.00","0.53","0.00","0.53","11.27","2.92","1.86","1.59","1.46","1.33","3.45","1.46","0.53","0.66","0.27","0.27","0.13","0.13","0.00","0.00","9.95","4.38","1.33","3.71","0.13","0.93","2.79","6.50","0.80","11.54","0.80","6.90","3.85","1.99","0.13","0.13","0.27","0.53","0.53","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","11.54","4.11","4.77","0.40","0.80","0.00","0.13","0.13","0.27","0.66","0.27","0.00","3532","8.65","24.483870967741936","1141","744","32","56.29","14.1","11.2","11.32","13.2","182","12.375","21.104946236559144","362","20.35","11","0.54","0","36","9","84","1","109","53","0","1","6","95","59","1","40","1","0","48","23","44","3","0","0","18","0","16","21","10","15","30","23","6","6","1","0"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/117845/gop-primary-victories-aside-republicans-still-have-gop-base-problem","The American Right, Not the 'Tea Party,' Is the GOP's Big Liability","The answer is yes. And Republicans have addressed that problem not by running shock and awe campaigns against individual ""Tea Party"" candidates, but by aligning behind candidates and incumbents conservative enough for the primary electorate yet polished enough (they hope) to avoid Akin-like admissions against interest. There are no Christine O'Donnells this year, but there are no Mike Castles either.

So the questions now are whether the current crop of GOP candidates can actually suppress the right wing Id, and, secondarily, whether the winning candidates of the American right can durably embed themselves into the political system. Just as we know that 2016 (a presidential year) will be a tough one for Senate Republicans, we can also project that conservatives who win swing states this year will face a much different electorate when they're up again in six years. And come then, their conservatism will be a liability, not an asset.

There are a bunch of ways to overcomplicate this, and make it seem as if the GOP has vanquished the right, or as if the right isn't a drag on the Republican Party. On Tuesday, Slate's Dave Weigel demonstrated that if you use the ""Tea Party"" as your key analytical unit, and moosh together the very different 2010 and 2012 elections, you can obscure the Republican Party's problem with its base, and even make it appear as if the establishment, not the right, is the GOP's real problem.

I'd say you can only blame ""the Tea Party"" for a net loss of two Senate seats since 2010. That's a period during which it helped send Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, Pat Toomey, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul to the upper House—during which ""establishment"" candidates like Denny Rehberg, Heather Wilson, Rick Berg, Josh Mandel, George Allen, Tommy Thompson, Carly Fiorina, and Dino Rossi totally failed to win seats.

It's true that ""Tea Party"" candidates, defined narrowly, have only lost two or three seats over the last four years, and won a bunch of seats in 2010, while establishment candidates lost everywhere in 2012. Conservatives like to stack the evidence this way to diminish the GOP's broader electability problems. Similarly, if you subtract my air shots and other miscues from my golf score, I'm Tiger Woods.

But this is a poor heuristic. It vastly inflates the right's national and swing-state viability by pitting their 2010 victories—which establishment candidates would have won as well—against the establishment's 2012 defeats, in which no conservative alternatives would have fared better.","2014-05-21 00:00:00","0","16.0","5.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","48.0","26.0","0.0","121.0","0.0","14.0","3","422","71.47","44.35","23.11","33.96","28.13","22.04","71.56","46.92","9.24","3.79","1.18","0.47","1.18","0.00","0.95","5.45","8.53","10.43","7.35","4.50","8.77","1.66","10.43","4.27","3.55","1.90","3.32","0.95","7.35","3.79","3.32","0.24","0.24","0.95","5.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.61","1.42","0.95","3.08","2.84","0.95","5.92","0.47","0.24","0.24","0.00","1.18","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.95","9.24","2.13","2.84","4.03","1.90","2.13","1.18","9.00","1.18","11.14","1.18","5.69","4.27","1.18","1.90","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.71","0.00","0.24","0.24","0.24","0.00","18.72","3.55","8.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.47","2.37","3.08","0.95","0.00","2039","8.43","28.933333333333334","621","416","15","51.82","13.9","12.9","12.71","16.6","90","10.5","21.73384615384616","251","24.87","7","0.45","0","20","13","45","0","50","28","1","0","10","45","61","2","29","0","0","16","6","27","1","0","1","6","0","22","8","6","6","16","6","4","1","0","1"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119026/guns-fueling-immigration-central-america-come-us","Guns Fueling Immigration from Central America Come from U.S.","This May, a public bus was traveling its usual midday route between the San Salvador airport and the city when a few men hopped on board, wearing the uniforms of road maintenance workers. Then they pulled out assault weapons and started firing on the passengers. Their targets were apparently two prison guards and a police investigator who were on the bus at the time, but three others were also mowed down in the attack. To Harry Penate, an adviser for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) who is based in the region, the incident was horrifying, but not remotely remarkable. “There’s examples like that every day on the news,” he explained, mentioning a week in early July when warring gangs were responsible for not one but two grenade attacks on the outskirts of Guatemala City.

Penate, a Cuban-American from New York City’s Hell’s Kitchen, is the ATF’s only agent for all of Central America. From his desk at the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador, he is the one responsible for tracing U.S. guns smuggled into the Northern Triangle: El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. That role has given him a front-row seat to a bloodbath. Looking beyond the region’s homicide rates, which are some of the world’s highest, what stands out is the number of gun homicides. And since Penate took on the job two years ago, he has come to an inescapable conclusion: U.S. weapons are partly to blame for the carnage—and in turn for the kids who are fleeing it. “I feel as bad about guns going into Central America and Mexico as good, hard-working Colombians feel about cocaine going into the U.S.,” he says.

By the ATF’s count, more than a third of the traceable guns seized from criminals last year in the Northern Triangle that originated from the United States were purchased from a retail dealer. The weapons are then smuggled south in cars and trucks, or in checked airline luggage, air freight, or even boats. That may sound like a lot of effort, but buying from U.S. gun stores is a lot more convenient for gang members. Thanks to our lax gun laws, there is little official paper trail, and the weapons (Northern Triangle gangs favor semi-automatic pistols) are cheaper than buying locally. “It’s a lot easier for me to go to a gun store in the U.S., buy a Glock, and ship it in parts in a microwave oven and have it show up at a relative’s house,” Penate says. He’d recently helped trace a gun recovered in El Salvador that had been purchased only six days earlier from a licensed dealer near Baltimore. When the “time-to-crime” is that short, he explained, the gun was probably “specifically purchased to be trafficked.” And just this month, an Indianapolis man was sentenced to 39 months in federal prison after he admitted to buying 28 handguns for shipment to Honduras, some of them tucked inside a plastic three-drawer CD organizer.

The flow of guns is critical to the gangs’ chokehold over the Northern Triangle. The most powerful gangs, MS-13 and 18th Street, are building ties with the cartels that traffic drugs to the United States through Central America. But their basic operations are fueled by rampant gun-related crime at the local level. “The firearm is to a gang member what a hammer is to a carpenter,” Penate says. “You have a lot of people unemployed who join gangs for protection, and you have everyone getting extorted, from the pupusa vendor on the corner to mom-and-pop businesses to bus drivers.”","2014-08-13 00:00:00","1","15.0","2.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","108.0","0.0","15.0","2","607","97.04","71.79","28.70","8.21","25.29","21.58","76.94","46.46","6.75","2.97","0.33","0.16","0.33","1.48","0.66","3.79","11.20","15.98","6.43","2.64","5.11","0.33","10.87","3.29","2.47","1.65","1.98","2.14","2.80","0.66","2.14","0.00","1.65","0.00","7.91","0.16","1.15","0.33","1.81","6.26","1.15","0.49","0.00","2.31","0.66","1.98","2.31","0.99","0.82","0.49","0.99","0.16","0.66","0.00","0.33","6.59","1.81","0.82","2.97","0.66","0.66","3.29","5.93","0.99","15.65","1.48","9.88","4.28","3.29","0.49","0.66","2.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.60","6.26","6.43","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.81","2.31","1.81","0.66","0.00","2728","7.99","27.130434782608695","847","595","31","68.91","10.9","8.4","10.56","10.8","128","9.0","18.285042016806724","339","24.04","20","0.47","0","23","11","75","0","76","34","4","1","1","93","72","3","45","0","0","18","4","20","1","1","4","18","0","12","21","17","18","16","20","5","6","0","3"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/118602/deporting-all-undocumented-immigrants-would-cost-billions-immigration","How Much Would It Cost to Deport All Undocumented Immigrants?","Republicans are very clear about what they want President Barack Obama to do with the undocumented children pouring into the United States across the Mexican border: Deport them. That isn’t a newfound GOP position. It’s also their de facto policy toward all undocumented immigrants in the country. Such a policy would carry real costs. In fact, the White House requested $3.7 billion Tuesday to hire more border control agents, build new detention facilities, and transfer immigration judges to the South. But a mass deportation program would cost magnitudes more. Are Republicans willing to fund it?

In 2010, researchers at the Center for American Progress (CAP) calculated the total costs of such a program by breaking down the deportation process into four parts: Apprehension, detention, legal proceedings and transportation. Using data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), CAP estimated the cost of each part of that process per undocumented immigrant. For instance, for the 2008 fiscal year, each apprehension cost $18,310. For 30 days of detention, the cost was $3,335. The researchers also assumed that 20 percent of undocumented immigrants would voluntarily leave under a mass deportations program. That would leave DHS to find and deport the remaining 80 percent.

After running the numbers, CAP estimated the cost for deporting 10.8 million undocumented immigrants in America would be $200 billion over five years. DHS would also need $17 billion each year thereafter for continued enforcement. But there are more undocumented immigrants currently in the United States than when CAP produced its report. The DHS’s most recent report, from January 2012, estimates there are 11.5 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Adjusting for that increases the costs to $216 billion.

Yet even that understates the cost, because those numbers are not adjusted for inflation. Doing so brings the five-year cost of a mass deportations program to $239 billion, before factoring in the money for sustained enforcement to ensure a new wave of undocumented immigrants does not enter the United States. To put that in perspective, the federal government spent $265 billion on Medicaid in 2013. The Department of Homeland Security’s annual budget is only around $60 billion. A mass deportations program would require a massive increase in funding.","2014-07-08 00:00:00","0","13.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","52.0","26.0","0.0","116.0","0.0","14.0","2","372","97.48","43.59","26.35","25.77","16.17","29.30","72.31","39.52","4.03","0.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.81","3.23","9.68","14.78","5.38","4.30","2.96","0.81","8.87","3.76","2.15","0.54","8.60","3.49","1.34","0.54","0.54","0.54","0.00","0.00","1.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.87","0.81","1.08","2.42","1.61","1.08","2.15","0.54","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.54","0.00","0.54","0.00","0.00","4.84","0.00","0.27","3.23","0.27","1.08","0.54","5.38","0.27","16.67","3.23","8.33","5.11","5.65","0.27","0.27","4.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.40","5.91","4.84","0.54","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.00","1.08","1.08","2.42","1938","8.15","16.47826086956522","613","369","26","48.6","12.3","10.0","13.68","11.3","89","4.944444444444445","17.32769647696477","218","15.78","10","0.38","0","5","35","43","2","49","25","3","0","7","56","39","6","26","1","0","4","2","14","0","1","1","9","0","16","9","7","1","7","6","1","1","0","1"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/118995/if-sanctions-against-russia-succeed-what-follows-putin","Vladimir Putin Might Fall. We Should Consider What Happens Next.","It was out of this mess that Russia created Putin, a man promising to reverse Russia’s humiliation and rein in the oligarchs stripping the country bare. He delivered on those promises, but he simply created new oligarchs, like Timchenko, from his childhood friends or KGB comrades. He also eviscerated, with Surkov’s brilliant engineering, the fledgling forms of democracy and free speech that had developed in the nine years that preceded him. Which is why certain bourgeois urban liberals now miss the freewheeling 1990s, even though many of them voted for Putin in 2000.

Given this history, the Western narrative of an evil, shirtless tyrant suppressing a society hungering for freedom and democracy is a wild fantasy. Putin is not popular only because he controls the television. He is also popular because he is giving Russia something that is quintessentially Russian. Putin is just a variation on the Soviet Union, which was just a variation on the monarchy.

What made the Soviets so ruthless and Manichaean was the czar. Nicholas was fiercely averse to any kind of political sphere between him and the peasant masses. He created a parliament only to immediately disband it and relied heavily on censorship and the secret police. And so, when he handed in his crown, there was nothing there to replace him. The only people strong enough to fill the vacuum were the Bolsheviks, hardened and disciplined by years of underground resistance. After all, it was the czars who instituted forced exile; Joseph Stalin, who escaped from Nicholas’s exile five times as a young revolutionary, simply improved upon their brutality in his gulags.

Similarly, when the Soviet Union fell, it wasn’t the pro-Western dissidents who replaced Gorbachev, but a high-ranking Party boss named Yeltsin. No one else had the organizational or political know-how; nobody else had been allowed to learn.

And so it is now. The liberal opposition that rose up from the Internet ghetto in December 2011 was only 100,000 strong in a city of twelve million. Six months later, Putin cracked down. Now, the only plausible leader of the opposition, Alexei Navalny, is under house arrest, barred from using the Internet and thus from talking to the people who want political change. Which will make things all the worse when Putin inevitably leaves the Kremlin. Knowing the weakness of the liberal opposition and the strength of Putin’s security apparatus, it’s hard not to fear that his replacement will make us long for the days of his thuggishly predictable unpredictability.

Last December, I met up with Gleb Pavlovsky, the man who helped Putin cruise to victory in 2000. “It’s impossible to say when this system will fall, but when it falls, it will fall in one day,” he told me. “And the one to replace it will be a copy of this one.”

Back in February 2012, a month before Putin was elected president of the Russian Federation for the third time, his supporters released a YouTube video that indulged the desire of the tens of thousands of Muscovites protesting in the streets that winter. “The opposition is chanting, ‘Russia without Putin!’ ” the narrator says. “So let’s imagine that there is no more Vladimir Putin.” The immediate result, says the narrator, is elections, hundreds of parties, and the West praising the dawn of real democracy in Russia. But then the hypothesis gallops on through 2013: the rise of militant Russian nationalists, their clashes with Russia’s large Muslim population, nato troops in Kaliningrad, the Chinese in Khabarovsk, the Georgians in Krasnodar, and skinhead rule in St. Petersburg. A hungry winter, chaos and inter-ethnic violence, the departure of major international companies, and hyperinflation. The leaders of the opposition beg for asylum in the United States. By February 2014, there is no electricity, mobile service, or Internet in Moscow. Russians are advised to stay in their homes. “Russia without Putin?” the narrator concludes. “You decide.”

It’s extreme and, to a non-Putinist, even laughable; the sun will not stop shining if Vladimir Putin is no longer president. But this is a key part of the Putin worldview when it comes to both foreign and domestic affairs: There’s not much separating you, or anyone, from the void. And, ironically, it’s this fear of the future that keeps Putin in power. It’s a fear that’s not all that ridiculous when you consider that all of the footage illustrating the horrors of a Putinless future is the real footage of Russia’s recent past.","2014-08-07 00:00:00","0","24.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","45.0","26.0","0.0","106.0","0.0","15.0","3","746","84.03","62.62","17.02","53.49","17.35","26.27","78.02","49.33","10.19","3.89","0.27","0.27","0.40","2.41","0.54","6.30","10.59","12.60","6.03","5.09","6.57","1.88","10.32","3.75","1.34","2.41","2.68","1.34","4.96","3.22","1.74","0.67","0.54","0.13","7.64","0.00","0.27","0.00","2.68","8.45","1.07","2.28","0.54","1.34","1.07","2.95","1.07","0.27","0.67","0.13","0.40","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.27","8.18","1.34","1.07","5.36","0.27","0.80","3.49","5.90","1.47","13.94","2.28","6.30","5.76","2.14","0.94","0.54","0.13","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.36","5.50","7.37","0.27","0.40","0.13","0.13","0.67","1.74","2.14","0.00","0.00","3623","8.4","20.62162162162162","1123","743","41","61.56","12.1","9.2","11.89","11.6","182","8.7","19.038115746971737","399","18.57","3","0.48","0","29","15","91","1","89","60","1","0","6","113","75","4","33","2","0","33","9","40","2","0","2","14","0","18","36","14","10","7","31","9","6","0","9"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/118971/video-steve-king-insults-immigrant-iowa-rand-paul-runs-away","Watch Rand Paul Run for His Life Before Steve King Insults an Immigrant in Iowa","It’s a cruel coincidence for GOP presidential aspirants that the Republican Party’s most uncensored, most influential anti-immigrant member (Representative Steve King) hails from a state (Iowa) where, for arbitrary reasons, presidential primary candidates face their first real electoral test. It means that top-tier Republicans like Senator Rand Paul have to break bread in public, more than a year ahead of the election, with someone they must be prepared to flee mid-meal, while still chewing. That's what happened Monday at a Paul fundraiser in Okoboji, Iowa.

If the Iowa caucuses were held on Super Tuesday, this probably wouldn’t have happened. But the caucuses are contest number one. So in addition to having to pretend to like butter sculptures, Paul and everyone else have to vie for King’s favor, which exposes them to the kinds of altercations they'd rather avoid ahead of the general election. Sticking up for the DREAMer in the video would plausibly doom Paul’s primary campaign. Standing with King would pose an equal but opposite threat in the general, as would playing dumb. So, he did what he had to do.

And it was a wise move. If he’d sat there stoically, it would’ve been tantamount to admitting he found King’s disposition toward these two deferred-action beneficiaries—who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents as minors—unremarkable. And to many Republicans, feigning surprise at an immigrant’s command of English and calling her a lawbreaker is unremarkable. As is the suggestion that children should refuse to travel with their parents absent proper authorization, or that they should self-deport once they grow up. It’s certainly unremarkable to the gentleman shouting “Go home!” at her (at the 6:30 mark). But most people don’t find these kinds of things particularly commendable.

Update: It's worth noting that part of the political logic driving Republicans' short-lived enthusiasm for immigration reform after the 2012 election was that it would take the issue off the table, and thus obviate combustible encounters like these. Paul voted against the Senate's immigration bill, and did nothing to encourage House Republicans to work with Democrats on a bill of their own.","2014-08-05 00:00:00","0","10.0","4.0","6.0","2.0","14.0","0.0","47.0","26.0","0.0","115.0","0.0","14.0","1","360","86.16","70.13","6.58","57.28","20.00","26.11","77.78","48.33","11.11","4.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.67","2.50","6.94","7.50","15.83","9.17","2.50","5.00","0.83","14.44","5.56","3.61","1.39","1.94","1.94","4.44","3.06","1.39","0.56","0.83","0.28","10.00","0.56","0.00","0.56","2.50","11.39","2.22","0.56","3.33","2.50","1.39","3.61","0.83","0.28","0.28","0.00","1.67","0.28","0.28","0.00","1.11","9.72","1.39","1.67","5.56","0.56","1.11","4.72","6.11","0.83","11.11","2.22","5.28","3.33","1.94","1.67","0.56","0.83","0.28","0.00","0.28","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.61","4.72","4.72","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.28","1.67","0.56","4.44","1.67","0.00","1804","8.6","22.11764705882353","552","352","18","51.58","13.2","10.9","13.69","13.5","89","13.5","19.953636363636367","232","20.47","1","0.47","0","11","5","32","0","52","37","1","2","8","51","31","6","19","0","0","16","6","12","0","1","1","15","0","18","15","11","5","8","7","1","3","0","1"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/117756/louis-cks-lecturing-women-and-louies-fat-girl-speech","'Louie's Tiresome Portrayal of Women","Last night’s “Louie” featured Sarah Baker in what should be a star-making turn. As Vanessa, a smart, sunny waitress who spends the episode wooing Louie, Baker is wry and endearing—until the episode’s last few minutes, when she suddenly turns exasperated and heart-rending, in a seven-minute monologue that functions as a cri de coeur on behalf of fat women everywhere. “You can talk into the microphone and say you can't get a date, you're overweight. It's adorable,” she tells Louie. “But if I say it, they call the suicide hotline on me. … What do you think is going to happen? You think your dick is going to fall off if you hold hands with a fat girl?” The speech has already landed her on the front page of The New York Times’ arts section, and all the praise headed Baker’s way is entirely deserved—it’s an astonishing, seemingly out-of-nowhere performance. (She was previously known only for a supporting role in a failed NBC sitcom.) But the heavy-handed monologue also feeds into all of Louis C.K.’s worst creative impulses, letting him remain a pliable sad-sack who needs women to enlighten him.

“Anyway, I do love women. Very much,” were Louie’s first words in this episode, titled “So Does the Fat Lady.” And, sure, Louie does love women, but mostly they terrify him, and not without reason. In the last few seasons, he keeps meeting women who are wildly aggressive, unpredictable, unstable: Melissa Leo’s gruff Laurie, who violently sexually assaults him; Delores, a deranged parent from Louie’s kids’ school who offers no-strings-attached sex and then insists he buy her blueberries and cries while he uncomfortably spanks her. (Later, she takes him along on a deeply unpleasant trip to Ikea.) In the season one finale, he meets Eunice, who drags him to New Jersey (!) to have a threesome with F. Murray Abraham. And then, of course, there was Parker Posey’s Liz, the irresistible manic pixie who was actually, frighteningly manic and gave last season its tragic heart. Some of these episodes are among the series' best: raw and complicated, like an open wound. After a while, though, there are diminishing returns.

When women aren’t unstable kooks dragging Louie along on some adventure, they have a different role: teaching him life’s lessons. Tarese, the black supermarket checkout girl who berates him after he creepily follows her home in the first season, tells him, “Well guess what, you don’t get everything you want. Not all the time.” In the second season, he sleeps with Joan Rivers after she reminds him he needs to get over himself and pay his comedy dues. Gaby Hoffman’s April, who has to break up with herself on his behalf, confronts him about his cowardice:

Do you realize you might be wasting four years of both of our lives because you can't just say 'Bye, see ya' right now, because in this second, that feels weird? … You could save yourself another divorce, and years of false living, if you could just be a man in this one moment and say to me, 'April, thank you for helping me,' y'know? 'Have a good one—see you sometime.'

And sometimes a woman gets to fill both roles. Chloe Sevigny, playing a quirky bookseller who took him around New York on a detective hunt for Parker Posey’s character, pleasures herself in a cafe and then gives him the best piece of advice he’s ever received: “You can’t just go through life and hope that love is just going to flow into you like plankton into a fucking whale’s mouth.”","2014-05-13 00:00:00","0","17.0","9.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","48.0","28.0","0.0","113.0","0.0","27.0","2","606","66.54","94.69","11.19","50.40","20.20","17.00","82.18","48.35","15.02","10.73","0.83","0.17","3.30","5.94","0.50","4.29","6.93","11.39","5.94","3.96","6.27","1.65","13.70","4.95","1.82","2.48","1.49","2.48","6.27","3.80","2.48","0.50","0.83","0.66","18.15","0.33","0.17","3.47","4.29","8.75","1.65","0.83","1.65","1.98","1.49","2.64","1.98","0.66","0.83","0.50","4.13","1.49","1.32","0.66","1.49","4.46","0.99","1.16","1.32","1.65","0.33","1.49","11.55","1.49","16.17","1.98","6.44","7.76","1.49","0.83","0.66","0.66","0.00","0.17","1.16","0.33","0.33","0.17","0.17","0.33","24.92","4.79","8.42","0.83","0.17","0.66","0.17","1.49","2.31","5.12","0.99","0.00","2700","7.81","24.115384615384617","816","594","30","68.3","10.0","8.7","10.68","11.2","120","7.416666666666666","18.00080808080808","362","22.31","6","0.48","0","20","5","53","1","64","49","0","2","8","86","49","1","26","2","0","61","8","36","0","1","3","11","0","30","13","14","9","19","37","2","13","0","2"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/118973/impossible-exile-review-stefan-zweigs-overdue-revival","One of Liberalism's Greatest Defenders Doesn't Deserve His Obscurity","One of the most important facts about Zweig is that he was perhaps even more passionate a collector than he was a writer; and what he collected were the literary and musical manuscripts of Mozart and Beethoven and Goethe, the highest peaks of human genius. Zweig did not claim to dwell at that height himself, but he was gifted enough—and sufficiently imbued with the German-Jewish passion for Bildung, or personal cultivation—to worship at the shrine of art. In The World of Yesterday, he writes rather more enthusiastically about his acquisitions—a manuscript page of Faust, the handwritten score of Schubert’s “An die Musik”—than he does about his own books: “I was aware that in this collection I had created something that in itself was worthier to last than my own works.” He declared quite straightforwardly that nothing he produced before the end of World War I, when he was thirty-seven, is worth preserving.

Yet even this love of culture can become a charge in the indictment against Zweig. For one thing, it can make him look like what Proust contemptuously called a “célibataire d’art,” one whose relations with art become passionate to the point of abjection, precisely because they are not truly creative. Certainly there is something alarming about the passage in The World of Yesterday where Zweig proposes, in all earnestness, that the great books are too long and need cutting:

I could not help wondering what exactly it was that made my books so unexpectedly popular . .. I think it arose from a personal flaw in me—I am an impatient, temperamental reader. Anything long-winded, high-flown or gushing irritates me, so does everything that is vague and indistinct, in fact anything that unnecessarily holds the reader up . . . why not bring out a series of the great works of international literature, from Homer through Balzac and Dostoevsky to Mann’s The Magic Mountain, with the unnecessary parts cut?

Balzac and Dostoevsky to one side, it is certainly true that the strength of Zweig’s fiction is its compression and intensity. He specialized in short novellas, the best of which have titles that get straight to the emotional point: Burning Secret, Confusion. (It is no accident that many of these stories were made into successful movies, most famously Ophüls’s Letter from an Unknown Woman.) Zweig, who was a friend of Freud and wrote a biographical essay about him, is fascinated by primal scenes, moments when naive young people are initiated into the powerful and perverse forms that sexuality can take. In Burning Secret, a young boy accompanies his mother to a resort, where she enters into a flirtation with a predatory nobleman. Like a detective, the boy is determined to figure out exactly what is going on with these strange grown-ups—what is the force that draws them together, and why do they seem not to want him around? The story’s climax comes when the boy eavesdrops on his mother and the baron in the hallway at night, and misinterprets their erotic struggle as an attempted murder—a primal scene gone terribly awry.

Similarly, in Confusion, a handsome young college student falls under the intellectual spell of his professor, and decides that he will help the old man complete his long-unfinished magnum opus on the Elizabethan drama. But the student cannot understand why the professor blows hot and cold, alternately encouraging him and holding him at an ironic distance. Not until the student ends up in bed with the professor’s young wife does his confusion begin to clear up: the professor, he realizes, is gay, and he is fighting his own attraction for the young man. The book concludes with the teacher’s passionate confession to his protégé, in which Zweig combines an acute analysis of the erotics of teaching with a remarkably forward-thinking plea for sexual toleration.

Even Zweig’s only full-length novel, Beware of Pity—written in the late 1930s, when he had fled Austria for England—is a novella at heart, focusing, again, on the romantic education of a naive young man. In this case, Lieutenant Hofmiller is a cavalry officer in a small Hungarian town on the eve of World War I. At home in the barracks but ill at ease in society, Hofmiller finds himself horrified to have committed a fairly innocent social blunder: at a party at the local nobleman’s mansion, he invites the daughter of the house to dance, not realizing that her legs are paralyzed. Overcome with shame and pity, he enters into a strange and ultimately destructive relationship with the girl, Edith, allowing her to believe that he wants to marry her when in fact the idea terrifies him. Here it is emotional immaturity, rather than sexual immaturity, that must be outgrown during the painful transition to adult understanding.

Not for nothing, clearly, was zweig a product of the Vienna of Freud, Schnitzler, and Schiele. And if The World of Yesterday turns out, as it now seems, to be Zweig’s most lasting and important book, it is in large part because of his rich evocation of Vienna’s turn-of-the-century culture. The city that Zweig describes, the one in which he grew up and eventually triumphed, was the Vienna of the educated Jewish haute bourgeoisie. It was only the money and the curiosity of this class, Zweig argues, that made the city’s golden age possible: “the part played by the Jewish bourgeoisie in Viennese culture, through the aid and patronage it offered, was immeasurable. They were the real public, they filled seats at the theater and in concert halls, they bought books and pictures, visited exhibitions, championed and encouraged new trends everywhere with minds that were more flexible, less weighed down by tradition.” His own movement from the mercantile middle class to the cultural elite, Zweig writes, was the ideal trajectory of all German Jewish families, instancing Aby Warburg and Ernst Cassirer—and he could have added Ludwig Wittgenstein or, indeed, Walter Benjamin.

This Jewish cultural assimilation was made possible, Zweig explains, by Vienna’s love of the arts and its tradition of toleration: “Poor and rich, Czechs and Germans, Christians and Jews peacefully lived together in spite of the occasional needling remark.” At such moments, however, the rose color of Zweig’s nostalgia is impossible to ignore. For the Vienna he idealizes was the same city where anti-Semitism flourished, where Karl Lueger became mayor on an explicitly anti-Semitic platform, and where the young Hitler laid the groundwork for his plan to exterminate the Jews. If you take Zweig at face value, it is inexplicable how Vienna became, in the interwar period, the site of a virtual civil war between Social Democrats and fascists—the city that wildly applauded the Anschluss in 1938 and happily sent its culture-loving Jews to concentration camps. As Prochnik recounts, Zweig wrote The World of Yesterday in a feverish few weeks in the summer of 1941 in, of all places, Ossining, New York, where his peregrinations had briefly taken him. If Vienna was really, as Zweig writes, the home of “live and let live”—“a principle that still seems to me more humane than any categorical imperative”—why did he end up writing about it in Ossining?

Hannah Arendt zeroed in on these questions when she stingingly reviewed The World of Yesterday in 1943. Zweig, Arendt believed, was the victim of the same illusion that had plagued German Jewry since the Enlightenment, and eventually led to its destruction: the belief that culture could replace politics, that individual artistic achievement would do the work of collective political consciousness. Despite what he thought, Arendt writes, Zweig never really belonged to Austrian society, because no Jew was allowed to belong to it. Instead he belonged to an international society of the famous, and he believed that membership in this cultural elite would protect him. But Zweig’s fate—his memoir was published after his suicide—made clear that he had wagered his life on an illusion. “Without the protective honor of fame, naked and disrobed,” Arendt concluded, “Stefan Zweig was confronted with the reality of the Jewish people.”

One of the strengths of Prochnik’s book, which focuses on the last few years of Zweig’s life, is that it pays due attention to his feelings about Jewishness—a subject that Matuschek’s fuller biography tends to scant. The Impossible Exile is a highly personal work, not a chronological biography so much as a meditation, through the lens of Zweig, on the whole experience of the German Jewish emigration. “Bruno Walter attributed the secret of a happy exile to remembering the distinction between ‘here’ and ‘there,’ ” Prochnik writes, but Zweig “offers a formula for toxic migration—what might be called Lot’s wife syndrome . . . he could not stop looking over his shoulder.”

The distinction is important to Prochnik because his own ancestors were among those impossible exiles. His father was a boy when he fled Vienna with his parents in 1938, eventually landing in the United States. The Prochnik family’s emigration was a success story, or at least that is the way he grew up hearing about it: “And though times were hard at first, living in a grim New York building, eventually they made their way to Boston, where your grandfather was able to resume his medical practice and get both his sons into Boston Latin School and Harvard. The End.” Only as an adult did Prochnik come to realize how much was left out of this comforting version, “how much was irrecoverably lost over the course of the family’s harrowing flight.” By writing about Zweig, he is clearly trying to grasp the reality of the world his own family left behind, their world of yesterday.

Vienna at the turn of the century was the birthplace of many intellectual movements, none of which turned out to be more consequential than Zionism. Zweig, as he writes in The World of Yesterday, started his career as a protégé of none other than Theodor Herzl. But the Herzl who mattered to Zweig was the literary editor of the Neue Freie Presse, not the founder of Jewish nationalism. When Herzl published Zweig’s first essay on the front page of Vienna’s leading daily when he was still a teenager, he felt that he had reached the summits of literature. In his memoir, however, Zweig is oddly evasive about the reasons why Herzl’s

Zionism made little impression on him. He observes only that he was turned off by the way Herzl, whom he saw as a king-like personality, was disrespected by his own followers: “the quarrelsome, opinionated spirit of constant opposition, the lack of honest, heartfelt acceptance in the Zionist circle, estranged me from a movement that I would willingly have approached with curiosity, if only for Herzl’s sake.”

The truth is that Zionism of any kind was never in the cards for Zweig, because of his deep conviction that being Jewish meant being in the vanguard of cosmopolitanism. “I see it as the mission of the Jews in the political sphere to uproot nationalism in every country, in order to bring about an attachment that is purely spiritual and intellectual,” he wrote in 1919. “This is also why I reject Jewish nationalism. . . . Our spirit is cosmopolitan—that’s how we have become what we are, and if we have to suffer for it, then so be it: it is our destiny.” Zweig’s hatred of all kinds of nationalism solidified during World War I—the latter years of which he spent in contented exile in Switzerland—and he came to see the arts as the only existing manifestation of the international brotherhood for which he yearned. When Zweig writes in his memoir about his friendships with everyone from Romain Rolland to Rainer Maria Rilke to Emil Verhaeren, he is not boasting so much as demonstrating the living possibility of a fellowship that transcends borders, a modern republic of letters. What Arendt derided as a mere society of the famous was, in Zweig’s view, a society of the idealistic and talented, a humanistic elite that preserved the highest values of liberalism.

The fact that Zweig lived to see this version of liberalism utterly defeated in Europe was, depending on how sympathetically you look at it, either his tragedy or his comeuppance. For how could any liberalism hope to survive divorced from democracy? A liberalism of the elite was doomed to be a social luxury; yet Zweig’s historical experience as an Austrian Jew left him convinced that the masses had no love for toleration, free speech, and pacifism. On the contrary, the energy of the times seemed wholly opposed to these things, as Zweig recognized when he described the outbreak of popular enthusiasm in the first days of World War I: “The great wave broke over humanity so suddenly, with such violence, that as it foamed over the surface it brought up from the depths the dark, unconscious, primeval urges and instincts of the human animal—what Freud perceptively described as a rejection of civilization, a longing to break out of the bourgeois world of laws and their precepts for once and indulge the ancient bloodlust of humanity.”

The profound pessimism of this view of humanity, and its implications for the liberalism that Zweig cherished, were not lost on him. Zweig’s nonfiction is today much less read than his fiction; none of it has yet been republished, though many of these books were translated into English in the 1920s and 1930s, at the height of his fame. The most significant for understanding Zweig’s political dilemma is Erasmus of Rotterdam, which he wrote in 1933, in the months after Hitler came to power, and just before he himself fled Austria. (It was the first of Zweig’s books not to be published by his lifelong publisher, Insel Verlag, which had purged its list of Jewish authors.)

Zweig’s Erasmus does not fulfill many of the duties of a biography. His historical works were always more about conjuring an atmosphere of intellectual drama than about telling a comprehensive story. As an essay on the fate of liberalism in an age of fanaticism, however, Erasmus is a powerful witness to its moment. The contrast between Erasmus, the moderate reformer and peacemaker, and Martin Luther, the belligerent and uncompromising man of faith, is transparently Zweig’s way of contrasting his own cherished ideals with those of triumphant fascism. As he says in his memoir, the book “presented my own views in veiled form through the person of Erasmus.”

Given this close identification, then, it is all the more remarkable that Zweig does not make a hero of Erasmus. Every word of praise for his subject’s irenic, cosmopolitan humanism is balanced by a word of censure for his timidity and his abstemiousness. Fifteenth-century humanists, like twentieth-century liberals, were out of touch with the people and unable to grapple with real-world problems: “though their realm was extensive,” with outposts among the intelligentsia of every nation, “its roots did not go deep, it only influenced the most superficial layers, having but feeble relations with reality.” Erasmus himself is sharply blamed for declining to attend the Diet of Worms, where he might have done something to bridge the gulf between Luther and the Catholic Church. “The absent are always wrong,” Zweig concludes, and the rebuke is directed also at himself. He had made Arendt’s indictment before she did.

The cowardice of Erasmus, if such it was, finally seems to Zweig like an inseparable component of a civilized character. It is for the barbaric Luthers to make war, while the civilized Erasmuses carve out niches of peace. No wonder he concludes that “the humanistic ideal, that ideal grounded upon breadth of vision and clarity of mind, is destined to remain a spiritual and aristocratic dream which few mortals are capable of dreaming.” Sounding surprisingly like Benjamin, Zweig places his trust in defeated ideas as the only possible source of redemption: “An idea which does not take on material shape is not necessarily a conquered idea or a false idea; it may represent a need which, though its gratification be postponed, is and remains a need. Nay, more: an ideal which, because it has failed to secure embodiment in action, is neither worn out nor compromised in any way, continues to work as a ferment in subsequent generations, urging them to the achievement of a higher morality.”

It is only when seen in the light of his political ideas that Zweig’s suicide becomes more than a personal tragedy. When Benjamin took an overdose of morphine in 1940, it was because, having been sent back across the border to conquered France, he believed that he was about to fall into the hands of the Gestapo. In 1942, however, Zweig had been out of the direct path of Nazism for eight years. Wisely or luckily, he had chosen not Paris but London as his refuge, which meant that he was not swept up in the fall of France like Arendt, Benjamin, and so many other Jewish refugees. Still, that disaster terrified him sufficiently to make him book passage to America in June 1940. Here, too, he could have found shelter, like Thomas Mann and Bertolt Brecht and many other writers he knew. But as Prochnik shows, by this point Zweig was so off-kilter, so traumatized by exile and terrified by war, that he made the irrational decision to move to Brazil, where he had earlier been given a hero’s welcome when he visited on a tour.

Finally even Brazil did not feel safe. Zweig was convinced that even if Hitler lost the war—and after Pearl Harbor, this did not seem unlikely—the world would never again be “the world of yesterday.” What Zweig needed for his peace of mind, for his sanity, was the ability to forget the world crisis, to withdraw like Erasmus into a private sphere of intellect and decency. But as he mournfully writes in his memoir, the twentieth century had made this impossible: “The greatest curse brought down on us by technology is that it prevents us from escaping the present even for a brief time. Previous generations could retreat into solitude and seclusion when disaster struck; it was our fate to be aware of everything catastrophic happening everywhere in the world at the hour and the second when it happened.” Zweig came to believe that there was nowhere left to escape to, no place where the values he cherished could survive. His curse was that he died believing this; our good fortune is that he was wrong.","2014-08-09 00:00:00","0","41.0","31.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","45.0","26.0","0.0","118.0","0.0","15.0","3","3099","89.04","68.00","12.40","42.14","29.51","23.46","81.70","51.47","11.07","5.71","0.61","0.29","0.10","4.29","0.42","5.36","9.29","16.23","6.36","4.36","5.71","1.32","11.46","4.90","2.55","2.16","0.87","1.71","5.49","3.13","2.23","0.35","0.58","0.58","8.97","0.45","0.10","0.42","4.52","10.65","2.61","1.68","1.39","1.94","1.52","2.74","1.48","0.61","0.32","0.45","1.19","0.19","0.52","0.39","0.06","7.52","1.55","1.90","3.29","0.81","0.81","5.49","5.55","0.61","13.78","1.61","7.94","4.32","2.55","1.06","0.19","0.35","1.26","0.55","0.03","0.00","0.00","0.03","0.00","0.00","15.17","3.55","7.03","0.52","0.19","0.13","0.00","0.61","1.68","1.32","0.13","0.00","14734","8.53","32.350515463917525","4610","3058","104","50.09","14.7","13.6","12.31","16.8","666","17.0","22.471576193590582","1197","27.8","13","0.5","0","95","18","326","1","466","274","4","6","20","494","245","8","105","1","0","150","73","155","9","5","15","73","0","88","173","47","69","24","106","33","14","1","38"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/117752/karl-rove-comments-hillary-clintons-age","Karl Rove's Attack On Hillary Clinton Is More Than Gross. It's Bad Political Strategy.","Karl Rove's recent comments about Hillary Clinton have received a fair amount of criticism in the press, even from Republicans. As The New York Post reported:

He said if Clinton runs for president, voters must be told what happened when she suffered a fall in December 2012. The official diagnosis was a blood clot. Rove told the conference near LA Thursday, “Thirty days in the hospital? And when she reappears, she’s wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what’s up with that.”

In response, former Bush White House Communications Director Nicole Wallace labeled Rove's remarks ""off the wall."" Wallace might be right in more ways than she realizes. As she went on to say:

“Karl did not raise the issue by accident,” the Republican political commentator said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Tuesday morning. “I worked with Karl for a long time. This was a deliberate strategy on his part to raise her health as an issue and, I think in his view, a legitimate line of questioning ahead of the next campaign. What’s interesting to me and doesn’t seem to be in line with Karl, is that he had some of the facts wrong. She wasn’t in the hospital for 30 days.”

Other people have also scolded Rove for the disgusting comments, but if Wallace is correct—and I assume she is—Rove's strategy is ""off the wall"" too. Remember, this isn't the first sign of a Republican strategy to attack Clinton on age-related issues. The New York Times reported almost a year ago that Clinton's age might play a part in an upcoming campaign. I jokingly wrote at the time that this was clearly a conscious Republican strategy to forfeit the election to Clinton:

Did any Republican quoted for this article happen to catch the 2008 Democratic primary? I have another idea: Why not spend the election focusing on how Clinton dresses, make an effort to refer to her as shrill, question her likeability, and even raise the issue of whether women are too emotional for the presidency. That seems like a better strategy.

Rove has always been overrated as a strategist. (If the Florida recount had gone the other way, Bush's decision to campaign in New Jersey and California in the week before the 2000 election would have gone down as one of the great blunders in campaign history.) But, as with Rand Paul's comments about Monica Lewinsky, Republicans seem completely confused as to how to run against Hillary Clinton. The two times Clinton has been most popular or politically robust were during the Lewinsky mess and parts of the 2008 campaign, when she came to be seen as a victim of media sexism. Perhaps Rove is so Machiavellian that for some reason he wants Clinton to win in 2016, thus ensuring...who knows what? Either that or his comments are simply dumb as well as nasty.","2014-05-13 00:00:00","0","12.0","7.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","48.0","26.0","0.0","100.0","0.0","15.0","1","490","89.07","58.86","30.61","16.95","19.60","22.45","80.82","50.20","9.18","4.90","1.22","0.20","0.00","3.47","0.00","4.29","9.18","16.94","7.96","4.49","6.73","1.02","14.29","6.53","4.08","2.65","2.04","2.04","4.29","1.84","2.45","0.20","0.82","0.20","7.96","0.00","0.00","2.45","1.22","12.04","3.67","1.43","1.43","4.08","1.22","3.47","1.63","0.61","0.82","0.20","1.63","0.82","1.02","0.00","0.00","6.73","0.41","2.45","3.67","0.61","0.20","5.51","7.96","1.02","14.49","1.84","6.12","6.53","2.24","0.20","0.20","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.41","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","16.12","4.90","3.88","0.82","0.00","0.82","0.00","0.20","2.45","2.65","0.41","0.00","2227","7.88","21.869565217391305","703","486","26","69.41","11.6","8.2","10.39","10.4","102","6.071428571428571","17.87506172839506","272","20.13","7","0.49","0","11","8","55","0","71","29","1","0","4","71","60","2","19","0","0","18","6","22","1","1","1","16","0","20","23","6","12","13","18","3","6","0","6"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/118960/democrats-white-working-class-problem-isnt-just-south","Democrats Have a White Working Class Problem—and Not Just in the South","Whenever elections approach, there is always a flurry of concern among Democrats regarding the white working class. Despite a steady and gradual decline in its size over the last several decades, this group remains a substantial percentage of the electorate; even relatively small decreases in its support for Democrats can mean defeat to Republican opponents. On a national level, if white working class support falls even 1 or 2 percent below the 36 percent that Obama received from them in 2012, the party's 2016 nominee will be in serious trouble.

In this year’s election cycle, the discussion about white working Americans began in March with a New York Times op-ed, “How Democrats Can Compete for the White Working Class,” by Tom Edsall. Noting Obama's 4 percent drop in support from the group between 2008 and 2012, he nonetheless insisted that ""Democratic prospects do not seem so gloomy. There was a wide disparity in Obama’s performance among with working class voters in different sections of the country: awful in the South and significantly better in much of the rest of the country. This suggests that a targeted regional strategy could strengthen the Democratic Party’s chances with what was once its core constituency.""

A number of commentators endorsed this interpretation of the 2012 election results, that Democrats could obtain sufficient white working class support to win future elections by essentially writing off the South and putting all their efforts into maximizing their support among white working people in other areas of the country. Mother Jones's Kevin Drum, for example, argued that “Democrats in general and Obama in particular don’t really have a huge 'white working class' problem. What they have is a huge Southern problem.… It’s only in the South that the white working class vote is overwhelmingly Republican, and this is what skews the national results.”

At first glance the data seem to support this view. Although the standard exit polls in 2012 did not include the same detailed regional and educational data as they had in prior years,a special analysis that I conducted on data from a large, 3,400-respondent post-election survey conducted by Democracy Corps shows that Obama’s support among whites with less than a four-year college degree in 2012 was as follows:","2014-08-06 00:00:00","0","21.0","6.0","6.0","2.0","15.0","0.0","42.0","26.0","0.0","102.0","0.0","15.0","3","379","95.96","54.21","50.72","45.14","31.58","28.76","78.63","44.06","7.65","1.85","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","1.32","5.80","9.23","15.83","5.28","3.43","3.96","0.79","10.82","7.39","2.11","1.32","4.22","2.64","5.80","3.43","2.37","0.26","0.26","0.53","4.75","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.26","6.33","1.32","0.79","1.32","1.06","0.53","2.64","3.17","3.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.71","1.06","4.49","2.64","1.06","1.06","1.85","6.60","0.79","18.47","1.58","12.66","3.96","6.33","0.79","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.72","3.43","3.96","0.53","0.26","0.00","0.00","1.06","1.58","2.90","0.00","0.00","1887","9.0","35.27272727272727","570","373","13","50.8","14.1","13.3","13.53","17.5","93","11.625","23.45319034852547","222","31.45","2","0.42","0","8","14","40","0","64","46","1","0","5","69","27","6","20","1","0","6","5","14","1","0","1","3","0","10","14","10","1","3","11","2","2","0","2"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/118968/rick-scott-attacked-over-climate-change-denial-florida","Rick Scott, Meet the Politics of Climate Change","If you want proof that the politics of climate change are shifting, pay close attention to what Rick Scott has been saying in Florida lately. Scott, who is running for reelection as Florida’s governor, has always denied climate change science. Except now he is reluctant to publicly admit this position, four years after he once said he was not “convinced that there’s any man-made climate change.”

In May, Scott hesitated to answer a question about man-made climate change, beyond saying, “I’m not a scientist.” Since then, he has gone from ignoring scientists who requested to meet with him to agreeing to a personal discussion, thanks to additional pressure from his opponent Charlie Crist. On the same day Next Generation—Tom Steyer’s political group—announced it would target Scott’s record, the GOP governor tried to bolster his environmental credentials by pledging a new fund to aid conservation efforts and to target polluters.

What changed? Scott’s electorate includes coastal residents who face the front lines of global warming. And as Floridians experience climate change first hand, their understanding of the threat changes. Rather than looking at it as a far-away issue, they begin to feel the impacts in their livelihoods and homes. It’s no wonder that the Republican governor considers it bad politics to dismiss sea level rise when Florida’s entire south coast faces crucial decisions of how to adapt to the changing climate. Outside spending from Steyer has helped to bolster this message, after years of lopsided political spending from fossil fuel groups.

One example of where Florida is hurting now is how property and construction have become too risky for insurers. According to the state-created storm risk management center, a growing number of insurance companies have exited the market entirely. Climate change and its related extreme weather both factored into that decision.","2014-08-05 00:00:00","0","28.0","21.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","62.0","26.0","0.0","117.0","0.0","14.0","3","306","89.07","74.34","42.94","9.63","20.40","30.07","80.07","42.16","9.15","3.92","0.33","0.00","0.33","2.29","0.98","5.23","5.23","16.01","6.21","3.92","4.25","0.98","14.71","5.56","2.29","2.94","1.31","1.96","4.90","1.63","2.94","1.96","0.33","0.33","9.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.94","14.05","4.25","4.90","1.31","1.96","1.31","1.96","2.94","0.33","0.98","1.31","1.31","0.98","0.33","0.00","0.00","7.84","1.31","1.31","3.59","0.00","1.96","3.59","8.50","0.65","16.99","4.25","7.19","5.88","5.56","0.33","0.65","1.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.71","4.58","4.58","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","1.31","1.31","2.61","0.00","0.00","1559","9.49","24.153846153846153","481","300","14","49.75","13.6","11.6","13.87","14.6","91","8.3","22.693333333333335","210","21.92","2","0.42","0","5","2","22","0","36","23","1","0","1","65","22","0","19","0","0","12","5","14","0","0","0","16","0","12","11","12","7","7","12","0","5","0","4"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/119021/border-crisis-let-child-migrants-central-america-stay","Let the Border Kids Stay","Without a well-regulated border, we lose the capacity to make choices about whom we admit to our country. We end up simply taking those who manage to make their way in—which diminishes our financial and political capacity to accept others based on our economic need or their moral merit. But in the last decade, we’ve solved that problem. We have a secure border that affords us the ability to make choices—to prioritize the entry of the groups who most need our help, especially when we are directly responsible for their plight.

Central America has hemorrhaged migrants in recent decades. Its long civil wars—battles between U.S.-supported governments and Marxist insurgents—flared and abated and then flared again, with death squads preemptively squashing potential rebellions. Millions fled during these grinding conflicts. One in five Salvadorans came to reside in the United States. The numbers from Guatemala and Honduras were never quite so dramatic, though still fairly staggering. (There are more than one million Guatemalans living in the United States.) These departures—which were driven by the search for economic opportunity as well as the quest for safety—divided families and weakened the underlying structures of societies, creating the conditions for chaos.

After the cold war ended, the United States more or less fled the region, too. But the American appetite for cocaine remained. Honduras, with its unguarded coastlines, empty jungles, and convenient location, became a global capital of the drug business, with some 40 percent of U.S.-destined cocaine touching its soil on its journey northward. Gangs sprouted alongside this booming trade. Their growth was a tragicomic tale of the perils of unintended consequences. During the past two decades, the United States deported thousands of Los Angeles gang members back to their birth countries in the Northern Triangle, introducing hardened criminals and their tribal customs. These gangsters were often dumped with little warning and essentially no program for curbing their impending threat. Then there was the joint U.S.-Mexican war on drugs, which propelled gruesome Mexican criminal organizations into Central America in search of greater freedom to operate and new business opportunities.

The governments of Central America weren’t prepared for this influx, to say the least. Gangs arrived just as these countries were making a ham-fisted transition to democracy—a transition that viewed the principle of law and order with skepticism. Correcting for the authoritarian abuses of the past, the judiciaries tended to think of offenders as victims of social injustice; prosecutors were viewed as implements of power-mad dictators. (According to official numbers, 98 percent of crimes in Guatemala aren’t prosecuted.) And after all the civil wars and insurgencies faded into history, the security forces were scaled back, a particularly unfortunate stroke of bad timing. They are now simply outnumbered. Two years ago, the State Department estimated that there are some 85,000 gang members in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In the face of this growth, the Honduran police force has shrunk to just 14,000—and a poorly paid force at that. Officers make $400 per month, supplemented by “war taxes” they have empowered themselves to assess.

It was inevitable that childhood would fall victim to such social decay. Since gangs recruit in schools, classroom attendance has collapsed. NGOs in the region report that thugs use rape to coerce girls as young as nine into their schemes. This is the expression of a society that has degraded the very value of life. In Honduras, death is concentrated in metropolitan abattoirs: The city of San Pedro de Sula is arguably the grimmest place on Earth, with 173 homicides per 100,000. By comparison, war-torn, refugee-ridden Congo has 30 per 100,000.

It’s hardly surprising that the gangs would capture large chunks of the state in these countries. The vice president of Honduras’s National Congress has estimated that 40 percent of the police force is tied to organized crime. Guatemala’s security services were so thoroughly corrupted that the United Nations set up a special agency to combat criminal impunity—though three out of four murder cases still go unpunished. These are the classical preconditions for claims of asylum: When kids are targeted by gangs, they can’t appeal to any authority for plausible sanctuary, because the authorities are implicated in their torment. Many of the children crossing the Rio Grande aren’t trying to evade the border patrol but desperately seeking their protection.

One hundred and fifty years ago, the arrival of refugees from Ireland provoked a wave of draconian proposals for closing off access to the United States. The most eloquent rebuttal to these restrictions came from Herman Melville, who had himself recently crewed a ship from Liverpool brimming with immigrants. In his mostly forgotten novel Redburn, he waxed lyrical: “Let us waive that agitated national topic, as to whether such multitudes of foreign poor should be landed on our American shores; let us waive it, with the one only thought, that if they get here, they have God’s right to come; though they bring all Ireland and her miseries with them. For the whole world is the patrimony of the whole world; there is no telling who does not own a stone in the Great Wall of China.”

It’s a beautiful passage, moving in its cosmopolitanism and big-heartedness. But Melville’s expansiveness touches on the very anxiety that makes so many Americans wary of helping the migrant kids: the worry that opening doors for one group will inspire other groups to elbow their way in; that showing compassion for victims of violence in Guatemala will set an irreversible precedent that will require us to show the same compassion to victims of violence in Syria and the Central African Republic and Iraq and Congo. This isn’t an unreasonable concern. U.S. immigration laws frequently end up ushering in far more new arrivals than their authors intended.

But ultimately, this anxiety is just an excuse for inaction. For starters, the proximity of Central America makes the scale of this crisis singular. So, even if our generosity to the border kids motivated other asylum seekers, the influx would be a manageable one. The odds of Syrian and Congolese children showing up at our airports in great numbers is exceedingly remote. They would need valid visas to even board flights to the United States. Besides, we’ve shown many times in the past that our immigration law can extend a hand to particular groups at particular times—Indochinese and Cuban refugees, to name two—without opening the border to all comers.

Over the decades, we’ve built a generous immigration system—and also provided it with rigid constraints, starting with a well-policed border. The fact there will always be another beleaguered group knocking on our door doesn’t mean that we should turn away the unaccompanied kids who immediately need our help, especially when our society has contributed to their woes. Obligations can feel frighteningly endless, but that doesn’t absolve us of their burdens.","2014-08-13 00:00:00","1","30.0","5.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","107.0","0.0","14.0","3","1164","90.18","76.73","24.84","9.79","20.79","27.58","78.35","45.53","9.45","4.47","0.00","2.15","0.00","0.34","1.98","4.98","7.99","15.03","5.58","4.38","4.90","1.12","9.54","4.21","2.23","1.12","2.75","2.32","6.19","2.41","3.69","0.69","1.37","0.34","8.59","0.09","0.69","0.17","0.26","8.93","1.29","1.89","1.20","1.98","1.03","2.32","1.29","0.60","0.17","0.52","1.29","0.34","0.69","0.09","0.17","11.60","4.12","1.20","4.98","0.60","1.46","3.18","5.41","0.86","14.86","2.06","8.33","4.55","3.09","0.34","0.26","0.95","0.17","0.77","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","14.00","5.50","4.73","0.34","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.86","0.34","1.37","0.34","0.09","5877","8.87","21.527272727272727","1783","1138","59","51.89","12.9","10.8","13.63","13.3","308","11.1","20.546010544815466","624","19.62","8","0.44","0","32","30","120","0","160","90","3","3","13","166","76","9","103","1","0","30","32","57","2","1","7","35","0","36","40","27","38","27","25","8","6","0","3"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/117749/joshua-ferris-rise-again-decent-hour-deeply-boring","Joshua Ferris' 'To Rise Again at a Decent Hour' Is Deeply Boring","Any novel can sound boring when reduced to its most basic summary. Anna Karenina: A woman has an affair and struggles in her marriage. Of Mice and Men: Two itinerant agricultural workers plot to buy a farm where they can raise rabbits. So to describe Joshua Ferris’s new novel as the story of an atheist dentist who’s obsessed with religion, baseball, and his online identity isn’t very helpful. Instead, recall the last time you were at a wedding reception and ended up cornered by someone’s tiresome relative—perhaps, God forbid, your own. Now imagine that this person is thrusting upon you his 400-page treatise.

This distinction between boring-sounding and truly dull is important, because Ferris’s debut novel, Then We Came to the End, ingeniously narrated almost entirely in the collective first person, is a minor classic. It, too, is about ostensibly boring stuff: the office culture at a Chicago ad agency going down the tubes in the early aughts. The disappearance of an office chair is a hinge event. Yet it’s a funny and moving book that reveals a deep knowledge about the modern workplace (missing from much of contemporary fiction), where the drama often rises and falls on picayune events. Ferris understood that all most of us want in life is for someone to bring in donuts and tell us a little gossip.

To Rise Again at a Decent Hour is narrated by Paul O’Rourke, a successful dentist on the Upper East Side who discovers that someone is impersonating him online. And that person is writing some pretty weird stuff. Soon enough the mystery recedes: The impersonator is pushing a sect known as the Ulms, an offshoot (invented by Ferris) of the Amalekites (a tribe described in the Bible as enemies of the Israelites). Supposedly, Paul is a genetic descendent. The Ulms take as their central tenet an enduring skepticism about the existence of God. Passages about them are interspersed with musings about faith, especially Judaism, as refracted through Paul's previous romantic relationships with women of one religious stripe or another.

To be interested in the ruminations of a Paul O’Rourke, you have to care about what makes him tick. You have to believe the dialogue that comes out of his mouth. You have to identify, even if only a little, with his struggle to reconcile some of the contradictions in his life. Asking for the likes of Nathan Zuckerman might be too much. Even a lesser-Woody Allen character here would do. (Paul isn’t Jewish, but he’s nebbish-y and neurotic.) But recognizable human motive is what’s missing from To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, in which people seem driven primarily by whatever conversation or action will occasion the next set piece. And they’re rattling around in a narrative whose cupboard is pretty bare of event. Several plot developments arrive as social media postings or website updates that are delivered to Paul on an iPad by an assistant in his dental office.","2014-05-14 00:00:00","0","21.0","18.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","46.0","26.0","0.0","106.0","0.0","15.0","3","499","89.67","83.20","22.33","22.66","19.19","23.45","80.76","49.70","9.42","4.41","0.00","0.60","1.20","2.00","0.60","5.01","10.02","15.43","6.81","6.21","5.41","0.40","11.62","4.81","1.60","2.00","0.80","2.40","6.01","2.81","3.01","0.80","0.40","0.60","10.22","0.40","0.00","0.60","2.00","9.62","2.81","0.60","0.60","4.41","1.00","2.00","0.80","0.20","0.60","0.00","1.00","0.20","0.80","0.00","0.00","5.81","2.61","1.00","2.20","0.40","0.00","1.20","9.02","1.00","14.23","2.81","7.01","4.81","2.20","1.40","0.00","0.20","1.80","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.43","5.21","4.41","0.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.80","0.00","2.61","1.60","0.00","2354","8.91","19.615384615384617","745","492","26","60.75","11.7","9.5","11.49","11.4","135","7.333333333333334","20.53560975609756","311","18.69","3","0.48","0","17","3","57","0","66","56","1","1","5","75","44","0","18","0","0","16","10","23","0","1","1","13","0","22","5","13","11","15","24","5","4","1","3"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/117735/private-equity-fraud-how-firms-are-ripping-their-investors","The SEC Has Revealed Astounding Corruption in Private Equity","When liberals talk about economic regulation, they often use eye-rolling abstractions like “accountability” and “transparency.” What do those things even mean? How are those objectives enforced, and what would this enforcement even look like? Luckily we have a real-time example of what it all means, courtesy of Dodd-Frank and the SEC. It involves one of the more controversial parts of the financial markets, and it gives us a view into how reform happens.

As a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, private equity firms must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This, in turn, allows the SEC to examine the behavior of private equity firms on behalf of investors. The SEC just completed an initial wave of 150 firms, and what it found is shocking.

These results were unveiled last week when Andrew Bowden, the director of the SEC’s examinations office, gave a speech titled “Spreading Sunshine in Private Equity.” The big takeaway: Half of the SEC’s exams find corruption in the way fees and expenses are handled. Or as Bowden forcefully describes it: “When we have examined how fees and expenses are handled by advisers to private equity funds, we have identified what we believe are violations of law or material weaknesses in controls over 50 percent of the time.”

As Bowden notes, the business model of private equity, which manages almost $3.5 trillion dollars of our nation’s assets, has unique conflicts of interest built into the structure. Private equity firms use their client’s money to do leveraged buyouts of companies. Since this gives them major operating control of both the investment and a pool of other’s investment money, there are significant opportunities to shift costs and otherwise skim off their investors.","2014-05-12 00:00:00","0","26.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","50.0","26.0","0.0","105.0","0.0","15.0","3","295","85.93","80.15","8.81","44.38","21.07","26.78","80.00","44.75","9.49","3.39","0.00","2.03","0.00","0.00","1.36","6.10","7.80","13.56","5.08","4.41","7.80","0.00","10.51","2.37","2.37","4.07","2.37","1.36","2.37","1.69","0.68","0.00","0.34","0.00","7.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.51","3.05","4.07","0.68","1.69","1.02","1.02","1.69","1.36","0.34","0.00","0.68","0.34","0.34","0.00","0.00","7.46","2.03","0.34","3.73","0.34","1.36","1.36","8.81","0.00","9.49","1.36","4.75","3.39","6.78","0.34","0.00","9.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.29","4.07","5.08","0.68","0.00","0.68","0.00","1.36","2.71","1.69","0.68","0.34","1456","9.37","27.363636363636363","456","291","15","51.78","13.1","10.9","12.88","12.8","88","7.0","21.85621993127148","191","24.64","6","0.43","0","13","7","31","0","35","19","0","0","2","44","30","1","31","0","0","12","3","7","1","0","1","4","0","7","5","3","7","15","11","1","5","0","5"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/118902/rick-perlsteins-invisible-bridge-review-nixon-reagan","How Ronald Reagan Rode America's Delusions to the White House","Rick Perlstein is becoming an American institution. In 2001, his account of Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign, Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus was well received. This he followed with Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America, in 2008, a study of the American body politic between the 1968 and 1972 elections. The epic continues in The Invisible Bridge: The Fall of Nixon and the Rise of Reagan, which examines the four turbulent years from 1972 to 1976, the bridge from Nixon’s very visible demise to Reagan’s increasingly visible triumph. All three have a trademark style. They are prodigiously researched; they are long; they are funny; and, in their zeal for narrative, they owe more to the high-quality journalism of a David Halberstam or a Theodore White than to the footnoting, the theorizing, and the narrowed focus of academic historical writing. In addition, Perlstein’s three books trace a single argument—that the conservative movement divided the nation.

But how often can a nation be divided? Perlstein would struggle to answer this question. In his multi-volume history, division functions not as an analytical category, rooted in statements of cause and effect, but as a poetic motif. As such, it resembles the melodies associated with particular characters in a opera, and when Goldwater or Nixon or Reagan is on stage, the trumpet of disunity is duly sounded. As a matter of logic, they cannot each have been the one to divide America. Without the motif of division, however, The Invisible Bridge would be a collage of campaign and cultural detail, of journalistic citations and political anecdote, held together only by chronological sequence, which, in essence, is what his latest book is. Perlstein’s genuine writerly gifts are compromised by the banality and imprecision of his broader historical insights.

Because the fracturing of America has no real beginning, in Perlstein’s chronicle, it can have no recognizable end. He registers the Alger Hiss case of 1948–1950 as the first time Nixon, “this strange, sweating man divided the country in two.” (This is a wildly hyperbolic claim: The deep divisions exposed by the Hiss case were ones that Nixon, a political novice when he stumbled on the case, simply exploited and in no way created.) With the McCarthy era, “the nation was now neatly divided,” Perlstein continues, and, in 1958, labor relations were “approaching a pitch near to civil war.” Lyndon Johnson’s presidency was, also, fractious. In this it was superseded by “Nixonland’s division.” “There were two tribes of Americans now,” Perlstein writes of the early 1970s: “how badly out of joint the nation had become.” Despite his popularity, Reagan too was “a divider.” “All right,” wrote John Dos Passos far more succinctly in his U.S.A. trilogy, ""we are two nations.""

Exhaustively detailed, The Invisible Bridge eschews nuance for generalizations: The country is enmeshed in a permanent and enervating presidential campaign, ever on the edge of unraveling. In The Invisible Bridge, the “world [has] gone mad,” its madness cause for “an increasingly paranoid culture.” “Everyone wanted to be somewhere else,” Perlstein writes of Americans during and after Watergate, because “it was easy to feel like civilization was falling apart” and “the world seemed well neigh unto apocalypse.” In “such death-haunted times,” a nation’s dreams could only be “haunted” as well. Even “trick-or-treating was just about too frightening to contemplate” in 1973, Perlstein notes. Amid their despair, “people yearned to believe.”","2014-07-31 00:00:00","0","22.0","22.0","6.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","48.0","26.0","0.0","115.0","0.0","15.0","3","579","93.63","54.80","28.64","12.14","19.97","29.36","73.75","47.84","5.87","2.94","0.00","0.17","0.00","1.55","1.21","2.76","10.71","15.03","7.25","4.49","6.22","1.04","9.50","5.35","2.59","1.21","3.45","1.04","3.97","1.38","2.42","0.52","0.69","0.35","4.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.73","9.15","3.28","1.55","0.86","1.55","0.69","2.42","1.21","0.52","0.35","0.17","0.69","0.35","0.35","0.00","0.00","3.97","0.86","0.52","2.42","0.35","0.00","3.80","5.87","0.17","14.34","2.07","8.12","4.66","3.97","0.69","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.52","0.00","25.22","5.35","8.81","1.04","0.52","0.17","0.00","0.86","6.22","1.55","0.35","0.35","2900","9.14","26.818181818181817","925","572","30","52.09","13.6","10.7","13.69","13.3","165","11.75","21.178461538461537","327","23.64","3","0.46","0","22","19","72","0","76","50","1","1","5","91","62","2","19","0","1","13","9","33","1","0","0","11","0","13","25","9","17","12","17","3","1","0","4"

""As to Crimea, as you know, its autonomy was restricted several times in the past against the will of the Crimeans.

"https://newrepublic.com/article/118957/toledos-water-ban-over-toxic-algae-still-problem","Toledo's Water Ban Is Over, But Toxic Algae is Still a Problem","Officials lifted the tap-water ban in Toledo, Ohio, on Monday, as it entered its third day. As Mayor Michael Collins declared Monday morning, “Our water is safe.” For now, anyway. But the toxin that contaminated the city’s water supply could be on the rise due to climate change and other human activities. Toledo’s crisis shows just how unprepared cities and towns are for a problem that’s getting worse.

The toxin that contaminated Toledo's water is called microcystin. It comes from cyanobacteria, known as blue-green algae—the green stuff found on the surface of water—which thrive in warm, sunny weather and feed off of phosphorous and nitrogen. Drinking and bathing in it can cause nausea, vomiting, and dizziness within hours, harm the liver, and lead to eye, skin, and throat irritation. Once microcystin is in the water, it can last there for weeks or months.

Officials have been watching microcystin in the Great Lakes region for a while now, and warned that this season would be the fourth-worst on record. Normally, algae blooms are spread across the water, but wind and waves caused it to concentrate near the shore in Lake Erie's Maumee Bay, where Toledo gets its water. On Friday, microcystin was detected in the treatment plant's water at 2.5 parts per billion, well above the World Health Organization’s 1 part per billion recommendation. The harmful algae bloom hasn’t even hit its peak month yet: September.

Other cities that get their water from the Great Lakes region are keeping a close eye on algae blooms: Chicago is now re-testing their water samples from Lake Michigan. And the problem is a national one, as harmful algae blooms exist in every coastal state. Ottawa County in Ohio faced a similar situation last year that resulted in a two-day water ban. Advisories not to swim in algae-contaminated lakes are fairly common: People were told to keep away from two Nebraska lakes last month.","2014-08-04 00:00:00","0","13.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","53.0","26.0","0.0","108.0","0.0","14.0","2","327","89.74","51.22","48.63","10.37","19.24","17.13","76.15","41.59","6.73","0.92","0.00","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.61","5.81","7.34","13.15","6.42","3.36","6.12","0.61","10.40","5.50","2.14","0.92","3.06","0.92","4.89","1.83","3.06","0.31","0.00","0.00","2.75","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.03","0.92","1.83","1.53","0.61","0.31","2.14","3.06","2.45","0.00","0.61","7.65","1.53","1.83","0.00","4.28","5.20","0.31","0.31","1.22","1.53","2.14","2.45","7.34","0.00","19.27","1.83","10.09","7.34","1.22","0.92","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.31","0.31","17.43","5.20","6.42","0.92","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.83","0.61","2.45","0.00","0.00","1538","8.23","21.0","461","319","18","70.43","10.4","7.8","11.6","11.1","75","6.357142857142857","18.48438871473354","204","19.5","0","0.4","0","14","8","26","0","41","29","1","0","4","69","34","0","19","0","0","5","6","12","0","0","0","5","0","8","15","5","7","9","11","6","0","0","2"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/117712/pope-francis-income-inequality-resist-economy-exclusion","When the Pope Speaks, Liberals and Conservatives Only Hear What They Want To Hear","When Pope Francis speaks about inequality, as he does frequently—and most recently Friday in an address to several United Nations agency heads in Rome—liberals and conservatives gather and, like the blind men with the elephant, claim that the singular thing he has just said means completely different things. (Author Elizabeth Stoker has fashioned another analogy: a Bingo card. Which parts of Francis’ remarks did you hear?)

What did Francis say Friday? He condemned the “economy of exclusion,” according to the Associated Press. He called for “worldwide ethical mobilization” with the poor. He cited “the legitimate redistribution of economic benefits by the state, as well as indispensable cooperation between the private sector and civil society” as ways to combat poverty. “Francis urged the U.N. to promote development goals that attack the root causes of poverty and hunger, protect the environment and ensure dignified labor for all,” the AP reported, quoting him saying, “Specifically, this involves challenging all forms of injustices and resisting the economy of exclusion, the throwaway culture and the culture of death which nowadays sadly risk becoming passively accepted.” Yes, “culture of death,” for Francis also spoke of life “from conception to natural death.”

In other words: raise taxes on the rich, make government better, and keep Terri Schiavo on life support.

Of course, it’s not remotely that simple. Yet the stakes couldn’t be higher: More than one billion people worldwide are ostensibly supposed to believe this man is literally infallible (though not most of the time, but you get the idea). And many more billions seem inclined to see the Pope as a moral beacon regardless of their religious beliefs. And so we fight over what the he said like dogs over a scrap of meat.","2014-05-09 00:00:00","0","15.0","2.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","50.0","26.0","0.0","108.0","0.0","14.0","3","291","92.14","76.47","2.58","37.95","19.40","28.18","81.79","44.67","8.93","4.12","0.00","0.34","1.03","2.41","0.34","4.81","8.93","15.12","3.78","3.78","7.22","1.03","9.97","6.19","5.50","1.72","1.03","3.44","4.81","2.75","2.06","0.34","0.69","0.34","10.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.09","10.31","2.41","1.03","0.69","1.37","1.72","3.44","3.78","0.69","2.75","0.34","2.06","0.34","1.03","0.00","0.69","8.25","1.03","1.37","4.47","1.72","0.69","2.75","6.53","0.00","6.53","0.00","4.12","2.41","5.50","0.00","0.34","2.75","1.72","1.03","1.03","0.00","0.34","0.34","0.34","0.00","19.59","4.81","5.84","1.03","0.00","0.69","0.00","0.00","4.81","1.03","1.37","0.00","1456","9.58","24.416666666666668","462","288","15","51.99","13.3","10.8","13.34","13.0","91","6.214285714285714","22.31888888888889","204","21.08","3","0.42","0","13","2","30","0","37","25","3","2","0","43","24","0","21","1","0","11","1","19","1","0","0","7","0","9","10","6","5","9","8","3","2","0","1"
"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/03/06/how-do-i-use-my-health-insurance-when-i-visit-a-doctor/","How Do I Use My Health Insurance When I Visit A Doctor?","If, like many Americans, you have been without health insurance, and just recently enrolled in a health plan as required by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), you will need to select a doctor to coordinate your health care. Doctor visits must be covered by your insurance as one of the 10 essential benefits under the ACA. Some plans require you select one primary care provider. Others allow you to visit any doctor within a plan’s network.

To maximize the benefits of your new insurance policy, you will likely need to choose a doctor from within your health plan’s network. These doctors have contracted with your health insurance company to provide services. While many plans will pay some benefits for services provided by an out-of-network doctor, you will generally have less out-of-pocket costs visiting an in-network provider.

To locate a doctor in your health plan’s network, consult your plan’s provider directory. You will find this on the company’s website. If you have a specific doctor in mind, you may call your insurer to determine if he or she is in the network. You will find the customer service number on your insurance card. You may also directly call the doctor’s office and ask if they accept your insurance. Have your insurance card ready when you call so you will be able to identify the exact name of your plan.

The first visit to your new doctor will be to establish yourself as a patient. Bring your insurance card to this appointment, it contains the information your doctor needs for billing. Your doctor may schedule you for preventative screenings, which may require you visit a laboratory to have blood drawn, or see a specialist for specific tests such as a colonoscopy, bone density test or a mammogram. The doctor’s clerical staff will generally verify that your insurance plan coverage includes the providers of these procedures.

Depending on your plan, you may be required to make a co-payment or pay co-insurance. Under a provision of the ACA, some preventative services must be paid for in full by the insurance company. You will have no out-of-pocket expense for these.

If you have a specific health issue that requires a specialist–for example, you wish to see a physical therapist or a mental health professional–some plans require that your primary care physician provide a referral. With other plans, you may schedule these appointments yourself. Check your plan’s documents or call the insurance company’s customer service number to determine if a referral is necessary.

BOYLE HEIGHTS (CBSLA.com) — A battery recycling plant in Vernon linked to environmental health hazards is under fire again.

KCAL9’s Dave Bryan reports residents demanded answers from Exide Technologies officials Wednesday night at a community forum held to discuss recent results of soil testing that found elevated lead levels in yards near the Exide plant.

State officials tried to update the community on what’s being done to deal with elevated lead levels in the soil. But the audience was unsatisfied with their answers, with attendees insisting to know why it’s taken so long for something to be done and why Exide hasn’t been shut down.

“People are dying. We see this every day. We are here to say when is for you enough?” one woman asked during the forum at the Resurrection Catholic Church. “How many people does it take for you to actually shut down this company?”

Residents of Boyle Heights, Maywood and other communities affected by toxic pollution reacted decisively, making clear nothing short of ceasing the plant’s operations would be acceptable.

State officials from the Department of Toxic Substances Control told the audience the elevated levels of lead are a concern, but not an emergency.

The department said Exide will have to eliminate exposure for the most vulnerable residents in affected areas – pregnant women and children – and will have to do more detailed follow-up testing in a wider region than before.

They also suggested residents in the affected areas take precautions.

“Just wash your hands when you come in from the front yard. Wash your children’s hands when they play in the yard,” Brian Johnson, Deputy Director of the Hazardous Waste Management Program, said.

Longtime Boyle Heights residents branded the remarks insulting.

“We know that. We’re not ignorant. We weren’t – I mean – we have some education here. And yet, they come in and say, well, you know, you need to wash your hands now. But it’s not dangerous,” one woman said.

An Exide spokeswoman said the company is doing everything it can to comply with state regulations.

“We are in compliance with all regulations, and, in fact, a December 2013 report by the AQMD staff actually showed that Exide had reduced all arsenic emissions by 95 percent,” she said.

The next step in the process is expected to come Friday when Exide is required to give its plan for how it will deal with the elevated lead levels to state health officials, who will then rule on what the following steps will be.

CULVER CITY (CBSLA.com) — A proposal that would increase the malpractice damage cap, which has remained at $250,000 for several decades, has gotten mixed reactions in California.

Supporters on Monday are expected to submit more than 800,000 signatures to put the medical reform measure, which would also require doctors to submit to drug tests and make it harder for prescription drug abusers to get their pills, on the November ballot.

Dr. Hector Flores, the co-director of the Family Medicine Residency Program at White Memorial Medical Center in Boyle Heights, said while he sympathizes with people who have lost loved ones due to hospital mistakes, the proposal is not what it appears to be.

“The referendum is flawed the way it is written because there’s too much baggage in it,” he said. “Someone who loses their child, my heart goes out to them. I have a daughter and if something happened to her, I’d be devastated. There’s no amount of money that would replace my daughter. The idea is to find a better way to make sound policy.”

Flores said raising the malpractice cap may drive up health care costs dramatically. It could also have unintended consequences for doctors, neighborhood clinics and patients, especially those in underserved communities.

“Potentially we may have to lay off some doctors, we may have to lay off staff, or reduce the pay we offer to our staff. None of that is good for the community,” he said.

Flores added, “It will have an impact with more lawsuits, more costly insurance, and the most adversely affected will be those communities we’re trying to help, which will be the underprivileged, low-income communities.”

Consumer Watchdog’s Jamie Court told KCAL9’s Dave Bryan that doctors just don’t want to change.

“They don’t want to held accountable to the same rules that you and I are. If a child dies in a car accident, a jury decides the value of their life and how negligent the driver was. If a child dies in a hospital, the cost is never more than $250,000 to a company like Kaiser and that’s not enough to change. I think the doctors who oppose this should be ashamed,” he said.

Tammy and Tim Smick back the proposition.

The couple lost their 20-year-old son, Alex, two years ago when he was hospitalized to be treated for a prescription drug addiction after incurring a stress fracture in his back.

“Alex checked into an Orange County hospital to ‘safely’ detox off of pain medication and he died the first night that he was at the hospital,” Tammy said.

The Smicks said Alex was repeatedly given powerful drugs on his first night at the hospital without being properly monitored.

“He was administered 11 medications, including multiple central nervous system suppressants. He was left unmonitored without even one blood pressure check for over seven hours. When the nurse finally checked on him shortly after 6 in the morning, he was found dead. How can a patient be given so many medications and then be left unmonitored?” Tammy said.","2014-03-21 21:48:53","1","61.0","160.0","35.0","0.0","68.0","0.0","220.0","62.0","0.0","503.0","0.0","40.0","37","516","77.59","76.92","8.07","10.92","19.11","20.93","85.27","48.26","11.05","6.20","1.16","0.97","0.19","2.71","1.16","4.84","7.95","12.79","9.69","3.49","4.65","1.74","17.83","3.10","2.52","2.13","2.71","2.71","4.26","1.55","2.71","0.78","0.19","0.97","11.05","0.78","0.39","0.58","2.71","9.11","1.16","1.94","2.33","2.71","0.39","1.94","2.71","0.58","1.74","0.39","6.59","0.39","6.01","0.00","0.19","10.08","2.71","1.74","4.84","0.97","0.78","6.01","9.11","1.74","13.37","1.55","7.36","4.84","3.68","0.39","0.58","1.94","0.00","0.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.60","5.43","6.01","0.19","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.78","2.91","1.94","0.78","0.39","2389","7.89","21.875","743","509","28","61.46","12.0","9.2","11.08","10.9","108","11.25","17.767229862475443","302","19.96","10","0.46","0","11","12","47","0","48","33","5","0","12","74","43","0","28","0","0","28","10","19","1","1","5","22","0","32","23","5","20","13","18","5","4","0","4"

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Saying it’s time the rich give more to the poor, demonstrators rallied in more than 20 cities in support of a tax on Wall Street dubbed “the Robin Hood tax.”

Protesters in Robin Hood-like green hats in downtown Los Angeles said the government needs to levy Wall Street transactions to provide up to $300 billion a year for services for the poor.

The bill, H.R. 1579, (more formally known as “The Inclusive Prosperity Act”) would place a tax of a fraction of a percent on the transactions to fund social programs and reduce income inequality, according to the bill’s website.

The proposed tax has yet to gain major support in the House and Senate.

Margie Keenan, a registered nurse, said it is time for Wall Street to pay “their fair share.”

“Transactions that we are taxing are the ones that caused the financial meltdown in the first place,” Keenan said.

Rallies were held in Los Angeles as well as at least 22 cities across the country.

In Washington, D.C., the bill’s author Rep. Keith Ellison, D- Minnesota, said the country is on the brink of another financial crisis.

“This tax alone will generate up to $300 billion a year in revenue, stabilizing the deficit and allowing us to invest in the things that matter, education, roads and bridges, and health care for our seniors and veterans,” Ellison said.

Ellison contends that in 2011, 40 countries had a similar tax, as did the United States until 1966.

The protests coincided with the 46th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an outspoken champion for workers and poor people.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — A Los Angeles city council committee Thursday approved a $10 million plan to repair damaged sidewalks.

“I am thrilled that we are finally making some progress on addressing the downright embarrassing condition of our sidewalks,” said Councilman Joe Buscaino, who chairs the Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee that approved the funds.

The funding proposal will be heard Monday by the Budget and Finance Committee. If approved there, it will go to a vote by the full City Council.

The funds would be split three ways, with a third of the $10 million going toward fixing sidewalk damage tied up in lawsuits and liability claims.

Another third would go into a larger effort to spruce up well-traveled, high-profile and “iconic streets” around the city, Buscaino spokesman Branimir Kvartuc said.

The remaining money would fund a cost-sharing program. In that plan, expenses of repairing sidewalks will be split evenly between property owners and the city.

Buscaino said the $10 million will chip away at a $1.5 billion problem that grew over a long period, with about 40 percent, or 4,600 miles of sidewalks, still in bad condition.

The backlog of broken sidewalks, he said, is a “result of four decades of disingenuous policies whereby the city took legal responsibility for a massive expenditure, without ever figuring out how to pay for it.”

Many of sidewalks in California, and the trees that line them, were installed by real estate developers. State law dictates property owners are the ones who must pay for repairs, according to Buscaino.

But the city’s damaged sidewalk problem suffered a blow in 1973 when city leaders passed an ordinance that made it the city’s responsibility to fix sidewalks damaged by tree roots, he said.

Councilman Bob Blumenfield this week also weighed in on the issue. He favored a cost-sharing plan in which commercial property owners would pay 50-75 percent of the cost, while the city would cover the rest.

His proposal also includes an incentive that would reduce the property owners’ share of the costs based on how quickly they act.","2014-02-06 21:32:32","1","59.0","160.0","35.0","0.0","68.0","0.0","217.0","62.0","0.0","503.0","0.0","40.0","37","356","95.76","76.74","8.18","25.77","22.25","27.53","75.84","41.85","6.74","2.53","0.28","0.56","0.00","1.12","0.56","4.21","10.67","13.20","5.34","3.65","4.21","0.28","11.52","1.40","0.28","1.69","5.06","1.69","5.62","2.81","2.81","0.28","0.00","0.28","8.99","0.00","0.28","0.00","1.12","7.58","0.28","2.25","3.09","0.84","0.56","1.69","1.97","0.00","1.97","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","10.11","1.69","2.25","4.78","0.28","1.40","4.21","3.37","2.25","14.61","1.97","9.83","3.09","6.74","0.28","0.00","4.49","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","16.85","5.06","5.34","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.40","1.69","0.84","1.12","1.12","1717","8.4","23.933333333333334","532","349","18","60.24","12.4","9.7","12.71","12.6","84","6.75","19.387507163323782","215","22.47","5","0.37","0","8","17","42","0","40","16","1","0","11","64","31","0","28","0","0","10","2","9","0","0","3","6","0","14","18","10","8","5","4","6","2","0","3"

Dekraai, 43, has pleaded guilty to fatally shooting his former wife and seven other people in a Seal Beach hair salon in 2011.

He is awaiting sentencing.

Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals said investigators engaged in serious misconduct by using jail informants.

Dekraai’s attorneys claimed sheriff’s deputies give jailhouse snitches easy access to inmates to pump them for information that can be used to prosecute them, essentially violating their constitutional rights.

“We’re pleased that he found there was misconduct, but we think the remedy should have been a stronger one,” said Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, who filed the 505-page motion earlier this year that led to the evidentiary hearing that began in mid-March.

O.C. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told reporters, “I do agree with many of the findings of Judge Goethals.” But he added that while

some of his prosecutors were guilty of “errors,” there was no “intentional misconduct.”

Rackauckas said he was working with sheriff’s officials to reform the unit that handles jailhouse informants.

The judge also faulted prosecutors for failing to share information with defense attorneys and “repeated improper attempts” to get Dekraai’s psychiatric records. He stopped short of removing the D.A.’s Office from the case or taking the death penalty off the table.

_____________________________________

Establishing an emergency savings plan is one of your most important financial moves. Traditionally, financial advisors suggest that consumers setup an emergency fund to cover at least 3-6 months worth of household expenses. However, under the current economic situation, they now recommend that you have enough funds set aside to make payments on at least 6-12 months of living expenses. You need this emergency savings cushion in case you’re affected by a sudden job loss, unexpected health-related issue, or even an accident. Americans are having greater difficulty finding jobs–realistically, it could take a year or more to find suitable replacement employment.

Another benefit of having a savings safety net is that it can prevent you from having to rely on credit cards in times of financial emergencies. With such high interest rates, using credit when you don’t have the means to pay it off at the end of the month, can make your large emergency purchases (a new transmission, or trip to the emergency room, for instance) cost thousands more in interest and fees. Paying some of these surprise expenses off with cash will save you much stress and cash.

The first step when establishing a savings plan is to calculate your expenses in the form of a household budget. Our budgeting worksheet will help. The most important things to consider are needs versus what are wants. If you’re on a tight budget, list only necessities that cannot be eliminated. Cutting out items such as cable, hobbies, charitable donations, extra telephone lines, and gifts will help you get to your bottom line. Make sure to include car payments, utilities, insurance, food, and health care costs.

Second review your budget once more to see where you can make some comfortable budget changes to allow you to start saving or increase your savings. Remember that anything you can do now will help you start to build your emergency savings fund. After reviewing and adjusting your budget, you should find that you have between 5 and 15% of your income available to deposit into savings each month. Use the numbers you have now to set a realistic time frame for your savings fund to reach your goal. No matter how much you can budget for savings, the key is to set something aside even if it is only $20 a pay period.

Third, consider your savings options. Make sure that the type of savings account you chose will allow you to make un-penalized withdrawals and that you have immediate access to the funds in case of an emergency. Check to see what the minimum deposit is required is to open a savings account. Select an account that has a minimum balance and amount of un-penalized access that will fit your needs. For most people with a modest savings, a basic savings account or money market account is fine.

Fourth, enact your savings plan and make sure to pay yourself first. After you have set up your savings account, the most important part of establishing your emergency fund is to start making deposits and sticking with a regular deposit schedule. Treat your deposits just like any other household bill. In fact, prioritizing your deposits is essential to achieving your savings goal. Many banks and employers offer direct deposit accounts for which the employer automatically deposits a portion of your payroll earnings into your savings account each pay period. You will be much less tempted to spend your savings when it’s out of sight and out of mind. When “left over” money is seen in the checking account, it usually gets spent. As more of a boost, is you get a raise, bonus or a tax refund, you could direct half of it to your savings. Like with the direct deposit, since you haven’t seen the money in your checking account, you’re much less likely to miss it.

Once your emergency savings fund has been established and you have met your savings goals, you may feel comfortable in knowing that you have enough funds to bail yourself out in a time of need. However it is important to reevaluate how much you will truly need in your emergency fund and revisit your budget. Are you are happy with your current budget and the amount of emergency funds you’ve saved? Decide if you would like to continue to maintain the plan or make some changes. Keep in mind that establishing a non-emergency savings account and paying down debt are also very important financial goals that may be accomplished using many of the same steps outlined above.","2014-02-03 03:00:16","1","57.0","171.0","35.0","0.0","68.0","0.0","226.0","61.0","0.0","503.0","0.0","40.0","37","781","78.19","93.77","10.41","82.91","20.55","23.56","87.07","46.35","12.55","8.32","0.00","0.13","8.07","0.00","0.13","4.23","5.89","13.70","8.32","2.94","4.87","0.51","14.21","4.23","2.69","1.28","2.18","3.84","4.23","3.71","0.51","0.13","0.00","0.26","9.86","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.50","1.66","2.82","1.66","3.20","0.77","2.18","1.15","0.77","0.13","0.26","0.51","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.13","7.17","0.90","1.92","2.82","1.79","1.02","1.28","11.65","1.92","11.27","1.15","5.38","4.74","5.38","0.26","0.51","14.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.77","4.74","4.23","0.26","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.77","0.26","0.90","0.51","4.99","3671","7.34","20.763157894736842","1137","774","38","59.23","12.0","10.1","11.37","12.0","132","8.2","16.981705426356587","355","19.26","0","0.46","0","24","8","56","0","86","58","3","3","19","140","17","1","67","0","0","44","30","24","4","3","5","32","0","58","1","22","17","32","22","4","2","0","7"

COSTA MESA (CBSLA.com) — Investigators are looking into allegations of a major data breach linked to an Orange County-based credit reporting agency, according to reports Friday.

KNX 1070’s Mike Landa reports the personal data of millions of Americans, including Social Security numbers, may have been stolen from the Experian data firm.

Report: Multi-State Investigation Of Experian Data Breach Underway Attorneys General from Illinois, Connecticut, and several other states were reported to be taking part in the investigation of Costa Mesa-based Experian, which is best known for its consumer credit services. According to Landa, prosecutors believe a data firm acquired by Experian may have been compromised by Vietnamese national Hieu Ngo, who pleaded guilty last month to running an underground website offering the personal data of Americans, which officials say could potentially be used for identity theft or financial fraud. As many as 200 million Social Security numbers may have been compromised, Reuters reported. Company officials would not comment on the investigation, according to reports. Experian was hired by retailer Target to provide free credit monitoring services to its clients following the theft of 40 million card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data in a breach announced last December.","2014-04-04 12:58:11","1","26.0","92.0","4.0","0.0","42.0","2.0","131.0","36.0","0.0","299.0","0.0","6.0","11","208","96.70","59.50","2.44","84.92","29.71","34.62","68.75","33.17","3.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.37","5.29","14.42","8.17","0.00","2.40","0.48","13.46","4.81","1.44","1.44","3.85","1.92","5.29","3.85","0.48","0.48","0.00","0.00","4.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.69","1.44","1.44","0.96","2.40","0.00","1.92","1.92","1.44","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.73","1.92","1.44","2.40","1.44","0.96","3.85","4.81","1.92","6.73","0.96","3.37","2.40","12.50","0.48","0.00","6.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.94","3.85","5.29","0.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.44","0.00","0.48","1.92","0.00","1124","10.32","29.714285714285715","371","204","8","28.67","17.0","15.6","16.02","18.1","70","10.5","25.92549019607843","137","28.0","4","0.31","0","3","7","11","0","20","16","0","0","5","27","38","2","22","0","0","0","2","3","0","1","0","8","0","7","6","9","13","3","2","2","1","0","0"

Toxics Regulators Accused Of ‘Doctored Data’ In Tainted Soil Probe","Residents of the Autumnwood housing complex have claimed a dangerous cocktail of contaminants is buried underneath their homes. (CBS)

SANTA MONICA (CBSLA.com) — California state toxics regulators and other officials allegedly doctored data in a preliminary investigation of a Wildomar housing complex to avoid pinpointing the source of an apparent health threat and any ensuing cleanup, according to a report released Tuesday.

The report from Consumer Watchdog alleges officials the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) and other regulators ignored high concentrations of toxins and refused to continue investigating to find the source of toxins poisoning residents at the Autumnwood complex.

Several families were forced to abandon their homes and move after deaths in the complex and illnesses among residents from chemically induced pneumonia to lupus, according to the “American Dream or Toxic Nightmare” (PDF) report.

Environmental advocate Penny Newman along with Wildomar residents prepared the report in response to the draft results of a DTSC investigation (PDF) that found “no evidence” of soil contamination or chemicals below the housing tract.

But according to Newman, both independent and DTSC testing showed hundreds of toxic chemicals at the Autumnwood property, including chlorinated hydrocarbons, petrochemicals, metals, and pesticides. Testing also showed chemicals detected in the groundwater, soil, and soil gas were found in concentrations up to 1,000 times higher than in homes, Newman said.

“The situation that Wildomar residents find themselves in is a result of bureaucratic bumbling, disingenuous lip service, and a massive cover-up,” said Newman in a statement.

The report cited several possible causes for the pollution: illegal dumping of toxic soil and other debris from underground gas station storage tank cleanups and an illegal auto dismantling yard; contaminated soil used to level the complex prior to construction that was brought in from a wastewater treatment plant; and crossed water lines that could be feeding non-potable recycled water to the community.

Nearly one-third of Autumnwood’s 60 homeowners sought legal representation last year after complaining of pneumonia-like symptoms, including swelling tongue and lips, nosebleeds, and sore throat.

KNX 1070’s Megan Goldsby reports U.S. Marine Tommy Chicoreely is among those residents calling for action after he lost his wife Fatima less than two years ago following their birth of their daughter.

Calif. Toxics Regulators Accused Of 'Doctored Data' In Tainted Soil Probe “I walked in holding her hand and I walked out holding the bag of clothes she died in,” Chicoreely said. “They said it was pneumonia, but we think it was more than that.” In response to the findings, DTSC spokesperson Russ Edmondson said the agency would “carefully review” the report and release a final report of the agency’s investigation “shortly.”","2014-04-08 12:40:03","1","33.0","92.0","4.0","0.0","42.0","2.0","135.0","36.0","0.0","299.0","0.0","6.0","11","446","98.42","60.62","22.00","2.99","29.73","33.63","73.32","37.44","5.38","2.91","0.45","0.22","0.00","0.90","1.35","2.47","7.85","15.92","2.69","0.67","4.93","0.22","8.07","4.48","2.24","0.00","1.79","1.35","2.47","0.00","2.47","0.45","0.67","0.45","5.38","0.67","0.00","0.90","0.45","9.87","3.81","2.69","0.45","1.12","0.22","2.24","2.69","0.67","1.35","0.22","6.05","1.57","3.59","0.00","0.90","5.61","0.90","0.22","3.81","0.00","0.90","5.61","2.24","0.22","11.21","1.57","6.73","2.91","6.05","0.90","3.14","1.35","0.00","0.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.59","4.04","4.48","0.22","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.90","3.14","1.12","2.24","0.00","2416","10.02","34.53846153846154","756","440","16","35.1","16.4","15.2","16.13","19.2","140","13.0","25.727272727272727","267","30.46","15","0.36","0","21","6","40","0","52","31","2","0","2","79","55","0","43","0","1","9","6","10","1","0","2","14","0","9","24","19","11","3","5","4","0","0","0"

DETROIT (WWJ/AP) – General Motors says second-quarter profit fell 85 percent as recall costs chopped $1.5 billion from the bottom line.

The automaker posted a net profit of $190 million, or 11 cents per share, including restructuring and recall-related expenses. A year ago GM made $1.26 billion, or 75 cents per share.

Without one-time items GM would have made 58 cents per share, equaling Wall Street’s expectations.

So far this year GM has recalled almost 30 million vehicles, a company record.

“We remain focused on keeping our customers at the center of all we do, and executing our plan to operate profitably in every region of the world,” CEO Mary Barra said in a statement.

GM took a number of pretax charges tied to the recalls. They Include $400 million to compensate victims of ignition-switch related crashes; $874 million to account for recall expenses during the next 10 years; and $1.2 billion for recalls announced during the quarter. The after-tax impact of those items was $1.5 billion.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — A proposed supermarket takeover involving Vons’ parent company took a step toward approval after Safeway shareholders voted Friday to accept a $9.2 billion purchase offer from Albertsons.

During a meeting near San Francisco, 96 percent of Safeway shareholders voted to accept the proposal, which would create the nation’s second-largest supermarket chain, according to the San Jose Mercury News, sending it on to federal regulators. Kroger, which owns and operates Ralphs stores in California, would still be larger than the combined chains.

Albertsons has 181 stores in Southern California while Safeway operates 279 Vons locations. Albertsons has not indicated what it plans to do regarding store locations or names if the purchase is approved, but the Federal Trade Commission could order the retailer to sell some of its stores to other competitors, the Mercury News reported.

Traditional supermarkets continue to face pressure from both big-box stores and specialty grocers, according to analysts who follow the sector.

_____________________________________

At what point does a fun shopping habit become a debt-causing addiction? Are you a compulsive shopper? A ClearPoint credit counselor would recommend that you ask yourself the following questions:

Do you shop as a means of relieving stress or escaping everyday problems?

When you are shopping, do you experience feelings of euphoria and excitement?

Do you feel guilty or remorseful afterwards?

Do you ever hide your purchases from relatives and loved ones?

Do you buy more than one of the same item, and keep items in your closet with the tags still attached?

Is your shopping habit causing emotional stress, financial debt or ruined credit in your life?

If you answered “yes” to more than one of these questions, you may be a compulsive spender. The first step in changing a compulsive spending behavior is admitting or recognizing that it exists. First identify the root cause of this behavior, and then resolve to address it.

Often, the source of compulsive spending patterns has its roots in early childhood. A parent or role model may exhibit the characteristics of a compulsive spender listed above. These behavior patterns can carry over into adulthood as a way to compensate for feelings of insecurity.

Various social and cultural factors reinforce the addictive potential of shopping and spending, and the impending debt that can follow. Credit counselors note that the availability of credit cards and the general focus on material possession and aesthetics in our society both contribute.

So why do it? Some people shop to improve their mood. They get a “high” or a “rush” from buying things, and they often buy items in bulk. They view spending as a thrill or a challenge. Others spend as a way to compensate for a lack of emotional support. Low self-esteem and depression are somehow temporarily erased during a shopping trip, only to return soon afterwards.

Numerous problems can occur from a compulsive shopping behavior. This behavior not only affects the compulsive shopper themselves, but can also affect important personal relationships. For example, if a family member or friend begins to complain about their spending habits, the compulsive shopper will often start to hide their purchases. Eventually, feelings of stress and resentment build towards concerned loved ones. If confronted, they often deny that a problem exists.

One of the greatest consequences of a compulsive shopping behavior is the toll it can take on their financial situation. Credit card debt is often a central part of the issue. While credit cards themselves do not cause compulsive shopping, they make it easy for undisciplined spenders to get into trouble. Many have low credit ratings due to the inability to pay their bills. Financial debt can result in legal, social, and relationship issues as well. Others resort to borrowing money, and some decide to take on a second job to help pay multiple credit card balances and mounting debt.

Start by recognizing that spending is a deliberate act, and consider the stress that debt causes you and your loved ones when you demonstrate this behavior.

Imagine your life without the challenges caused by this compulsive behavior and use this positive image to motivate a change in your lifestyle.

There are many alternatives to spending money that can bring enjoyment to one’s life. Activities such as exercising, listening to music or simply enjoying nature can be relaxing and pleasing.

Find out what other things make you happy and pursue them in your life.

For professional guidance and support, you may decide to seek out the services of a credit counselor to help you get back on track financially.

Below are some other suggestions that will help you take control of your debt situation.

Track your daily spending. Save all your receipts and check them with your monthly bank statement. Always shop with a prepared list. Take only enough money for items on your list, and leave your credit cards at home. Avoid shopping alone or with persons who encourage you to buy things when you’re shopping with them. When facing a buying decision involving two or more choices, discipline yourself to buy only one, no matter how much you like all the options. If you purchase something you do not like or that is unsuitable, take it back immediately. Always show your family your purchases. Avoid hiding any items you buy (except gifts). To help you avoid impulsive buying, set a shopping schedule and do not deviate from it. Join a support group in your community or online. Begin a bill reduction program. Set a goal of paying off all your debts by a certain date.

If your financial situation has suffered because of a compulsive spending habit, it is a good idea to get help from a professional credit counselor. The certified credit counselors at ClearPoint Credit Counseling Solutions can help to get your finances back on track with budgetary advice and paying off debt owed to your creditors.

"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/05/12/gov-browns-budget-plan-expected-to-include-catastrophic-cuts-to-home-care-services/","Gov. Brown’s Budget Plan Expected To Include Catastrophic Cuts To In-Home Care Services","LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Disabled rights activists are concerned the changes Gov. Jerry Brown plans to make to California’s budget Tuesday will include huge cuts to resources for in-home caregivers.

Brown will announce his revised budget plan at noon at the Reagan State Building.

It’s rumored it will include a cap on payments to in-home caregivers that could wreak havoc for some families.

CBS2/KCAL9 political reporter Dave Bryan spoke with SoCal resident Sharon Brady, who’s spent 17 years working as her daughter Lauren’s caregiver. Lauren was born with Rett Syndrome, a debilitating disease that denied her the ability to walk or talk. Through the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program, Brady is paid less than $10 an hour to tend to her daughter.

“Me having random people come in to take care of Lauren to fill those hours, that just doesn’t work for us. It doesn’t work for families like mine,” Brady said.

Brady says she’s anxiously awaiting Brown’s revised budget for the coming fiscal year because it’s rumored to include a 40-hour weekly cap. She says no longer getting paid for overtime would force her to either get outside work and put her daughter in an institution or staying home with her daughter and endure the financial consequences. She says she can’t imagine putting her daughter in an institution.

“For some families, placing their children would be what they’d have to pick. That’s not something I could ever do. So, I’d have to figure out something, but, to be honest with you, I have no idea what that would be,” Brady said through tears.

IHSS Consumers Union co-founder Nancy Becker Kennedy says there is a lot riding on Brown’s plans.

“What the governor has proposed earlier is catastrophic. It will cause misery across the state, it will institutionalize people at many times the cost to the taxpayers, it will break up homes and it will make family members homeless,” Kennedy said. “They must, must, must pay the overtime, or we’ll see public policy of a catastrophic nature that’s going to ruin lives.”

Activists say this new plan for capping payments for in-home care is scheduled to go into effect January 2015. They want to put it on hold in a compromise so this plan could be put into effect January 2016 so they’d have time to iron out the proposal’s reported problems.","2014-05-12 23:32:06","1","57.0","162.0","35.0","0.0","68.0","0.0","221.0","62.0","0.0","507.0","0.0","40.0","37","399","79.38","78.15","7.91","21.90","19.00","21.05","83.71","45.86","12.28","6.27","1.25","0.50","0.25","3.01","1.25","6.02","5.26","15.04","11.03","1.50","3.01","1.50","20.80","3.26","1.75","1.00","1.25","1.50","2.51","1.00","1.25","0.50","0.00","0.75","11.78","2.26","0.00","4.01","0.25","9.77","1.25","2.51","2.76","2.26","1.00","2.01","3.01","0.75","2.26","0.00","0.75","0.00","0.75","0.00","0.00","8.52","2.26","2.76","2.26","0.75","0.50","2.76","12.53","3.76","13.78","3.01","6.52","4.26","6.52","1.00","2.76","3.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.30","5.51","4.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.50","2.01","4.51","1.00","0.50","1843","7.9","20.85","551","392","22","70.33","9.9","7.9","11.13","10.8","84","6.214285714285714","17.69142857142857","238","19.35","10","0.45","0","7","5","29","0","39","18","1","0","17","61","44","1","27","0","0","24","8","8","2","0","3","19","0","33","11","11","11","12","16","5","4","0","0"
"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/05/21/cbs2-investigates-lax-among-nations-top-3-for-airport-complaints/","CBS2 Investigates: LAX Among Nation’s Top 3 For Airport Complaints","LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — This summer is shaping up to be one of the busiest travel seasons ever, and that can spell out problems at airports.

CBS2 investigative reporter David Goldstein has obtained a database of every 2013 complaint filed about Los Angeles International Airport with the federal government.

More than 10,000 complaints were filed about every airport in the world to the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Luggage problems tend to be one of the biggest issues travelers have with LAX.

“When we had gotten here, there was one piece of luggage and it took three hours to get the other one. I was pissed,” LAX traveler Cheyanne Cranmer said.

Not the welcome she and her boyfriend, Jamal, expected when they landed from Philadelphia last week.

One person who experienced flight delays with United Airlines at LAX called it “abysmal customer service.”

Another traveler on Aeromexico said: “Picked up my luggage in LAX and, when I got home, the laptop had been stolen.”

Another vacationer flying Air Canada said she “felt racially discriminated” by the attendant at the LAX counter.

So how does LAX rank among airport complaints?

LAX ranks third in the nation, having received 336 complaints in 2013.

Chicago O’Hare placed at second with 409 complaints and JFK is number one with 502.

The top complaint about LAX involved flight problems.

That doesn’t surprise travelers like Gerard Danishek: “It’s always in the back of my mind when I get to the airport, if I’m going to be delayed for mechanical.”

The DOT compiles the data to make sure airlines are in compliance with consumer protection laws. In some instances, a series of complaints can lead to civil charges.

When it comes to airlines at LAX, United received the most complaints with 91 filings. It’s the largest carrier at the airport so it’s likely it would have a higher number.

When asked about the complaint filings, United sent CBS2 the following statement:

“United’s on-time performance, baggage handling and customer satisfaction scores have each improved at Los Angeles International Airport year over year since 2012, with baggage handling up by 25 percent in the last year alone. We have also provided new customer service training to our airport agents and flight attendants to ensure they deliver a better experience for our customers.”

Coming up in second with 69 complaints is American Airlines.

Jeffrey Spring, of AAA, says the number of complaints at LAX are to be expected.

“LAX is one of the busiest airports in the country, so I wouldn’t be surprised to hear that there have been certain issues with some terminals or airlines, especially as we’re coming toward the summer travel season,” Spring said.

He advises air travelers to arrive early, have paperwork ready and make sure luggage is identifiable.

Travelers can file a complaint with the Department of Transportation here.","2014-05-21 23:12:42","1","70.0","162.0","35.0","0.0","68.0","0.0","227.0","61.0","0.0","506.0","0.0","40.0","37","476","90.80","72.87","48.66","8.31","18.31","26.89","77.94","43.07","6.93","3.78","1.47","1.05","0.00","0.84","0.42","3.15","6.72","16.18","7.98","4.62","4.62","0.63","13.66","3.15","2.52","1.68","4.62","2.52","5.67","2.10","3.57","0.00","0.21","0.21","8.40","0.00","0.21","0.63","0.42","7.14","0.63","1.47","1.68","1.26","1.68","1.05","1.89","0.00","1.26","0.21","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.56","1.47","1.47","3.15","1.68","0.84","4.62","8.40","1.05","20.17","5.46","8.82","6.51","4.41","1.89","0.21","1.26","0.00","0.00","0.42","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.60","5.88","4.41","0.63","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.21","2.94","1.89","0.42","0.00","2315","8.08","22.045454545454547","696","473","28","62.78","10.6","8.7","12.35","11.3","108","6.0","17.89319238900634","265","20.59","27","0.43","0","9","19","40","0","63","24","3","4","4","70","56","2","35","0","0","20","5","12","0","1","4","14","0","17","23","7","16","13","13","1","1","0","7"
"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/05/23/la-city-council-orders-investigation-into-street-repair-crews-following-cbs2-investigation/","LA City Council Orders Investigation Into Street Repair Crews Following CBS2 Investigation","LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — The Los Angeles City Council Friday ordered an investigation into city street repair crews who allegedly took unauthorized breaks and falsified their work logs.

The move comes following a report Tuesday by CBS2 investigative journalist David Goldstein, who followed several crews as they went about their work day repairing potholes.

Two different Bureau of Street Services crews were seen working only a portion of the hours they claimed in their work logs and that they didn’t mention the breaks they took, Goldstein said.

“Nothing can be more corrosive to the public trust than what Mr. Goldstein uncovered,” City Councilman Mitch O’Farrell said Friday.

The councilmember says that if the allegations are proven true, those employees should not be working for the city.

Councilman Joe Buscaino, who introduced an emergency motion calling for the investigation, said the report “angered” him because it may taint the reputation of “dedicated, hardworking and highly skilled” city workers. “This may reinforce the stereotypes of lazy, dishonest government employees, which is 100 percent false for the vast, vast majority of our public servants.”

Buscaino’s motion was adopted unanimously and instructs the BSS to look into the allegations, including how they currently assign jobs, estimate the time and manpower each project takes and verify the work is done.

BSS director Nazario Sauceda called the accusations “ugly” and asked that the council to give him the necessary time to conduct a thorough probe.

Councilman Felipe Fuentes said the report came at an inopportune moment when the city is trying to persuade voters to adopt a half-cent sales tax increase to pay for street repairs, as well airing in the middle of National Public Works Week.

_____________________________________

It’s time to plan the family’s summer getaway. You’re probably focused on choosing a destination, deciding how to get there and anticipating the fun your family will have. That fun is likely to end with financial regrets, however, if you don’t budget properly.

Don’t let a burden of debt displace your happy vacation memories. Lingering vacation-related bills can have a ripple effect on your household budget for months to come.

Know in advance how much money you will need to cover your travel, food, lodging, entertainment and other vacation expenses. Save that money up-front, and you won’t return home to money worries.

Here are tips from experts at ClearPoint Credit Counseling Solutions on how to budget for a relaxing vacation that won’t end in a financial dilemma.

Create a budget for your trip. Get your partner or family members involved in planning what to do on vacation. Once you reach agreement on activities you all can enjoy, you can determine the cost of the vacation and build a budget. In addition to transportation expenses, don’t forget to figure in the cost of food and lodging. A 2007 survey by the AAA estimates a family of four (two adults, two children) can expect to pay an average of $269 per day for food and lodging.

Save your pennies. You may need to sacrifice a few luxuries in the short-term to save for that long-awaited vacation. Cut back on restaurant meals, impulse shopping and other unnecessary expenditures. Borrow videos from the library instead of going to the movies. Pack your lunch and take it to work. Carpool or use public transportation for a few weeks. Those savings will help fund meals and activities on your vacation.

Calculate fuel expenses. If you plan to drive during your vacation, factor in rising gas prices. Use AAA’s If you plan to drive during your vacation, factor in rising gas prices. Use AAA’s Fuel Cost Calculator to determine how much you can expect to pay for fuel during your trip. While on the road, keep in mind that gas prices may vary within only a few blocks. Consult money-saver websites, such as www.GasBuddy.com or www.GasPriceWatch.com , to find nearby gas stations with the cheapest prices.

Fly smart. If you’re planning to fly, reserve your flights a month or more in advance of your travel date for the best fares. This is particularly important if you plan to use frequent flyer miles to pay for your tickets. Check out surrounding airports to see if they offer better fares than your direct destination. When packing, adhere to the airline weight limits to avoid being assessed luggage fees.

Be an early bird. You can save money by planning ahead. Last-minute vacations can wreak havoc on the savings account and the day-to-day household budget. Wait too late and all of the bargain flights and hotel rooms will already be taken.

Use the Web. Trustworthy travel websites, such as www.Expedia.com, Trustworthy travel websites, such as www.Travelocity.com www.Hotels.com and others, can make it easy to compare rates for air travel, lodging and rental cars. If hotels appear outside your price range, consider renting an apartment, or booking rooms at a lodge, guesthouse or motel. Members of AAA can book special travel deals at www.aaa.com

Be flexible. You don’t have to visit an expensive tourist attraction to have an enjoyable vacation. Check out less-popular destinations for great travel deals. In addition, you’ll pay more for travel during peak tourist seasons. If your children are pre-school age, consider delaying your vacation until autumn to take advantage of off-season rates.

Ask about discounts. Some auto clubs and other membership organizations offer discounts on motels, travel and tourist attractions. You may be able to use a local coupon booklet to get a reduced price on a restaurant meal, a museum outing or an admissions park.

Use credit cards wisely. If you travel outside the country, keep in mind that many credit card companies assess surcharges on overseas purchases. Those extra costs can add up over the course of a vacation. One way to avoid surcharges is to use bank-issued gift cards or traveler’s checks. If you do use your credit card during vacation, only make purchases that you can afford to pay off when the next bill comes due.

SEATTLE (AP) — Chris Young pitched shutout ball until Albert Pujols homered in the seventh inning, Robinson Cano had three hits and two RBIs to raise his average to .332, and the Seattle Mariners beat the Angels 5-1 on Monday.

After manager Lloyd McClendon lamented Seattle’s production following losses over the weekend to Houston, the Mariners responded with five runs in the first two innings off Tyler Skaggs (4-2). Seattle scored three unearned runs with two outs in the second.

Young (4-2) kept the Angels without a hit until Kole Calhoun’s single with one out in the sixth inning. An inning later, Pujols hit his 506th career home run, pulling within three of Gary Sheffield for 24th on baseball’s all-time homer list.

Young lasted only two more batters after Pujols’ homer, getting pulled after issuing a walk to Raul Ibanez. He struck out five and walked three.

But Young’s strong pitching at Safeco Field continued. In four starts at home this season, Young is 2-0 with a 1.65 ERA.

It was a solid rebound for Young, who got knocked around in losing his previous two starts. He gave up 10 hits and five runs in losing to Minnesota and allowed four runs and seven hits in a loss to Texas last week.

The top three hitters in Seattle’s order did the damage against Skaggs. James Jones scored twice, and Michael Saunders tripled, singled and scored two runs.

Cano singled in each of his first three at-bats a day after his streak of reaching base ended at 31 games.

Skaggs wasn’t helped by his defense in the second inning when shortstop Erick Aybar couldn’t handle Jones’ one-hopper with two outs. The miscue allowed Dustin Ackley to score and opened the door for two more runs on Saunders’ triple and Cano’s infield single.

Despite the early trouble, Skaggs threw seven innings and struck out eight.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — A Marina del Rey man has been convicted on charges related to a rapidly-growing high-tech crime known as synthetic identity theft, according to an exclusive KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO report.

KNX 1070’s Charles Feldman reports the prosecution is believed to be a first for Los Angeles and only the second such prosecution in the nation.

'Synthetic' ID Theft Emerging As Fastest-Growing Type Of Consumer Fraud

Synthetic identity theft occurs when thieves create new identities either by combining real and fake identifying information to establish new accounts with fictional identities, or create a brand new identity from fake or inaccurate information, according to credit reporting agency Experian.

Since perpetrators of synthetic ID theft will only use a stolen Social Security number – the only piece of information that matches the “real” person – the crime can often go undetected for years.

“It’s almost like a ghost is committing these crimes,” said prosecutor Warren Kato with the District Attorney’s Office.

Synthetic identity theft is the fastest-growing type of ID fraud in the U.S. and has already surpassed “true-name” identity fraud, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which estimated it currently accounts for up to 85 percent of all identity fraud.

Earlier this year, Deon Mimbs plead guilty to withdrawing almost $2 million in bank withdrawals using fake business and personal identities.

“He did this a number of times, in effect creating a small army of synthetic identities,” Kato said. “He used these identities to form fake companies, he used ‘the army’ to create fake customers who would generate fake charges for these companies.

In order to avoid becoming a victim of synthetic ID theft, consumers are urged to check their annual Social Security statement to ensure their reported income figure is not over-inflated from what was actually earned, and to be on the lookout for mail that is sent to your home address with another person’s name.","2014-06-19 08:50:00","1","26.0","93.0","4.0","0.0","42.0","2.0","131.0","36.0","0.0","299.0","0.0","6.0","11","382","95.59","66.24","18.89","21.74","31.83","28.53","68.06","36.91","6.28","2.88","1.05","0.00","0.26","0.79","0.79","3.40","6.54","14.66","6.02","2.62","2.62","0.26","10.21","5.50","1.83","1.05","2.88","1.31","5.24","2.36","2.62","0.52","0.00","0.00","6.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.05","8.64","2.88","2.88","0.26","1.31","0.79","1.31","1.31","0.79","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.54","0.52","2.09","3.14","0.52","0.79","3.66","4.45","0.26","11.52","1.83","4.19","5.76","7.85","0.00","0.52","3.14","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.80","3.93","3.93","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.83","3.14","2.09","1.57","0.79","1923","9.3","32.166666666666664","617","375","14","44.27","16.6","13.7","14.16","17.3","103","8.1","23.706666666666667","237","28.25","17","0.34","0","8","9","32","1","40","31","0","1","3","65","71","0","21","0","0","5","4","10","1","0","0","16","0","12","9","14","12","3","13","2","2","0","1"

CHICAGO (AP) — In the middle of a tough stretch of games, Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia did not want to be forced to play a doubleheader.

“At some point you’re going to have to play the stretch like we’re in now, 20 straight, and you want to play,” Scioscia said before the Angels game against the White Sox on Monday night was postponed due to heavy rains and rescheduled as part of a traditional doubleheader on Tuesday. “A doubleheader does not benefit anyone at any time.”

The storm hit U.S. Cellular Field just after scheduled first pitch. The postponement was announced at 7:30 p.m.

The first game Tuesday afternoon will start at 4:10 p.m. CDT with Chicago’s Hector Noesi (2-5, 5.07) going against Los Angeles’ Garrett Richards (8-2, 2.76), who were slated to start Monday night.

Scott Carroll (2-4, 4.76) will go for the White Sox against the Angels’ Jered Weaver (8-6, 3.33) in the second game.

Los Angeles slugger Albert Pujols was in Monday night’s starting lineup set to hit third and play first base one day after he pulled up lame with a groin injury during a loss to the Royals. Pujols, who was limited to only 99 games last season, remained in that game.

The postponement also gives White Sox manager Robin Ventura an extra day to sort out his bullpen. Ventura removed Ronald Belisario from the closer role on Friday after the reliever allowed two runs in the ninth inning to Toronto and has failed to find a permanent ninth inning pitcher since Matt Lindstrom’s ankle injury in May.

“The way the bullpen is right now, we’re going to by usage, matchups and just the feeling of who you want in there at that time,” Ventura said on Monday. “You don’t know on a daily basis who you’re going to use in which spots.”

NOTES: White Sox 1B Jose Abreu, tied for the MLB lead in homers with 25, has found himself at the center of Home Run Derby speculation, but the rookie slugger remained mysterious on his possible participation. “I’m more concentrated on helping the team right now,” Abreu said. . Angels SP Garrett Richards has allowed 4 ER over his last five starts and carries a 4-0 record in that span. . Tyler Skaggs will start the series finale on Wednesday for Los Angeles. He will face John Danks (7-6, 4.26).

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt is asking a judge to order his ex-wife to pay him nearly $2 million in legal fees after she contested their divorce settlement.

McCourt’s attorneys are seeking $1.94 million in fees spent fighting a motion by Jamie McCourt to throw out a divorce settlement that gave her $131 million and several pieces of property.

A judge rejected the motion in September.

Frank McCourt’s attorneys argue in a motion filed Thursday in Los Angeles that the attempt to undo the settlement was baseless and required the work of more than a dozen highly-specialized attorneys.

A phone message left for Jamie McCourt’s attorney Bert Fields was not immediately returned.

The divorce was finalized in 2010, and the team was sold in 2012 for $2 billion.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sandra Fluke, who gained national attention when she testified before Congress in favor of requiring that employer-provided health insurance cover birth control, plans to run for the state Senate.

The Los Angeles Times says Fluke will seek the seat held by Ted Lieu, a Torrance Democrat. He has announced he’ll run for the seat of retiring Congressman Henry Waxman.

Fluke was considering seeking Waxman’s seat but told the Times she thinks she’d accomplish more in the Legislature.

Fluke, a Democrat, was an unmarried Georgetown University law student in 2012 when she testified before Congress. That led radio commentator Rush Limbaugh to brand her a “slut” and a “prostitute.” After a national uproar, he later apologized.

Fluke moved to California after graduating, passed the bar and has been active on issues including foster care and living wages.

"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/02/04/secretary-of-state-sued-over-criminals-voting/","Secretary Of State Sued Over Criminals’ Voting","SACRAMENTO (AP) — Voting and civil liberties groups sued Secretary of State Debra Bowen on Tuesday over a decision she made in 2011 that said tens of thousands of criminals who are serving their sentences under community supervision are ineligible to vote.

The American Civil Liberties Union, League of Women Voters, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and other groups filed the lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on behalf of nearly 60,000 convicts who are sentenced either to mandatory supervision or post-release community supervision.

It’s the second lawsuit challenging Bowen’s interpretation of the 2011 criminal justice realignment law, which is designed to ease overcrowding in state prisons by sentencing those convicted of less serious crimes to county jails or alternative treatment programs.

The first lawsuit included those serving time in county jails and sought an expedited hearing from the 1st District Court of Appeal in San Francisco. It would have allowed locally incarcerated felons to vote in the June 2012 primary election.

The initial attempt died when both the state appellate court and the California Supreme Court declined to hear the case, without comment.

As a result, “the Secretary of State’s reading of the law stands,” Bowen spokeswoman Nicole Winger said in an email.

Winger said she could not comment further on pending litigation.

Both lawsuits argue that state law prohibits voting only by people who are in state prison or on parole. California already allows voting by those on county-supervised probation.

The latest lawsuit contends that the two new forms of community supervision were intended “as innovative community-based alternatives to parole,” with alternatives emphasized in italics. Felons under those programs are supervised by county employees, not state parole agents.

The 2011 memo written by Bowen’s chief legal counsel to county elections officials said it does not matter if felons’ supervision “is labeled something other than ‘parole.’ ”

The lawsuit says Bowen’s decision undermines the intent of the realignment law, which was pushed by Gov. Jerry Brown in response to federal court orders. The law also encourages rehabilitation, leading the plaintiffs to say in their lawsuit that participating in society by voting should be a part of that effort.

They also say Bowen issued the policy without going through proper legal procedures.

Several of the groups were plaintiffs in both lawsuits, including the nonprofit Legal Services for Prisoners with Children and its affiliated voter-education program called All of Us or None.

"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/02/04/report-reveals-millions-in-taxpayer-dollars-spent-on-salaries-for-lapd-union-officers/","Report Reveals Millions In Taxpayer Dollars Spent On Salaries For LAPD Union Officers","LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — The L.A. City Council has come under questioning amid reports it approved the spending of millions in taxpayer dollars to pay the salaries of nine LAPD officers working full-time for the union that represents them.

Southern California public radio station KPCC first reported taxpayers are paying a $750,000 bill every year for the officers, who work at the Los Angeles Police Protective League.

KCAL9’s Dave Lopez reports the union was initially tasked with reimbursing the city for the salaries, but that changed three years ago when the contract was renegotiated and the City Council voted to waive the fee.

City Councilman Bernard Parks urged a “no” vote on the change, made on July 1, 2011.

“It was in my judgement that it was one of those issues that should never have been given back,” Parks said.

Nevertheless, the City Council voted to approve the provision by 11-1.

Mayor Eric Garcetti, a city councilman at the time, was among those who voted “yes”.

He defended his vote in a written statement to KCAL9 on Tuesday.

“This was one part of a complex and mulch-faceted negotiation, that at the end of the day resulted in a contract where the sum of its parts saved many millions of dollars and contained significant pension reforms,” Garcetti stated.

L.A City Councilman Paul Koretz said echoed his defense.

“Overall it was a contract that was very favorable to the city,” Koretz said.

L.A. City Councilman Mitch Englander says the controversial contract now raises a bigger question, however.

“That could very well be the case,” he said in regards to Garcetti’s comments.

“I would like to see that information and will ask those questions,” he continued, noting, “The bigger comes in: how many more of these [contracts] are like that?”

A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Protective League would only say in a written statement that the union is in “full compliance with terms of the agreement”. The spokesperson declined to comment further.

The next chance to contest the provision is in July, when the currant contract expires.","2014-02-04 18:11:18","1","63.0","159.0","35.0","0.0","67.0","0.0","222.0","62.0","0.0","498.0","0.0","40.0","37","353","95.39","73.34","25.22","41.11","18.58","25.21","78.47","44.48","8.50","2.27","0.57","0.00","0.00","1.42","0.28","6.23","12.18","12.46","5.95","3.68","2.83","0.57","12.75","2.27","1.42","1.70","3.68","1.42","1.98","1.42","0.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.42","6.80","1.98","1.70","1.13","1.42","0.57","0.85","2.83","0.28","2.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.52","1.42","0.85","3.12","0.00","1.13","6.80","4.25","0.28","16.15","1.13","9.92","5.38","6.23","0.28","0.00","3.12","0.00","0.00","0.57","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.28","0.00","19.83","6.23","5.10","0.28","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.85","5.10","0.57","0.57","0.85","1653","7.92","22.1875","492","346","19","69.92","11.2","8.0","12.13","11.6","74","8.6","17.83491329479769","201","20.19","15","0.42","0","5","10","49","0","39","10","3","0","5","48","57","0","19","0","0","9","4","12","0","0","1","9","0","12","28","5","8","3","9","4","2","0","4"
"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/02/02/addiction-expert-weighs-in-on-hoffmans-death/","Addiction Expert Weighs In On Hoffman’s Death","HOLLYWOOD (CBSLA.com) — Family, friends and fans of Philip Seymour Hoffman are reeling Sunday from the news of the 46-year-old actor’s death from an apparent drug overdose in New York City.

His passing has raised questions about his addiction, something he candidly struggled with for many years.

The Oscar-winning actor got clean in his early 20s and stayed sober for years. After relapsing, Hoffman checked himself into rehab last year.

Dr. Joseph Haraszti has treated many celebrities struggling with drug and alcohol addiction.

“Heroin addiction or opiate addiction or alcohol addiction is a life-long struggle. It’s a life-long battle against that addiction,” the psychologist and addictionologist said.

Haraszti says he’s saddened by the actor’s death, but understands how the actor may have relapsed.

“Actually, a lot of people start using heroin because, in a sense, it’s easier to obtain and cheaper than prescription drugs,” the doctor said.

Haraszti says it’s possible Hoffman’s tolerance for the drug was lower than when he was actively using.

“If a person takes enough opiates, like heroin, they will stop breathing, which causes respiratory arrest, and that, in turn, progresses to cardiac arrest, which causes death,” Haraszti said. “I think [celebrities] are more susceptible to that because of the stress.”

Years, ago, Hoffman was speaking about his role in “Capote” — for which he won an Academy Award – when he acknowledged the intensity of his job: “It’s very challenging, but very satisfying.”

“Because [celebrities] are so visible, we see them, but [addiction] happens to a lot of people who are anonymous,” Haraszti said.

The doctor said that, even after long periods of sobriety, people who struggle with addiction can be one drink or drug away from possible death.","2014-02-02 23:04:01","0","59.0","159.0","35.0","0.0","67.0","0.0","217.0","62.0","0.0","498.0","0.0","40.0","37","287","81.37","76.78","9.81","31.72","19.13","25.78","84.32","43.21","10.10","5.23","0.35","0.35","0.00","3.83","0.70","4.88","6.62","12.89","6.97","3.48","6.97","0.00","14.29","4.53","3.14","2.79","0.70","1.74","5.23","2.79","2.44","1.74","0.35","0.35","11.15","0.35","0.35","0.00","3.83","10.80","1.74","2.79","0.35","3.83","0.35","3.83","3.83","0.70","2.79","0.00","8.71","0.35","8.01","0.00","1.05","8.01","1.05","1.74","4.53","2.09","0.35","4.18","8.71","0.70","11.50","1.05","4.53","6.27","2.44","3.83","0.35","0.35","0.00","1.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","27.18","5.92","8.71","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.74","4.88","2.79","0.70","2.09","1425","8.58","22.692307692307693","427","284","15","60.75","12.2","9.5","13.92","13.4","72","5.428571428571429","19.700845070422535","171","20.69","3","0.43","0","12","3","21","0","38","19","3","0","3","55","26","0","15","0","0","14","5","11","1","0","0","4","0","5","19","7","4","8","14","3","2","0","3"

INGLEWOOD (CBSLA.com) — A woman said her grandson was suspended last week for protesting the Inglewood Unified School District’s spending of tens of thousands of dollars on a retreat for its employees.

CBS2’s Joy Benedict reported that the cash-strapped district, which was taken over by the state in 2012 and given a $55 million loan, sent principals and administrators to the Estancia La Jolla Hotel and Spa in San Diego at a cost of more than $38,000.

The revelation sparked outrage at Inglewood High School, where multiple student-led protests and walk-outs were held.

Rosa Brown’s grandson, Quioness Wilson, helped organize the protests.

“When they heard the news report, they were very upset,” she said.

Brown said Wilson was suspended last Thursday.

“They have him on camera. He was talking to channel 2,” she said.

Brown, her grandson and other students attended a closed-door meeting Monday morning with Dr. Don Brann, the district’s state-appointed superintendent.

After the meeting, Wilson’s suspension was revoked and it won’t appear on his record.

Meantime, Brann assured the students that he has made changes. He said the San Diego junket was planned by Education Services, a department which includes one of his assistant superintendents.

“I’ve taken away the signature power from the assistant superintendents here, so everything will come through me,” he said.

Also, Brann said he found a trip for administrators planned for Las Vegas, which he cancelled.

Brann plans to eliminate the three assistant superintendent positions at the end of the school year.

“We will also be taking personnel actions in response to it,” he said.

"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/03/12/can-i-pay-for-contacts-or-glasses-with-my-health-insurance/","Can I Pay For Contacts Or Glasses With My Health Insurance?","Routine adult vision care and prescription eyeglasses are not one of the essential benefits required under the Affordable Care act (ACA). The law does require eye care coverage for children (those younger than 19) in all individual and small group policies as preventive care.

Adult vision care

Some health plans offered in the health insurance exchanges may include coverage for eye exams, glasses and contact lenses, but this coverage is not required for a plan to be classified as a Qualifying Health Plan (QHP). Stand-alone vision policies, ones that are not part of a comprehensive health plan, are not offered in the health insurance marketplace.

If you have health insurance through your employer, you may have vision care coverage. Often employers offer vision care in a stand-alone policy. Check your policy documents or ask the director in your company’s Human Resources department about the availability of coverage for eyeglasses and contacts.

If you are insured through the Medicaid program, the odds are you do have coverage for glasses. The coverage varies by state, but most states include eyeglasses in their Medicaid benefits package. Each state has its own limitations. For example, the Connecticut Medicaid program will only cover new glasses every two years. Some states require a small co-payment for glasses.

Pediatric vision care

To be compliant with the ACA, vision care for children must be included in a health plan’s coverages. As a preventive care service, insurers cannot require a co-pay, co-insurance or deductible for pediatric vision care. Grandfathered plans, those in effect prior to implementation of the new law, are not required to offer pediatric vision care, although many do.

Children who are insured by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) will have coverage for exams and glasses, although limits vary by state. CHIP is administered by the states in partnership with the federal government, and each state determines its levels of coverage for eyeglasses. Visit the InsureKidsNow.gov website to locate insurance programs for children in your state.

FULLERTON (CBSLA.com) — Police in Fullerton are warning parents about a rash of “sexting” among local students, in which they exchange lewd photos on their cell phones.

Over the past month, Fullerton police have found the lewd photos on the phones of three boys, including a junior high school student who was allegedly molested by eighth-grade teacher Melissa Lindgren, according to Fullerton police Sgt. Jeff Stuart.

Lindgren, 28, of La Mirada, was booked last month on suspicion of molesting at least one student. She was released after posting $10,000 bail and has not been charged.

In another incident, school officials alerted police after a girl sent nude photos of herself to a boy, Stuart said.

Stuart told KNX 1070 NEWSRADIO young children may not realize the serious privacy violation that sexting can pose.

“The reality is, it’s never private,” he said. “Once you put something out there, it’s there for other individuals.”

Sending a nude photo of a minor could lead to criminal charges, according to Stuart, who advises parents to obtain software that allows them to monitor their child’s cellphone and Internet activity.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Officials with the Los Angeles Police Commission are getting their first wave of feedback on a pilot program to test the use of body cameras on police officers.

KNX 1070’s Ed Mertz reports the LAPD is now 60 days into the first field test of the on-body camera project.

Police Officials Get First Feedback On LAPD On-Body Cameras

About 30 officers volunteered for 90-day trials of the devices provided by Arizona-based Taser International Inc. and Coban Technologies Inc. of Houston, according to the Associated Press.

Each company has donated 60 of its units for the field test. At the end of the trial, 600 cameras from one of the companies will be purchased and deployed, Police Commission President Steve Soboroff said in January.

Soboroff solicited $1.2 million in funding for the trial from Hollywood luminaries such as director Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, along with former mayor Richard Riordan, media giant Casey Wasserman and the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Associated Press reported.

LAPD Sgt. Dan Gomez told commissioners the impact of the on-body cameras was recently seen when a supervisor who was dealing with an escalating situation at a police station called over a sergeant, who was being trained with a camera.

“When he arrived, he explained to the person who was escalating that he had a camera, he noticed he had a camera…all of a sudden, the whole thing started to de-escalate,” Gomez said. “They were able to deal with whatever the situation was and no additional enforcement action was needed.”

After the current initial first round of testing is completed, a new 90-day trial is scheduled to begin with a second product.

Officials are expected to make their selection of a camera system by sometime this summer.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson weighed in Friday on a report that the Inglewood Unified School District spent thousands on a weekend junket in San Diego for administrators to discuss changes in the curriculum.

“It wasn’t necessary to do it in La Jolla. That’s the point. The retreat could have been done on campus somewhere,” Torlakson said.

KCAL9’s Dave Lopez reported that the cash-strapped district, which was taken over by the state in 2012 and given a $55 million loan, sent principals and administrators to the Estancia La Jolla Hotel and Spa at a cost of more than $38,000.

Don Brann, the state trustee who runs the district on behalf of the state, said he didn’t know about the junket. By the time he found out, it was too late to cancel.

Torlakson said he has complete trust and faith in Brann, who he said is doing the best job possible.

“It won’t happen again. I believe Don has put the internal controls on. He has to sign off on everything. And he’s got a clear message from my office that this is not appropriate,” he said. “I trust his judgment moving forward in many, many key decisions in the district. The district has been turning around in the right direction under his leadership.”

Meantime, Inglewood High School students continued to protest Friday about the way the district spent its money.

Five students also met behind closed doors with various department heads at district headquarters to air out their differences.

Earlier this week, police thwarted a planned student walk-out at the school.

First, U.S.-backed Syrian rebels were routed by al-Qaida-affiliated groups from a stronghold in northeastern Syria.

Next, al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State joined forces to gain territory and battle the Assad regime.

More recently, Turkish leaders signaled that a policy aimed at removing Syrian President Bashar Assad would result in access to Turkish bases and the commitment of Turkish ground troops to fight IS.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-primary-local-races-20140826-story.html","Thompson wins second term on Orange County Commission","In a primary marked by low turnout, Orange County voters elected Commissioner Jennifer Thompson to a second term Tuesday and sent two other commission races to Nov. 4 runoffs.

Thompson will represent District 4 in southeast Orange County for another four years. She cruised to victory over political newcomers Euri Cerrud and Maribel Cordero. Thompson received more than 65 percent of the vote. Cordero won 23 percent and Cerrud 11 percent.

Her resounding win indicates Thompson didn't suffer any lasting damage in the so-called ""textgate"" scandal. She paid a $500 civil fine in the case after State Attorney Jeff Ashton found that she and other officials violated Florida's open-records law as they worked to defeat a sick-time referendum in 2012.

In District 2, State Rep. Bryan Nelson has the edge to replace term-limited Orange County Commissioner Fred Brummer. He received just under 49 percent of the vote, not quite enough to avoid a runoff. Nelson, R-Apopka, will face Eatonville Town Councilman Alvin Moore in November. Moore was the second-place finisher with about 18.5 percent of the vote.

Rounding out the field were probation officer Patricia Rumph, 18 percent; attorney Greg Jackson, 10 percent; and former Navy officer Prince Brown, 4 percent.

The seat represents the northwest area of the county around Lake Apopka.

""I sure would have liked to have finished it off,"" Nelson said. ""We'll take a few days off and then we'll get back to the trenches. We're ready to go for November.""

Voters in District 6 chose Victoria Siplin and Derrick ""Shine"" Wallace to advance from a six-candidate field to the November runoff. The winner will succeed term-limited Commissioner Tiffany Moore Russell.

Siplin, wife of former State Sen. Gary Siplin, topped the field with about 29 percent of the vote. Wallace, a contractor, garnered 21 percent, followed by Metroplan official Virginia Whittington with 18 percent, attorney Roberta Walton with 15 percent, former Commissioner Homer Hartage with 12 percent and community activist Lawanna Gelzer with 6 percent.

District 6 includes the Parramore and Pine Hills neighborhoods, MetroWest and the Millenia area.

Outgoing District 6 County Commissioner Moore Russell, meanwhile, emerged victorious in the Democratic primary for Orange County Clerk of Court. She handily defeated fellow attorney James ""Jimmy"" Auffant, 69 percent to 31 percent.

The winner takes on Clerk Eddie Fernandez, appointed to the post this year by Gov. Rick Scott following the death of former Clerk Lydia Gardner.

Fernandez had no Republican-primary foe.

Orange County voters also approved an initiative to require employers to provide paid sick-time — but the law will never go into effect.

After Orange County activists succeeded in placing the measure on the local ballot, the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature passed a bill that Gov. Rick Scott signed into law, preventing local communities from passing their own laws on mandatory sick time.

""It was gratifying to hear the voters raise their voice in support of earned sick time at the ballot box. But the victory is bittersweet for hardworking Orange County families,"" said Stephanie Porta, executive director of Organize Now, which had pushed for the benefit.

The foes of mandatory paid sick-time included Darden Restaurants, Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando.

Seminole County Commissioner John Horan won a second four-year term on Tuesday, easily defeating political newcomer Jorge Martos.

With all precincts reporting, Horan garnered nearly 74 percent of the votes.

Horan, a retired attorney, said in his second term he wants to make sure that the county continues growing in the urban areas but protects the rural areas.

""The next four years will be about trying to hit that sweet spot where the services that are required to maintain our high quality of life are affordable to our residents,"" Horan said.

And in Osceola County, voters winnowed a field of three Republicans and two Democrats in the race for County Commission in District 2.

Incumbent John ""Q"" Quiñones fended off challenges from former School Board member Julius Melendez and political newcomer David Garcia on the Republican side. Quiñones garnered 54 percent of the vote, enough to avoid a runoff, to 33 percent for Melendez and 13 percent for Garcia.

Quiñones, an attorney, will face Democrat Viviana Janer in November. Janer, a first-time candidate for office who works as auditor for a time-share company, outpolled Romuald Jose Leydon, 79 percent to 21 percent.

District 2 includes the Buenaventura Lakes area near Kissimmee.

Voter turnout was about 18 percent in Seminole County. It was just over 15 percent in Orange and just under 12 percent in Osceola County.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-ed-defending-israel-myword-110914-20141107-story.html","Muslims are their own worst enemy: My Word","Is it any wonder that an overwhelming majority of Americans of all backgrounds continue to support Israel until a more constructive and positive Palestinian Arab leadership emerges to accept the olive branch of peace offered on numerous occasions?

Looking at the conflicts in the world today and since the end of World War II, a significant portion of the deaths, mayhem, destruction and unrest caused have been the result of inter-Muslim disputes. Most notable are the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran; the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq; the Pakistan-Bangladesh conflict; the Syrian, Lebanese, Yemeni and Somali civil wars; intersectarian Muslim violence between Shia and Sunni in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq; inter-Palestinian factionalism; and the decade-long mass violence by Muslim religious extremists during centuries of conflict between Shia and Sunni.

Where Muslims have been at risk of displacement and under attack in Bosnia, Kosovo and Kuwait, their rescue was made possible only by the efforts of the United States.

Yet Douglas Bevins (My Word: ""U.S. should back off support for Israel,"" Orlando Sentinel, Thursday) is apparently only impressed by what he has seen on biased television reporting portraying heartless Israelis evicting innocent Palestinian Arabs, while ""Muslims from all over the world flock to join ISIS,"" a symbol of rejection of the West.

No concern is expressed for ISIS' barbaric nature or how the Egyptian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, a close ally of Palestinian Hamas in Gaza, led to the mass demonstrations of the Egyptian people to depose the Morsi regime.

Handout Norman Berdichevsky Norman Berdichevsky (Handout)

Absent, too, is the dismay of our Jordanian, Saudi and Gulf State allies that the U.S. has chosen to ignore the common threat to all of them (and Israel) from Iranian nuclear ambitions.

There is no ""ethnic cleansing"" in the Middle East — except that perpetrated by Arab Muslim regimes against the Jews, Kurds, Yazidis and Christians.

By contrast, as polls indicate, Israel's flourishing million and a half Arab minority population, whatever legitimate grievances they may have, would not trade their Israeli citizenship for a Palestinian one in any future state. Remember how dozens of their supporters in Gaza were thrown off rooftops by Hamas executioners who displayed the same Palestinian brotherhood toward alleged ""collaborators.""

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/os-election-congress-brown-smith-20141008-story.html","Incumbent Corrine Brown battles Glo Smith for congressional seat","U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown and Republican challenger Glo Smith are battling over a district that has not changed in decades but likely will be redrawn before the next term is over.

Brown, 67, of Jacksonville spent 10 years in the Florida Legislature before running for Congress in 1992. She now is seeking re-election to her 12th term.

She touts her legacy of veterans affairs and transportation work, including helping secure approval and money for construction of the new VA Medical Center in Lake Nona and expansion of facilities in Gainesville and Jacksonville, and expansion of sea ports on the Florida coast.

Brown also is a passionate defender of President Barack Obama and his policies, and a civil-rights advocate who says her presence in recent racially explosive cases in Sanford and Jacksonville gave confidence to her constituents and prevented violence.

""You saw what happened in Ferguson,"" she said of the Missouri case where a black teenager was killed by a white police officer, leading to weeks of unrest. ""We didn't have that in Sanford. It's because of leadership.""

Smith, 50, of Fleming Island is a social-services administrator and small businesswoman making her first run for elected office.

Smith's early childhood was spent in poverty, in Jacksonville public housing, but she grew up watching her mother and stepfather raise the family up financially and move them to a safer neighborhood by starting and running businesses.

It brought Smith to appreciate smaller government, lower taxes and reduced regulations, and the belief that hard work and education are the only answer for the high poverty levels in the 5th district. She advocates widespread entitlement-program reforms to discourage their use.

""These entitlement programs were never designed to strengthen the family. As a matter of fact, they were designed to do the exact opposite,"" Smith said.

Florida's 5th Congressional District is one of the oddest-shaped in the state, created to comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to make sure large minority communities have opportunities to speak as majorities in electing representatives.

The area, to the north, begins with most of Jacksonville. It follows a narrow, meandering path for 250 miles to include Palatka, eastern Gainesville, western Sanford, Zellwood, western Apopka, Forest City, Eatonville, Pine Hills, southwest Orlando and Oak Ridge.

The district is 53 percent African American. Sixty percent of the registered voters are Democrats; 20 percent are Republicans.

Leon County Circuit Judge Terry Lewis this summer ruled that Republicans gerrymandered it to siphon Democrats out of neighboring districts, making them more Republican. Lewis accepted an alternative map that would cut Sanford loose, but deferred that change until the 2016 elections. The case has been appealed to the Florida Supreme Court.

Brown argued that no changes should be made.

""I have the same district I had since 1992, that the federal courts drew,"" Brown said. ""We live in communities not because of gerrymandering. We live in communities because that's where you told me to live, on the other side of the railroad track.""

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-cannon-rpof-meeting-was-needed-to-determine-the-rules-20140528-post.html","Cannon: RPOF meeting was needed to 'determine the rules'","TALLAHASSEE – Former House Speaker Dean Cannon says he sanctioned a secret meeting between legislative employees and Republican operatives because he wanted the 2012 re-drawing of political boundaries to be above reproach.

Cannon, a Winter Park Republican and lobbyist, testified Wednesday in the second week of a trial brought by a coalition alleging the GOP-controlled Legislature broke the law in 2012 when it re-drew congressional maps that still favored Republicans.

Cannon was House speaker when the congressional maps were drawn in an effort to comply with the so-called “Fair Districts” amendments banning the intentional gerrymandering of maps to benefit a party or incumbent.

He was asked by plaintiff lawyer David King repeatedly about a December 2010 meeting between top House redistricting staffers like Alex Kelly – whom Cannon hired to oversee redistricting – House lawyer George Meros, and GOP operatives including Marc Reichelderfer, another Cannon associate tasked with consulting for GOP legislative campaigns.

“I thought it was appropriate to determine … the roles people inside and outside the process would play, because it was new and untested,” Cannon testified.

Reichelderfer testified last week the meeting was held in part so GOP consultants could figure out a way to get “a seat at the table” when legislative and congressional maps were re-drawn, despite the Fair Districts constitutional prohibition.

Although current legislative leaders have testified the consultants were shut out of map-drawing, Reichelderfer was passed along by Cannon aide Kirk Pepper copies of maps drawn by Kelly before they were publicly released – including versions that are almost identical to the final plans passed.

Testimony has shown so far that other maps drawn by Republican Party of Florida director of House campaigns Frank Terraferma also ended up in the hands of another RPOF redistricting consultant Rich Heffley, and were ultimately entered into the public record under the name of a Florida State University engineering student.

Cannon was at the center of opposition to the Fair Districts amendments, which he said Wednesday were “poorly drafted and likely to foment litigation.”

In 2010, he used the power of his office to push a competing ballot question, and personally defended it before the Florida Supreme Court – which ultimately stripped what was then known as Amendment 7 off the ballot.

But Cannon said once the Fair Districts amendments passed, it was his job to implement them and he was “personally and professionally” invested in making sure the Legislature passed constitutional maps on his watch.

The meeting at RPOF headquarters was for the purpose of deciding roles for all the partisan actors who had traditionally been involved in redistricting.

“The purpose was to figure out what this meant,” Cannon said. “I thought it was important that everybody knew what the rules were and how it would be carried out.”

But, he added, political operatives remained involved in the process because his relationship with Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Indialantic, deteriorated to such an extent that they weren’t speaking to each other and needed lobbyists to carry messages.

In one email to Reichelderfer, the lawmaker questions why the Senate would unveil a proposed congressional map without first clearing it with the House.

“Why would they put out a map until we are sure it is one that is acceptable?” he wrote, adding the House needed to be ""comfortable with it.""

Cannon said he wanted to avoid “embarrassing the House” if both chambers unveiled radically different maps.

He also recalled yelling at Pepper, his former aide and current lobbying firm employee, when he learned the staffer had given previously unreleased maps to his GOP campaign consultant.

“My recollection is that I yelled at him and said that was stupid,” Cannon said. “I said that was really dumb and he apologized, and that was it.”

King then asked whether he would have provided those maps without the speaker’s say-so.

“He did do that without my approval,” Cannon answered.

The trial is slated to conclude next week, although it may finish without public access after the Florida Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that GOP firm Data Targeting could shield its emails and documents from public disclosure.

The plaintiffs, including the League of Women Voters, have argued the records are important to making their case, while Data Targeting owner Pat Bainter has argued they are protected trade secrets. On Wednesday, Bainter's firm appealed the Florida decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.","2014-05-28 13:14:00","0","30.0","10.0","3.0","0.0","28.0","2.0","41.0","21.0","0.0","84.0","4.0","17.0","0","730","85.62","76.61","13.01","45.92","27.04","28.22","76.85","45.21","10.00","4.66","0.82","0.14","0.00","2.88","0.82","5.34","7.95","13.15","7.26","2.74","6.03","0.68","14.25","3.56","1.37","2.05","1.37","1.10","4.11","2.60","1.51","0.27","0.82","0.14","11.10","0.00","0.00","0.14","3.15","9.59","2.88","1.92","1.64","0.96","0.55","2.33","2.33","0.14","2.05","0.14","0.55","0.14","0.41","0.00","0.00","8.90","1.10","1.10","6.03","0.68","0.41","9.18","3.42","0.55","12.74","1.37","6.58","4.79","5.89","0.55","1.10","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.14","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.29","3.97","4.11","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","1.10","3.56","0.41","0.00","0.00","3770","8.58","31.91304347826087","1160","728","27","44.07","15.0","13.8","14.22","17.4","166","19.166666666666668","21.92087912087912","363","28.7","16","0.42","0","21","7","68","0","80","52","0","0","8","78","102","6","39","2","0","37","9","25","0","0","4","22","0","24","68","19","26","8","12","5","5","0","7"
"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-cannon-aide-bad-blood-not-bad-intentions-cause-of-lobbyist-involvement-20140520-post.html","Cannon aide: Bad blood, not bad intentions, cause of lobbyist involvement","TALLAHASSEE – A key aide testified Tuesday that bad blood in the Legislature led by two Central Florida lawmakers was the cause of some interesting email and back-channel use of lobbyists – not an underhanded attempt to undermine the 2010 Fair Districts anti-gerrymandering amendments.

Former legislative aide Kirk Pepper testified Tuesday that “distrust” between the House and Senate – and not a grander plan to gerrymander districts – was behind the secret communications with lobbyists in 2011-12.

A group of voting-rights groups has alleged in a two-year court fight that GOP lawmakers intentionally re-designed the congressional maps in 2012 to protect Republican incumbents. The Fair Districts amendments banned redistricting aimed at intentionally helping incumbents or political parties.

Pepper, now a lobbyist with former House Speaker Dean Cannon’s firm, testified that relations between Cannon, R-Winter Park, and then Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Indialantic, were horrible by the end of the 2011 session – leading to a cataclysmic end in the early morning hours after sine die with both chambers blowing up each other’s priorities.

“There was just a lot of discord and distrust between the chambers at the time,” Pepper testified. “There was essentially zero conversations between the Senate President’s Office and the Speaker’s Office.”

That led to concern within his own office about “whether the House can trust that the Senate is going to be honest brokers” in redistricting and other issues. To bridge that, both sides turned to lobbyists – Rich Heffley for the Senate and Marc Reichelderfer for the House – to engage in back-channel communications.

Reichelderfer is at the center of the litigation because he received draft legislative and congressional maps from Pepper weeks before they were released publicly in 2011 – a fact Reichelderfer testified about for more than five hours on Monday.

Reichelderfer testified he and other Republican consultants had wanted “a seat at the table” but were denied one by GOP legislative leaders and their lawyers. He told the court Monday that while he had received maps that closely resembled the final congressional districts adopted – particularly those in Central Florida surrounding the oddly-shaped District 5 seat held by Democrat Corrine Brown – he didn’t draw any maps or have any input into the map-drawing process of the House.

Pepper, the former aide to Cannon, R-Winter Park, testified he had given the draft maps to Reichelderfer, a longtime friend, to give him a “heads up” on the larger “philosophy” of how the House was drawing its maps.

Pepper now works for Cannon's lobbying firm, and testified his boss told him it was ""dumb"" for him to have transmitted the maps to Reichelderfer.

Pepper also testified he had very little involvement in the redistricting process as director of external affairs, and was primarily involved in other legislation and only “looked once or twice” at the Web site the House created to display maps.

The trial will last two weeks, and current House Speaker Will Weatherford is testifying now.","2014-05-20 14:11:00","0","19.0","8.0","3.0","0.0","28.0","2.0","37.0","18.0","0.0","84.0","4.0","17.0","0","495","95.61","66.44","26.17","44.24","30.94","27.47","74.34","42.63","5.86","2.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.42","0.40","3.03","9.49","14.14","5.05","3.43","5.25","0.61","7.88","4.04","1.82","0.40","3.03","2.02","3.43","2.22","1.21","0.20","0.81","0.00","7.47","0.00","0.20","0.00","2.42","6.26","0.40","2.02","0.20","1.41","0.40","2.42","1.21","0.61","0.61","0.00","0.40","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.28","1.62","1.01","4.85","0.00","1.21","5.86","3.43","1.01","16.97","1.41","9.49","6.87","4.24","0.61","1.62","0.40","0.00","0.20","0.81","0.20","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.74","3.23","3.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.42","3.64","1.21","0.00","0.00","2536","8.85","33.4","784","493","16","40.21","15.7","15.3","14.34","19.2","115","18.666666666666668","23.65062880324544","258","30.0","8","0.44","0","19","12","53","0","63","39","2","1","2","54","73","2","40","1","0","12","4","21","0","0","2","15","0","14","35","11","13","2","6","2","0","0","1"

The ABC-owned WLS and Weigel Broadcasting said Tuesday they are teaming up for a new, hourlong newscast weeknights at 7 p.m. on The U.

The live newscasts, which begin Jan. 12, will be anchored by ABC 7's Hosea Sanders and Linda Yu, along with sports anchor Jim Rose and newly added meteorologist Cheryl Scott. ABC 7 will produce the broadcasts, effectively expanding the station's local news coverage by five hours per week.

""It's just a great time period for viewers that can't catch our earlier newscasts,"" said John Idler, president and general manager of ABC 7. ""No other broadcaster is on at 7 p.m., so we have a little bit of running room there.""

The newscast breaks new ground for ABC 7's local news by venturing into prime time and going head-to-head with network programming, including that on ABC 7. It also represents a departure for locally owned WCIU, which features an eclectic mix of sitcoms, reality shows and judge shows throughout its schedule. The newscast will replace ""Tyler Perry's House of Payne,"" which airs during the time slot.

Neal Sabin, vice chairman of Weigel Broadcasting, said employing ABC 7 to add local news to WCIU's programming schedule is beneficial for both stations.

""We've been talking about it for a while and it makes a lot of sense because it's one of the things we don't do that someone else does very well, and they were a natural partner for this,"" Sabin said.

Sanders, a 20-year veteran of ABC 7, will leave his post co-anchoring the station's morning news to move to the prime time newscast. He will be replaced by Terrell Brown, the station said.

Yu will continue to co-anchor the ABC 7 newscast at 4 p.m., adding the 7 p.m. newscast to her duties.

Cheryl Scott, who most recently served as morning and evening weekend meteorologist at NBC-owned WMAQ-Ch. 5, joined ABC 7 on Monday.

WCIU is paying a licensing fee to WLS for the newscast, and will sell advertising within the hour. Sabin said the programming should open the door to new advertisers for WCIU.

""Even if it does the same ratings in the time period we're doing now, it's a win because advertisers pay more for news programming and some advertisers will only buy news programming,"" Sabin said.

Beyond the licensing fee, there is a revenue sharing component to the deal, based on ratings for the newscast, executives said. In November, ""House of Payne"" averaged a 0.9 household rating during the time slot for WCIU, reaching 30,000 homes.

The concept of farming out newscasts is already up and running at ABC-owned stations in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Raleigh, N.C., where Idler was general manager before coming to Chicago to take the helm at WLS-Ch. 7 in 2012.

While the newscast on WCIU will be competing with his own station, Idler was not concerned it would cannibalize ABC 7's viewership at 7 p.m.

""I think it's a different audience,"" Idler said.

The broad subpoena requests documents and records on the company's job placement rates, graduation rates, marketing materials and student loan default rates.

The subpoena is the latest in a string of headaches for Corinthian, which announced last month that it would sell 85 of its 107 campuses and online programs amid heightened scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Education.

Claiming Corinthian failed to provide documentation on job placement rates and other academic data, the Education Department restricted the company's access to federal student aid in June. The sanctions put the company in a severe cash crunch, and Corinthian told investors it might have to shut down without additional funds.

In early July the company agreed to sell of most or its schools and close a dozen of them.

Patrick Fitzgerald, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, is serving as an independent monitor overseeing Corinthian's operations.

The company's business practices are also being investigated by attorneys general in more than a dozen states, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Since Corinthian announced plans to sell schools, several states have tried to prevent Corinthian from enrolling new students.

The California attorney general's office successfully pushed for Corinthian to clearly disclose its dire financial situation to prospective students. And the company has stopped enrolling new students at campuses in Illinois, after state higher education authorities argued that students faced an ""unacceptable risk"" in attending schools up for sale.

Veterans agencies in five states, including California, have suspended Corinthian's enrollments of veterans using GI Bill funds.","2014-08-13 13:37:00","1","20.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","29.0","0.0","48.0","21.0","0.0","93.0","4.0","16.0","0","287","98.76","58.27","18.76","25.77","23.92","39.02","74.56","35.89","4.18","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.35","3.83","8.71","15.33","3.48","0.70","4.18","0.35","7.67","6.27","2.79","0.35","1.74","1.05","3.48","1.74","1.74","0.35","0.35","0.35","3.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.53","0.70","1.05","0.35","1.05","0.35","1.39","0.70","0.70","0.00","0.00","0.70","0.00","0.70","0.00","0.00","10.80","0.00","2.09","6.97","1.05","2.09","1.74","4.18","1.05","13.94","1.39","8.01","4.88","15.33","0.00","0.00","6.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.68","7.32","4.88","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.35","0.70","2.44","0.00","0.00","1595","9.44","24.833333333333332","485","286","17","45.96","13.7","11.0","16.06","14.3","90","5.857142857142857","21.307412587412585","178","23.42","9","0.36","0","10","3","25","0","36","28","2","2","2","48","41","1","35","0","0","4","3","4","0","0","1","8","0","9","11","9","6","4","5","1","0","0","0"
"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/la-fi-fed-financial-stress-20140808-story.html","Many Americans are still struggling financially","Four in 10 U.S. households are straining financially five years after the Great Recession — many struggling with tight credit, soaring education debt and profound issues related to savings and retirement, according to a new Federal Reserve survey.

The wide-ranging Fed study assessing the economic well-being of Americans shows that the economy has made progress to the point where most households said they were ""living comfortably"" or doing OK financially.

But almost 40% reported last fall that their families were ""just getting by"" or struggling to do so, and more people said their financial situation was worse rather than better off compared with five years earlier.

The survey, conducted in September and reported Thursday, found that the recession had forced substantial shares of the population to put off big purchases or delay major decisions such as moving to a new city or getting married. And many people leaned on others to get through the hard times.

""The survey indicates that many households have been providing assistance to one another during periods of financial distress,"" the 100-page Fed report said, noting that 34% helped friends or family with money.

This suggests that some of the folks who dropped out of the labor force during the recession will not be returning. — Scott Hoyt, an economist at Moody's Analytics

Overall, the Fed's findings are consistent with many other studies and data depicting the deep and lingering effects of the 2007-09 recession. They provide fresh evidence that the recovery has been slow and uneven, generally skewed to the wealthy, and flesh out with numbers some commonly held assumptions.

The survey found, for example, that 15% of those who had retired since 2008 had done so earlier than planned because of the downturn. Only 4% said they had retired later than expected. Based on demographics, that translates into roughly 2 million more people retiring since 2008 than if the recession had not occurred.

""This suggests that some of the folks who dropped out of the labor force during the recession will not be returning,"" said Scott Hoyt, an economist at Moody's Analytics.

That could factor in to the current debate inside the Fed and among academics about the extent of labor market slack, that is, the number of people who are not in the workforce but willing and capable of filling a job.

Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen has argued in favor of easy-money policies largely on the basis of her belief that there is significant slack in the economy, but others have maintained that there are far fewer such workers who are waiting in the wings.

The Fed's report, however, captured a snapshot of households last fall, so there is no comparable data from prior years to assess changes over time. Since then, the recovery stalled in the winter, bounced back in the spring and produced six straight months of job growth surpassing 200,000 each.

The central bank conducts a far more extensive survey of consumer finances every three years, but the results of the most recent one, for 2013, won't be released until early next year.

Even so, this latest snapshot, which the Fed said was aimed at monitoring the recovery and risks to financial stability, adds to the understanding of the severity of the Great Recession's effect on households and individuals. The report suggested that Americans had a fairly positive outlook about their finances. More than 60% said they expected their income to stay the same in the next 12 months, with 21% looking for it to increase. Only 16% expected it to decline.

Similarly, a plurality of homeowners — 60% of respondents said they own homes — said they expected their houses to rise in value over the next year.

The recession has turned more Americans into renters, yet the survey suggests that's not because they aren't interested in being homeowners. The most common reasons people gave for renting were because they couldn't afford a down payment or couldn't qualify for a mortgage.

On loans in general, about one-third of consumers were turned down or given less credit than they had sought. An additional 19% reported putting off applying because they figured they would be rejected.

More recently, however, there are indications that lenders are loosening up. Separately, the Fed reported Thursday that consumer borrowing rose in June at a solid 6.5% annual pace, mostly the result of gains in auto and student loans.

About one-fourth of households have education debt of some kind, according to the survey. The average amount was $27,840 — a hefty sum that left nearly one-fifth of the borrowers behind in payments or facing collections.

Financial strains also were evident in health spending: About one-third of respondents said they had put off medical care in the prior 12 months because they could not afford it.

Also, fewer than 40% of households had a rainy-day fund to cover expenses for three months.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/la-fi-corinthian-colleges-20140814-story.html","Corinthian Colleges tells investors it is facing a criminal probe","After months of financial uncertainty and battles with regulators, Corinthian Colleges Inc. told investors Wednesday about the prospect of a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors.

The beleaguered Orange County for-profit college company said in a filing that it received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles.

The subpoena requests a broad range of documents and records related to the company's job placement rates, graduation rates and marketing materials used to recruit students. The Santa Ana firm has previously received subpoenas and similar document requests from state attorneys general, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but Wednesday's announcement was the first to signal the possibility of a federal criminal inquiry.

The subpoena, issued Friday, is the latest in a string of headaches for Corinthian, which announced last month that it would sell 85 of its 107 campuses and online programs amid heightened scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Education.

A company spokesman, Kent Jenkins, said in a statement that Corinthian would cooperate with the request, but added that the company is prepared to ""vigorously defend its policies, practices and track record of serving students effectively.""

Corinthian operates schools under the Everest College, WyoTech and Heald brand names. Nearly a quarter of the company's campuses are based in California — more than any other state.

The for-profit college industry has faced greater scrutiny from federal and state authorities in recent years, as attorneys general and federal investigators allege that some schools are aggressively targeting low-income students who are eligible for the maximum in federal aid.

The Obama administration in March proposed new rules for the industry and other vocational schools that are intended to weed out bad actors that leave students with enormous debts and few job prospects.

Other companies have faced declining enrollments in recent years, but Corinthian's recent troubles far outweigh those of its peers.

Over the last year, Corinthian has been inundated with investigations by state and federal authorities into its business practices, including concerns that employees falsified job placement rates and student attendance records to retain access to federal student loans and grants — the lifeblood of company profits.

The U.S. Department of Education set its sights on Corinthian in January, requesting extensive data and documentation to justify the company's job placement rates. In June, the Education Department contended Corinthian had failed to provide the information as requested, and put a 21-day hold on the company's access to federal student aid.

The sanctions put Corinthian on the brink of collapse. Last year, the company received nearly 85% of revenue from federal loans and grants.

In a June regulatory filing announcing the financial penalties, the company told investors it might have to shut down without additional funds. Amid declining enrollments and problems with an internal student lending program, Corinthian had already been struggling with cash flow this year.

In early July, Corinthian agreed to sell of most of its schools and close a dozen of them in a deal with U.S. education officials.

Patrick Fitzgerald, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, is serving as an independent monitor overseeing Corinthian's operations.

Corinthian is also facing a lawsuit filed by California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris last October. Harris' office alleged a wide range of fraudulent behavior, including having financial arrangements with temp agencies to count students as being ""employed."" Job placement rates are a key marketing tool for recruiting new students, and are crucial to maintaining accreditation and access to federal aid.

That lawsuit is ongoing. Corinthian faced a similar lawsuit from the California Attorney General's office in 2007. The company settled the case for $6.5 million, admitting no wrongdoing.

Jenkins, the Corinthian spokesman, said none of the ongoing investigations have proven ""systemic wrongdoing or company-wide failure to comply with laws and regulations.""

""There has been no finding by any court of law that Corinthian has failed to meet any of its legal or regulatory obligations to students,"" he added.

Felicia Gerard dropped out of an online bachelor's degree program at Everest University last month, after she said she couldn't get a straight answer about the company's future from more than a dozen academic advisors. Gerard had already graduated from an Everest associate's degree program last year, and said she reluctantly re-enrolled in the bachelor's program after learning her credits would not transfer to Arizona State or other nearby public colleges.

""They just refused to tell me what was going on,"" said Gerard, 29, of Mesa, Ariz. ""They were just telling me things to shut me up and move me along, so they could get their money.""

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/la-fi-fico-20140809-story.html","New FICO criteria could help borrowers","The nation's dominant credit-scoring system is being revised in a way that could save consumers nationwide billions of dollars, especially in qualifying for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards at lower interest rates.

The changes to FICO criteria are aimed at reducing the negative effect of overdue medical bills and at removing the penalties to consumers who pay off debts that had been assigned to collection agencies.

The revisions, to take effect this fall, will alter the formulas used to generate the credit grades used in more than 90% of the decisions that lenders make about how much consumers can borrow and at what interest rates. The scores also are used by employers and landlords.

Improved scores could make it easier for millions of Americans with past credit blemishes to get loans or to get them at lower rates.

------------

FOR THE RECORD:

FICO scores: An Aug. 9 article in the Business section about new rules for FICO credit ratings referred to the score's creator as Fair Isaacs Corp. It is Fair Isaac Corp.

------------



We're looking at people, who are currently being denied, potentially being offered a mortgage because of this. — Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors

Experts cautioned, though, that borrowers might have to wait a year or more to see the effect of changes because lenders will not quickly overhaul their systems to evaluate consumers and price loans for them.

What's more, the effect on the housing market, a major key to economic growth, is likely to be muted. Analysts said change would be seen more rapidly in auto loans and credit cards than in mortgages.

""These are not changes that are going to turn on a fire hose of new loan applications any time soon,"" said Greg McBride, the chief analyst at consumer financial website Bankrate.com. ""For a lot of people, it's not so much going to be the difference between being approved and denied as it is the terms on which you are approved.""

For consumers whose only major delinquency is an unpaid medical bill, the changes would increase a credit score by 25 points, according to Fair Isaac Corp., the company that provides FICO scores to the three big credit-rating firms. Scores range from 300 to 850, and most lenders prefer a score above 700.

The revisions, released Thursday, address a major point of contention between Fair Isaac and consumer groups.

Consumer advocates had complained that medical patients frequently are left in the dark when insurers reject payment on a bill, which can then go to collection. What's more, unexpected medical catastrophes can swamp otherwise responsible borrowers with enormous bills.

A recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau study, based on data from Fair Isaac and the credit bureaus, found that both paid and unpaid medical debts unfairly penalized a consumer's credit rating.

Although the changes will affect FICO scores, they won't remove any unpaid debts from a credit report.

Lenders could still use the items as a reason to deny a loan application or charge more in fees or interest.

Credit unions will need time to study the new FICO criteria but are likely to adopt them quickly, said Arnold Ramirez, a consultant for the California and Nevada Credit Union Leagues. He said a consumer who pays off a debt that went to collection years ago would be regarded favorably.

""Credit unions were created to help people of modest means,"" Ramirez said. ""We want to help people who may have had problems but are now putting themselves back in good financial standing.""

Many mortgage lenders use a previous version of FICO, which also is still favored by industry financing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Together they buy or guarantee more than 60% of home loans.

A credit score is just one of many factors a lender looks at when considering a loan.

A survey by FICO of bank risk managers last month found that they were nearly six times more likely to reject a loan application because of a high debt-to-income ratio — the amount of a borrower's income devoted to housing and debt payments — than because of a low FICO score.

""The credit score plays less of a role [in a mortgage decision] than most people think,"" said Kelli Isaacs, vice president and regional sales manager for Southern California at Bank of the West. ""I think what people should be looking at is the overall picture. Regardless of your scores, are you paying your bills?""

Meanwhile, lenders have eased up on the credit scores they have been requiring in the aftermath of the mortgage meltdown and financial crisis. The average FICO score for a closed mortgage in June was 728, down from 742 a year earlier, according to Ellie Mae, a company that processes mortgage applications for lenders.

Still, a higher score often translates into lower interest rates and lower payments.

A borrower with a FICO score of 675 can expect to pay 4.75% interest on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to Informa Research Services in Calabasas. That amounts to $2,086 a month in principal and interest on a $400,000 loan.

At a FICO score of 700, that rate drops to 4.212%, and the monthly payment falls $127, to $1,959.

Access to credit is still a big hurdle for the housing market. A survey this week by the Federal Reserve found that 29% of renters hadn't bought a house because they couldn't qualify for a mortgage.

Anything that makes qualifying easier and cheaper should be welcome news, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors.

""In recent years the [credit score requirement] has been dialed so tightly that only fairly upper-tier consumers were able to qualify for a loan,"" he said. ""We're looking at people, who are currently being denied, potentially being offered a mortgage because of this.""

Nick Clements, a credit-scoring expert who heads Magnify Money, a personal finance site, said the changes have the potential to save consumers billions of dollars, noting that 64 million Americans have a medical collection item on their credit reports.

But Clements said banks probably will take a year to 18 months to analyze the effects of the new scoring on their loans and set up new pricing strategies. And improvement won't be automatic.

""Just because FICO says that someone is low risk does not mean a bank will treat them as such,"" Clements said.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/la-fi-financial-markets-close-20141211-story.html","Dow plummets 268 points as oil price drop sinks energy stocks","Oil resumed its slide on Wednesday and took the stock market down with it.

The catalyst for the latest sell-off in oil was an OPEC report that projected demand for its crude would sink next year to levels not seen in more than a decade. Demand for the cartel's oil has been eroded as other countries such as the U.S. have stepped up production.

The decline in the price of oil accelerated after the U.S. Energy Department reported that domestic oil inventories had increased. Analysts expected a decline.

Benchmark U.S. crude fell $2.88 to close at $60.94 a barrel. The price of oil has now dropped more than 40% from a peak of $107 in June.

The wider fallout from the plunge in the price of oil may be starting to worry investors. While lower oil prices are good for consumers and some industries, if prices continue to drop some producers may be forced out of business.

“The slide in oil has been pretty dramatic,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “There is an over-reaction to these lower energy prices, which is what we seem to be seeing right now, where it becomes more panic selling.”

The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 33.68 points, or 1.6%, to 2,026.14. The decline was the biggest for the index since Oct. 13.

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 268.05 points, or 1.5%, to 17,533.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 82.44 points, or 1.7%, to 4,684.03.

Falling oil prices and concerns about global growth have pushed stocks down sharply since they closed at record levels on Friday. The market rose that day after the government reported a jump in hiring in November that put the U.S. on track for the healthiest year for job creation since 1999.

The resilience of the U.S. economy has prompted investors to speculate that the Federal Reserve will signal next week that it is nearing its first rate increase in more than eight years. The prospect of higher rates is unsettling for some investors as the market's almost six-year bull run has come against a backdrop of unprecedented stimulus.

Federal Reserve policymakers are scheduled to convene a two-day meeting on Dec. 16.

“The stronger employment data and economic data that we have gotten has only increased people's confidence that the Fed is going to be raising rates by the (middle) of next year,” said Rob Eschweiler, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Houston.

Among individual stocks, Yum Brands, which owns the Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut chains, was one of the day's big losers.

The stock slumped after the company cut its profit outlook for the year late Tuesday. It said sales in China are recovering more slowly than expected after a food-safety scare. Yum fell $4.69, or 6.2%, to $70.53.

Shares of airlines, which are heavy fuel users, rose as oil plunged. Southwest Airlines gained 75 cents, or 1.8%, to $41.48. The stock has gained 120% this year.

Government bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.17% from 2.21% on Tuesday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 117.90 yen from 119.40 late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.2445 from $1.2385.

In metals trading, Gold was little changed, dropping $2.60, or 0.2%, to $1,229.40 an ounce. Silver rose 5.3 cents, or 0.3%, to $17.19 an ounce. Copper fell 3.5 cents, or 1.2%, to $2.89 per pound.

In other energy trading, Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, fell $2.60, or 3.9%, to $64.24 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange in London.

— Wholesale gasoline fell 8.2 cents to close at $1.642 a gallon.

— Heating oil fell 3.8 cents to close at $2.046 a gallon.

— Natural gas rose 5.4 cents to close at $3.706 per 1,000 cubic feet.","2014-12-09 17:00:00","0","27.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","24.0","0.0","33.0","19.0","0.0","86.0","4.0","16.0","0","655","98.84","46.95","56.52","33.68","15.60","18.32","74.20","38.78","4.12","0.46","0.00","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.15","3.66","9.01","16.49","5.34","1.22","3.21","0.15","11.30","5.34","3.97","0.76","9.16","1.53","3.82","2.14","1.68","0.61","0.00","0.46","1.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.72","0.46","1.68","0.61","2.90","0.15","2.75","3.51","0.31","0.46","0.31","1.22","0.15","0.15","0.00","0.92","5.34","0.61","1.07","3.05","1.07","0.31","3.97","5.50","1.22","19.39","4.12","9.01","6.41","6.87","0.15","0.15","6.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","22.44","8.40","6.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.92","0.92","0.76","0.31","4.73","2898","7.15","18.57894736842105","870","646","79","88.53","7.9","2.9","8.72","5.5","127","3.8499999999999996","13.143777089783283","362","17.68","17","0.37","0","15","99","65","0","89","25","7","3","4","109","70","2","47","0","0","7","4","11","2","0","4","24","0","14","39","14","18","10","16","5","1","0","1"
"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/la-fi-fico-scoring-changes-20140808-story.html","FICO changes may save consumers billions -- but not soon, experts say","America’s most widely used credit-scoring system is being revised to reduce the negative effect of overdue medical bills and to quit penalizing consumers who pay off debts that had been assigned to collection agencies.

The changes to the hugely influential FICO scoring system could make it easier for millions of Americans to get loans at lower rates and eventually save consumers billions of dollars.

Experts cautioned, however, that borrowers might have to wait for a year to see change because lenders will not quickly overhaul their systems to evaluate consumers and price loans for them.

For consumers whose only major delinquency is an unpaid medical bill, the changes would increase a credit score by 25 points, according to Fair Isaacs Corp., whose FICO credit ratings are the basis for scores published by the three big credit-rating agencies.

The changes, released Thursday, address a major point of contention between FICO and consumer advocates, who complained that medical patients frequently are left in the dark when insurers reject payment on a bill, which can then go to collection.

A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau study this summer found that both paid and unpaid medical debts unfairly penalized a consumer’s credit rating.

The revised system, called FICO Score 9, will be made available to lenders through the three major credit-rating agencies starting this fall, Fair Isaacs said. The San Jose-based company said the improved scoring methods also would help lenders do a better job of assessing the risk of consumers with limited credit histories.

The National Assn. of Realtors applauded the changes, saying they would “ultimately make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americans” who have been shut out of the housing market or forced to pay higher mortgage interest rates “because of flawed credit scores.”

“Since the housing crash, overly restrictive lending has been the greatest obstacle to homeownership,” the real estate trade group said.

Nick Clements, a credit-scoring expert who heads Magnify Money, a personal finance site, said the changes have the potential to save consumers billions of dollars, noting that 64 million Americans have a medical collection item on their credit reports.

Clements, who spent more than a decade building credit-scoring models for financial institutions, said banks likely will take a year to 18 months to analyze the effects of the new scoring on their loans and set up new pricing strategies. And improvement won’t be automatic.

“Just because FICO says that someone is low risk does not mean a bank will treat them as such,” Clements said.

Though the changes are a victory for the consumer bureau, the agency needs to keep close watch on how the new rules are put into effect, he said.

“There is a real risk that banks use the score only to accept new people,"" he said, ""not to lower rates on customers with demonstrably lower risk.”

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/la-fi-heloc-default-worries-20140808-story.html","Home equity line defaults are likely to rise","A wave of potential defaults on home equity lines of credit could start arriving in the next few years as Americans face a day of reckoning on their boom-era borrowing.

Many homeowners who took out home equity lines, essentially second mortgages, during the housing bubble have been paying only interest.

Now, as they are nearing their end-of-draw terms, shutting down further borrowing, they have to start paying back principal along with interest. That, credit rating firm TransUnion said Thursday, could lead to payment shock — and possible defaults.

Economists said that the threat is particularly pronounced in California, especially more affordable inland areas, because of the flood of risky lending that led up to the housing meltdown and the Great Recession.

""The bubble areas are going to have the biggest risk,"" said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Nationwide, $50 billion to $79 billion in home equity lines are at heightened risk for default in coming years, TransUnion said in its study. Borrowers of those loans have lower credit scores, less equity in their homes and less flexibility in adjusting to a sharp rise in expenses, the Chicago firm said.

While the problem is significant, it's manageable, said Ezra Becker, a TransUnion vice president. Lenders can contact borrowers and try to make arrangements with those most prone to default.

He said the loans with the highest risk are a small segment —11% to 19% — of home equity lines of credit, known as HELOCs, that have balances yet to mature.

""A lot of people are worried that the sky is going to fall,"" said Becker, who co-wrote the study. ""The numbers indicate the majority of HELOCs are low risk.""

As a wave of borrowers face higher payments in coming years, the larger economic recovery should bolster their ability to weather payment shock, Becker said.

Not only is the job market improving, but home prices have risen sharply in the last two years. That should make it easier for borrowers to refinance or sell their homes if they get into trouble, he said.

Home equity lines of credit enable homeowners to borrow up to a pre-defined amount at their discretion. During last decade's housing boom, Americans borrowed feverishly against their rising equity, often using the lines to buy cars and take vacations.

A year before the housing meltdown, Richard Peterson took out a $167,000 credit line on his Huntington Beach condo. He didn't even have to ask. Countrywide Financial Corp., then an aggressive Calabasas home lender, called the insurance adjuster on the phone in 2006 and offered him one.

""They were just giving money out,"" Peterson said. ""It paid off my car and everything.""

But the lines usually run dry after 10 or 15 years, forcing borrowers to make set payments on the debt monthly or pay the entire amount.

Peterson, 62, who has since retired, received his unpleasant shock last month in a letter from Specialized Loan Servicing, the company that collects his mortgage payment. As of July 2016, his payment will rise to more than $1,100 a month from the $400 he is paying to cover just the interest.

""We both now live on a fixed income and will not be able to make the payments,"" he said of himself and his girlfriend.

The U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, has been urging bankers for more than two years to help borrowers like Peterson.

Those efforts and routine payoffs of the credit lines have helped reduce the number of borrowers approaching the end-of-the-draw periods at large banks by about 20% from the end of 2011 to the end of 2013, the comptroller said in a June report.

But that still left nearly $150 billion in credit lines subject to higher payment shock from 2015 through 2017 at the nine largest banks regulated by the agency. ""While improving, substantial challenges remain, and the OCC will continue to monitor exposure levels and lender efforts to mitigate the risks,"" it said.

The banks with the largest exposure to these credit line payment shocks, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., said they were aggressively offering to rework or refinance debts, where possible.

At Chase, around $29 billion of the bank's $49 billion in home equity lines of credit will reset through 2017, mortgage spokesman Jason Lobo said.

Many who have sufficient equity in their homes choose to refinance, Lobo said, wrapping their existing first mortgage and the credit-line debt into a new, longer-term fixed mortgage.

As of June 30, Bank of America had $89.7 billion in outstanding home equity loans and credit lines, the most of all the banks, and Wells Fargo was No. 2 with $80 billion.

Economists said defaults would likely be focused in areas such as the Antelope Valley and the Inland Empire, where many homeowners still owe more than their homes are worth.

But the pain likely won't go much farther than that. Economists said they don't foresee HELOC payment shock stalling either the housing or broader economic recovery.

""I don't see it shaking the financial system,"" Baker said. ""This isn't anything like we saw in 2008 and 2009.""

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/la-fi-jobs-20140802-story.html","July's job growth strong but below expectations","The labor market extended its best streak since the late 1990s, posting solid job growth last month that lured more people back into the workforce.

The 209,000 net new jobs were below analyst expectations and a sharp falloff from June's robust 298,000 figure.

In addition, there were signs in Friday's Labor Department report that the job market still isn't back to full health. Those markers included stagnant wages and an increase in the already high number of people out of work for more than six months.

Nonetheless, July was the sixth straight month that the economy added more than 200,000 net new jobs, which hadn't happened since the early dot-com boom in 1997.

President Obama touted that streak, along with a host of positive economic data released this week.

""The good news is the economy clearly is getting stronger, things are getting better, our engines are revving a little bit louder,"" he said.

The good news is the economy clearly is getting stronger, things are getting better, our engines are revving a little bit louder. — President Obama

In a sign of the recovery's progress, analysts said July's job growth was a bit of a disappointment. A year ago such growth would have been a reason to celebrate. But economic conditions have improved since then.

With revisions that added a total of 15,000 more jobs to May's and June's numbers, the economy is averaging about 230,000 new jobs a month this year. That's up from 194,000 last year.

The unemployment rate rose by a tenth of a percentage point to 6.2% in July. Still, that was down significantly from 7.3% a year earlier.

And the rise was for a good reason: The labor force grew by 329,000 last month as many people who had left the job market — and so weren't being counted in the unemployment rate — returned. That caused the labor force participation rate to inch up for the first time in five months, to 62.9%, from its lowest level since 1978.

""This is a solid report that shows the economy is moving forward at a fast enough rate to put people back to work,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York.

July's jobs report was good enough to maintain economic momentum but not so good that it added to investor concerns that interest rates will rise sooner than expected.

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 69.93 points, or 0.4%, to 16,493.37 on Friday amid global tensions. It dropped 467 points for the week, the second worst of the year.

Friday's loss was an improvement after a 317-point sell-off Thursday fueled by worries that recent upbeat economic data would lead the Federal Reserve to act more quickly to raise its near-zero short-term interest rates.

""Wall Street has become more concerned that growth is improving,"" said Tim Hopper, chief economist for TIAA-CREF, one of the nation's largest money managers. The July jobs report eased those concerns, he said.

Hopper doesn't expect the Fed to start raising rates until late next year.

Some key, good-paying industries accelerated their hiring pace last month.

Construction companies added 22,000 new jobs, more than double the 10,000 added in June. Manufacturers increased their payrolls by 28,000, up from 23,000 in June.

Job growth declined in retail, to 26,700 in July from 41,200 the previous month. Professional and business services added 47,000 net new jobs, down from 73,000 in June. And job creation in the education and health services sector was 17,000 last month, well off June's 45,000.

Overall, private employers added 198,000 net new jobs and government added 11,000.

The report also highlighted that the labor market still has some weaknesses. The labor force participation rate remained at an historically low level. Long-term unemployment increased by about 202,000 to 3.2 million. And wages are barely increasing.

Average hourly earnings rose just a penny to $24.45 in July and increased only 2% over the previous year. That's just a little more than inflation.

""Until we see real wage growth, we're not really seeing the improvement we need to see,"" Hopper said.

The solid jobs data added to recent signs that the recovery is back on track after a scare during the winter.

The economy grew at a robust 4% annual rate from April through June, the Commerce Department said this week. Much of that growth came from consumers and businesses catching up on activity lost during the first quarter, when the severe winter battered much of the nation and the economy contracted at a 2.1% annual rate.

Consumer spending rose 0.4% in June, up from 0.3% the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday. Personal income also increased 0.4% in June, the same pace as in May.

And July was one of the best months in years for motor vehicle sales, automakers said Friday.

""It's better,"" Kevin Logan, chief U.S. economist at HSBC Bank, said of an economy growing at about a 2.5% annual rate. ""It could be much better, but at least it's improving — even if slowly.""

Consumers in July said they were more positive about their current financial situation than at any time since 2007, according to private survey results released Friday. Still, the monthly consumer confidence index from the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters dropped to 81.8 last month from 82.5 in June.

""The slow and uneven pace of the recovery in jobs and incomes during the past five years has made consumers unwilling to put much stock in favorable economic forecasts until repeatedly confirmed by positive realizations,"" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.

""What may have been termed a skeptical viewpoint in an earlier era is now regarded as a more practical 'show-me' state of mind,"" he said.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/la-fi-us-markets-20140801-story.html","Stocks plunge on worries about interest rate increase","Wall Street's long-running bull market got a jolt Thursday from investors increasingly worried that the improving economy will push policymakers to raise interest rates sooner than expected.

Stocks have been tumbling this week, and Thursday's 317-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average left July in the red and wiped out what was left of its gains for the year.

The Dow's 1.9% decline Thursday to 16,563.30 was eclipsed by the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index, which fell 2% to 1,930.67, and the tech-oriented Nasdaq composite, which lost 2.1% to 4,369.77.

Traders also feared that several years of low market volatility could be coming to a close and fretted about strife abroad and uncertainty over employment data expected Friday.

""What we're seeing makes perfect sense on a number of fronts. The potential was always there for this to happen,"" said Bob Keiser, vice president of S&P Capital IQ's Global Markets Intelligence unit. ""Now, it's finally happening.""

Recent economic reports have been promising, which some investors worry may convince the Fed to shut off the spigot after years of easy-money policies aimed at stimulating the slow economic recovery from the Great Recession.

The Commerce Department said gross domestic product, or total economic output, expanded at a 4% annual rate in the second quarter, more than most economists expected. But with a major contraction in the first quarter, the average was only about 1% for the first half of the year. Economists, nevertheless, expect continued strong growth through the rest of the year.

It's a reality check to what's happening in the economy. It's not as rosy as so many people would like to think. — Lindsey Piegza, Sterne Agee chief economist

First-time claims for jobless benefits rose to 302,000 last week, but the less volatile four-week average hit an eight-year low of 297,250, the Labor Department said Thursday.

And a slew of data to be released Friday — especially July's job market and unemployment numbers — may offer even more evidence of a strengthening recovery.

The government tally of nonfarm payrolls is expected to show a gain of 233,000 jobs, and the national unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 6.1%. But economists said that if the rate falls to 6% or below, the Fed could see the decline as a cue to tighten monetary policy before the expected mid-2015.

Raising a key Fed interest rate, which has been near zero since 2008, would probably lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, possibly crimping the housing market and consumer spending. Wall Street also fears higher rates would hamper corporate borrowing, especially for expansions. Hence, the sell-off in stocks.

Some analysts, such as Sterne Agee Chief Economist Lindsey Piegza, say that the Fed's actions at its regular meeting this week also sent a signal that economic growth still wasn't as robust as hoped, another factor putting pressure on stocks.

""It's a reality check to what's happening in the economy. It's not as rosy as so many people would like to think,"" she said.

Contributing to the sense of unease are a host of problems abroad. Chief among them are Russia-Ukraine tensions, the relentless march of Isis militants across Iraq, and fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

German sports gear firm Adidas, for instance, said Thursday that higher risks in Russia, where the U.S. and European Union intensified sanctions this week, compelled it to significantly reduce plans to open stores in the region as it ramps up store closures. It also lowered its full-year profit forecast.

Argentina, which lost its appeals in U.S. courts over its sovereign debt, failed to resolve its issues with bondholders in last-ditch talks late Wednesday and fell into default for the second time in 13 years.

""It's an accumulation effect,"" said Alan Whitman, a managing director of Morgan Stanley. ""The news just doesn't seem to improve, and for a lot of people, it becomes more than they want to deal with.""

A smattering of disappointing earnings this week also put a damper on the market.

Time Warner Cable Inc.'s shares slid $6.32, or 4.2%, to $145.10 on Thursday after it lowered its revenue growth projections for the year to as low as 3.5% from 4.5%. The company manages SportsNetLA — the channel now broadcasting Los Angeles Dodgers games — but has been stuck in a pricing standoff with other distributors.

Exxon Mobil Corp. also took a hit after it said its global production of oil and gas fell to its lowest point since 2009. Shares of the world's largest energy company sank $4.31, or 4.2%, to $98.94 a share.

On Wednesday, Whole Foods Market Inc. reported a 3.9% increase in same-store sales that left investors cold. The organic grocer lowered its full-year forecast for same-store-sales growth to a range of 4.1% to 4.4% from its previous projection of a 5% to 5.5% upswing. Shares fell 88 cents, or 2.3%, to $38.23 a share.

But S&P's Keiser dismissed the notion that, across a wide swatch of reporting businesses, earnings for the quarter were so-so.

""A couple of companies are not going to outweigh the overall complexion of earnings, which have been strong,"" he said.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/la-na-obamacare-terminations-20140916-story.html","Many may lose Obamacare coverage because of missing paperwork","As many as half a million people who signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act this year may lose coverage or need to pay more because they haven't submitted proper documentation, the Obama administration warned Monday.

Some 115,000 people are poised to be cut from insurance rolls at the end of the month because they haven't verified their citizenship or immigration status.

Another 363,000 people haven't sent in the necessary forms proving their income, a key requirement for calculating the size of government subsidies some consumers are eligible to receive under the law.

Together, that represents about 10% of those who signed up for coverage on new federal marketplaces created by the law.

It does not include people in California and other states operating their own marketplaces this year.

Without proper income documentation, some consumers may be forced to repay subsidies that they improperly received, said the Department of Health and Human Services' Andy Slavitt, who oversees the marketplaces.

The law allows Americans who don't get health benefits at work to shop among plans on the marketplaces. Those making less than four times the federal poverty level — or about $94,000 for a family of four — qualify for subsidies.

The marketplaces are closed to people who are not legally in the country.

The reconciliation of consumers' income and immigration information is a key part of the complex new marketplaces. But that process has come under increased scrutiny because the Obama administration and some states that are running their own marketplaces had so much difficulty starting the markets.

That slowed the process and led to widespread confusion. Many consumers have grown frustrated, and insurance industry officials are concerned that renewing coverage for people next year may become very difficult because of unresolved verification issues.

The Obama administration may face a backlash from consumers who will be asked to repay hundreds or thousands of dollars in subsidies that they weren't entitled to receive.

Slavitt said Monday that the health agency had made significant progress clearing a backlog of those with incomplete information, including 851,000 people with missing immigration documentation and 897,000 households with missing income documentation.

He and other Obamacare supporters point to signs that the law has helped expand coverage to millions of Americans and that the marketplaces appear to be restraining the cost of insurance in many states.

""All the evidence is showing us the Affordable Care Act is working for millions of Americans,"" he said.

But Slavitt would not say how many of the cleared cases led to termination of coverage or adjustments in premiums.

That number is key to gauging how many of the 8 million people who signed up for coverage have remained in health plans and whether the law's expansion of coverage looks to be enduring.

It is also unclear how many more people face changes in their coverage in the 14 states, including California, that did not rely on the federal government to operate their marketplaces. The Obama administration did not release data on those states Monday.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/la-pn-north-carolina-voting-laws-20141001-story.html","Court blocks parts of N.C. law that ended same-day voter registration","A federal appeals court on Wednesday blocked some provisions of a North Carolina law that bars same-day voter registration, saying it would disproportionately affect minority voters.

In a 2-1 decision, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that North Carolina's new elections law -- passed last year by the state's Republican-controlled legislature -- violated a section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that prohibits discrimination based on race.

""There can be no doubt that certain challenged measures in House Bill 589 disproportionately impact minority voters,"" wrote the court in a 69-page decision that orders a lower court to halt the enforcement of the law less than five weeks before the November midterm elections.

The ruling also orders a district court to block a provision of the new law that bans out-of-precinct voting.

Since the law was passed, such groups as the American Civil Liberties Union and National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People have assailed it as disenfranchising minority voters.

There can be no doubt that certain challenged measures in House Bill 589 disproportionately impact minority voters. — Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals

According to Democracy North Carolina, a left-leaning group, black voters in 2012 made up 29% of the state’s early voters and 34% of same-day registration voters.

The law has faced several challenges, but lower courts had largely upheld it.

“We are pleased with the Circuit Court’s ruling today,” the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said in a statement. “The evidence clearly showed that, under North Carolina’s voter suppression law, African Americans would have faced higher barriers to the ballot this November, and the court took an important step to ensure that this election will remain free, fair and accessible to all North Carolina voters.

Officials in North Carolina said an appeal to the Supreme Court is likely to come as early as Thursday.

“We are concerned that changes so close to the election may contribute to voter confusion,” Executive Director Kim Westbrook Strach of the State Board of Elections, said in a statement. “More than 4 million voter guides have gone to the public with information contrary to today’s decision.”

The Circuit Court on Wednesday did affirm a lower court's ruling that allows the state to limit the number of early on-site voting days from 17 to 10.

North Carolina is home to a competitive midterm contest between Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan and Republican state House Speaker Thom Tillis.

“The big one is early voting days and that wasn’t touched. Still, the same-day issue is now another wrinkle in this wild midterm election,” said John Davis, a Raleigh, N.C.,-based political analyst.

Gordon Erspamer, a radiation victim’s son who became one of the nation’s foremost courtroom advocates for military veterans, died of brain cancer Nov. 7 at his home in Moraga. He was 61.

Mr. Erspamer argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1985 on behalf of the National Association of Radiation Survivors, challenging a Civil War-era law that barred veterans from paying lawyers more than $10 to seek service-connected benefits. He lost in court but won in Congress, which repealed the fee limit and later established a new court to hear veterans’ cases. Another suit he argued over veterans’ mental health care was also dismissed but helped to spur the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish new suicide-prevention programs.

Protesting the death of Stephon Clark: ‘You murdered a Son’ New York Times

Two years ago, shortly before he retired from law practice, Mr. Erspamer won a ruling from a federal judge in Oakland allowing a class-action suit by about 100,000 veterans seeking information and medical care for their exposure to chemicals during decades of secret weapons experiments by the armed services and the CIA. That case is still pending.

“He made himself available to the veterans he represented and would take any call from anybody at any time,” said Michael Blecker, executive director of Swords to Plowshares in San Francisco, which provides services to veterans. “These guys had issues, they were angry ... and here was someone powerful who could validate and signify their experiences as a soldier.”

“There wasn’t any lawyer in America that was pursing this cause with as much vigor as Gordy Erspamer,” said Arturo Gonzalez, who is a partner at Morrison & Foerster, the San Francisco law firm where Mr. Erspamer worked for 30 years.

His father, Ernest Erspamer, was a survey officer on a military vessel in the South Pacific in 1946 and was exposed to radiation from a U.S underwater atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll. The VA denied his claim for radiation sickness and, after his death from leukemia in 1980, denied his wife’s claim for benefits. Mr. Erspamer, who had just become a lawyer, took up his mother’s case and, 10 years later, won it with the help of a ruling by the veterans court Congress had just established.

His 2007 lawsuit on behalf of two veterans groups presented strong evidence of systemic delays and neglect in the mental health care system: VA documents showing that the system took an average of 4.4 years to review veterans’ appeals, that more than 1,400 veterans who were denied coverage had died in one six-month period while their appeals were pending, and that 18 veterans per day nationwide were committing suicide, much higher than the rate among the general population.

After a trial in 2008, a federal judge in San Francisco agreed that the VA’s delays were harming veterans but said the courts had no power to intervene. The ruling incensed Mr. Erspamer, who told The Chronicle, “There’s got to be a remedy somewhere for the poor slobs who are fighting for our country.”

A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s decision in May 2012. In the meantime, however, the federal agency had started to take steps it had previously announced but never implemented, such as hiring regional suicide-prevention coordinators and establishing a nationwide suicide-prevention hotline. The lawsuit “shamed Congress and the VA into acting,” said Gonzalez, who argued the case along with Mr. Erspamer.

Gordon Paul Erspamer was born in Ironwood, Mich., in 1953 and attended law school at the University of Michigan, where he met his future wife, Trish Bare. The couple moved to San Francisco in 1978, and Mr. Erspamer joined Morrison & Foerster four years later and became a partner in the firm, focusing on intellectual property and energy law. With the firm’s support, he also handled cases for veterans and their advocates without charge.

Despite being bedridden and disabled from cancer in his final months, his wife said, he was able to use a wheelchair to attend a celebration of his life with family and friends in July.

He is survived by his wife; sons Kevin Erspamer of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Brian Erspamer of Moraga; and daughters Kerry Ginsberg of Walnut Creek and Brett Erspamer of Boston. No services are planned.

Opponents of the year-old Graton Resort and Casino near Rohnert Park have opened up a new attack on the gambling mega-complex, asking the California Supreme Court to invalidate the Graton Indian tribe’s claim over the land.

The Stop Graton Casino community group contends in its Nov. 12 court petition that the casino’s 254 acres don’t meet state and federal guidelines for Indian casino land because they weren’t ancestral Graton territory and were instead given to the tribe by Station Casinos of Las Vegas.

It’s the same type of “off-reservation” casino that state voters rejected this month near Madera, the group argues.

“Newly purchased lands are a world apart from historic reservations,” Petaluma City Councilman Michael Healy, an attorney for the group, said in a statement announcing the petition. The group would ultimately like to see the casino close down.

This is the latest in a series of similar claims by Graton opponents, and none has been successful. The most recent ruling came last month when a state appeals court sided with the tribe, saying federal approval for the land acquisition and the governor-approved compact for the casino constituted adequate authorization for the tribe to take possession of the territory.

Stop Graton Casino, however, hopes that voters’ rejection of Proposition 48 on Nov. 4 signals a sea change in their favor. The proposition would have allowed the North Fork Tribe of Mono Indians to build a Las Vegas-class casino miles from its land.

"https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/Speaker-Playland-near-propane-site-is-that-5889273.php","Speaker: Playland near propane site; is that smart?","Speaker: Playland near propane site; is that smart?

ALBANY — An environmental activist from Bethlehem who has been Albany County Executive Dan McCoy's go-to expert on the dangers of oil trains on Wednesday questioned the county's bid to relocate Hoffman's Playland to an industrial section of the city near a large liquefied propane storage facility.

Peter Iwanowicz, who by day is executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York, was one of just two people to speak at a hearing Wednesday night on the plan to move the amusement rides to Huck Finn's Warehouse & More with the help of grants and tax breaks from two county economic development panels.

Iwanowicz, who said he was speaking simply as a parent and county resident, questioned what the county would do if the situation were reversed and someone were trying to build a fuel depot next to an amusement park.

""If the county is going to be supporting this with tax dollars, there needs to be a thorough review of whether this is a smart strategy,"" Iwanowicz said, citing what company officials described as a small spill last month at the facility run by Massachusetts-based Global Partners, resulting in an intentional burn-off of the fuel. ""What would happen if there were a catastrophic event?""

McCoy helped put together the deal to save the Hoffman's rides by selling them to Huck Finn's owner Jeff Sperber. But he has also led the local fight against Global Partners' plans to expand its crude oil processing facilities at the Port of Albany, with Iwanowicz as one of strongest allies.

The only other speaker was Wade Abbot, a regional representative of American Coaster Enthusiasts, who cheered the plan to preserve the rides that might otherwise have been lost after Hoffman's Playland closed earlier this year.

In particular, Abbot said, Hoffman's 1950s-era Lusse Auto Skooters bumper cars — heavier in body and outfitted with metal bumpers rather than rubber — are classics and perhaps the best in the state.

Even though the park's small roller coaster is newer, it remains significant for many children, he said.

""Often it's the first roller coaster that they will have ridden,"" he said. ""From our perspective, that's a great thing.""

Huck Finn's warehouse is seeking a $150,000 grant from the county's Capital Resource Corporation and an estimated $80,000 in sales tax breaks from the Industrial Development Agency to make the move happen.

The $1.8 million project is also banking on $250,000 grants each from National Grid and Empire State Development, the state's economic development arm.

You may have seen the lawn signs sprouting up in parts of Shelton, Stratford and Trumbull and wondered: ""Isn't it a little early to begin campaigning for the November election?""

Those signs aren't for November. They're for a special election that's needed to fill the unexpired term of Larry Miller, the state representative from the 122nd House district who died May 31.

The special election will take place July 22. It's possible the winner of that election will never act on official legislative business, other than being sworn into office.

""It's dictated by state law,"" said Lou DeCilio, the Stratford registrars of voters. ""If Mr. Miller had lived until July, there wouldn't have been any need for a special election. It's entirely possible that the winner won't ever get to vote on the floor of the Legislature if he or she loses in November.""

Even if he wins July 22, Republican candidate Ben McGorty might not even get to on the ballot in November because he will face Mike Vickerelli, of Stratford, in a Republican primary for the 122nd on Aug. 12, which is also the date of the statewide Republican gubernatorial primary.

More Information The details

Where: The 122nd House District, which includes parts of Shelton, Trumbull and Stratford.

When: July 22, from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Why: To fill the unexpired term of Rep. Larry Miller, who died May 31.

Candidates: Democrat Arlene Liscinsky and Republican Ben McGorty

Polling places: Trumbull, St. Joseph High School; Shelton, Mohegan Elementary School and Long Hill Elementary School; Stratford, Bunnell High School and Chapel Street Elementary School.

Who can vote: All registered voters residing in the 122nd House District.

Absentee ballots: Must be delivered to the city or town clerk by noon the day of the election on July 22.



Vickerelli was supported by both the Trumbull and Stratford Republican delegation, but the Shelton delegation, which is larger than the other two combined, prevailed, DeCilio said.

The odd-shaped 122nd district includes a large swath of Shelton, including much of the Huntington, White Hills and Pine Rock Park sections, the part of Stratford north of the Merritt Parkway including Oronoque Village, and a small slice of eastern Trumbull. The Trumbull portion hasn't always been part of the 122nd. Miller, a Republican, represented the 122nd since 1991.

Officials say they're expecting a very light turnout. It's always a challenge getting voters interested in a special election and this one will take place during the height of the summer vacation season. Even the candidates agree the turnout will likely be small.

Still, both Liscinsky and McGorty said they are hopeful that the electorate will take notice and turn out to their polling places, or fill out an absentee ballot.

Both live in Shelton.

Liscinsky, 64, is a member of the Shelton Board of Education and ran for Miller's seat in 2002. She lived in Stratford for 12 years, but grew up in New York and Danbury.

""Over the years, I had a very nice relationship with Mr. Miller, both in my involvement with the Board of Ed and the Chamber of Commerce,"" Liscinsky said. ""My passion is solving problems and helping people. I'm in the arena, certainly, on issues concerning education, and because my husband has to commute over the Tappan Zee Bridge every day, I'm well aware of commuter issues, too.""

She said that now she's in her 60s, she expects to have more traction in Stratford's Oronoque Village and with other senior citizens, too.

""Now that I'm facing my rusty years, those issues are more important to me.""

McGorty, 50, is a real estate agent and a volunteer with the Shelton Fire Department. He serves on Shelton's Board of Fire Commissioners and is a member of the Knights of Columbus. He said he will continue ""work as a fiscal watchdog in Hartford.""

""I've been a volunteer with the Fire Department for 34 years and also at the Boys and Girls Club -- I'm on the board of directors."" McGorty said. ""I like to help my community, and now I want to help my state.""

San Francisco Supervisor Mark Farrell’s campaign manager on his 2010 run for supervisor has paid a $14,500 fine for violating state campaign law by coordinating with an independent expenditure committee formed to get Farrell elected.

California’s Fair Political Practices Commission on Nov. 20 will vote on a settlement already reached by the commission’s staff and political consultant Chris Lee and is expected to approve it.

In August 2009, Farrell created a campaign committee for the November 2010 supervisors’ race in District Two, which includes the Marina and Pacific Heights. He retained Lee of Town Square Consulting as his campaign manager. Farrell was considered a little-known underdog to the favorite, Janet Reilly.

In September 2010, incumbent District Two Supervisor Michela Alioto-Pier lost her bid to qualify to run for an extra term and gave her endorsement to Farrell. She helped raise funds for an independent expenditure committee called Common Sense Voters to get Farrell elected.

That committee was formed on Oct. 1, 2010, and had several of the same staff members as Farrell’s regular campaign committee.

Lee was heavily involved with Common Sense Voters — including working with that committee to produce a door hanger supporting Farrell and including an endorsement letter written by Alioto-Pier.

The FPPC found that Lee’s work with Common Sense Voters violated the rules that independent expenditure committees formed to get candidates elected cannot work with the candidates’ campaign committees.

The FPPC found that Farrell did not authorize Lee to coordinate with Common Sense Voters and that Lee “purposely or negligently” caused the violation.

Farrell released a statement saying that he didn’t know about Lee’s actions until after the campaign and that he cooperated fully with the FPPC’s investigation.

“I always have and will continue to hold myself to the highest possible ethical standards as an elected representative for the city I was born and raised in,” Farrell said in the statement.

Lee did not return a call for comment.

In 2003, during the aftermath of the dot-com crash, San Francisco led the country as the first city in the nation to adopt a higher minimum wage than required by the federal government.

Now, with the city in a second tech boom and facing the nation’s fastest-growing income gap, Proposition J on the November ballot would propel San Francisco to similar high ground, raising the minimum wage from $10.74 an hour to $15 by July 2018.

The San Francisco measure and one on the ballot in Oakland to raise the minimum wage to $12.25 are seen as a spearhead in the nationwide push by labor to raise the pay of low-wage workers.

Protesting the death of Stephon Clark: ‘You murdered a Son’ New York Times

David Nayfeld making pasta San Francisco Chronicle

“If we can raise the minimum wage in San Francisco and Oakland, and the whole Bay Area, we can help set a better standard for everyone,” said Alysabeth Alexander, vice president of politics for Service Employees International Union Local 1021, a Northern California chapter of the union that has been pushing for higher minimum wage laws across the country. “The idea is that our momentum here will help us win a higher minimum wage around the state and the nation.”

Labor action

The union, the second largest in the country, helped organize fast-food workers in a series of protests to raise the wage floor that started in November 2012 in New York. The issue rose all the way to the White House, with President Obama calling for the national minimum wage to rise from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour in his 2014 State of the Union address. That proposal stalled in Congress, but Seattle became the first city in the country to adopt a $15 minimum wage when its City Council decided in June to gradually raise it to that level.

San Francisco’s Prop. J, though, gets to $15 faster than Seattle’s law, which phases it in over seven years for small businesses. It covers nearly all workers in the city, only exempting youths under 18 in government-subsidized training programs or people over 55 at some government-subsidized nonprofits, making it much more comprehensive than a requirement the Los Angeles City Council approved last week to pay workers at large hotels $15.37 an hour.

Prop. J would gradually raise the minimum wage from the current $10.74 an hour to $15 by July 2018, boosting the paychecks of at least 60,000 restaurant, retail and other minimum-wage workers by $75 to $197 a week, according to an analysis by the San Francisco controller’s office.

“That’s 60,000 people who are going to be a little better off after this ballot measure passes than they are today,” said Jason Elliott, a senior adviser to Mayor Ed Lee who brought together business and labor leaders to agree on Prop. J after SEIU Local 1021 initially proposed a rival ballot measure. “The principle is that we need to do something about affordability and income inequality in this city.”

Rents in San Francisco, where nearly two-thirds of the population don’t own their home, have increased at twice the rate as of minimum wage since 2005, according to the controller’s analysis. The average market rent for a two-bedroom apartment is about $3,900 a month, well beyond the means of two full-time minimum-wage earners currently making a combined $44,700 a year.

“Raising the minimum wage isn't going to solve our problem of economic inequality,” Alexander said, “but it’s a good start.”

Wide impact

A UC Berkeley study in August projected that 142,000 workers — or 23 percent of San Francisco's workforce — would get a raise by the time the minimum wage hits $15 an hour in 2018 if voters approve Prop. J.

“It’s not just the folks who fall under that $15 waterline who stand to benefit,” said Sean Clegg, a consultant for the Yes on J campaign. “When you raise the minium wage, it has a buoyant effect on everyone at the lower end of the wage scale.”

That’s exactly what worries some small-business owners in San Francisco, who say raising the minimum wage for their most junior employees will mean the rest of their workforce will demand higher pay. While larger businesses may be able to absorb some of the extra costs, for corner stores or cafes, that’s going to result in higher prices, said Henry Karnilowicz, president of the San Francisco Council of District Merchants Associations.

“You have a ripple effect,” Karnilowicz said. “Prices are going to have to go up. Small businesses are going to have to make a reasonable profit.”

Prop. J has no exception for workers like servers or bartenders, who in California are paid at least minimum wage but make most of their money from tips. Restaurant owners are concerned that their narrow profit margins — and viability — are going to be hurt by hiking compensation to already well-paid workers.

“Servers who make well in excess of $20 an hour, sometimes in excess of $40 an hour, are getting a raise,” said Gwyneth Borden, executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association. “We’re not against an increase in the minimum wage, we just thought that tipped workers aren’t low-wage workers, and they don’t need an increase.”

Many lower-compensated dishwashers and other kitchen staff are already making more than minimum wage as the city’s restaurant industry is booming right along with tech and tourism.

'Labor shortage’

“We have a labor shortage,” Borden said. “Back-of-house workers are already making more than minimum wage.”

The city controller found that as of 2013, the latest data available, the average hourly wage in the food services industry was between $13.10 and $13.80 an hour.

Despite misgivings, the Golden Gate Restaurant Association is officially neutral on Prop. J, as is the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. Citizens Initiative for Technology and Innovation, San Francisco’s largest tech company advocacy organization, is supporting Prop. J.

The merchants council, while opposed to the measure, is not raising any money to campaign against it.

“What’s the point?” said Karnilowicz. “At the end of the day, everybody realizes this is going to pass.”

Polls have shown the measure with well over 70 percent support.

BRACKETTVILLE, Texas — Time and Mother Nature are threatening to dismantle the Alamo. Not the original, but the replica 18th century Spanish mission and Old West movie set John Wayne built for his Oscar-nominated 1960 movie and that for decades was a tourist mecca and film production site.

“It’s not just something that represents history to a movie set — it is now history for sure,” says Rich Curilla, the one-man curator and custodian of the now-closed Alamo Village.

Alamo Village, a 400-acre plot of land about 120 miles west of San Antonio, was carved out of a large ranch in the late 1950s for Wayne’s directorial debut. Starring Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie and Wayne as Davy Crockett, “The Alamo” had an estimated $12 million budget, huge for its time.

The 4-foot-thick Alamo facade was modeled off a 1936 map of the historic building — drawn up for the Texas centennial that year — and set construction took nearly two years. Unlike the real Alamo, which is dwarfed by taller buildings in the heart of San Antonio, the view from Wayne’s Alamo offered a panorama of iconic Texas and Western images.

“To Hollywood, a movie set is just a means to an end,” said Curilla, a film and Alamo historian who spent his summers in college during the late 1960s at the site and began working there full time in 1988. “I think Wayne was cognizant of building a monument and not just a movie set.”

In its heyday, Wayne’s Alamo hosted Jimmy Stewart, Dean Martin, Raquel Welch and even Willie Nelson. It’s where James Arness reprised his famous Matt Dillon role in a “Gunsmoke” TV movie.

In all, nearly 40 major film and TV productions, plus hundreds of commercials, documentaries and music videos were shot at Alamo Village. And musical shows, comedy skits and staged gunfights drew hundreds of tourists daily.

“It was magical,” said Penny Loewen, who was 18 in 1979 when she arrived from tiny St. Francisville, Ill. She stayed for three years, getting paid $350 a month to sing and perform six days a week, 11 hours a day.

“We would do just about anything,” said the 55-year-old retired Nashville songwriter, who remained involved with movie productions for 20 years. “That was the most fun I ever had in my life.”

Business at Alamo Village began to wane in the 1980s when traffic along the main east-west route through South Texas shifted north with completion of Interstate 10. It closed to the public after the last remaining owner died in 2009 and the property was divided among heirs. The land now primarily is used for cattle grazing and hunting.

In recent years, a large crack has developed on the front of the Alamo facade. A tree grows inside. Other walls and structures that have been replaced or redone are failing.

At the main entrance to the ranch, only an abandoned ticket booth and a weathered sign telling visitors they’re entering the world’s largest outdoor movie set hint at its storied past.

“The weather and elements are taking a toll on it,” Texas Film Commission Director Heather Page said. “I think it would be disappointing to lose something like that.”

Corpus Christi businessman David Jones, 74, envisions saving Alamo Village as a Texas version of Old Tucson, a thriving Old West theme park in southern Arizona.

Jones, who describes himself as a lifelong friend of the former owners, says he’s close to raising the $8 million he believes is necessary to buy the property and ready it for visitors. The remote location won’t be a deterrent, Jones says, noting that Big Bend National Park, some 200 miles to the west, typically draws more than 300,000 visitors a year.

“The place really needs to be more than preserved,” he said. “It needs to be rehabilitated. ... It has two icons, John Wayne and the Alamo, known to everybody all over the world.”","2014-12-31 12:20:00","0","104.0","0.0","28.0","0.0","58.0","0.0","329.0","290.0","0.0","391.0","0.0","23.0","0","861","92.95","61.44","27.55","40.38","23.92","21.60","70.03","38.91","6.62","2.09","0.46","0.12","0.12","1.39","0.00","4.53","8.13","12.43","5.23","3.72","4.18","0.70","10.57","4.53","1.86","1.16","4.30","0.81","3.37","2.09","1.28","0.23","0.23","0.46","5.34","0.35","0.12","0.46","1.51","5.81","0.81","0.58","0.70","1.39","0.93","1.51","3.95","1.28","1.74","0.93","1.05","0.23","0.58","0.23","0.00","4.53","0.35","0.58","2.90","0.58","0.70","3.37","6.39","0.35","16.72","0.58","9.41","7.20","2.67","3.83","0.00","1.28","0.23","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.35","4.41","5.23","0.35","0.00","0.12","0.00","1.05","3.25","3.14","0.00","0.81","3998","8.13","27.4375","1200","857","35","63.53","12.0","10.5","11.55","14.0","178","15.333333333333334","20.108051341890317","479","25.0","9","0.38","0","28","36","74","0","84","49","2","2","2","125","183","2","39","1","0","28","8","34","0","1","3","22","0","16","43","20","22","10","30","6","4","0","4"

Lyricist Gerry Goffin, whose songwriting partnership in the early 1960s with then-wife Carole King yielded some of the most indelible hits of the era, died of natural causes Thursday at home in Los Angeles, said his wife, Michelle Goffin. He was 75.

Among the hit songs Mr. Goffin wrote with King were ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,"" sung by Aretha Franklin; ""Take Good Care of My Baby,"" performed by Bobby Vee; and ""Up on the Roof,"" sung by The Drifters.

But perhaps their most enduring song was their first smash hit. It was in 1960, not long after the couple had their first child. Mr. Goffin came home one night from a bowling excursion with his buddies to find a note on the tape recorder from King, asking him to write lyrics for a melody she had composed for the girl group the Shirelles. Mr. Goffin said the lyrics came easily.

You give your love so sweetly,

Tonight, the light of love is in your eyes,

But will you love me tomorrow?""

""Will You Love Me Tomorrow,"" which hit the top of the charts in January 1961, showcased Mr. Goffin's sensitivity as a lyricist, a trait that would resonate in many of the duo's best songs.

""His words expressed what so many people were feeling but didn't know how to say,"" said King in a statement Thursday.

Childhood lyricist

Mr. Goffin was born on Feb. 11, 1939, in Brooklyn, N.Y., and began writing lyrics as a child. But he was a chemistry major at Queens College when he met fellow student and aspiring songwriter King, then known as Carol Klein. Despite his major, Mr. Goffin was working on a musical about beatniks, and was looking for someone to compose the music. King was looking for a partner to provide thoughtful lyrics for her infectious rock melodies.

The two struck up a creative partnership, meeting in the lounge at Queens College to write music together. ""Eventually it came to be a boy-and-girl relationship,"" Mr. Goffin recalled in a 2001 interview with Vanity Fair. ""Eventually I began to lose heart in my play, and we stuck to writing rock 'n' roll.""

They married in August 1959.

Troubled marriage

Together, King and Mr. Goffin wrote more than 50 top-40 hits and became one of the most successful songwriting duos of the many working in and around the Brill Building. For a while, it seemed they could do no wrong, professionally. They even enlisted their babysitter, Eva Boyd (stage name, Little Eva, to sing their song ""The Loco-Motion,"" which became a No. 1 hit and spawned a dance craze.

Throughout the 1960s, Mr. Goffin and King's music evolved with the changing tastes of the era, and their songs were recorded by artists as diverse as the Chiffons, Dusty Springfield, Vee, the Animals and The Byrds.

But the King-Goffin marriage was troubled. Mr. Goffin struggled with mental health problems exacerbated by his use of hallucinogenic drugs; at one point, King made the anguished decision to admit him for shock therapy, an experience detailed in her memoir, ""A Natural Woman.""

His extramarital relationship with singer Jeanie McCrea Reavis of the girl group the Cookies led to the birth of a daughter in 1964.

The fruitful but troubled relationship between King and Mr. Goffin, which ended in divorce in 1968 as their growing lifestyle differences became irreconcilable, is the subject of the current Broadway hit ""Beautiful: The Carole King Musical."" The show won two Tonys earlier this month.

After the breakup, King went on to have a successful solo career. Her 1971 album ""Tapestry"" was one of the best-selling of all time.

Other collaborators

Mr. Goffin wrote with several other collaborators, including Michael Masser, with whom he earned an Oscar nomination for ""Theme From Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)"" sung by Diana Ross. Masser and Mr. Goffin also wrote ""Saving All My Love for You,"" for which Whitney Houston won her first Grammy in 1986.

And with Barry Goldberg, he wrote ""I've Got to Use My Imagination"" for Gladys Knight & The Pips and ""It's Not the Spotlight"" for Rod Stewart. ""Gerry was one of the greatest lyricists of all time and my true soul brother,"" Goldberg said in a statement Thursday.

Goffin also released two solo albums, but they were not successful.

He and King were admitted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

""Carole loved me for what I was,"" Mr. Goffin said in a United Press International interview in 1996. ""I've had a lot of guilt. It's been almost 30 years, and I'm finally feeling expurgated.

""I feel like I've worked it off, but maybe you never work it off.""

Mr. Goffin is survived by his wife, Michele, whom he married in 1995; daughters Louise Goffin, Sherry Goffin Kondor, Dawn Reavis, Lauren Goffin; son Jesse Goffin; and brother Al Goffin.","2014-06-21 16:25:00","0","115.0","5.0","7.0","0.0","58.0","0.0","323.0","290.0","0.0","376.0","0.0","22.0","0","1019","93.74","84.87","17.56","66.62","23.16","20.51","74.19","38.86","8.24","6.08","1.67","0.10","1.08","2.16","1.08","2.16","7.26","13.84","4.22","2.06","4.91","0.69","12.07","3.83","2.36","1.18","3.93","1.77","4.91","3.53","1.37","0.20","0.00","0.20","13.15","1.37","0.49","1.67","3.83","6.77","2.16","0.88","0.39","1.18","0.69","1.67","5.30","1.37","2.65","0.98","1.96","0.20","0.49","0.29","0.39","9.13","3.04","2.26","3.24","1.28","0.69","6.18","4.32","1.18","12.46","1.57","5.89","5.10","3.83","3.93","0.20","0.49","0.10","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","22.77","5.89","7.16","0.49","0.59","0.10","0.00","0.69","4.32","2.65","0.49","0.39","4765","7.86","24.093023255813954","1442","1010","56","70.13","10.5","8.0","11.54","11.2","213","10.4","17.635643564356435","543","21.4","13","0.39","0","36","36","80","0","112","42","2","4","3","122","282","2","33","0","0","40","23","26","1","2","4","20","0","22","72","25","12","13","8","5","4","1","3"

Neil Young Rock

Not surprisingly, Neil Young has made another album that’s going to make people scratch their heads, chins and maybe even eyeballs. As a follow-up to April’s “A Letter Home,” which sounded as if it were recorded inside a trash can, “Storytone” — his 35th studio album — was made in a proper studio with a 92-piece orchestra and choir. There are few things more jarring than hearing the 68-year-old Canadian singer’s gruff voice and gnarled guitar chords paired with lavish strings, horns and voices. The 10 songs here mostly linger on either his love of the environment or, perplexingly, his love of cars. Then there are the ones that are simply about love, whether it’s falling apart in the big-band-adorned “Like You Used To,” which may be about his impending divorce from Pegi Young (“I couldn’t satisfy you/ Just couldn’t show you my love”), or just flaring up in the swooning “I’m Glad I Found You” (“It took me so long just to find you/ Right where we belong”), which is probably about his new romance with Daryl Hannah. As always, there’s something endearing about his blunt, no-filter approach to songwriting, but the production’s heavy schmaltz undermines his passion at every turn. — Aidin Vaziri

Phoenix --

Charles H. Keating Jr., the notorious financier who served prison time and was disgraced for his role in the costliest savings and loan failure of the 1980s, has died.

Keating, 90, died late Monday in a Phoenix hospital, a family member reported. The cause of death was not released.

When Mr. Keating's Phoenix-based home construction company, American Continental Corp., bought Lincoln Savings & Loan in 1984, the multimillionaire elevated its worth from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion in a four-year period.

Junk bonds

But his financial empire crumbled with state and federal convictions for defrauding investors. Mr. Keating allegedly bilked Lincoln customers by selling them $200 million of unsecured junk bonds. They became worthless when Mr. Keating's company became bankrupt.

The thrift's collapse cost taxpayers $2.6 billion and tarnished the reputations of five senators who became known as the ""Keating Five.""

As the public heard testimony of elderly bondholders who had lost their life savings, Mr. Keating became a national poster boy for corporate greed. Mr. Keating was convicted in both state and federal court, but the convictions were thrown out and he agreed to a plea deal that freed him after nearly five years in prison.

Though Mr. Keating insisted he was a symbol of the common man, he was known more for an extravagant lifestyle. Mr. Keating received $19.4 million in salary, stock purchases and other compensation over five years, ending in 1988.

His company provided luxuries like the use of a $5 million refurbished Florida estate. The corporation picked up the tab for lavish events like a 1986 Christmas party at which nearly $2,000 was spent on Silly String alone.

As the savings and loan institution's profits rose, the Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco began looking into investment activity in 1986. The examination was the beginning of numerous conflicts between Mr. Keating and federal regulators.

By April 1989, American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection - one day before federal regulators seized Lincoln for alleged bad business practice. The government said Mr. Keating made land swap deals to fabricate real estate profits.

Through a tax-sharing agreement, American Continental siphoned off $94 million of federally insured deposits in the form of deferred taxes never actually paid to the Internal Revenue Service.

The 'Keating Five'

The scandal also shook the political world. Five senators who received campaign donations from Mr. Keating - Democrat Alan Cranston of California, Republican John McCain of Arizona, Democrat John Glenn of Ohio, Democrat Donald Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Democrat Dennis DeConcini of Arizona - were accused of impropriety for appealing to regulators on Mr. Keating's behalf in 1987.

In 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee formally reprimanded Cranston for ""improper and repugnant"" dealings with Mr. Keating. DeConcini and Riegle received rebukes. Glenn and McCain were criticized less severely.","2014-04-02 18:12:00","0","105.0","3.0","7.0","0.0","58.0","0.0","319.0","292.0","0.0","378.0","0.0","22.0","0","683","97.61","65.92","14.46","23.48","20.70","32.94","60.91","28.99","3.07","1.76","0.00","0.00","0.29","1.02","0.44","1.32","6.44","12.45","2.20","1.90","3.81","0.59","8.35","3.81","2.34","1.17","6.00","0.44","3.95","1.90","2.05","0.15","0.59","0.88","5.56","0.29","0.00","0.15","1.46","4.25","1.46","1.17","0.00","0.29","0.15","1.17","2.05","1.32","0.29","0.29","1.61","0.15","0.88","0.00","0.59","5.71","0.73","0.73","3.95","0.59","0.73","5.71","2.05","0.15","13.03","1.17","6.73","5.56","5.71","1.02","0.44","5.86","0.15","1.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.18","6.88","4.25","0.88","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.90","0.73","1.76","0.59","2.20","3512","8.44","26.76923076923077","1069","672","41","54.83","12.3","9.7","14.38","12.7","170","12.25","18.67904761904762","396","23.85","13","0.29","0","18","44","45","0","75","34","1","2","0","88","207","3","34","0","0","8","6","17","1","0","2","9","0","4","47","15","21","1","6","2","4","0","2"

Chelsea Manning, the U.S. Army private convicted of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, is suing the federal government to receive appropriate medical care for the gender disorder she was diagnosed with in 2010, the ACLU said Tuesday.

Manning, who formerly went by the name Bradley Manning, was convicted of multiple counts of espionage for leaking more than 700,000 wartime documents and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, in a move that sparked debates about the Obama administration’s prosecution of whistle-blowers.

In the suit, the American Civil Liberties Union contends that Army medical personnel diagnosed Manning with gender dysphoria in 2010, an identity disorder where a person rejects the gender they were assigned with at birth.

Manning is suing to receive hormone therapy, permission to follow female grooming standards and access to a doctor trained to deal with her condition.

“The government continues to deny Ms. Manning’s access to necessary medical treatment for gender dysphoria, without which she will continue to suffer severe psychological harms,” Chase Strangio, an attorney with the ACLU Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgender project, said in a statement. “Such clear disregard of well-established medical protocols constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.”

The suit contends the Army has taken little to no action in response to several requests from Manning to be treated as a female and to receive proper treatment for gender dysphoria.

Manning had previously petitioned to be transferred to a civilian prison facility, but Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel rejected the Army’s request to have Manning moved, according to the lawsuit.

Manning is also trying to obtain appropriate psychological therapy, according to the lawsuit.","2014-09-23 17:12:00","0","97.0","2.0","7.0","0.0","58.0","0.0","313.0","292.0","0.0","378.0","0.0","22.0","0","539","98.61","71.12","6.04","20.18","31.71","35.25","62.34","31.54","2.78","1.48","0.00","0.00","0.37","0.93","0.19","1.30","7.98","13.73","3.15","2.04","2.78","0.37","9.09","4.27","1.67","0.74","2.78","0.93","3.71","1.67","2.04","0.00","0.74","0.56","6.12","0.19","0.00","1.67","0.19","3.34","0.74","0.74","0.19","0.74","0.37","0.56","3.71","2.23","0.56","0.74","5.01","0.93","2.97","0.37","0.74","6.68","0.19","0.74","4.45","0.93","0.56","2.60","5.75","0.56","11.50","2.97","5.38","3.90","3.15","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.74","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","17.81","5.94","5.57","1.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.48","0.93","1.48","0.37","0.93","2810","9.14","36.8","891","531","21","37.34","15.5","14.3","15.15","17.3","143","7.25","22.892128060263655","297","31.33","25","0.32","0","11","13","46","0","51","38","2","2","2","82","156","1","22","0","0","7","2","8","1","0","0","25","0","16","15","20","14","1","13","2","1","0","1"

WASHINGTON — Alarmed by increasing encounters between small drones and manned aircraft, drone industry officials said Monday they are teaming up with the government and model aircraft hobbyists to launch a safety campaign.

The campaign includes a website — www.knowbeforeyoufly.com — which advises both recreational and commercial drone operators of FAA regulations and how to fly their aircraft safely. The campaign was announced by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International and the Small UAV Coalition, both industry trade groups, and the Academy of Model Aeronautics, which represents model aircraft hobbyists, in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration.

The two industry trade groups also said they plan to distribute safety pamphlets at industry events, and are working with drone manufacturers to see that safety information is enclosed inside the package of new drones.

Retailers say small drones, which are indistinguishable from today’s more sophisticated model aircraft, are flying off the shelves this Christmas.

ST. LOUIS, Mo. — People protesting the Ferguson, Mo., grand jury decision took to the streets in some U.S. cities for a second day Tuesday, even as others were still cleaning up vandalism from the night before.

Protesters disrupted traffic for several hours in downtown St. Louis by blocking major intersections, an interstate highway and a Mississippi River bridge connecting the city to Illinois.

Riot police arrested several demonstrators who sat in the middle of Interstate 44 near the Edward Jones Dome. They used pepper spray to disperse the crowd.

Aiming to head off another night of looting and arson fires, Gov. Jay Nixon called in reinforcements Tuesday in an effort to quell the violence that gripped Ferguson after a grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson, a white police officer, in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager.

In the aftermath of Monday’s violence, Nixon more than tripled the number of Guard soldiers sent to the St. Louis suburb, ordering the initial force of 700 to be increased to 2,200 in hopes that their presence would help local law enforcement keep order in the St. Louis suburb.

“Lives and property must be protected,” Nixon said. “This community deserves to have peace.”

About 50 protesters converged on a barricade guarded by 30 Guard members. The group chanted “Whose streets, our streets,” ''This is what democracy looks like” and “Hands up don’t shoot,” a slogan that has become a rallying cry in protests over police killings.

Meanwhile, Wilson said he couldn’t have done anything differently to have prevented the 18-year-old’s shooting death. He made his first public statements Tuesday during an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos.

He told Stephanopoulos he has a clean conscience because “I know I did my job right.” He told Stephanopoulos that Brown’s shooting marked the first time he had used his gun.

As Gov. Nixon met Tuesday with law enforcement and National Guard officials, he came under criticism from the mayor of Ferguson, James Knowles, for not deploying the guard quickly enough to save some of the businesses that burned.

Later Tuesday, lawyers for Brown’s family vowed to push for federal charges against Wilson and said the grand jury process was rigged from the start to clear Wilson. They questioned the close relationship between the police and prosecutors in St. Louis County — which family lawyers said tainted the investigation.

“We have the local prosecutor who has a symbiotic relationship with the local police and the local police officers,” said Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family.

In New York, a man was arrested for throwing a jar full of fake blood that struck Police Commissioner William Bratton and his security detail. Mostly peaceful protesters swarmed through traffic, closely trailed by police, as they marched to Times Square for a rally. Other protesters shut down the Lincoln Tunnel, according to CNN.

After a night of rallies in Chicago, dozens of protesters upset with the grand jury’s decision camped out at the doors of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s office inside City Hall and planned to remain there overnight. They were holding teach-ins on political issues and “healing circles” for people to discuss experiences with violence in Chicago.

In Seattle, hundreds of students walked out of high school classes and rallied at the University of Washington or marched to the downtown federal courthouse. The night before, demonstrators in the city threw canned food, bottles and rocks after marching peacefully for hours. Police responded with pepper spray and flash-bang grenades, and arrested five people.

In Los Angeles, demonstrations remained mostly small and peaceful, but about 200 people marching toward downtown briefly shut down Interstate 110, City News Service reported.

Police Chief Charlie Beck said Tuesday there were no injuries and no property damage during hours-long demonstrations across LA. Three people were arrested.

“Mike Brown is an emblem (of a movement). This country is at its boiling point,” said Ethan Jury, a protester in Philadelphia, where hundreds marched. “How many people need to die?

While we're pretty much convinced you can't go wrong with when it comes to hiking in Marin, there are some areas you undoubtedly must visit at least once.

Considering Marin's seemingly endless selection of open space and trails, creating a list of the best hikes the county has to offer was no easy feat. But we gave it a shot, selecting a mix of cardio-pumping routes and easy flat trails that are kid friendly.

In the above slideshow we've highlighted what we consider the best hikes in Marin.

These hikes range from more intense all-day treks to little half-day loops. We also included a range of scenery, including well-forested parts of Mount Tamalapais, the shores of Point Reyes National Seashore or a sunny spot in central Marin that's the perfect escape during a cold and foggy day in San Francisco.

Take a look through the above slideshow (captions include links to Google Maps of the hikes) and tell us in the comments if you agree with our top picks.

One caveat: We skipped some other superior hikes that already have nightmarish parking or trailheads that are locals-only secrets we promised not to spill (don't worry, most of these also fell in the category of not being able to handle a large influx of visitors).

Hiking safety tips you probably already know but should still read:

We recommend always carrying plenty of water, extra layers, some snacks (trail mix or protein-loaded bars) and being extra mindful of your surroundings and how much daylight you have left. Trailheads in some of these featured areas can reach very remote areas and it's not uncommon for hikers to get lost. Also, keep in mind that you may not always have cell phone service.

And, remember, even though you aren't far from San Francisco, you are hiking in the wild. We don't want to deter you, but there's rattlesnakes, powerful sneaker waves on the Pacific Coast, poison oak and lots of wild animals. (In the very unlikely chance you see a mountain lion, make yourself as big and loud as possible. Do not run away!) But, seriously, don't worry. Keep in mind that there are very few serious hiking incidents.

Want more hikes?

If you really want to familiarize yourself with Marin County hiking, there's a book by Don and Kay Martin called ""Hiking Marin."" We have the third edition and it includes 141 hikes. Many of the hikes in this slideshow were discovered via this book. It's a great resource.

Here's a map showing the general location of each of the featured hikes.

MADERA --

Hilario Santiago Vasquez came to California during a surge of 1980s immigration to follow the crops from the Central Valley to Oregon to Florida. Along the way, he picked grapes, blueberries and oranges.

""I slept under the bridge, covering myself with a newspaper, because there was no housing to rent for farmworkers,"" he said.

Santiago Vasquez, one of millions who helped Hispanics become California's largest racial or ethnic group, no longer chases harvests.

Like many other Mexican farmworkers, he found permanent work. He now lives in Madera, a town north of Fresno where 80 percent of the 61,000 residents are Latino and the downtown is packed with Mexican restaurants and stores that sell cowboy boots and tortillas.

Positive demographics

His story illustrates a reality for California Hispanics: With the immigrant boom ending long ago, they are older and more settled than elsewhere. As a result, they have relatively high rates of home ownership, rising incomes and are better educated.

""We're running 15 to 20 years ahead of the nation,"" said Dowell Myers, a demography and urban planning professor at the University of Southern California. ""California has a large population of second-generation children who are now coming of age. The rest of the country doesn't have that.""

As California joins New Mexico next year as a state where Latinos make up the largest racial or ethnic group, other regions of the country are seeing stronger growth. Latino arrivals are reshaping the Midwest and South, just as they did California a generation ago.

Following the work

Santiago Vasquez, 47, fled after Mexico's economy collapsed in 1982, at the same time Central Americans abandoned their homes as civil wars spread. He came to California in 1985 to work in the fields, following other migrants who were pushed north by poverty from villages in the Mexican state of Oaxaca.

They poured into Los Angeles' Koreatown, San Francisco's Mission District and other urban enclaves, joining Hispanics who came to California in previous generations - some tracing their roots back to when the state was part of Mexico. The arrivals told those back home that jobs were waiting.

Rosa Lopez, 45, was one of them. She knew she wasn't cut out for work on her family's Oaxacan ranch and followed her cousin to San Diego 25 years ago. ""Once I arrived here, I never thought about going back,"" said Lopez, who got a green card through her husband and became an American citizen.

As defense jobs dwindled in the aftermath of the Cold War, however, and the 1990s recession hit harder than in other states, new arrivals from Mexico and Central America increasingly shunned California for states where job prospects were better and housing was cheaper.

The number of people living in the country illegally tripled in Iowa from 2000 to 2010, nearly doubled in Ohio and surged 55 percent in North Carolina, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.

""Once there's an immigrant beachhead, other people move in. ... In the South, first people broke the ice and others followed,"" said Manuel Pastor, director of USC's Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.

In California, the previous generation of Hispanic immigrants transformed communities, such as Madera. Latino farmworkers settled near downtown, as whites moved to suburban subdivisions.

Family reunion

Santiago Vasquez brought his wife and three daughters from Mexico in 2002, and rented an apartment in downtown Madera. He ended his annual tradition of picking blueberries in Oregon a few summers later and found a year-round job with a company that grows almonds and pistachios.

A lack of temporary housing in other states discouraged farmworkers like Santiago from chasing the harvests, said Philip Martin, professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California at Davis. Some farmworkers settled in states such as Oregon and Washington, meaning fewer migrants were needed.

Santiago Vasquez earns about $11,000 a year, a reminder that Latinos lag other groups on the income ladder. Latinos had a median household income of $44,401 in 2011 - well below the statewide median of $58,328. Many work in low-skilled jobs.

Lopez makes about $32,000 a year cleaning offices seven days a week in San Diego. Despite her financial struggles, she recently bought a three-bedroom condominium. Sixty percent of California's Latinos who have been in the U.S. at least 30 years are homeowners, six points above the state average, according to USC's Myers.

""I wasn't thinking of buying, but then I can't be throwing my money into the trash,"" she said.

Lopez didn't finish high school in Mexico. Her children attend San Diego State University and community college. California's high school dropout rate among Hispanics is 16.2 percent in 2012 - compared to 13.2 percent overall - but the education gap is closing.

Degree of success

Marjorie Garcia, 36, worked three jobs to put herself through California State University Northridge and now practices entertainment law in Los Angeles. It is a far cry from her childhood in a rough neighborhood of Los Angeles, where her family had a two-bedroom apartment.

Her father came to California from Mexico when he was 18 and her mother came from Guatemala when she was 15, and both stayed illegally. He worked at a Thai restaurant as a busboy and as a wait staff supervisor at the Los Angeles Country Club. She cleaned houses.

""I feel like I did what I was supposed to do,"" said Garcia, whose parents had only an elementary school education. ""You're supposed to go to school and get educated.""

Omar Martinez, the son of Mexican immigrants who grew up bilingual and bicultural in suburban Los Angeles, is an American success story. As a teenager, he listened more to Milli Vanilli than the Mexican music of his parents but came to appreciate his family's culture as he grew older.

Ties to past

Martinez still has family in Zacatecas state, and heads the Federation for Zacatecans in Southern California - a group that raises money for public works projects in the Mexican state. The organization was started by migrants to California years ago, and Martinez is its first American-born president.

Now 42, he employs 50 people at Miravalle Foods in El Monte, which posted more than $7 million in revenues last year selling tamarind, curry, chiles and other Mexican cooking staples to supermarkets in California, Colorado and Utah. He is raising four children to speak English and Spanish - and two of them are also learning Chinese.

""The other day they congratulated (my daughter) because she knows the numbers 1 to 100 in Chinese,"" he said in his office overlooking a pungent warehouse as workers slapped stickers on boxes.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A week after saying it was justified in snooping through a blogger's Hotmail account to track down a leaker of company software, Microsoft has changed course, saying it will refer such matters to law enforcement starting immediately.

The reversal, explained by general counsel Brad Smith in a blog post Friday, follows last week's revelation that it searched through emails and instant messages of a blogger who Microsoft believed had received proprietary code illegally.

The search, in September 2012, led to Alex Kibkalo, a Russian native who worked for Microsoft as a software architect in Lebanon. Microsoft turned over the case to the FBI in July 2013.

Smith now says the company ""will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves"" and will refer the matter to law enforcement if it believes its services are being used to facilitate theft of Microsoft property.

Microsoft Corp. owns Hotmail and the cloud storage service formerly known as SkyDrive. It alleged that the services were used so Kibkalo could transfer software files to the blogger, including a fix for the Windows 8 RT operating system that hadn't been released publicly.

The case spawned a wave of criticism, and Microsoft initially responded to it by saying that it would consult with an outside attorney who is a former judge to determine if a court order would be issued in similar searches in the future.

Many saw its initial response as inadequate.

""Last week's response was trying to create a mimic of due process with a shadow court that was run by Microsoft,"" said Kurt Opsahl, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocate. ""It was good to see Microsoft reconsidered.""

Smith said the company would also change its terms of service to make it clear what customers can expect, and consult with privacy advocates to come up with industry best practices going forward.

Shares of the Redmond, Wash., company rose 94 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $40.30.

Sacramento -- A state lawmaker wants California to join a growing number of states that are examining a college financing system that flips the current model on its head.

Where colleges typically charge tuition and fees prior to enrollment, the new model instead would have students pay after they finish through fixed payroll deductions.

The ""pay it forward, pay it back"" model is catching the attention of educators, lawmakers and students nationally, with nearly a dozen states considering different variations. Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer, D-South Los Angeles, introduced a bill last week asking the state to study whether the model should be offered to some Californians.

The idea is that after college, students would contribute a portion of their earnings - from 1.5 percent to 4 percent - to an education trust for about 20 years. That trust would fund future generations of students.

""It's Social Security turned upside down,"" said John Burbank, executive director of the Economic Opportunity Institute, a Seattle-based liberal think tank that began researching and marketing the model as debt-free access to higher education. ""Here you get your benefits right away, then contribute.""

But the idea isn't without its critics. Some education policy experts warn that high-income graduates could wind up paying thousands more for their education than if tuition was paid up front. They also fear that taxpayers could be asked to cover initial startup costs or that schools would have a hard time seeking payroll deductions if former students moved out of state.

A coalition of education groups - including the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the American Association of University Professors, and the American Federation of Teachers - have voiced strong criticism of the model, saying it further shifts the cost of higher education on students and families. They believe states should instead improve funding for public colleges and universities and increase need-based student aid.

""The Pay It Forward model puts a tiny Band-Aid on a gaping wound without doing anything to stop the cause of the bleeding,"" said Sara Goldrick-Rab, an associate professor of educational policy studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has studied the model and says more students are taking on debt due to rising college costs. ""This policy sounds far better than it really is.""

But supporters believe the model could open doors for students who otherwise would not consider college. That includes households where there is a cultural or familial aversion to taking on substantial debt, said Isaac Bowers of Equal Justice Works, a Washington, D.C., group of lawyers that represents underserved communities and causes.

""The opportunity to go and repay later is pretty innovative and may break down some of those barriers to access,"" Bowers said.

The cost of attending California's public universities and community colleges has doubled since 2007, although tuition and fees remain among the lowest in the country and graduates, on average, borrow less than students in most states.

Students at California's public and non-profit colleges rank 48th in student debt. Half of California's undergraduates finish with debt that averages $20,300, according to statistics in Gov. Jerry Brown's budget proposal for the 2014-15 fiscal year. Nationally, 70 percent of undergraduates finish with debt, which averages $29,400.

Proponents argue that the model does not have to replace current college financing models, but instead can be used as another option to students.

""We came up with this idea and it seems to have struck a nerve since there is a lot of interest,"" Burbank said. ""Both Republicans and Democrats have children. They see these rising costs of tuition and are freaked out by it. This may have some mileage that is bipartisan.""

Last month, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, introduced legislation in the U.S. Senate that would help states implement the program. Under Merkley's Pay It Forward College Affordability Act of 2013, students would still have the option of concurrently participating while taking out federal loans, receiving federal grants and other aid from public and private sources.

The Oregon Legislature unanimously passed a bill in July to create a study committee that will develop a pilot program for the pay-it-forward model, with lawmakers deciding in 2015 whether to implement the plan. Since then, officials in several other states have begun exploring whether they should be exploring the model, too.

In California, AB1456 calls on the state's public university and community college systems and Student Aid Commission to study the model to determine whether a pilot program should be created through future legislation.

AB1456 is scheduled to be heard in the California Assembly later this month or in early February.","2014-01-21 18:22:00","0","106.0","3.0","7.0","0.0","56.0","0.0","320.0","278.0","0.0","304.0","0.0","21.0","0","900","93.25","60.53","32.84","48.44","25.00","29.56","77.78","38.67","5.89","1.33","0.00","0.11","0.44","0.00","0.78","4.56","7.22","12.89","5.78","2.22","5.22","0.56","12.11","4.33","2.78","1.11","2.00","2.22","3.22","2.22","1.00","0.22","0.44","0.11","6.00","0.22","0.00","0.11","0.11","10.11","2.00","1.78","2.00","2.22","0.00","3.22","1.89","0.33","1.11","0.33","1.44","0.44","0.67","0.00","0.44","10.11","1.44","1.11","6.11","1.33","0.67","2.11","6.67","1.22","15.11","2.44","7.22","6.44","10.44","0.56","0.33","4.78","0.00","0.44","0.11","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.00","4.44","5.00","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.56","1.89","1.44","0.00","0.22","4645","8.79","26.88235294117647","1435","880","39","48.54","14.4","12.1","14.97","15.8","225","12.875","21.26727272727273","500","24.29","16","0.36","0","32","16","77","0","98","51","6","4","18","133","147","6","67","0","0","19","6","29","1","0","8","24","0","38","21","31","17","21","28","10","2","0","2"

SACRAMENTO — A California lawmaker is attempting to force four high schools in the Golden State that use “Redskins” as their mascots to abandon the controversial name.

Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Watsonville, introduced AB30 this month, giving public schools until 2017 to phase out the use of the Redskins as mascots. It is the third time the Legislature will consider similar statewide bans on Indian-themed mascots since 2002.

Alejo’s bill would specifically affect four holdout schools that are the remaining campuses in the state using the mascot. Those schools are Gustine High School in Merced County, Calaveras High School in Calaveras County, Chowchilla Union High School in Madera County and Tulare Union High School in Tulare County.

Sarah Koligian, superintendent of the Tulare Joint Union High School District, and other school leaders say their communities take great pride in their Redskins mascot.

“Tulare Union Redskins are part of a long and proud tradition dating back to 1890,” Koligian said. “Our school has worked closely with our local Indian tribes to include them in the discussion regarding how the Tulare Union Redskin depicts both pride and respect.”

Other schools have dropped Redskins as a mascot amid increasing protests from those who say the term is offensive. The issue resurfaced this season in the NFL, which saw protesters gather outside games played by the Washington, D.C., team to lobby for it to change its mascot. The Assembly passed a resolution by Alejo in August urging the team to make a change.

Alejo said “singling out the Native American community” for the mockery and taunts that mascots are often subjected to is discriminatory.

In 2002, American Indians began pushing legislation in California to ban the use of mascots like Redskins, Chiefs, Comanches, Indians and Braves after years of taking their protests to individual school boards to appeal for changes.

That bill by Jackie Goldberg, a then-Assemblywoman from Los Angeles, failed in the Legislature in 2002. Goldberg narrowed the bill to only ban the use of Redskins, which the Legislature passed in 2004. However, then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed that bill, saying “decisions regarding athletic team names, nicknames or mascots should be retained at the local level.”

“This is long overdue,” Alejo said. “The bill gives a reasonable amount of time to prepare and phase out their mascots.”

Under the AB30, all public schools would be prohibited from using the term Redskins as a school or athletic team mascot beginning Jan. 1, 2017, unless a tribe within the boundaries of the school has authorized the use of the name.

To save on the cost of changing the mascot, schools would be allowed to continue to use uniforms and other materials with the Redskins mascot if the item was purchased before the bill became effective. New purchases would bear the new mascot, however. The state may be obligated to pay for some of the costs associated with new school and athletic supplies.

“It’s a small thing we can do in California that is part of a national movement to phase out the use of racial slurs as mascots,” Alejo said.

FERGUSON — Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has named 16 members to the Ferguson Commission Tuesday, including SIUE Professor of Public Administration T.R. Carr Jr.

“The members of the Ferguson Commission are tough, they are smart, they are empowered and they are independent,” Nixon said in a release. “Their most important work will not be what is written on sheets of paper or on a website. Their most important work will be the changes we see in our institutions and our work places, in our communities and in our interactions with one another. Change of this magnitude is hard; but maintaining the status quo is simply not acceptable.”

According to Carr’s biography on the SIUE website, he is a professor and program director at the Department of Public Administration and Policy Analysis at SIUE. He is also a Senior Research Fellow with the Institute of Urban Research at SIUE. He has an MPA and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Oklahoma. He recently completed the “Vision 2020”, a federally-funded Department of Labor project through the Madison County Workforce Investment Board in cooperation with the Mid American Workforce Investment Board.

In the St. Louis area, Carr has served as mayor of Hazelwood, MO for three terms from April 2000 to May 2009. He served as president of the St. Louis County Municipal League, Secretary-Treasurer of the Metro Mayors of Greater St. Louis and served on the East-West Gateway Council of Governments Board of Directors.

Because of his service to the St. Louis region, he has received the Buzz Westfall Award for Excellence in Leadership from the St. Louis County Municipal League as well.

“My goal is to build bridges, build relationships, help advance Ferguson, North County and the St. Louis region,” Carr said to St. Louis Positive Change, the official site for the Ferguson Commission. “Our challenge is to build trust between the public, law enforcement and local government. I believe my background and skills will contribute to the effectiveness of the Ferguson Commission. I live in North County, served as mayor of Hazelwood for nine years, am a graduate of McCluer High School and a professor of public policy at SIUE. The issues that emerged in Ferguson require thoughtful deliberation with a range of voices on the commission. It is important to effectively communicate with the law enforcement community as strategies are developed for this region. I can help serve as a bridge in the area.”

The Ferguson Commission will be responsible for issuing a report with policy recommendations in the areas of: citizen-law enforcement interaction and relations, racial and ethnic relations, municipal government organization and the municipal court system, and disparities in areas including education, economic opportunity, housing, transportation, health care, child care, business ownership, family and community stability.

Nixon has given the commission until Sept. 15, 2015, to issue its reports, but said that he would welcome any interim recommendations for positive steps that can be taken prior to the completion of its final report. The commission has been given $100,000 from the Missouri Development Finance Board for operating costs, research and other expenses. Funding is also coming from private sources. The commission will operate from space provided by Washington University.

Besides Carr, the commission has selected 15 other individuals from the list of more than 300 applicants and nominations. They are:

Rev. Starsky Wilson, CEO of the Deconess Foundation

Rich McClure, former president and COO of Unigroup

Rev. Traci Blackmon, pastor of Christ the King United Church of Christ.

Dan Isom II, director of the Missouri Department of Public Safety

Scott Negwer, president of Negwer Materials in Ferguson

Bethany Johnson-Javois, CEO of the St. Louis Integrated Health Network

Gabriel E. Gore, attorney and partner at the law firm of Dowd Bennett, LLC

Brittany Packnett, executive director of Teach for America

Rose Windmiller, assistant vice chancellor for government & community relations at Washington University

Rasheen Aldridge, Jr., community organizer and director of Young Activists United

Grayling Tobias, superintendent of the Hazelwood School District

Felicia Pulliam, director of development for FOCUS St. Louis and Ferguson resident.

Kevin Ahlbrand, detective sergeant with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and president of the Missouri State Fraternal Order of Police.

Patrick Sly, executive vice-president at Emerson

“These 16 men and women bring to the table a rich diversity of life experience and points of view-business owners and not-for-profit leaders; teachers and lawyers; police officers and activists; pastors and public servants,” Nixon said in a release. “But while they are clearly a diverse group, they are united by their shared passion to promote understanding, to hasten healing, to ensure equal opportunities in education and employment and to safeguard the civil rights of all our citizens.”","2014-11-17 22:00:00","1","96.0","2.0","7.0","0.0","56.0","0.0","298.0","294.0","0.0","304.0","0.0","21.0","0","926","97.09","77.19","7.90","80.55","20.13","30.99","70.41","36.83","4.86","3.35","0.54","0.76","0.22","0.86","0.97","1.51","7.56","14.47","4.32","0.97","5.51","0.32","7.34","3.78","1.94","0.22","1.62","0.97","3.56","3.24","0.22","0.00","0.22","0.00","8.42","0.43","0.22","0.32","1.40","4.32","1.08","1.19","0.22","0.54","0.54","1.08","1.51","0.43","0.54","0.32","1.94","0.22","1.30","0.11","0.43","12.63","3.67","1.51","7.13","1.08","0.32","1.84","5.18","0.86","10.91","1.40","7.13","2.38","11.02","0.43","0.43","1.51","0.54","0.43","0.22","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.11","0.00","16.85","5.40","6.48","0.65","0.43","0.00","0.00","1.40","1.62","0.65","0.00","0.22","4814","8.94","31.066666666666666","1511","912","47","43.32","14.5","12.0","14.79","14.3","251","12.0","20.768771929824563","495","26.0","29","0.36","0","39","15","76","0","116","37","1","2","8","125","295","2","50","0","0","20","12","15","0","2","0","18","0","20","13","14","16","16","17","2","1","0","0"

What you'll see: On crystal-clear days in early spring, the view from the top of 4,343-foot Mount St. Helena can make life seem complete. On the best days, you can see the snow glisten white on the Sierra Crest 150 miles to the east. Closer to home, Mount Tamalpais and Mount Diablo rise to the south in the Bay Area. Lake Berryessa is below to the east, and the Napa Valley plunges to the south. Several times in the spring, I've seen the clear outline of Lassen Peak to the northeast.

Location: 7 miles north of Calistoga, at the border of northern Napa, eastern Sonoma and southern Lake counties.

The hike: 10.2-mile round trip, with a 2,068-foot elevation gain on the way up. The route emerges from oak woodlands on a dirt service road. The climb is steady with two steep spots. Four miles in, continue straight at a junction to the North Peak (a left takes you to the 4,003-foot South Peak).

Trail time: Strong hikers will make the summit in about 2 1/2 to 3 hours, with the last half hour strenuous, and then return downhill in about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

On-the-spot note: In spring, bring a windbreaker for the often-chilly breezes out of the north at the top and a change of shirts for the one you will likely soak with sweat during the climb, especially if you carry a pack.

Dogs, mountain bikes: No dogs are permitted, per state parks policy. Mountain bikes are allowed, but it's a very challenging ride.

History lesson: The mountain is in Robert Louis Stevenson State Park, so named because this is where Stevenson, the author of ""Treasure Island,"" spent his summer honeymoon in 1880, in a cabin long since gone. The cabin site is off a spur (hikers only), 1.5 miles in, marked along the trail to the top.

Cost: Parking, access are free.

When conservationist John Muir returned from the wild in 1890, he and his wife settled in Martinez, on his father-in-law's 2,600-acre fruit ranch. Today, you can visit his home and see his ""scribble den,"" 9 acres of the orchard and the historic Martinez Adobe home.

If you want more exercise, take a 2.4-mile hike and climb nearby Mount Wanda, where Muir tramped with his two daughters.

The John Muir National Historic Site is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. It is closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. There is no admission fee. For more information, call (925) 228-8860 or go to www.nps.gov/jomu.

Visitor center and grounds

Start at the Visitor Center at 4202 Alhambra Ave. Here you will find a helpful ranger, books and T-shirts for sale, clean restrooms and, best of all, a fascinating 20-minute movie about John Muir's life. If you are planning to climb Mount Wanda, ask the ranger for a trail map. Exit the back of the visitor center to begin a tour of the park grounds.

Wander through the extensive orchard of grapevines and apple, pear, apricot, orange and lemon trees. (You are free to take home fallen fruit.) You can also take a self-guided cell phone tour of the grounds. Tables and benches are there for picnicking.

The Strentzel-Muir House

Take the path uphill to the Strentzel-Muir House. Although John Muir often hiked in the rugged wilderness, the home where he lived was huge and luxurious. Given to him and his wife by his in-laws, Dr. John and Louisiana Strentzel, who had lived in it previously, the Italianate Victorian home is 10,000 square feet and has 17 rooms with 12-foot ceilings. Knowledgeable docents are available to show you around.

The Martinez Adobe

Another ""must-visit"" structure on the grounds is the Martinez Adobe. Don Vicente Martinez was the son of the comandante of the San Francisco Presidio and built this adobe house around 1849. The house passed into the hands of Muir's father-in-law. Later, Muir's daughter Wanda and her husband lived there, and Muir often visited to have dinner and play with his grandchildren.

Today, the adobe features exhibits about the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail. You can learn about de Anza's 1775-1776 journey when he led more than 200 men, women, and children from Sonora, Mexico, to Monterey.

Mount Wanda

Although the trailhead through this 326-acre parcel is only about a quarter mile from the visitor center, you cannot safely walk from one to the other as there is no sidewalk on Alhambra Avenue. Parking for Mount Wanda is at the Caltrans Park and Ride lot next to Franklin Canyon Road. There is also a bus stop here.

During the spring, wildflowers abound. From the summit at 640 feet, you can enjoy sweeping views of Martinez, the Carquinez Strait and Mount Diablo. Pick up the trail (actually a fire road) on Franklin Canyon Road. Past the information kiosk, the road ascends for about a half-mile through bay, oak and buckeyes. Then, split off on the Nature Trail, which is more level and wooded, with benches for resting and a stream trickling along below.

When the Nature Trail ends, turn left back on the fire trail. Then, to get to the summit (more mound than mountain), quickly turn right on another fire road and then left on a path to the top with its 360-degree views. Return to the main fire road and back to the trailhead.

If you go

John Muir National Historic Site: Public transportation: Take the County Connection 98X from the Walnut Creek BART Station or the County Connection 16 from the Concord BART Station. Both buses stop in front of the John Muir Visitor Center. By car from S.F.: Cross the Bay Bridge and continue on Interstate 80 eastbound to Highway 4 eastbound. Exit at Alhambra Avenue, then turn left at the bottom of the ramp. Cross beneath the highway, and the park will be on your left.","2014-03-12 15:38:00","0","105.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","65.0","0.0","390.0","360.0","0.0","557.0","0.0","22.0","0","813","95.20","75.08","50.22","41.33","18.48","19.07","67.40","38.50","4.67","3.32","0.00","0.00","1.72","1.60","0.00","1.35","9.10","12.55","3.57","4.06","6.15","0.37","8.49","3.69","1.85","1.11","3.81","1.23","1.35","1.11","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","7.01","1.60","0.12","0.86","2.21","3.81","0.86","0.62","0.62","0.98","0.25","1.60","2.34","0.98","0.12","0.86","2.83","0.74","1.23","0.00","0.86","3.08","0.49","0.74","1.11","0.98","0.37","2.09","6.52","0.98","20.79","3.08","12.05","6.15","0.37","1.23","1.48","0.37","0.12","0.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.82","6.27","5.78","0.98","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.71","0.62","1.35","0.98","0.12","3703","7.46","19.595238095238095","1070","785","47","71.44","9.7","7.4","11.31","10.4","149","5.125","16.27235668789809","430","17.45","12","0.39","1","34","31","80","3","88","27","5","3","7","120","207","1","31","1","0","19","12","25","0","0","3","19","0","22","23","10","8","14","19","1","1","0","5"

One of November's hottest ballot battles matches two women who swear they're not politicians.

Democrat Betty Yee of Alameda and Republican Ashley Swearengin, mayor of Fresno, both say their race to replace termed-out Democrat John Chiang as state controller is less about partisan labels and more about who can best serve as watchdog over California's precariously balanced economy.

""I'm a wonk, not a politician,"" the 56-year-old Yee protested before appearing at a San Francisco event for Emily's List, a group that supports Democratic women who favor abortion rights.

At a talk before the Sacramento Press Club, Swearengin, 42, also eased away from her party roots, declining to endorse Neel Kashkari, the Republican candidate for governor, and noting that she has never held a partisan office.

""I think voters are looking for an independent view,"" she said.

Protesting the death of Stephon Clark: ‘You murdered a Son’ New York Times

Yet neither Yee nor Swearengin is a political rookie.

Political experience

Yee, who grew up in San Francisco and graduated from Lowell High School and UC Berkeley, was a top budget deputy in the state Department of Finance under Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, served as chief aide to Democrat Carole Migden when Migden was on the state Board of Equalization, and then was elected to two terms of her own on the board.

In the June primary for controller, Yee edged Democratic Assemblyman John Pérez of Los Angeles, who as Assembly speaker was one of the most partisan politicians in California, for the second and last spot on the November ballot.

Swearengin, who finished on top in the primary, was raised in Arkansas before graduating from a Fresno high school and California State University Fresno. After working for the university as community and economic development director, she served as chairwoman for the California Partnership for the San Joaquin Valley, a group established by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, before being elected as Fresno's mayor in 2008. She was re-elected four years later.

Each woman argues that her experience best prepares her for a job that's been described as California's bookkeeper, the person who writes the checks and audits the accounts for the state.

""It's not a sexy job,"" Yee said. ""California is a big, complex state, and state finance is a complex system. But that's the expertise I bring.""

Her time dipping deep into the details of the state budget, along with her years on the Board of Equalization, which runs California's tax system, gives her insight into the details of how the state's finances work, Yee said.

""You need credentials to be the state's fiscal watchdog,"" she said. ""You have to be able to call out before something catastrophic happens.""

That's especially important in this time of term limits, when legislators aren't in Sacramento long enough to develop that type of expertise, Yee said.

""I don't see the controller's job as a political office, but obviously politics has its place,"" Yee said. ""I believe the controller's job is to hold the Legislature accountable to the people ... and be independent enough to call them out.""

Fresno's travails

Swearengin says her efforts to steer Fresno through financial hardships brought on by the housing crunch and the recession, along with her willingness to make the tough choices needed to keep the city solvent, show what she can bring to the controller's office.

The city, with an annual budget of $1 billion, was on the verge of bankruptcy when general-fund revenue plunged 16 percent from 2008 to 2010, she said. But by cutting the budget, eliminating some services, establishing public-private partnerships and taking other measures, Swearengin said, she helped the city return to solvency.

""I'm the right person for this job,"" she said. ""I'll bring to the office direct experience in an executive position, where I was the one person accountable for a 3,200-person workforce and the one person who would take the rap for what happens, good or bad.""

As the person checking the state's books, Swearengin would not only point out potential problems but also find ways that legislators and the state could deal with them, now and down the road, she said.

""I'm not a person who likes to criticize and walk away,"" Swearengin said. Instead, the controller ""needs to make suggestions and fix the problem.""

Being a Republican working with a Legislature that will be overwhelmingly Democratic is an asset, not a problem, she added.

The controller's job ""requires independence, free from the political party in control in Sacramento,"" Swearengin said. ""If something can work, even if it's politically controversial, I'll support it.""

GOP's hope

Although the candidates downplay the politics of the controller's race, that doesn't mean it's not there. Republicans, for example, see Swearengin as their best chance to grab a statewide office, something they've had difficulty doing in recent years.

Aside from Schwarzenegger, Steve Poizner, who spent one term as insurance commissioner, has been the only Republican elected statewide since 2003.

In an invitation to a Piedmont fundraiser in August, Duf Sundheim, former chair of the California Republican Party, described Swearengin as a future star of the party and a candidate who has ""a real chance to win.""

Partisan cash

Both Yee and Swearengin drained their campaign treasuries to get through the primary, but both have been raising money since, with much of the cash coming from the usual partisan sources - unions, women's organizations and education groups for Yee, and deep-pocketed individual donors for Swearengin.

And while the controller's office might not seem like a major political plum, it has been an important step up for a number of politicians.

Republican Tom Kuchel and Democrat Alan Cranston each served as controller before moving up to the U.S. Senate, and Davis, a former controller, was elected governor.","2014-09-09 15:47:00","0","125.0","2.0","7.0","0.0","67.0","0.0","369.0","335.0","0.0","468.0","0.0","22.0","0","1259","95.17","68.02","7.39","51.01","26.79","26.05","71.25","39.87","6.43","3.49","0.79","0.00","0.32","1.91","0.48","2.94","9.05","14.06","5.24","1.99","5.40","1.27","10.64","6.75","3.73","1.59","2.86","1.51","3.65","2.38","1.03","0.08","0.56","0.08","8.34","0.08","0.24","2.38","0.16","7.07","0.79","2.46","0.95","1.19","0.32","1.91","3.97","1.43","1.59","0.40","0.95","0.08","0.56","0.16","0.24","7.94","1.11","1.11","5.40","0.71","0.40","3.18","6.20","1.03","11.68","1.27","5.96","4.53","5.16","0.87","0.24","2.30","0.00","0.32","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","22.56","4.37","7.39","1.03","0.24","0.00","0.00","1.35","2.46","3.97","0.32","1.43","6276","8.18","28.88888888888889","1896","1236","50","54.86","13.4","11.7","14.45","16.5","260","10.1","20.29423948220065","580","24.96","20","0.4","0","39","35","122","0","150","76","1","8","11","207","252","2","55","0","0","37","18","38","1","1","6","29","0","31","48","24","18","33","33","6","13","0","5"

In its latest philanthropic move, Salesforce.com's foundation will spend $6 million nationally over the next three years on job training for underemployed young adults.

The program was announced Tuesday in Denver as part of a Clinton Global Initiative effort to expand job opportunities for the nearly 6 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 who are out of work and not in school.

Salesforce will expand its existing partnerships with Genesys Works and Year Up - two nonprofits geared to providing job training for low-income young people. The San Francisco company's philanthropic arm will also create 400 unpaid internships and 150 post-internship jobs for young people as part of the program.

""What we want to do is give them access and exposure so they can fill the jobs that are out there,"" said Ebony Frelix, vice president of programs at the Salesforce.com Foundation.

Many young people of that age ""have had a hard time accessing those jobs,"" said Jay Banfield, founding executive director at Year Up Bay Area. ""This will really help.""

Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced Salesforce's program expansion Tuesday during a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, which her family founded. The organization will focus on youth unemployment issues over the next year. Joining Salesforce in making similar commitments Tuesday were San Francisco clothing chain Gap, software security company Symantec of Mountain View, Corning, Ernst and Young, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Lifeway Foods, Marriott International, MDC Partners Inc. and Microsoft.

Clinton, who is contemplating a 2016 run for president, recently blasted the nation's increasing wealth inequality gap during a policy speech in May at the New America Foundation in Washington.

""The dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach, and many Americans understandably feel frustrated, even angry,"" Clinton said.

Salesforce.com founder Marc Benioff, one of the nation's largest donors to Democratic candidates and interest groups, donated $25,000 in November to Ready for Hillary, an organization supportive of Clinton's presidential aspirations, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Salesforce officials say their involvement with the Clinton Global Initiative is not political in nature.

""We were supporting this before Secretary Clinton's involvement, and we will continue to support it,"" Frelix said.

Salesforce.com has about $4 billion in annual revenue, and Benioff has an estimated personal net worth of $3 billion, according to Forbes. Benioff, with his wife, Lynne, have made numerous philanthropic personal donations, including $200 million to UCSF Benioff Children's Hospitals.

Benioff - along with the nonprofit Tipping Point Community and Ron Conway, venture capitalist and head of the San Francisco Citizens Initiative for Tech and Innovation, rallied other tech companies this year to join forces in giving $10 million to Bay Area antipoverty causes.","2014-06-24 14:48:00","1","103.0","2.0","7.0","0.0","60.0","0.0","347.0","315.0","0.0","437.0","0.0","22.0","0","761","94.56","71.84","29.33","39.89","28.19","33.51","65.31","30.22","4.60","1.58","0.00","0.39","0.26","0.53","0.39","3.02","4.60","11.96","4.34","1.84","3.29","0.53","9.20","4.99","1.97","0.92","4.60","0.79","3.15","1.84","1.05","0.00","0.92","0.13","7.10","0.39","0.39","0.79","0.39","4.99","0.66","2.23","0.13","0.26","0.26","1.45","3.42","1.58","1.05","0.66","1.45","0.39","0.53","0.00","0.53","7.75","1.71","2.37","3.42","0.39","0.13","2.23","5.39","1.31","16.29","1.18","8.28","7.10","6.18","0.66","0.39","1.18","0.00","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","24.05","4.86","6.44","1.58","0.39","0.00","0.00","1.84","1.45","3.68","0.53","3.29","4018","9.09","35.31818181818182","1215","734","30","38.15","15.3","14.0","16.95","18.4","197","5.25","22.53569482288829","418","31.59","13","0.3","0","20","35","43","0","72","42","0","5","9","117","235","3","37","0","1","8","8","17","2","0","2","17","0","18","18","23","11","9","17","3","5","0","0"

OK, here's a mental experiment: Think of the word ""Duke."" What do you conjure? The Southern school with a pretty good basketball team? The grizzled Hollywood actor in a cowboy hat, perhaps atop a horse? The jazz legend? The energy company?

That general, amorphous perception the public has about the word Duke is at the center of a dispute between the heirs of the late actor John ""The Duke"" Wayne - who want to sell a bourbon with his likeness - and the North Carolina university, which wants any ""Duke"" product branding to be clearly connected to the man. As a result, John Wayne Enterprises, of Newport Beach (Orange County), has sued the school, seeking a judicial judgment to remove what it calls ""the cloud of an eventual infringement claim"" by Duke University.

""Apparently, Duke University believes that products bearing John Wayne's world renowned image and signature, like the bottle of bourbon, will somehow be confused as being associated with Duke University,"" the company says in its suit, filed July 3 in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana. The family considers that contention to be ""ludicrous,"" the lawsuit says.

Wayne died of cancer in 1979, but remains a Hollywood icon with enormous commercial value. He was born Marion Robert Morrison, but never liked the name Marion, and had a dog named Duke while growing up in Southern California. The dog's name replaced Marion - and Marion R. Morrison became John Wayne for the budding actor's first starring role, in ""The Big Trail"" in 1930.

A spokesman for Duke, the university, Michael Schoenfeld, says the school does not object to selling liquor or other products with the term ""The Duke"" if the products ""unmistakably connect"" themselves to John Wayne with words or an image. ""However, this suit seeks to establish their ability to use the name 'Duke' even without an explicit connection to Mr. Wayne, which Duke University opposes because of the potential for confusion,"" Schoenfeld said last week in an e-mail. He said the Durham school and John Wayne Enterprises have worked together successfully for more than a decade on past trademark issues.","2014-07-19 15:02:00","1","86.0","2.0","7.0","0.0","62.0","0.0","343.0","318.0","0.0","452.0","0.0","22.0","0","640","98.21","69.70","11.36","58.28","20.00","24.84","66.41","33.28","3.91","1.09","0.00","0.16","0.16","0.47","0.31","2.81","8.75","13.12","2.81","2.66","2.66","0.78","8.12","3.28","1.09","0.78","4.84","0.62","2.97","2.34","0.62","0.47","0.16","0.00","7.97","0.16","0.31","0.00","3.59","9.22","0.94","1.72","1.09","2.66","1.09","2.34","4.69","2.81","1.25","0.31","0.94","0.16","0.31","0.00","0.47","3.91","0.62","1.09","1.88","0.47","0.16","1.88","5.16","0.94","12.03","1.25","7.03","3.75","5.94","2.66","0.47","0.94","0.31","0.31","0.78","0.00","0.62","0.16","0.00","0.00","28.44","5.31","5.62","1.72","0.47","1.25","0.00","1.41","5.00","3.75","0.94","2.97","3004","8.21","22.413793103448278","931","626","37","62.78","11.2","8.7","12.87","11.8","148","4.833333333333333","18.216869009584666","355","19.66","14","0.32","0","11","28","57","0","73","22","1","0","2","96","214","2","12","0","0","5","4","19","0","0","1","17","0","17","14","11","10","7","22","2","3","0","0"

If a development project in Marin lacks controversy, there can only be one reason: It involves high-end organic broccoli.

That's the case with Measure B, a proposal on the June 3 ballot to build a $20 million, 365-day-a-year farmers' market at the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael.

The measure had no opposition on the ballot, almost unheard of in a county that has a 50-year history of fighting developments of all sizes. Not even the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy objected. In fact, staff there will oversee the design.

""This is a statement about Marin - how important agriculture is to the local economy and lifestyle,"" said Lynn Giacomini Stray of Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Co., a vendor at the farmers' market and a longtime West Marin dairy farmer. ""We're so lucky that people care so much about where their food comes from.""

Marin's largest and oldest farmers' market has occupied the Civic Center parking lot for 32 years. Even though it attracts up to 12,000 people on weekends, the market has no rest rooms, no running water, no electricity and no permanent structures. Twice a week, every Thursday evening and Sunday morning, staff bring in portable toilets, tents and other necessities for the market to operate.

There'll be nothing haphazard about the new market, if voters approve it. Plans call for an expansive open-air canopy and a 30,000-square-foot building similar to San Francisco's Ferry Building market and Market Hall in Oakland. The new building will include 18 tables for vendors and a restaurant, a cafe, a butcher and a dairy counter, and will be open daily.

And it won't be in the parking lot. The new market will be in a vacant lot now used to sell Christmas trees, closer to the Marin Center auditorium.

Taxpayers' role

The building will be funded privately by the Agricultural Institute of Marin, the nonprofit that runs the Civic Center market as well as six other Bay Area farmers' markets. Taxpayers will pay $2 million to upgrade the vacant lot and make other infrastructure improvements, as part of a broader overhaul of the Civic Center campus.

The Board of Supervisors is solidly supportive of the measure.

""It's part of our continued commitment to local agriculture,"" said Supervisor Steve Kinsey, who represents West Marin. ""Plus it'll help us launch the renaissance of the entire campus.""

The Civic Center complex includes a host of buildings designed or inspired by Wright, most dating from the 1960s, plus a lagoon, park and playground. Soon it'll have a Smart station, serving the soon-to-be-completed train system connecting Sonoma and Marin counties.

Most Marin developments never make it to the ballot. Measure B was necessary because in the early 1990s, voters upset about a jail expansion at the Civic Center passed a measure requiring the board to get voter approval for any Civic Center project larger than 250 square feet.

Keeping Marinites dry

The primary advantages of the new market will be for local farmers to have more opportunities to sell their goods, and for Marinites to have a more comfortable shopping experience.

""In the winter, for example, Marin residents aren't very good at going out in the rain,"" said Brigitte Moran, director of the Agricultural Institute of Marin. ""Now they won't have to get wet. Basically, we've been here for 32 years, and it's time to upgrade. It's time for us to grow up.""","2014-05-21 09:41:00","0","107.0","2.0","7.0","0.0","62.0","0.0","355.0","327.0","0.0","464.0","0.0","22.0","0","991","97.34","55.61","31.23","67.71","24.17","24.12","66.40","35.82","3.33","1.01","0.00","0.50","0.20","0.00","0.30","2.32","9.28","13.42","4.74","2.93","3.94","1.11","8.78","5.15","2.12","0.50","4.34","1.72","3.23","2.72","0.50","0.10","0.40","0.00","3.03","0.10","0.10","0.20","0.20","5.45","0.81","1.11","0.50","1.41","1.01","1.21","2.42","1.51","0.30","0.40","2.32","0.50","0.81","0.00","1.01","3.53","0.71","0.71","1.51","0.81","0.10","1.11","5.85","1.82","16.55","1.31","9.49","5.85","4.64","1.11","0.40","3.23","0.10","0.40","0.61","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.10","0.00","22.91","4.84","5.25","1.41","0.30","0.00","0.00","2.93","1.31","4.54","0.40","1.92","4727","8.18","25.974358974358974","1423","953","44","57.91","11.7","10.6","13.52","14.4","209","10.3","19.45229800629591","475","22.97","15","0.36","0","26","42","101","0","105","50","4","6","10","165","242","1","57","0","1","17","6","25","1","0","4","27","0","32","21","13","11","13","24","3","2","0","2"

Islamic State threat overblown Even under provocation, Obama must remain cool

Earlier this year, Barack Obama, the unruffled strategist, coolly assessed the limitations of the Islamic State terrorist network. Wednesday night, Barack Obama, the embattled politician, declared ISIS (as the Islamic State is also called) a clear and present danger to American national security. Undoubtedly, the beheadings of two American journalists - a deliberate provocation by Islamic State leaders hoping for overreaction - turned the tide in the battle for the president's ""strategic soul"" in favor of politics.

Sadly so, because the instincts of Obama the strategist are far closer to the mark than the reactions of Obama the politician, which are fraught with peril, particularly the portion of his policy that seeks to widen the war to Syria. The plan to support anti-Assad rebels there may appease critics on the right, and might even save Democratic control of the Senate in the looming November elections. But the cost will be heavy, fracturing the tenuous cooperation with Tehran in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq, as the Iranians will brook no effort to support those who seek the overthrow of Bashar Assad. Russia, too, will oppose the Obama plan - and will no doubt flex its veto power in the United Nations Security Council meeting the president plans to attend in a few weeks.

So before we go too far down the path of war expansion, with all its attendant costs and risks, perhaps one more effort should be made to appeal to Obama the strategist - and to those in Congress still capable of cool assessment of the situation. There are four reasons to view the Islamic State as, at best, a lesser threat to American security and interests:

1. Its advance into Iraq was easily stopped with just a tiny leavening of American air power and special forces.

2. The very fact that ISIS seeks to hold ground and fight with tanks and artillery makes it highly vulnerable to counterattack.

3. Support from disgruntled Iraqi Sunnis - so important to ISIS - can be easily undermined by a more inclusive government in Baghdad.

4. ISIS is fundamentally aimed at overthrowing local regimes, not in pursuing ""the far enemy"" (that is, the United States).

For all these reasons, American strategy and policy should avoid overreaction and escalation, and consist instead of more limited options and objectives. Indeed, the president's stated desire to emulate our counter-terrorism operations in Yemen and Somalia - which many have criticized as poor models for what they want done in Iraq and Syria - is actually the strongest part of his approach. With minimal investment and a very light tactical touch, U.S. forces have worked with the Yemeni military to thwart the aims of al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula, and have done serious damage to the al-Shabab network in Somalia. Neither country is a nation-state paragon, but the terrorists in both countries are well contained.

If an Obama doctrine has emerged over the past several years, it comprises exactly the sorts of elements that are in play in Yemen and Somalia: small U.S. military involvement, vigorous intelligence and infiltration operations, and close cooperation with local allies. It is an approach that can be sustained for the long term - that is, for as long as it takes to destroy terrorist networks. The president tried to hew to this way of war in his speech Wednesday night, but the siren call of Syria and the specter of ""foreign fighters"" coming to our shores took him a bit off course. A pity, because arming rebels in Syria will prolong rather than end the civil war there. And, as to foreign fighters, one need only see that ISIS recruits them to fight - even to mount suicide attacks - ""over there,"" not here.

Perhaps the president should take a moment to remember that he is a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. He can live up to its promise by going to the United Nations in two weeks to advance a plan to end the Syrian civil war that, say, allows Assad to remain in power for the present, but also guarantees human rights and contains some liberalizing measures. It's hard to see either Moscow or Tehran opposing such a call. And ending that civil war will deal a truly fatal blow to the Islamic State, which will lose its haven in Syria. All that will be called for then is very limited military support to conclude the fight against ISIS remnants in Iraq.

Let us hope that enough of Obama the cool strategist remains to overcome the pull of political pressure to overreact to the Islamic State crisis.","2014-09-11 12:19:00","0","98.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","57.0","0.0","299.0","279.0","0.0","354.0","0.0","21.0","0","845","96.85","56.59","8.86","9.68","25.61","24.02","76.33","44.50","5.21","1.42","0.00","0.47","0.00","0.71","0.24","3.79","9.59","16.21","5.33","3.79","5.33","0.59","8.99","4.85","2.49","0.59","1.78","1.66","8.40","3.55","4.85","1.42","2.84","0.36","3.79","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.71","7.69","0.95","1.30","1.30","1.54","1.66","2.01","2.25","1.30","0.24","0.71","0.59","0.24","0.36","0.00","0.00","12.90","1.07","2.96","7.10","1.18","1.78","1.66","5.68","2.60","11.95","1.42","7.69","2.96","2.84","0.36","0.24","0.47","1.54","1.07","0.59","0.00","0.00","0.47","0.12","0.00","14.20","4.38","5.56","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.78","0.95","0.36","0.47","0.24","4008","8.38","25.757575757575758","1278","841","32","53.24","14.0","12.4","11.67","15.0","183","15.5","21.223923900118905","418","22.73","13","0.43","0","29","15","89","0","101","60","2","2","17","123","117","4","48","1","0","12","10","45","3","0","4","40","0","43","9","12","17","14","20","10","2","0","0"

Those who inherit their wealth need to contribute

In a new Pew poll, more than three-quarters of self-described conservatives believe ""poor people have it easy because they can get government benefits without doing anything."" In reality, most of America's poor work hard, often in two or more jobs. The real non-workers are the wealthy who inherit their fortunes. And their ranks are growing.

In fact, we're on the cusp of the largest intergenerational wealth transfer in history.

The wealth is coming from those who over the last three decades earned huge amounts on Wall Street, in corporate boardrooms or as high-tech entrepreneurs. It's going to their children, who did nothing except be born into the right family.

The ""self-made"" man or woman, the symbol of American meritocracy, is disappearing. Six of today's 10 wealthiest Americans are heirs to prominent fortunes.

The six Walmart heirs have more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined (up from 30 percent in 2007).

The U.S. Trust bank recently released a poll of Americans with more than $3 million of investable assets.

A solid majority of those over age 50 were the first in their families to accumulate significant wealth.

But the bank found inherited wealth far more common among rich Millennials under age 35.

This is the dynastic form of wealth French economist Thomas Piketty warns about. It's been the major source of wealth in Europe for centuries. It's about to become the major source in America - unless, that is, we do something about it.

As income from work has become more concentrated in America, the super-rich have invested in businesses, real estate, art and other assets. The income from these assets is now concentrating even faster than income from work.

In 1979, the richest 1 percent of households accounted for 17 percent of business income. By 2007, they were getting 43 percent. They were also taking in 75 percent of capital gains. Today, with the stock market significantly higher than where it was before the crash, the top is raking even more from their investments.

Both political parties have encouraged this great wealth transfer, as beneficiaries provide a growing share of campaign contributions.

But Republicans have been even more ardent than Democrats.

For example, family trusts used to be limited to about 90 years. Legal changes implemented under Ronald Reagan extended them in perpetuity.

These ""dynasty trusts"" now allow super-rich families to pass on to their heirs money and property largely free from taxes, and to do so for generations.

George W. Bush's biggest tax breaks helped high earners, but they provided even more help to people living off accumulated wealth. While the top tax rate on income from work dropped from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, the top rate on dividends went from 39.6 percent (taxed as ordinary income) to 15 percent, and the estate tax was completely eliminated. (Conservatives called it the ""death tax"" even though it only applied to the richest two-tenths of 1 percent.)

Barack Obama rolled back some of these cuts, but many remain.

Before George W. Bush, the estate tax kicked in at $2 million of assets per couple, and then applied a 55 percent rate. Now it kicks in at $10 million per couple, with a 40 percent rate.

House Republicans want to go even further than Bush did.

Rep. Paul Ryan's ""road map,"" which continues to be the bible of Republican economic policy, eliminates all taxes on interest, dividends, capital gains and estates.

Yet the specter of an entire generation who do nothing for their money other than speed-dial their wealth-management advisers isn't particularly attractive. It's also dangerous to our democracy, as dynastic wealth inevitably accumulates political influence.

What to do? First, restore the estate tax in full.

Second, eliminate the ""stepped-up-basis on death"" rule. This obscure tax provision allows heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes on the increased value of assets accumulated during the life of the deceased.

Such untaxed gains account for more than half of the value of estates worth more than $100 million, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Third, institute a wealth tax. We already have an annual wealth tax on homes, the major asset of the middle class. It's called the property tax. Why not a small annual tax on the value of stocks and bonds, the major assets of the wealthy?

We don't have to sit by and watch our meritocracy be replaced by a permanent aristocracy, and our democracy be undermined by dynastic wealth.

"http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/white-south-africans-battle-for-refugee-status-in-canada-ended-by-appeals-court","White South African's battle for refugee status in Canada ended by appeals court","The case of a white South African granted refugee protection in Canada over fear of his country’s black majority has been overturned and his appeal rejected, clearing the way for a return to his homeland, where his claims sparked an angry furor and backlash against Canada.

In 2009, an international uproar greeted Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board decision that Brandon Huntley, a white citizen of South Africa, had a “well-founded fear of persecution on the ground of his race” and the South Africa government had “indifference or inability or unwillingness … to protect white South Africans from persecution by African South Africans.”

That decision was called “perverse” by Ottawa and “racist” by South Africa’s government. Politicians, newspaper editorials and talk radio in South Africa angrily refuted Mr. Huntley’s claims and attacked the IRB’s decision.

Canada was told the decision could damage relations between the two countries and Ottawa appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Canada, which sent the case back to the IRB for another look. In 2010, Mr. Huntley’s then-lawyer accused Ottawa of interfering to mend international relations. Mr. Huntley appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which declined to hear his case in 2012.

The second appraisal of Mr. Huntley’s claim by the IRB came to a different conclusion: He was deemed not to be a person in need of protection.

It was Mr. Huntley’s appeal of that decision that was dismissed this week.

“We are pleased that the Federal Court has agreed with the government’s position in this case,” said Sonia Lesage, a spokeswoman for Citizenship and Immigration Canada.

“Mr. Huntley has been found not to be in need of Canada’s protection. He should respect our immigration laws and leave Canada.”

Mr. Huntley came to Canada in July 2004 on a five-month work visa. When it expired, he returned to South Africa and successfully reapplied for a second temporary visa. He returned to work in Canada in June 2005 and repeatedly renewed his temporary visa until he was no longer allowed to. His last work permit expired on Dec. 31, 2006, but he remained in Canada and then, in April 2008, he made his bid for refugee asylum.

He claimed protection on the grounds of persecution because of his race and his political opinion, saying his life is at risk if he returned because of violence and prejudice against whites in his homeland.

In his Personal Information Form, Mr. Huntley said he was assaulted and stabbed at least six times since he was a teenager, each time by black South Africans. He was subjected to racial slurs during the attacks, he said.

He said he knows of other white citizens similarly attacked. His white family members in the Roodepoort district of Johannesburg hire private security to accompany them if travelling at night, he said.

‘Mr. Huntley has been found not to be in need of Canada’s protection. He should respect our immigration laws and leave’

He said he was not able to get a job in South Africa because of “affirmative action” favouring black applicants following the end of Apartheid. He also received delayed medical treatment because of his race, he claimed, saying his stitches and X-rays were delayed at the hospital in favour of black patients.

When he was applying for a passport, he had to return three days in a row because black citizens were permitted to go ahead of him in line, he said. For his application to come to Canada, he said he had to submit additional documents that black applicants did not have to provide.

When he returned to South Africa to reapply for a permit to return to Canada, he said he realized he could not live there because he was constantly afraid for his safety.

When his refugee claim was accepted in 2009, he spoke out about his success in the media because, he told court, he “felt so strongly that millions of people did not know what was going on in South Africa regarding the plight of white South Africans.”

His case, however, drew intense publicity. It was reported in newspapers around the world, especially in South Africa. His picture, he said, was featured in newspaper ads on buses in his hometown. Online, he was threatened, he said. If he was not a person in need of protection before, he was now, he claimed in court, a distinction referred to as being a “refugee sur place.”

When his case was sent back to the IRB, the new member wrote a 38-page ruling, which was the focus of the Federal Court ruling. The IRB said its decision turned on issues of Mr. Huntley’s credibility and on the ability of the South African government to protect him.

Counted against him by the IRB was his delay in making a refugee claim and that he had returned, safely, to South Africa in 2004. There were also inconsistencies between his testimony at his original hearing and his second.

Although the IRB recognized serious human rights problems in South Africa, the member did not accept evidence from Mr. Huntley that South Africa was heading towards genocide against whites, instead relying on information from the Canadian government that crime rates and corruption were declining in South Africa.

While the IRB found there were incidents of violence and intolerance, the evidence as a whole did not support generalized oppression of whites. Further, Mr. Huntley admitted not reporting his attacks to police at the time, saying he felt they would be ignored, which did not help him make a case that police were unable to assist him.

As for his sur place claim, the IRB found it “pure speculation” unsupported by “any objective evidence establishing that someone will want to attack him merely because his name was mentioned in South African newspapers or during television broadcasts in connection with his refugee protection claim in Canada.”

The IRB acknowledged that South Africa was “a young democracy with ongoing problems,” the court summarized, but remained “a functioning democracy with independent judicial institutions.”

In judging the IRB’s second decision, Federal Court Judge Catherine M. Kane said the reasons given by the IRB were adequate and the decision was a reasonable one to arrive at.

“The [IRB] is entitled to weigh the evidence and prefer evidence that comes from reputable and knowledgeable sources,” Judge Kane wrote in her decision, released Thursday.

Judge Kane rejected Mr. Huntley’s appeal.

Mr. Huntley is now under an enforceable removal order, said Chris Kealey, spokesman for Canada Border Services Agency.

“The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states that removal orders must be enforced as soon as possible. The CBSA is firmly committed to doing so,” he said.

Prior to removal, Mr. Huntley may seek further judicial review, as well as an administrative review — called a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) — that looks at the potential risk he faces if returned to South Africa.

His PRRA would be conducted by officers with Citizenship and Immigration Canada, a department and ministry which has been vocally opposed to Mr. Huntley’s case.

“Everyone ordered removed from Canada is entitled to due process before the law,” said Mr. Kealey. “Once individuals have exhausted all legal avenues of recourse… they are expected to respect our laws and leave Canada or be removed.”

Mr. Huntley could not be reached for comment. Calls to his lawyer were not returned by deadline.

"https://nationalpost.com/news/mikhail-kalashnikov-reportedly-wrote-letter-to-russian-orthodox-church-expressing-regrets-over-designing-ak-47","AK-47 creator Mikhail Kalashnikov wrote of regrets over gun’s invention, ‘unbearable pain in my soul’","MOSCOW — Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the AK-47 assault rifle, reportedly wrote a regretful letter several months before his death asking the head of the Russian Orthodox Church if he was to blame for the deaths of those killed by the guns.

The Russian daily Izvestia reported Monday that Kalashnikov, who died last month at 94, wrote to Patriarch Kirill in April and told him he kept asking himself if he’s responsible.

“The pain in my soul is unbearable. I keep asking myself the same unsolvable question: If my assault rifle took people’s lives that means that I, Mikhail Kalashnikov, … am responsible for people’s deaths,” he said in the letter.

“The longer I live, the more often that question gets into my brain, the deeper I go in my thoughts and guesses about why the Almighty allowed humans to have devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression,” Kalashnikov continued.

Kalashnikov’s daughter, Elena, was quoted by Izvestia as saying that a local priest could have helped her father write the letter, which was typed and carried his signature.

The letter contrasted sharply with past statements by Kalashnikov, who had repeatedly said in interviews and public speeches that he created the weapon to protect his country and couldn’t be blamed for other people’s action.

“I sleep well. It’s the politicians who are to blame for failing to come to an agreement and resorting to violence,” the designer told The Associated Press in 2007.

The church sought to comfort him with exactly same argument. Izvestia quoted Kirill’s spokesman Alexander Volkov as saying the Patriarch responded to Kalashnikov and praised him as a true patriot.

“If the weapon is used to defend the Motherland, the Church supports both its creators and the servicemen using it,” the newspaper quoted Volkov as saying.

The AK-47 is the world’s most popular firearm, favoured by guerrillas, terrorists and the soldiers of many armies.

So, when Russia sliced Crimea off Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was nonplussed: “You just don’t in the 21st century behave in 19th-century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped up pretext.” If, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin is out of step with the march of progress, where exactly on history’s inevitably ascending path (as progressives such as Kerry evidently think) does Kerry, our innocent abroad, locate the Islamic State?

The commander-in-chief of the world’s greatest military would now appear to be more of a pacifist than the Pope.

Appalled at the barbaric tactics of the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS), Pope Francis urged the international community this week to “take action to end the humanitarian tragedy now underway.”

“Maybe military action is necessary at this moment,” Archbishop Silvano Tomasi , the Vatican’s UN in Geneva, said in an interview with Vatican Radio.

The Islamic State uses crucifixions to express piety and decapitations to encourage co-operation. These are some of the “folks” — to adopt the locution U.S. President Barack Obama frequently uses to express his all-encompassing diffidence — Obama was referring to when talking to The New York Times‘ Thomas Friedman. “That’s exactly right,” Obama said when Friedman suggested that Obama believes all Middle East factions must agree to a politics of “no victor, no vanquish.” It will be interesting watching Obama try to convince the crucifiers and the crucified to split their differences.

Exactly 70 years ago, America grappled with a humanitarian dilemma. On Aug. 9, 1944, A. Leon Kubowitzki of the World Jewish Congress wrote to assistant secretary of war John J. McCloy, quoting a Czech official’s opinion that the “destruction of gas chambers and crematoria in Oswiecim [Auschwitz] by bombing would have a certain effect now.” On Aug. 14, McCloy rejected the request, noting that it would require “the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations elsewhere,” a defensible argument. But then McCloy added that such bombing “might provoke even more vindictive action by the Germans.” That is, bombing an extermination camp might make the operators of the crematoria really cross.

In 1988, U.S. president Ronald Reagan signed implementation legislation for the Genocide Convention, the parties to which agreed to “undertake to prevent and to punish” the kind of crimes the Islamic State vows to commit. Senator Dianne Feinstein today says, “It takes an army to defeat an army.” Is she, too, so very 19th century? Obama seems to agree with her, telling Friedman, “We can run [the Islamic State] off for a certain period of time, but as soon as our planes are gone, they’re coming right back in.” So air power is insufficient. He also said, “We’re not going to let them create some caliphate through Syria and Iraq, but we can only do that if we know that we’ve got partners on the ground who are capable of filling the void.” We will not “let” something happen — unless air power alone cannot prevent it and no “partners” fill the void beneath our bombers. About that void:

America has fought its longest war — more than three times longer than U.S. involvement in the Second World War — lest Afghanistan become a state unable or unwilling to prevent terrorists operating with impunity in a substantial area. Since this war began, U.S. policies have created two such voids by shattering two states, those of Iraq and Libya.

Friedman reports that Obama says his regret about Libya is not that he waged an utterly optional war of regime change. Rather, Obama regrets not getting busy “on the ground” to “manage” Libya’s transition to democracy. So, even after 13 years in Afghanistan and nearly a decade in Iraq, Obama wishes America had gone into Libya for more of the excitements and satisfactions of nation-building.

Two questions must be distinguished. First, is it an important American interest or duty to protect, as much as air power can, Kurds and Yazidis from the Islamic State, and to (in Obama’s words) “push back” (back to where?) this group? Even if the answer is yes, there is another question: Is it wise to support the use of force by this President? He is properly cautious about today’s awful dilemma, which is not primarily of his making. But caution can be reckless.

One of Napoleon’s aphorisms — “If you start to take Vienna, take Vienna” — means: In military matters, tentativeness is ruinous. Are F-18s going to be used for a foreign policy of right-minded gestures — remember #BringBackOurGirls? — the success of which is in making the gesturers feel virtuous? “Success,” said T.S. Eliot, “is relative: It is what we can make of the mess we have made of things.” There is much material — rubble, actually — to work with as we seek success.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-americans-are-ready-for-a-conservative-internationalist-foreign-policy","George F. Will: Americans are ready for a 'conservative internationalist' foreign policy","WASHINGTON — With metronomic regularity, there is a choreographed minuet of carnage. Israel is attacked. Israel defends itself. Perfunctory affirmations of Israel’s right of self-defence are quickly followed by accusations that Israel’s military measures are disproportionate. Then come demands for a cease-fire, and the attackers replenish their arsenals.

Where’s the President?” link=”http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/07/26/charles-krauthammer-the-world-is-aflame-wheres-the-president/”%5DThe president’s demeanour is worrying a lot of people. From the immigration crisis on the Mexican border to the Islamic State rising in Mesopotamia, Barack Obama seems totally detached. When he does interrupt his endless rounds of golf, fundraising and photo ops, it’s for some affectless, mechanical, almost forced public statement.

Regarding Ukraine, his detachment — the rote, impassive voice — borders on dissociation. His UN ambassador, Samantha Power, delivers an impassioned denunciation of Russia. Obama cautions that we not “get out ahead of the facts,” as if the facts of this case — Vladimir Putin’s proxies shooting down a civilian airliner — are in doubt.

The preferred explanation for the president’s detachment is psychological. He’s checked out. Given up. Let down and disappointed by the world, he is in withdrawal.

The accusations and demands are ascribed to something fictitious, the “international community.” The word “community” connotes a certain cement of shared values and aspirations. So, what community includes Denmark and Yemen, Canada and Iran, New Zealand and Congo, Italy and North Korea? “International community” is empty cant that bewitches the minds of earnest diplomats such as John Kerry but does not interest Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

He surely has told Kerry what he has told others: The point of Israel is that Jews shall never again, like Blanche DuBois in “A Streetcar Named Desire,” depend on the kindness of strangers. Such dependency did not work out well for Jews, so Israel exists for Jewish self-defence.

Israel’s hardheaded exercise of hard power in Gaza has instructively coincided with a dismal reverberation from the Obama administration’s most empty-headed adventure. Among the multiplying foreign policy debacles that are completing the destruction of Barack Obama’s crumbling presidency, many are more portentous but none more emblematic, than the closure of the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli last weekend. The U.S. military evacuated the embassy staff while the State Department advised U.S. citizens to leave Libya “immediately.”

U.S. involvement in the 2011 decapitation of Libya’s government has predictably (for those who have noticed developments in Iraq since 2003) produced a failed state convulsed by rival militias. The attack on Libya appealed to the Obama administration’s humanitarians precisely because it was untainted by considerations of national interest. The seven-month attempt to assassinate Moammar Gaddafi with fighter-bombers was a war of choice, waged for regime change. It was not an event thrust upon the United States, which had its hands more than full elsewhere. Because the war against Libya was thoroughly voluntary, it stands as the signature deed of the secretary of state at the time, and should by itself disqualify her from presidential aspirations.

Today there is a torrent of redundant evidence for the Macmillan axiom. When British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was asked what caused him the most trouble, he supposedly replied, “Events, dear boy, events.” He certainly used the phrase “the opposition of events.” Events, from Ukraine to Syria to Gaza, are forcing something Americans prefer not to think about, foreign policy, into their political calculations.

Having recoiled from the scandal of the Iraq War, which was begun on the basis of bad intelligence and conducted unintelligently, Americans concluded that their nation no longer has much power, defined as the ability to achieve intended effects. The correct conclusion is that America should intend more achievable effects.

Obama has given Americans a foreign policy congruent with their post-recoil preferences: America as spectator. Now, however, their sense of national diminishment, and of an increasingly ominous world, may be making them receptive to a middle course between a foreign policy of flaccidity (Obama) or grandiosity (his predecessor).

If so, a Republican presidential aspirant should articulate what George Washington University’s Henry R. Nau calls, in a book with this title, “Conservative Internationalism.” This would, he says, include:

In 11 ruinous years, beginning with the invasion of Iraq, Republicans have forfeited their foreign policy advantage

The liberal internationalist goal of spreading freedom, but doing so “primarily on the borders of existing freedom, not everywhere in the world at once.” The realists’ use of “armed diplomacy” against adversaries outside of negotiations. And the “conservative vision of limited global governance, a decentralized world of democratic civil societies” rather than “one of centralized international institutions as Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt advocated.” The blend is conservative internationalism because “states remain separate and armed; national culture, sovereignty, defence, and patriotism are respected; civic virtue and democracy are widespread; the global economy is mostly private; and global governance is limited.”

After the shattering of the Democratic Party over Vietnam in 1968, and the nomination of George McGovern in 1972, the party’s foreign policy credentials became suspect. This was disqualifying until the end of the Cold War, and of the Soviet Union in 1991, reduced the stakes of foreign policy. Democrats elected a president in 1992.

In 11 ruinous years, beginning with the invasion of Iraq, Republicans have forfeited their foreign policy advantage and Obama has revived suspicions that Democrats’ are uncomfortable with American power. There is running room for a conservative internationalist.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-nato-sends-a-message-of-uncertain-resolve","George F. Will: NATO sends a message of uncertain resolve","Speaking on Aug. 29 — at a fundraiser, of course — Barack Obama applied to a platitude the varnish of smartphone sociology, producing this intellectual sunburst: “The truth of the matter is, is that the world has always been messy. In part, we’re just noticing now because of social media and our capacity to see in intimate detail the hardships that people are going through.” So, if 14th- century Europeans had had Facebook and Twitter, they would have noticed how really disagreeable the Hundred Years’ War was.

Obama did have a piece of a point: Graphic journalism, now augmented by billions of people with cameras in their pockets, can give an inflammatory immediacy to events. His intention was to dispel the impression that the world has become not just unusually “messy” but especially dangerous. Unfortunately, this impression derives not from social media static but from stark facts, including this one:

A nation with nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles is dismembering another nation. And the nuclear power is governed by an unconstrained despot fueled by a dangerous brew of disappointment, resentment and contempt.

Writing for The Federalist website, professor Tom Nichols of the Naval War College describes Vladimir Putin as neither a realist nor a nationalist but rather someone saturated with Soviet nostalgia. In 1975, Nichols writes, the world seemed to be going the Soviet Union’s way. Extraordinary U.S. exertions in Vietnam had ended in defeat, a president had resigned and the economy was sagging into stagflation. “By contrast,” Nichols says, “the Soviets were at the top of their game,” with a modernized military and a new generation of missiles: “The correlation of forces, the great wheel of history itself, was finally turning in their favour,” and because history’s ratchet clicks only in a progressive direction, “it would never turn back.”

“Putin’s speeches and public utterances,” Nichols notes, “tend to show more nostalgia for his Soviet youth than his Russian adulthood.”

In 1975, Putin, 23, joined “the most elite Soviet institution,” the KGB, which would guarantee “he would be somebody in the brave new Soviet future.” But in the 1980s, “he watched the Soviet descent to oblivion begin, accelerate, and then end in a humiliating wreck.” Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and a Polish pope ignited a Western resurgence — military, economic and moral. By 1990, Putin was 38 and aggrieved. Today, “Putin’s speeches and public utterances,” Nichols notes, “tend to show more nostalgia for his Soviet youth than his Russian adulthood.” Remember “the explosion of bad taste and Soviet kitsch” in the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

A participant in NATO’s 1949 founding famously said that the alliance’s purpose was to protect Europe by keeping “the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down.” When the Cold War, which prompted NATO’s creation, ended, the alliance began to gingerly undertake what it calls “out-of-area operations,” as in Afghanistan. Now, however, it is back to its original business of keeping Russian forces out of NATO members, which now include Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, the last two being contiguous to Russia.

If NATO’s meeting in Wales was, as one European defence intellectual said, a “credibility summit,” it was at most a semi-success. The decision to augment by around 4,000 an existing rapid response force of around 13,000 is a far cry from Poland’s request that 10,000 NATO troops be stationed with heavy weapons in that country. Watching NATO flinch from this, Putin might reasonably conclude that NATO is ambivalent about Article 5 (an attack on any member will be considered an attack on all) and therefore wants its means of responding to remain some distance from where events might require a response.

Although ambiguity has its uses, a British diplomat of the early 20th century, Lord Curzon, reportedly advised that it is generally wise to know your own mind and make sure your adversary knows it, too. Putin might read NATO’s mind in what Gideon Rachman of the Financial Times calls “the learned helplessness” of American allies who “have come to rely excessively on the U.S. to guarantee their security.”

Time was, Rachman writes, America accounted for roughly half of NATO’s military spending; now it accounts for about 75 percent. Only four of NATO’s 28 members (America, Britain, Estonia and penurious Greece) fulfill their obligation to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense, and Britain may soon fall below that threshold as its army shrinks to about 80,000, its smallest size since after Waterloo (1815). As Putin casts a cold eye on his enemies, he might reasonably infer from their atrophied military muscles that they have palsied wills.

Will: Is Putin’s next target the Baltic States?","The Islamic State is a nasty problem that can be remedied if its neighbours, assisted by the United States, decide to do so. Vladimir Putin’s fascist revival is a crisis that tests the West’s capacity to decide.

[np_storybar title=”Kelly McParland: NATO deploys wishful thinking against Putin’s tanks” link=”http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/09/02/kelly-mcparland-nato-deploys-wishful-thinking-against-putins-tanks/”%5DThe case for believing Russian President Vladimir Putin won’t risk a wider war while perusing his campaign in Ukraine is the assumption that no sane leader could be so reckless, foolhardy or mindless of history.

The Soviet Union lost 20 million dead in the Second World War, split evenly between military and civilian casualties. That followed nine million killed or wounded in the First World War. Thirty million people lost in two wars over three decades – that should be enough to convince even the most irresponsible of leaders that risking yet another European conflagration isn’t something to be joked about.

Yet Mr. Putin seems immune to such sensibilities. Visiting a youth camp near Moscow, Mr. Putin played the part he loves best, the macho strongman who likes to doff his shirt and show off his pecs.

[/np_storybar]

Putin’s serial amputations of portions of Ukraine, which began with his fait accompli in Crimea, will proceed, and succeed, until his appetite is satiated. Then the real danger will begin.

Suppose Ukraine is merely his overture for the destruction of NATO, the nemesis of his Soviet memory. Then what might be his version of the Gleiwitz radio station episode 75 years ago?

On the evening of Aug. 31, 1939, Nazi SS personnel pretending to be Polish partisans seized the station, which was about four miles inside Germany (Gliwice is now in Poland), proclaiming that Poland was invading Germany to achieve “our just [territorial] claims,” and shot a German prisoner dressed in a stolen Polish uniform, giving Hitler his pretext for declaring war the next day.

Putin has discarded the minor inhibitions of what NATO calls his “hybrid war” — giving slightly surreptitious aid to Russian separatists; brazenly infiltrating Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms. Russia has invaded Ukraine, although the Obama administration likes the semantic anesthesia of calling it an “incursion.” Putin does not pretend that it will be, like President Nixon’s 1970 “incursion” into Cambodia, temporary.

So, suppose Putin, reprising his Ukrainian success, orchestrates unrest among the Russian-speaking minorities in Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia. Then, recycling Hitler’s words that his country “could not remain inactive,” Putin invades one of these NATO members. Either NATO invokes Article 5 — an attack on any member is an attack on all — or NATO disappears and the Soviet Union, NATO’s original raison d’être, is avenged.

Putin is, the West must acknowledge, more talented and dangerous than either Nikita Khrushchev or Leonid Brezhnev. Their truculence was not fueled by fury. Putin’s essence is anger. It is a smouldering amalgam of resentment (of Russia’s diminishment because of the Soviet Union’s collapse), revanchist ambitions (regarding formerly Soviet territories and spheres of influence), cultural loathing (for the pluralism of open societies) and ethnic chauvinism that presages “ethnic cleansing” of non-Russians from portions of Putin’s expanding Russia.

This is more than merely the fascist mind; its ethnic-cum-racial component makes it Hitlerian. Hence Putin is “unpredictable” only to those unfamiliar with the 1930s. Regarding the roles of resentment and vengeance, remember where Hitler insisted that France formally capitulate in 1940 — in the railroad carriage near the town of Compiegne, where Germany signed the 1918 armistice.

Since its emancipation by the Soviet Union’s demise, Ukraine has been ravaged by corruption that frays national sentiment, which even before this was a tenuous phenomenon. In The Long Shadow: The Legacies of the Great War in the Twentieth Century, David Reynolds of Cambridge University cites a British diplomat’s 1918 analysis: “Were one to ask the average peasant in the Ukraine his nationality, he would answer that he is Greek Orthodox; if pressed to say whether he is a Great Russian, a Pole, or an Ukrainian, he would probably reply that he is a peasant; and if one insisted on knowing what language he spoke, he would say that he talked ‘the local tongue.’ ”

Given Putin’s animus, nourished by his negligibly resisted success in Ukraine, he is more dangerous than the Islamic State

Ukraine may be an ethnic casserole susceptible to diminishment by Putin’s ladle. But the Baltic States, by virtue of their NATO membership, are, regardless of their histories or sociologies, decisively different. And given Putin’s animus, nourished by his negligibly resisted success in Ukraine, he is more dangerous than the Islamic State.

This group is perhaps 20,000 fighters possessing some artillery and armor but no air force. It is an island of tenuously occupied territory in a sea of hostile regimes — those of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Iraq’s Kurdish region, which has its own regime. These command approximately 2-million troops who, with ample air power, can pulverize the Islamic State whenever the regimes summon the will to do so.

U.S. participation in this should be conditional on the regional powers putting their militaries where their mouths (sometimes) are in the fight against radical Islamists. U.S. participation in defense of the Baltic States is unconditional.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-cupcake-compliance-illustrates-washingtons-quest-to-control-everything","George F. Will: Cupcake compliance illustrates Washington's quest to control everything","WASHINGTON — In physics, a unified field theory is an attempt to explain with a single hypothesis the behaviour of several fields. Its political corollary is the Cupcake Postulate, which explains everything, from Missouri to Iraq, concerning Americans’ comprehensive withdrawal of confidence from government at all levels and all areas of activity.

Washington’s response to the menace of school bake sales illustrates progressivism’s ratchet: The federal government subsidizes school lunches, so it must control the lunches’ contents, which validates regulation of what it calls “competitive foods,” such as vending machine snacks. Hence the need to close the bake sale loophole, through which sugary cupcakes might sneak: Foods sold at fundraising bake sales must, with some exceptions, conform to federal standards.

A cupcake-policing government will find unending excuses for flexing its muscles as it minutely monitors our behaviour in order to improve it

What has this to do with police, from Ferguson, Mo., to your hometown, toting marksman rifles, fighting knives, grenade launchers and other combat gear? Swollen government has a shriveled brain: By printing and borrowing money, government avoids thinking about its proper scope and actual competence. So it smears mine-resistant armoured vehicles and other military marvels across 435 congressional districts because it can.

And instead of making immigration policy serve the nation’s values and workforce needs, government, egged on by conservatives, aspires to emulate East Germany along the Rio Grande, spending scores of billions to militarize a border bristling with hardware bought by previous scores of billions. Much of this is justified by America’s longest losing “war,” the one on drugs. Is it, however, necessary for NASA to have its own SWAT team?

A cupcake-policing government will find unending excuses for flexing its muscles as it minutely monitors our behaviour in order to improve it, as Debra Harrell, 46, a South Carolina single mother, knows. She was jailed for “unlawful neglect” of her 9-year-old daughter when she left her, with a cellphone, to play in a park while she worked at a nearby McDonald’s.

Resistance to taxation, although normal and healthy, is today also related to the belief that government is thoroughly sunk in self-dealing, indiscriminate meddling and the lunatic spending that lards police forces with devices designed for conquering Fallujah. People know that no normal person can know one-tenth of 1 percent of what the government is doing.

In Federalist Paper 84, Alexander Hamilton assured readers that although the proposed Constitution would increase the power of a distant federal government, this government would be inhibited by scrutiny: “The citizens who inhabit the country at and near the seat of government will, in all questions that affect the general liberty and prosperity, have the same interest with those who are at a distance, and … they will stand ready to sound the alarm when necessary.” Not now, when five of the nation’s richest 10 counties, ranked by median household income, are Washington suburbs, parasitic off the federal government. The people who write the regulations of school lunches must live somewhere.

Darin Simak, a first-grader in New Kensington, Pa., who accidentally brought a toy gun to school in his backpack, turned it in to his teacher. School administrators then suspended him because the school has a “zero-tolerance policy.” What children frequently learn at schools is that schools often are run by biological adults incapable of common-sensical judgments.

“We simply cannot allow toxic things to be in our schools,” said a spokesman for the Texas school district that confiscated the suntan lotion of a 10-year-old who then became sunburned on a school trip. Students, the spokesman explained, “could ingest it. It’s really just a dangerous situation.” Not as dangerous as entrusting children to schools run by mindless martinets.

Contempt for government cannot be hermetically sealed; it seeps into everything. Which is why cupcake regulations have foreign policy consequences. Americans, inundated with evidence that government is becoming dumber and more presumptuous, think it cannot be trusted to decipher foreign problems and apply force intelligently.

The collapse of confidence in government is not primarily because many conspicuous leaders are conspicuously dimwitted, although when Joe Biden refers to “the nation of Africa,” or Harry Reid disparages the Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision as rendered by “five white men” (who included Clarence Thomas), Americans understand that their increasingly ludicrous government lacks adult supervision. What they might not understand is that Reids and Bidens come with government so bereft of restraint and so disoriented by delusions of grandeur that it gives fighting knives to police and grief to purveyors of noncompliant cupcakes.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-more-voters-does-not-equal-more-democracy","George F. Will: More voters does not equal more democracy","The pursuit of perfection is usually foredoomed, but the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission, which has a latitudinarian understanding of ethical behaviour, has a perfectly awful idea. It is urging the city council to consider ways of paying — starchier ethicists might call it bribing — people to vote.

Some ideas are so loopy that they could only be conceived by governments, which are insulated from marketplace competition that is a constant reminder of reality. And governments are generally confident that their constituents need to be improved by spending the constituents’ money. The supposed problem for which the “pay the voters” idea purports to be a solution is this: Few Los Angeles residents are voting.

Especially alarming to those who choose to be alarmed is the fact that only 23.3% of those eligible to vote did so in last year’s mayoral election. Well.

Since the days of Hiram Johnson (1866-1945), who was governor 100 years ago, progressivism has intermittently made California an incubator of dubious ideas. One of which is that government should fine-tune political partisanship — disagreements about how government should behave. If this looks like a conflict of interest, you have not embraced progressivism’s default assumption, which is that disinterested government has only the interests of “the people” at heart.

Los Angeles, in order to get things just right, has a nonpartisan primary. In it, all candidates of all party affiliations for a particular office are listed together on primary election ballots. If no one receives a majority, the top two finishers then face each other in a runoff election. The rationale for this system, which is favoured by people whose moral micrometers can measure such things, is that there is “too much” partisanship which produces “too much” polarization.

Los Angeles is a one-party city in a one-party state. It is a state in which one power — organized labour, especially government employees’ unions — is the dominant political force, no matter who is chosen to govern from a coterie of candidates representing faintly variant shades of progressivism.

Predictably, the March 2013 mayoral primary produced a general election choice between two progressive Democrats. Predictably, this did not produce a stampede to the May runoff. So now Los Angeles’ problem is too much apathy. Reformers’ work is never done because their ideas have such unanticipated (by them) caroms.

Now, partisanship is surely healthy: People have different political goals and sensibilities; like-minded people cluster; we call these clusters political parties; in our two-party system, their polarity defines the competition for power. But fine-tuning partisanship to produce just the right amount of polarization requires subtlety beyond the ken of most of us. Progressivism, however, is all about bringing to bear on society the fabulous expertise of a disinterested clerisy.

Although the ethics commission is sad that so few Angelenos are expressing their political opinions, the commission should cheer up. Not voting is an expression of opinion. Democracy is a market: Political products are offered; people examine them and decide whether to purchase this one or that one. Or neither, which is often a sensible decision after careful scrutiny of progressive Tweedledum and progressive Tweedledee.

If money is necessary to lure certain voters to the polls, those voters will lower the quality of the turnout

Obviously, some level of financial enticement would draw to the polls a significant number of those who hitherto have not been moved by normal political exhortations or moral shaming. (“Men left bloody footprints in the snow at Valley Forge in order to secure your right to select the candidate you prefer from a pair of progressives.”) Whether the city, in its parlous financial condition, can afford this expenditure is a decision to be made, alas, by the political class that got the city into its condition. But when making the cost-benefit calculation, that class should ask: What benefit might result?

Regarding voting, more often means worse. If money is necessary to lure certain voters to the polls, those voters will lower the quality of the turnout: They will be those people who are especially uninterested in, and hence especially uninformed about, public affairs. Why is it intelligent public policy to encourage their participation?

One suggested measure to conquer nonvoters’ lassitude is to create a special lottery and give everyone who shows up at the polls a chance to win, say, $100,000. Lotteries thrive on the irrational hopes of people not thinking clearly about probabilities, which is why governments love lotteries to raise funds. And why there would be nice symmetry in using a lottery to further decrease the reasonableness of our politics.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-mississippi-conservatives-vote-to-keep-their-pork","George F. Will: Mississippi conservatives vote to keep their pork","WASHINGTON — Chris McDaniel, 41, the flawed paladin of the tea party persuasion who in Mississippi’s Republican Senate primary failed to wrest the nomination from the faltering hands of six-term incumbent Thad Cochran, 76, came into politics after a stint in talk radio. There practitioners do not live by the axiom that you don’t have to explain something you never said, and McDaniel had some explaining to do about some of his more colourful broadcast opinions and phrases, which may have given a number of voters pause about whether he is quite senatorial, whatever that means nowadays.

No Mississippian has become a freshmen Democratic senator since Harry Truman was president

Also, Democrats and independents who had not voted in the Democrat’s primary could vote in the Republican’s. They probably care more than Republicans like to admit that they themselves care about legislative pork, of which Cochran has served up heaping amounts during his 33 years on the Appropriations Committee. This bright red state has the nation’s lowest per capita income, the highest federal funding as a percent of revenue, and a surplus of cognitive dissonance between its professed conservatism and its actual enjoyment of the benefits Cochran can now continue to shovel its way.

[np_storybar title=”Tea Party dealt a blow as Republican incumbent narrowly wins in key Mississippi senate race” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/06/24/republican-incumbant-narrowly-wins-over-tea-party-backed-challenger-in-mississippi-senate-race/”%5D

In a remarkable political turnaround, six-term Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi edged out tea party-backed challenger Chris McDaniel Tuesday night in a bruising, costly Republican runoff that pitted Washington clout against insistence on conservative purity.

With 99% of precincts reporting, Cochran had 51% to McDaniel’s 49%, three weeks after McDaniel had beaten the veteran lawmaker in the initial primary round but had fallen short of the majority needed for nomination. In the three-week dash to the runoff, Cochran and his allies had highlighted his seniority while McDaniel had argued that Cochran was part of a blight of federal overspending.

In a brief speech, Cochran credited those who helped. “It’s a group effort, it’s not a solo and so we all have a right to be proud of our state tonight.”[/np_storybar]

Mississippi’s conservatives understand the bargain they have struck. One resident of a town not named for the tea party spirit, Olive Branch, told The New York Times she suspected Cochran engaged in costly logrolling: “There’s no telling what kinds of liberal things he had to vote for to get those kinds of things for Mississippi — what kind of trading he had to do.”

Give tea partyers their due by acknowledging the virtue that makes them scary to their cultured despisers. The tea party’s critics consider its politics not properly focused on the material things appropriations buy.

Ten years ago, a talented polemicist of the left, Thomas Frank, wrote a lively lament, “What’s the Matter with Kansas?” His book’s title replicated the title of a scalding 1896 editorial in The Emporia Gazette by that paper’s famous editor William Allen White, who believed that populist hostility to sophisticates and wealth-creators was impoverishing Kansas.

In 2004, Frank, a Kansas native, argued that Kansans vote against the Democratic Party because they misunderstand “their fundamental interests.” Rather than lining up for largess from liberalism’s government cornucopia, they are distracted by cultural concerns. Instead of seeking concrete benefits, they vote about abstractions, such as constitutionalism, limited government and cultural conservatism.

So, what’s the matter with the tea party, according to those who think there is much the matter with it? It is insufficiently materialistic. Hence its reluctance to be bought by the appropriator. And what’s the matter with Mississippi? The fact — the state has waited a long time for this to be said — that it is so much like the rest of the nation.

The best thing about Mississippi’s recent moment in the national spotlight is how normal the state seems. It is, like the nation, defined by its ambivalence, its uneasy conscience, about its appetite for what Washington dispenses. Mississippi today is burning with embarrassment, but not, at long last, embarrassment about race.

Its Republican primary occurred three days after the 50th anniversary of the disappearance and murder of three civil rights workers — Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney — near the town of Philadelphia in Neshoba County. Today, Philadelphia’s mayor is an African-American, and Mississippi, which is 37 % African-American, has more African-American elected officials than any other state.

Mississippi has not elected a Democratic senator since 1982, when it gave a sixth full term to John Stennis, who was first elected to fill a vacancy created by an incumbent’s death in 1947. Which means no Mississippian has become a freshmen Democratic senator since Harry Truman was president. So, the tea party’s low-risk insurrection hardly threatened a Republican Senate seat.

McDaniel’s defeat, like many the tea party has experienced this primary season, brings that feisty faction face to face with a melancholy fact: Americans’ devotion to frugal government is frequently avowed but rarely inhibiting. If the nation’s trajectory is to be changed, this will not be done as abruptly as tea partyers wish, and will not be done without their continued wholesome agitation. They must take to heart the truth Thomas Jefferson told in 1790 to a congressional candidate. Jefferson said that “the ground of liberty is to be gained by inches, that we must be contented to secure what we can get from time to time, and eternally press forward for what is yet to get.”

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/john-ivison-harper-conservative-attack-ads-have-nothing-on-maurice-duplessis-mastery-of-political-propaganda","John Ivison: Harper Conservative attack ads have nothing on Maurice Duplessis’ mastery of political propaganda","The Conservatives have hit “an all-time low” with their latest attack ad suggesting Justin Trudeau wants marijuana in local stores, which shows the image of a young boy lighting up a joint, according to the Liberals.

[np_storybar title=”Kelly McParland: Negative ads reflect Twitterization of political thought” link=”http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/06/20/kelly-mcparland-negative-ads-reflect-the-twitterization-of-political-thought/”%5D

With days to go before a federal byelection in the riding formerly held by Liberal Jim Karygiannis, Conservatives have begun circulating a leaflet that portrays Justin Trudeau as a pot-happy drug dealer, eager to get kids hooked on drugs.

The leaflet depicts Trudeau in his Johnny Depp guise, goateed, tousle-haired and wearing an open-necked shirt, with a slipstream of smoke behind him, grinning as a young boy in the next frame lights up a joint. “Trudeau wants marijuana in local stores, just like alcohol and cigarettes,” it says under the heading, “Trudeau’s pot plan.”

Well, it’s kind of true. Horrifically distorted, but based on the Liberal proposal to decriminalize marijuana, which would open the way to legal sales. Except the Liberal plan would include strict controls aimed at restricting sales, to put criminals out of business and protect kids from easily-accessible dope.

[/np_storybar]

Really? The worst ever? The federal Conservatives may have refined the art of the attack ad but they didn’t create Punch and Judy politics.

As Tom Flanagan’s book Winning Power shows, negative campaigning has been a feature of democracy since Quintus wrote a short guide to electioneering for his brother, Cicero: “Avoid taking positions, while practising calculated ambiguity,” he advised.

Rosy retrospection about the good old days in politics is swept swiftly away by a visit to a new exhibition at the freshly minted Canadian Museum of History, the erstwhile Museum of Civilization that has a new mandate to increase its focus on Canadian history. The display of artifacts and footage — titled Duplessis Gives to His Province — looks at the political marketing of Maurice Duplessis, the former premier of Quebec.

Le Chef (“the boss”) won five elections as leader of the conservative Union Nationale between 1936 and 1956, often by presenting his Liberal rivals as being Bolsheviks and lapdogs, “guided by remote control” from Ottawa.

A 1948 propaganda film gives some sense of the political brawling of the day. Over footage of modern hospitals, the voiceover recounted how Duplessis create the health ministry in 1936, after a period when infant mortality was higher than China and India. “Under the Liberals, the crib miracles were matched by a parade of coffins,” it says.

When Duplessis was re-elected in 1944, he blamed the Liberals for rationing meat, sugar and butter, not to mention nationalizing power utilities. “Let me tell you, those Rouges are Communists,” he said.

Duplessis’ personality cult was the product of a careful marketing campaign. The current Quebec flag, the fleurdelisé, was adopted by the province in January, 1948, replacing the Union flag, and Duplessis considered it very much his own symbol. The stern, patrician figure of Duplessis stared out from all manner of promotional material and souvenirs, radiating benevolence, almost always against a background of the fleurdelisé.

The Karl Rove of the day was J.D. Bégin, chief organizer for the Union Nationale. He convinced his leader to use advertising, despite the fact Duplessis said he did not “trust it.” Bégin paid careful attention to the images and stories about Duplessis in order to make him an embodiment of the province he led. Calendars covered with fleurdelisé and pictures of Le Chef intersected the words Duplessis and Quebec. “The UN ensures the future of Quebec,” they claimed — what was good for Duplessis was good for Quebec and he would look after Quebecers during a period of turbulence and change.

During the 1948 election, Bégin devised a campaign that highlighted money the wartime Liberal government had given to England. “The Liberals give to foreigners; Duplessis gives to his province” ran the subsequent slogan. The result was a thumping election win, with more than half of the province’s voters opting for the Le Chef. He repeated the feat in 1952 and 1956, before dying in office in 1959.

The fortunes of the Union Nationale crumbled after his death with the advent of the Quiet Revolution.

The Liberals alleged that Duplessis’ success was tainted by patronage politics – rumours circulated that fridges were exchanged for votes. But with the solid backing of the Roman Catholic Church, strong support in rural areas and his opposition to conscription, Duplessis was able to survive the transition into the modern, post-war era that brought down even towering figures of the day like Winston Churchill.

Political marketing was not introduced in Canada by Duplessis and Bégin – Sir John A. Macdonald ran newspaper ads featuring the slogans “Wages higher!”, “Employment Plentiful!” and “Living Cheaper!” as far back as 1891.

As Susan Delacourt detailed in her book Shopping for Votes, Prime Minister Mackenzie King set up the Bureau of Public Information during World War Two to stay on top of the public mood, and keep Canadians supporting the war effort through the use of propaganda.

But nobody before or since has been as successful at projecting an image that made the politician synonymous with the state. In the eyes of many voters, Duplessis’ political fortunes were intertwined with the success of Quebec. He was guarantor of Quebec as “the citadel of Christian civilization” in North America; the protector of rural values of “stability, common sense and strong religious convictions.”

But as Duplessis himself said: “Elections are not won by prayers.”

That he ran the province for nearly 20 years was largely due to astute image manipulation and a paranoiac vision that saw enemies everywhere, trying to destroy a province under threat of social upheaval.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-europes-political-establishment-cannot-afford-to-ignore-the-fringe","George F. Will: Europe's political establishment cannot afford to ignore the 'fringe'","When the dyspeptic poet Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867), who loathed Belgium even more than most things, was asked to imagine an epitaph for that nation, he suggested: “At last!” Which is how many Europeans feel about the rapidly growing disgust with the European Union, which is headquartered in Brussels.

Opposition to the EU is a worthy cause that unfortunately has been embraced by, and might become the property of, political parties tainted by disreputable motives and members. That xenophobia, anti-Semitism and other acrid aromas of Europe’s past are today present in corners of the continent is an indictment of the EU’s — and of Europe’s major parties’ — disregard of the legitimate concerns of decent people dismayed by the damage the EU is doing to democracy and freedom.

In last month’s elections for the European Parliament — a misbegotten institution that presumes a common European political culture but has 24 official languages — parties frequently dismissed as “fringe” groups performed impressively in France, Britain, Austria, Denmark and Greece by stressing hostility to the EU. They express, among other things, resentment of the “pooling” of national sovereignties in EU institutions, and the “harmonization” of national policies by bureaucracies in Brussels, all of which diminish the rights of national parliaments, won over centuries.

Greece’s Golden Dawn party (9.4% of Greece’s vote), whose symbol suggests the swastika, and Hungary’s unambiguously anti-Semitic Jobbik party (14.7%) are parties with fascist fragrances. In France, Marine Le Pen’s National Front won, but has attracted enough disagreeable adherents to cause Nigel Farage, leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), to rule out alignment with it.

Europhiles may think these parties will, like bees, sting and then die. But although UKIP has no seat in the House of Commons, it won more British seats in the European parliamentary elections than either Labour or the governing Conservatives (who finished third), the first time this has happened in any British national election in 103 years. New York Times columnist Roger Cohen notes that France’s Le Monde newspaper says Le Pen’s National Front won 43% of workers’ votes and 37% of the unemployed’s (the youth unemployment rate is 23.2%). With Le Pen having won 25% of the vote to the two major parties’ 20.8% and 14% (for the governing socialists), Cohen says “a two-party system is now a three-party system” and “make no mistake, she could become president.” The presidential election is in 2017.

One hundred summers ago, Europe stumbled into the first of two wars from which it emerged terrified of itself. Having misdiagnosed nationalism as the cause of Europe’s sufferings (Hitler was a racialist, not a nationalist; he did not become a German citizen until the year before becoming Germany’s chancellor), European leaders undertook the steady attenuation of nationhood. They have thereby eroded the basis of government by consent — the powers of national parliaments.

The assumption was that if the European could be made into homo economicus, a purely economic creature, he would accept an increasingly closer union of decreasingly sovereign nations as a price cheerfully paid for economic dynamism. But the draining away of the powers of parliaments by Brussels’ supranational bureaucracy now coincides with continental stagnation.

America’s tea party impulse — a recoil against the promiscuous growth of government — could have fuelled a third party, but a major party has managed to accommodate it

Now everything from cheeses to condoms is regulated. The German word for all this is “Gleichschaltung,” meaning to bring everything and everybody into co-operation, or at least conformity; the French word is “dirigisme,” from diriger, to direct. The English word is bossiness.

In 1988, in Bruges, Belgium, near Brussels, an unapologetic British nationalist denounced efforts to “suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the centre of a European conglomerate.” Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher continued: “We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level.”

America’s tea party impulse — a recoil against the promiscuous growth of government — could have fuelled a third party, but a major party has managed to accommodate it. If Britain’s Conservative Party had remained Thatcherite, or if a major French party had espoused Charles de Gaulle’s vision of “a Europe of nations,” the sensible anxieties of millions of Europeans about Europe’s intensifying statism and disparagement of nationhood could have been channeled into more mainstream parties. Instead, it has fallen to minor parties to insist: What more than a millennium of distinct national evolutions have put asunder, the EU should not presume to put together.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-arrested-development-in-the-white-house","George F. Will: Arrested Development in the White House","Recently, Barack Obama — a Demosthenes determined to elevate our politics from coarseness to elegance; a Pericles sent to ameliorate our rhetorical impoverishment — spoke at the University of Michigan. He came to that very friendly venue — in 2012, he received 67 percent of the vote in Ann Arbor’s county — after visiting a local sandwich shop, where a muse must have whispered in the presidential ear. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., had recently released his budget, so Obama expressed his disapproval by calling it, for the benefit of his academic audience, a “meanwich” and a “stinkburger.”

Try to imagine Franklin Roosevelt or Dwight Eisenhower or John Kennedy or Ronald Reagan talking like that. It is unimaginable that those grown-ups would resort to japes that fourth-graders would not consider sufficiently clever for use on a playground.

[np_storybar title=”Michael Den Tandt: Canada’s unrequited love for Barack Obama” link=”http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/04/22/michael-den-tandt-canadas-unrequited-love-for-barack-obama/”%5D

The Arab Spring is not working out particularly well. Now Russia, led by the crazed Vladimir Putin, is using its energy muscle in Europe as a lever in its continuing efforts to seize by force the territory of another sovereign country. Russia is the world’s second-largest producer of natural gas. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, including Canada, are making a show of bulking up their scanty military power in Eastern Europe.

But by far the best leverage the West has, against Russia, is economic. The United States is now the world’s largest producer of natural gas, thanks to exploding shale production. Some in Washington have advocated greatly expanding shipments of liquid natural gas to Ukraine. It’s not difficult to see where that leads. Though there’s no direct, immediate connection to Keystone, there is no denying the strategic value of creating a North American energy fortress. The Keystone XL pipeline is critical to the proper future functioning of the North American energy market and would therefore be the cornerstone —­ call it the keystone —­ of that fortress.[/np_storybar]

When Theodore Roosevelt was president, one of his good friends — he had been best man at TR’s 1886 wedding — was the British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice. So, when visitors to Washington wanted to learn about TR, they asked Rice about him, and Springie, as TR called him, would say: “You must always remember that the president is about 6.” Today’s president is older than that. But he talks like an arrested-development adolescent.

Anyone who has tried to engage a member of that age cohort in an argument probably recognizes the four basic teenage tropes, which also are the only arrows in Obama’s overrated rhetorical quiver. They were all employed by him last week when he went to the White House briefing room to exclaim, as he is wont to do, about the excellence of the Affordable Care Act.

First came the invocation of a straw man. Celebrating the ACA’s enrollment numbers, Obama, referring to Republicans, charged: “They said nobody would sign up.” Of course, no one said this. Obama often is what political philosopher Kenneth Minogue said of an adversary — “a pyromaniac in a field of straw men.”

Adolescents also try to truncate arguments by saying that nothing remains of any arguments against their arguments. Regarding the ACA, Obama said the debate is “settled” and “over.” Progressives also say the debate about catastrophic consequences of man-made climate change is “over,” so everyone should pipe down. And they say the debates about the efficacy of universal preschool, and the cost-benefit balance of a minimum wage increase, are over. Declaring an argument over is so much more restful than engaging with evidence.

A third rhetorical move by argumentative adolescents is to declare that there is nothing to argue about because everything is going along swimmingly. Seven times Obama asserted that the ACA is “working.” That is, however, uninformative because it is ambiguous. The ethanol program is “working” in the sense that it is being implemented as its misguided architects intended. Nevertheless, the program is a substantial net subtraction from the nation’s well-being. The same can be said of sugar import quotas, or agriculture subsidies generally, or many hundreds of other government programs that are, unfortunately, “working.”

Finally, the real discussion-stopper for the righteous — and there is no righteousness like an adolescent’s — is an assertion that has always been an Obama specialty. It is that there cannot be honorable and intelligent disagreement with him. So last week, less than two minutes after saying that the argument about the ACA “isn’t about me,” he said some important opposition to the ACA is about him, citing “states that have chosen not to expand Medicaid for no other reason than political spite.”

This, he said, must be spiteful because expanding Medicaid involves “zero cost to these states.” Well. The federal government does pay the full cost of expansion — for three years. After that, however, states will pay up to 10 percent of the expansion’s costs, which itself will be a large sum. And the 10 percent figure has not been graven on stone by the finger of God. It can be enlarged whenever Congress wants, as surely it will, to enable more federal spending by imposing more burdens on the states. Yet Obama, who aspired to tutor Washington about civility, is incapable of crediting opponents with other than base motives.

About one thing Obama was right, if contradictory. He said Americans want politicians to talk about other subjects — but that Democrats should campaign by celebrating the wondrousness of the ACA. This would be candid because it is what progressivism is — a top-down, continent-wide tissue of taxes, mandates and other coercions. Is the debate about it over? Not quite.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-a-legacy-of-dependence","George F. Will: A legacy of dependence","WASHINGTON — Standing on his presidential limousine, Lyndon Johnson, campaigning in Providence, R.I., in September 1964, bellowed through a bullhorn: “We’re in favor of a lot of things and we’re against mighty few.” This was a synopsis of what he had said four months earlier.

Fifty years ago this Thursday, at the University of Michigan, Johnson had proposed legislating into existence a Great Society. It would end poverty and racial injustice, “but that is just the beginning.” It would “rebuild the entire urban United States” while fending off “boredom and restlessness,” slaking “the hunger for community” and enhancing “the meaning of our lives” — all by assembling “the best thought and the broadest knowledge.”

In 1964, 76% of Americans trusted government to do the right thing “just about always or most of the time;” today, 19% do. The former number is one reason Johnson did so much; the latter is one consequence of his doing so.

Barry Goldwater, Johnson’s 1964 opponent who assumed that Americans would vote to have a third president in 14 months, suffered a landslide defeat. After voters rebuked FDR in 1938 for attempting to “pack” the Supreme Court, Republicans and Southern Democrats prevented any liberal legislating majority in Congress until 1965. That year, however, when 68 senators and 295 representatives were Democrats, Johnson was unfettered.

He remains, regarding government’s role, much the most consequential 20th-century president. Indeed, the American Enterprise Institute’s Nicholas Eberstadt, in his measured new booklet “The Great Society at Fifty: The Triumph and the Tragedy,” says LBJ, more than FDR, “profoundly recast the common understanding of the ends of governance.”

When Johnson became president in 1963, Social Security was America’s only nationwide social program. His programs and those they subsequently legitimated put the nation on the path to the present, in which changed social norms — dependency on government has been destigmatized — have changed America’s national character.

Between 1959 and 1966 — before the War on Poverty was implemented — the percentage of Americans living in poverty plunged by about one-third, from 22.4 to 14.7, slightly lower than in 2012. But, Eberstadt cautions, the poverty rate is “incorrigibly misleading” because government transfer payments have made income levels and consumption levels significantly different. Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, disability payments, heating assistance and other entitlements have, Eberstadt says, made income “a poor predictor of spending power for lower-income groups.” Stark material deprivation is now rare:

“By 2011 … average per capita housing space for people in poverty was higher than the U.S. average for 1980. … [Many] appliances were more common in officially impoverished homes in 2011 than in the typical American home of 1980. … DVD players, personal computers, and home Internet access are now typical in them — amenities not even the richest U.S. households could avail themselves of at the start of the War on Poverty.”

But the institutionalization of anti-poverty policy has been, Eberstadt says carefully, “attended” by the dramatic spread of a “tangle of pathologies.” Daniel Patrick Moynihan coined that phrase in his 1965 report calling attention to family disintegration among African-Americans. The tangle, which now ensnares all races and ethnicities, includes welfare dependency and “flight from work.”

Twenty-nine percent of Americans — about 47% of blacks and 48% of Hispanics — live in households receiving means-tested benefits. And “the proportion of men 20 and older who are employed has dramatically and almost steadily dropped since the start of the War on Poverty, falling from 80.6% in January 1964 to 67.6% 50 years later.” Because work — independence, self-reliance — is essential to the culture of freedom, ominous developments have coincided with Great Society policies:

For every adult man ages 20 to 64 who is between jobs and looking for work, more than three are neither working nor seeking work, a trend that began with the Great Society. And what Eberstadt calls “the earthquake that shook family structure in the era of expansive anti-poverty policies” has seen out-of-wedlock births increase from 7.7% in 1965 to more than 40% in 2012, including 72% of black babies.

LBJ’s starkly bifurcated legacy includes the triumphant Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 — and the tragic aftermath of much of his other works. Eberstadt asks: Is it “simply a coincidence” that male flight from work and family breakdown have coincided with Great Society policies, and that dependence on government is more widespread and perhaps more habitual than ever? Goldwater’s insistent 1964 question is increasingly pertinent: “What’s happening to this country of ours?”

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-the-bergdahl-swap-didnt-merely-defy-congress-it-broke-the-law","George F. Will: The Bergdahl swap didn't merely 'defy Congress.' It broke the law","What Winston Churchill said of former U.S. secretary of state John Foster Dulles — that he was a bull who carried his own china shop around with him — is true of Susan Rice, who is, to be polite, accident prone. When in September 2012 she was deputed to sell to the public the fable that the Benghazi attack was just an unfortunately vigorous movie review — a response to an Internet video — it could have been that she, rather than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was given this degrading duty because Rice was merely UN ambassador, an ornamental position at an inconsequential institution. Today, however, Rice is Barack Obama’s national security adviser, so two conclusions must be drawn.

[np_storybar title=”Bowe Bergdahl tried to escape Taliban captors twice over five years: reports” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/06/05/bowe-bergdahl-tried-to-escape-taliban-captors-twice-over-five-years-reports/”%5DThe Pentagon reportedly decided not to try to rescue Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl because his Taliban captors were constantly moving the American prisoner of war to different safe houses and he was heavily guarded after two failed escapes.

“A rescue mission would have been fraught politically as well as tactically,” a senior defense official briefed on the Bergdahl case told The Daily Beast.

U.S. officials told the news website that the Obama government wanted to avoid a politically risky raid on dozens of safe houses in Pakistan. Tensions have been high between the two nations since a unilateral Navy SEAL raid that killed Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in May 2011.

Perhaps she did not know, in advance of the swap of five terrorists for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the, shall we say, ambiguities about Bergdahl’s departure from his platoon in Afghanistan, and the reportedly deadly consequences of his behaviour. If so, then she has pioneered a degree of incompetence exotic even for this 10-thumbed administration. If, however, she did know, and still allowed Obama to present this as a mellow moment of national satisfaction, she is condign punishment for his choice of such hirelings.

Perhaps this exchange really is, as Obama said in defending it, an excellent thing “regardless of the circumstances, whatever those circumstances may turn out to be.” His confidence in its excellence is striking, considering that he acknowledges that we do not know the facts about what would seem to be important “circumstances.”

Such as the note Bergdahl reportedly left before disappearing, in which he supposedly said he did not approve of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. And the notably strong and numerous expressions of anger by members of Bergdahl’s battalion concerning his comportment and its costs.

Obama did not comply with the law requiring presidents to notify Congress 30 days before such exchanges. Politico can be cited about this not because among the media it is exceptionally, well, understanding of Obama’s exuberant notion of executive latitude but because it is not. Politico headlined a story on his noncompliance with the law “Obama May Finally Be Going Rogue on Gitmo.” Politico said Obama’s “assertive” act “defied Congress” — Congress, not the rule of law — in order “to get that process [of closing Guantanamo Bay prison] moving.” It sent “a clear message” that “Obama is now willing to wield his executive powers to get the job done.” Or, as used to be said in extenuation of strong leaders, “to make the trains run on time.”

The 44th president, channeling — not for the first time — the 37th (in his post-impeachment conversation with David Frost), may say: “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” Already the administration says events dictated a speed that precluded complying with the law.

This explanation should be accorded open-minded, but not empty-minded, consideration. It should be considered in light of the fact that as the Veterans Affairs debacle continued, Obama went to Afghanistan to hug some troops, then completed the terrorists-for-Bergdahl transaction. And in light of the fact that Obama waged a seven-month military intervention in Libya’s civil war without complying with the law (the War Powers Resolution) that requires presidents to terminate within 60 to 90 days a military action not authorized or subsequently approved by Congress.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, says the administration told him he would be notified about negotiations for the release of terrorists. He now says he cannot “believe a thing this president says.”

This episode will be examined by congressional committees, if they can pierce the administration’s coming cover-up

Obama says his agents “consulted with Congress for quite some time” about prisoner exchanges with the Taliban. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, says there have been no consultations since 2011. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., says, “I don’t like it when the White House says the intelligence committees were briefed. Because we weren’t.” He says Obama is “referring to … 2011-2012, when I was still in grade school.”

Now, now. “Assertive” presidents can’t be expected to “go rogue” without ruffling feathers. And omelettes cannot be made without breaking eggs. Etc.

This episode will be examined by congressional committees, if they can pierce the administration’s coming cover-up, which has been foreshadowed by the response to congressional attempts to scrutinize the politicization of the IRS. If the military stalls on turning over files to Congress pertaining to the five years of Bergdahl’s absence, we will at least know that there is no national institution remaining to be corrupted.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-george-w-bushs-ruinous-war-barack-obamas-policy-of-retreat","George F. Will: George W. Bush's ruinous war, Barack Obama's policy of retreat","WASHINGTON — Two hundred and nine years after Marines visited “the shores of Tripoli,” dispatched by President Jefferson to punish Barbary pirates for attacking U.S. vessels in the Mediterranean, Marines are again in that sea, poised to return. If they are sent ashore, their mission will be to rescue U.S. citizens from the consequences of U.S. policy. Then they might have to do the same thing in Baghdad.

The House Select Committee on Benghazi should not consider the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi its sole or even primary topic. Rather, it should begin at the beginning, with the U.S. military intervention in Libya’s civil war 18 months before Benghazi.

Today, Libya is an anarchy of hundreds of rival militias. The U.S. intervention, for which Barack Obama’s phrasemakers coined the term “leading from behind,” was justified by “R2P” — the “responsibility to protect” Libyans, especially in Benghazi, from the supposed threat of genocide inflicted by Moammar Gaddafi. This humanitarian imperialism quickly became an exercise in regime change. But the prolonged attempt to assassinate Gaddafi from the air made no provision for a replacement regime.

The Benghazi committee should hear from Alan J. Kuperman of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. In his policy brief “Lessons from Libya: How Not to Intervene,” he says:

Gaddafi did not initiate violence against peaceful protesters. Rather, protesters initiated the violence that engulfed four cities. Media reports “exaggerated the death toll by a factor of 10, citing ‘more than 2,000 deaths’ in Benghazi during the initial days of the uprising, whereas Human Rights Watch (HRW) later documented only 233 deaths across all of Libya in that period.” Furthermore, when the U.S. and a few other NATO nations intervened in March 2011, “Gaddafi already had regained control of most of Libya, while the rebels were retreating rapidly toward Egypt. Thus, the conflict was about to end, barely six weeks after it started, at a toll of about 1,000 dead. … [The intervention] enabled the rebels to resume their attack, which prolonged the war for another seven months and caused at least 7,000 more deaths.” The intervention encouraged peaceful protesters in Syria to use violence in the hope of attracting an intervention. This increased the rate of killing there tenfold. And since Gaddafi fell, “sophisticated weapons from Gaddafi’s arsenal — including up to 15,000 man-portable, surface-to-air missiles unaccounted for as of 2012 — leaked to radical Islamists throughout the region.”

Perhaps including Iraq. The Benghazi committee is organizing as Iraq crumbles, its army disintegrating as the enemy approaches. In January, Fallujah fell to forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, an al-Qaeda affiliate. ISIS’ conquest of Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, then Tal Afar, is redundant evidence that the U.S. experience in Iraq was the worst episode of squandered valor in U.S. history.

Some will say that it would not have come to this if the Iraqi army had not been disbanded, or if there had been better occupation planning, or if there had been a bigger occupying force, or if an agreement had been reached to keep a significant number of U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely, or if …

Enough. Here is a question for Republican presidential aspirants:

Given the absence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, and given that we now know how little we know about “nation-building” and about the promotion of democracy in nations that need to be “built,” and given that Saddam Hussein’s horrific tyranny at least controlled Iraq’s sectarian furies, and given that Iraq under him was Iran’s adversary, and given that 10-year wars make Americans indiscriminately averse to military undertakings — given all this, if you could rewind history to March 2003, would you favour invading Iraq?

Barack Obama is conducting the foreign policy retreat he promised, that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton facilitated without apparent qualms, and that many Americans said they wanted until it began to make them queasy. The Republican challenge is to articulate a policy that fills the vast space between this retreat and the ruinous grandiosity of the “freedom agenda” of Obama’s predecessor.

Americans prefer not to think about, and rarely allow elections to turn on, foreign policy. Events, however, are not cooperating. Trotsky probably did not really say this, but someone should: “You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.”

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/joe-oconnor-tragic-police-shooting-of-armed-teens-that-didnt-happen-says-a-lot-about-canadian-city","Joe O’Connor: Tragic police shooting of armed teens — that didn't happen — says a lot about Canadian city","A kid is holding what appears to be a gun. Pointing it and pacing to his left, then right, before tucking the weapon into his waistband and scuffing at some snow with his shoes and sitting at a picnic table beneath a gazebo in a city park.

This was last month in Cleveland, Ohio. Tamir Rice, 12, doesn’t know someone has called 9-1-1 and described him as a “juvenile” to a police dispatcher while twice referring to the gun that he is carrying as “probably fake.”

The video, seen on screens across North America and around the world, captures what happened next: A police car pulls up. Two officers jump out, guns drawn.

Within a second, perhaps two at the most, Tamir Rice has been shot in the chest. He dies the next day.

The gun will indeed turn out to be a toy and Americans will ask themselves, again, how could this happen, and why does it always seems to happen here?

In Canada, we will scratch our heads and whisper: surely that couldn’t happen here.

And we are right. And Moncton is our proof.

Moncton isn’t Cleveland, but a southeastern New Brunswick city with a story to tell that says a lot about the place, and the people who live there, and the police who work there.

It is a story about “two males” with a handgun in a park on a Sunday afternoon, four days before Christmas. Someone dials 9-1-1 and tells the police dispatcher that the pair are pointing a weapon at a passerby. An RCMP officer rushes to the scene, arriving around 4:30 p.m. One of the “males” turns and actually points the weapon at the cop and — and no one gets shot.

“Someone definitely could have got shot, because as he turned toward the police officer he had the gun pointed toward him,” Staff Sergeant Mark Janes, of the Codiac Regional RCMP, said Tuesday from Moncton.

Instead, the officer dove for cover, drew his service revolver and shouted at the “males,” who turned out to be a couple of teenage boys, aged 14 and 15, to drop the firearm. They promptly did. The gun turned out to be a bb gun.

The boys were driven home. Police spoke to their parents. No charges were laid. And no headlines were written about a tragic shooting in Moncton, a city where, if anywhere in Canada, police could be forgiven for being a little quick on the trigger.

Remember the names of the dead? Constables Dave Ross, Fabrice Gevaudan and Douglas Larche, and the wounded, Darlene Goguen and Eric Dubois. And the date, June 4, when Justin Bourque committed the worst mass police shooting in Canadian history.

Ever since, Moncton RCMP have been receiving calls from a spooked, hyper-vigilant public, that keeps mistaking toys and other objects for lethal weapons, and keeps seeing the kids waving them around in the park as the next Bourque — and then dial 9-1-1 to report it. Police respond to every call.

“Sometimes it is not even a firearm,” Sgt. Janes says. “The community has a heightened sense of sensitivity with respect to these types of incidents as a result of June 4, along with the police…

“It is hard, for me anyway, to compliment your own force. It sounds like you are bragging and putting down other forces. But I think it goes to the training of our guys. You know, we have these talks on a weekly basis with respect to being vigilant out there.

“But, at the same time, looking at all the threat cues.”

He means looking for what is actually there, right in front of you. Last Sunday, it was two idiot teens in a park. One pointing what looked to be a gun at a police officer. And nothing happened.

In Cleveland, Tamir Rice stood up from a park bench and was shot dead.

It is a tragic story.

It is not Moncton. For that, we can all be proud.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-millennials-are-struggling-with-the-worst-economic-climate-in-decades-at-least-they-got-their-president","George F. Will: Millennials are struggling with the worst economic climate in decades. At least they got their president","It is said that the problem with the younger generation — any younger generation — is that it has not read the minutes of the last meeting. U.S. President Barack Obama, forever young, has convenient memory loss: It serves his ideology. His amnesia concerning the policies that produced the robust recovery from the more severe (measured by its 10.8% unemployment rate) recession of 1981-82 has produced policies that have resulted in 0.1% economic growth in 2014’s first quarter — the 56th, 57th and 58th months of the recovery from the recession that began in December 2007.

June begins the sixth year of the anemic recovery from the 18-month recession. Even if what Obama’s administration calls “historically severe” weather — aka, winter — reduced GDP growth by up to 1.4 percentage points, growth of 1.5% would still be grotesque.

America has a continental market, a reasonably educated and remarkably — considering the incentives for not working — industrious population, an increasingly (because of declining private-sector unionization) flexible labour market, an efficient financial system, extraordinary research universities to fuel innovation and astonishing energy abundance. Yet the recovery’s two best growth years (2.5% in 2010 and 2.8% in 2012) are satisfactory only when compared to 2011 and 2013 (1.8% and 1.9%, respectively).

The reason unemployment fell by four-tenths of a point (to 6.3%) in April while growth stalled is that 806,000 people left the labour force. The labour force participation rate fell by four-tenths of a point to a level reached in 1978, which was during the Carter-era stagflation and early in the surge of women into the workforce. There are about 14.5 million more Americans than before the recession but nearly 300,000 fewer jobs, and household income remains below the pre-recession peak.

Paul Volcker, whose nomination to be chairman of the Federal Reserve Board was Jimmy Carter’s best presidential decision, raised interest rates to put the nation through a recession to extinguish the inflation that, combined with stagnant growth, ruined Carter’s presidency. Then came the 1983-88 expansion, when growth averaged 4.6%, including five quarters over 7%.

Ronald Reagan lightened the weight of government as measured by taxation and regulation. Obama has done the opposite. According to the annual “snapshot of the federal regulatory state” compiled by Clyde Wayne Crews Jr. of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, four of the five largest yearly totals of pages in the Federal Register — the record of regulations — have occurred during the Obama administration. The CEI’s delightfully cheeky “unconstitutionality index,” measuring Congress’ excessive delegation of its lawmaking policy, was 51 in 2013. This means Congress passed 72 laws but unelected bureaucrats issued 3,659 regulations.

Americans 25 to 32 constitute the first age cohort since the Second World War with higher unemployment or a greater portion living in poverty than their parents at this age

The more than $1.1-trillion of student loan debt — the fastest-growing debt category, larger than credit card or auto loan debt — is restraining consumption, as is the retirement of baby boomers. In 2012, more than 70% of college graduates had student loan debts averaging about $30,000. This commencement season’s diploma recipients are entering an economy where more than 40% of recent college graduates are either unemployed or in jobs that do not require a college degree. This is understandable, given that 44% of the job growth since the recession ended has been in food services, retail clerking or other low-wage jobs.

In April, the number of persons under 25 in the workforce declined by 484,000. Unsurprisingly, almost one in three (31%) persons 18 to 34 are living with their parents, including 25% who have jobs.

So, the rate of household formation has, Neil Irwin reports in The New York Times, slowed from a yearly average of 1.35 million in 2001-06 to 569,000 in 2007-13. And investment in residential property is at the lowest level (as a share of the economy) since the Second World War. “If,” Irwin writes, “building activity returned merely to its postwar average proportion of the economy, growth would jump this year to a booming, 1990s-like level of 4%.”

However, a Wall Street Journal headline announces that Washington has a plan: “U.S. Backs Off Tight Mortgage Rules.” It really is true: Life is not one damn thing after another, it is the same damn thing over and over.

There is, however, something new under the sun. The Pew Research Center reports that Americans 25 to 32 — “millennials” — constitute the first age cohort since the Second World War with higher unemployment or a greater portion living in poverty than their parents at this age. But today’s millennials have the consolation of having the President they wanted.

"http://nationalpost.com/scene/inside-the-bill-cosby-defence-team-strategy-hush-accusers-insult-them-then-blame-the-media-2","Inside the Bill Cosby defence team's strategy: Hush accusers, insult them, then blame the media","In 2005, when Tamara Green told the Today show and The Philadelphia Inquirer that Bill Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in the early 1970s, one of Cosby’s lawyers publicly branded the allegations “absolutely false,” while his aides approached another newspaper with “damaging information” about her, according to court documents.

Five years earlier, after an actress on Cosby’s TV series Cosby told the police that he had tried to put her hand down his sweatpants at his New York town house, Cosby’s lawyers threatened The National Enquirer with a $250-million defamation suit for publishing detailed comments about the incident by the woman’s relatives.

And when Cosby acknowledged an extramarital affair in a 1997 interview with Dan Rather, his agent telephoned the president of CBS Entertainment to demand that the segment not air on 60 Minutes as planned. It did not, although CBS News said the decision had nothing to do with the call.

As accusations of sexual assault continue to mount against Cosby — more than two dozen women have gone public, the latest last Monday — the question arises as to why these stories never sparked a widespread outcry before. While many of the women say they never filed police complaints or went public because they feared damaging their reputations or careers, the aggressive legal and media strategy mounted by Cosby and his team may also have played a significant role.

The Cosby team’s media strategy over the years has been a mix of hardball and playing ball, sometimes even with the same news organization

An examination of how the team has dealt with scandals over the past two decades and into this fall reveals an organized and expensive effort that involved quashing accusations as they emerged while raising questions about the accusers’ character and motives, both publicly and surreptitiously. And the team has never been shy about blasting the news media for engaging in a feeding frenzy even as the team made deals or slipped the news organizations information that would cast Cosby’s accusers in a negative light.

Playing hardball with people who make (and report on) incendiary claims is hardly a new tactic in the celebrity world. But given the volume and severity of the recent charges, with numerous women saying Cosby drugged and then sexually assaulted them, some legal and public relations practitioners question the wisdom of continuing to counterpunch.

“Sometimes in a case like this, less can be more,” said Benjamin Brafman, a criminal defense lawyer who represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn. “Attacking someone who is perceived to be a ‘victim’ can often be unproductive.”

“I would suggest,” Brafman added, “a softly spoken denial rather than an outspoken challenge to the integrity of the women now coming forward. Simply put, it may be better to say nothing than try and engage so many.”

The team behind Cosby’s longtime strategy has included John P. Schmitt, a lawyer from the New York law firm Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler; Norman Brokaw, Cosby’s longtime agent at the William Morris Agency until late 2012; and Norman’s son David Brokaw, who has been Cosby’s publicist for 40 years. In addition, at several critical moments over the past few decades, Cosby has called on Martin D. Singer, an $850-an-hour lawyer with a reputation for playing rough on behalf of clients like Charlie Sheen and Arnold Schwarzenegger when they found themselves embroiled in controversy.

“He is a bulldog,” David R. Ginsburg, executive director of the entertainment, media and intellectual property law program at the UCLA School of Law, said of Singer.

Singer’s intensity was on full display in the first week of December after Judy Huth filed a civil suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that in 1974, when she was 15, Cosby plied her with drinks and forced her to perform a sex act on him in a bedroom at the Playboy Mansion.

In court papers, Singer said Huth’s claim was “meritless” and nothing short of “a shakedown.” According to Singer, Huth and her lawyer had first demanded money to keep them from going public and Huth had tried unsuccessfully to sell the allegations to a tabloid 10 years earlier. (Huth’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.)

It was not the first time that the word “shakedown” had been used to describe the motives of those coming forward with accusations of sexual abuse by Cosby.

Back in 2005, after Andrea Constand, a Temple University basketball manager, told the police in Pennsylvania that Cosby had drugged and sexually abused her at his home in Pennsylvania the year before, a story appeared on “Celebrity Justice,” a TV show and website created by the founder of TMZ. “Sources connected with Bill Cosby,” the show reported, said that before Constand had approached the police, her mother had asked Cosby to “make things right with money.” The show went on to say that a Cosby representative had called this “a classic shakedown.”

‘The media has consistently refused to look into or publish information about various women whose stories are contradicted by their own conduct or statement’

Singer was the Cosby representative in question, another member of Cosby’s legal team said at a court hearing in 2005, and the next year that Constand sued him for defamation. (Her lawyers denied the charge at the time.) That suit and Constand’s suit against Cosby were later consolidated and settled confidentially.

Singer declined to comment for this article.

Schmitt, who has been a lawyer for Cosby for more than 30 years, has also played a significant role — both behind the scenes and publicly — perhaps most notably in beating back the accusations of Autumn Jackson, who claimed to be Cosby’s daughter. When Jackson, in 1997, threatened to sell the story to the tabloid The Globe unless Cosby paid her $40-million, Schmitt agreed to wear a recording device as part of a law enforcement operation that charged her with extortion.

And after Jackson was found guilty, Schmitt took the unusual step of appearing on Geraldo Rivera’s CNBC show, Rivera Live, in 1997, and saying that Cosby would take a blood test to determine paternity.

Schmitt declined to comment for this article.

The Cosby team’s media strategy over the years has been a mix of hardball and playing ball, sometimes even with the same news organization.

Though the Cosby legal team threatened The National Enquirer in 2000 with a $250-million lawsuit, relations with that tabloid were decidedly more friendly five years later.

After Constand, the Temple University employee, had gone public with her accusations against Cosby, The National Enquirer was pursuing a story about another woman, Beth Ferrier, who said Cosby had drugged and sexually assaulted her in the mid-1980s. In exchange for not publishing its article about Ferrier, The Enquirer got an exclusive interview with Cosby (the headline: “Bill Cosby Ends His Silence: My Story!”), according to recently unsealed court documents.

Team Cosby would also try to apply pressure behind the scenes. In 1997, soon after Cosby’s son, Ennis, was murdered in Los Angeles, Cosby gave his first interview to Dan Rather of CBS News. For much of the 2 1/2 hours of questioning, Rather focused on the crime and how Cosby was dealing with the grief. But he then gingerly asked about Jackson and the extortion charges, which had just become public days before. Cosby, surprisingly, acknowledged the affair with the mother and said he could possibly be the father.

When the network aired the newsiest tidbits from Rather’s forthcoming 60 Minutes segment on the morning and evening news programs, Norman Brokaw, Cosby’s William Morris agent and one of the most powerful people in television at the time, called Leslie Moonves, then the president of CBS Entertainment, to complain about the treatment of the network’s star.

Days later — after Rather had recorded his audio for 60 Minutes — CBS News decided to scrap the segment. CBS executives denied any corporate interference, saying journalistic reasons had prompted the move.

In the biography Cosby, Mark Whitaker writes that bad blood between Don Hewitt, the powerful executive producer of “60 Minutes,” and Rather also drove the decision. Hewitt, who despised Rather, was furious that the newsiest excerpts had already been broadcast.

Moonves and Rather declined to comment.

During this recent spate of accusations, the Cosby team has suggested that the proliferation of accounts is itself a reason to distrust them and has pointed to apparent inconsistencies in some of the women’s stories. It has also systematically directed its ire at the news media, which it claims is engaged in a blind rush to judgment against a man who has never been convicted or charged.

Singer threatened to sue BuzzFeed last month as it prepared an article about accusations by Janice Dickinson, a onetime supermodel, that Cosby drugged and raped her in 1982 in Lake Tahoe, Calif. “You proceed at your peril,” Singer wrote, saying that Dickinson had told a contradictory story in her memoir more than a decade earlier.

And in the past 10 days, he has sent angry letters to CNN and The Daily News, accusing them of abandoning any journalistic rigour in their coverage. “The media has consistently refused to look into or publish information about various women whose stories are contradicted by their own conduct or statement,” he wrote in his letter to The Daily News.

Singer isn’t the only one following the blame-the-media handbook. On Dec. 15, Cosby’s wife, Camille, finally broke her silence and joined the defense of her husband. In a statement released by David Brokaw, she said, “There appears to be no vetting of my husband’s accusers before stories are published or aired.”

She concluded: “None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking the victim. But the question should be asked – who is the victim?”

But casting doubt on or aiming vitriol at the accusers can have consequences.

In 2005, when Cosby’s team denied Tamara Green’s accusations that he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in Los Angeles in the early 1970s, she did not pursue legal action. But this month she was ready to fight back. Cosby’s team had greeted her renewed claim of sexual assault by saying it was “a 10-year discredited accusation that proved to be nothing at the time, and is still nothing.” On Dec. 10, Green filed a defamation suit against Cosby, saying the denials basically branded her a liar.

“I want it put to a jury,” Green said this month. “I want it ended, finally. I want my name restored.”","2014-12-29 16:20:29","1","49.0","22.0","3.0","0.0","24.0","0.0","97.0","87.0","0.0","134.0","17.0","8.0","7","1753","93.99","77.94","15.42","6.99","24.35","25.44","75.93","44.89","7.42","3.82","0.40","0.06","0.11","2.51","0.74","3.59","9.58","14.66","5.53","3.54","5.42","1.08","10.67","4.28","2.80","1.37","2.62","1.77","4.22","1.25","2.91","0.68","1.60","0.23","11.47","0.63","0.06","2.17","1.48","7.76","2.00","0.97","1.08","2.17","0.74","2.45","2.62","0.97","1.43","0.17","1.54","0.29","0.57","0.57","0.11","6.90","1.37","2.11","3.59","0.40","0.63","6.05","4.11","0.68","13.63","1.43","5.93","6.67","4.73","1.88","0.17","0.63","0.11","0.11","0.11","0.00","0.06","0.06","0.00","0.00","16.37","4.05","5.99","0.17","0.11","0.06","0.06","0.57","2.74","1.83","0.46","0.34","8516","8.09","30.724137931034484","2636","1749","72","55.27","12.8","11.6","12.48","14.6","360","25.0","19.95327615780446","687","27.21","19","0.43","0","62","44","190","0","231","98","5","3","12","272","225","3","91","0","0","48","29","69","4","2","2","45","0","46","125","38","61","16","30","8","10","2","10"

An examination of how the team has dealt with scandals over the past two decades and into this fall reveals an organized and expensive effort that involved quashing accusations as they emerged while raising questions about the accusers’ character and motives, both publicly and surreptitiously. And the team has never been shy about blasting the news media for engaging in a feeding frenzy even as the team made deals or slipped the news organizations information that would cast Cosby’s accusers in a negative light.

Playing hardball with people who make (and report on) incendiary claims is hardly a new tactic in the celebrity world. But given the volume and severity of the recent charges, with numerous women saying Cosby drugged and then sexually assaulted them, some legal and public relations practitioners question the wisdom of continuing to counterpunch.

“Sometimes in a case like this, less can be more,” said Benjamin Brafman, a criminal defense lawyer who represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn. “Attacking someone who is perceived to be a ‘victim’ can often be unproductive.”

“I would suggest,” Brafman added, “a softly spoken denial rather than an outspoken challenge to the integrity of the women now coming forward. Simply put, it may be better to say nothing than try and engage so many.”

The team behind Cosby’s longtime strategy has included John P. Schmitt, a lawyer from the New York law firm Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler; Norman Brokaw, Cosby’s longtime agent at the William Morris Agency until late 2012; and Norman’s son David Brokaw, who has been Cosby’s publicist for 40 years. In addition, at several critical moments over the past few decades, Cosby has called on Martin D. Singer, an $850-an-hour lawyer with a reputation for playing rough on behalf of clients like Charlie Sheen and Arnold Schwarzenegger when they found themselves embroiled in controversy.

“He is a bulldog,” David R. Ginsburg, executive director of the entertainment, media and intellectual property law program at the UCLA School of Law, said of Singer.

Singer’s intensity was on full display in the first week of December after Judy Huth filed a civil suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that in 1974, when she was 15, Cosby plied her with drinks and forced her to perform a sex act on him in a bedroom at the Playboy Mansion.

In court papers, Singer said Huth’s claim was “meritless” and nothing short of “a shakedown.” According to Singer, Huth and her lawyer had first demanded money to keep them from going public and Huth had tried unsuccessfully to sell the allegations to a tabloid 10 years earlier. (Huth’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.)

It was not the first time that the word “shakedown” had been used to describe the motives of those coming forward with accusations of sexual abuse by Cosby.

Back in 2005, after Andrea Constand, a Temple University basketball manager, told the police in Pennsylvania that Cosby had drugged and sexually abused her at his home in Pennsylvania the year before, a story appeared on “Celebrity Justice,” a TV show and website created by the founder of TMZ. “Sources connected with Bill Cosby,” the show reported, said that before Constand had approached the police, her mother had asked Cosby to “make things right with money.” The show went on to say that a Cosby representative had called this “a classic shakedown.”

‘The media has consistently refused to look into or publish information about various women whose stories are contradicted by their own conduct or statement’

Singer was the Cosby representative in question, another member of Cosby’s legal team said at a court hearing in 2005, and the next year that Constand sued him for defamation. (Her lawyers denied the charge at the time.) That suit and Constand’s suit against Cosby were later consolidated and settled confidentially.

Singer declined to comment for this article.

Schmitt, who has been a lawyer for Cosby for more than 30 years, has also played a significant role — both behind the scenes and publicly — perhaps most notably in beating back the accusations of Autumn Jackson, who claimed to be Cosby’s daughter. When Jackson, in 1997, threatened to sell the story to the tabloid The Globe unless Cosby paid her $40-million, Schmitt agreed to wear a recording device as part of a law enforcement operation that charged her with extortion.

And after Jackson was found guilty, Schmitt took the unusual step of appearing on Geraldo Rivera’s CNBC show, Rivera Live, in 1997, and saying that Cosby would take a blood test to determine paternity.

Schmitt declined to comment for this article.

The Cosby team’s media strategy over the years has been a mix of hardball and playing ball, sometimes even with the same news organization.

Though the Cosby legal team threatened The National Enquirer in 2000 with a $250-million lawsuit, relations with that tabloid were decidedly more friendly five years later.

After Constand, the Temple University employee, had gone public with her accusations against Cosby, The National Enquirer was pursuing a story about another woman, Beth Ferrier, who said Cosby had drugged and sexually assaulted her in the mid-1980s. In exchange for not publishing its article about Ferrier, The Enquirer got an exclusive interview with Cosby (the headline: “Bill Cosby Ends His Silence: My Story!”), according to recently unsealed court documents.

Team Cosby would also try to apply pressure behind the scenes. In 1997, soon after Cosby’s son, Ennis, was murdered in Los Angeles, Cosby gave his first interview to Dan Rather of CBS News. For much of the 2 1/2 hours of questioning, Rather focused on the crime and how Cosby was dealing with the grief. But he then gingerly asked about Jackson and the extortion charges, which had just become public days before. Cosby, surprisingly, acknowledged the affair with the mother and said he could possibly be the father.

When the network aired the newsiest tidbits from Rather’s forthcoming 60 Minutes segment on the morning and evening news programs, Norman Brokaw, Cosby’s William Morris agent and one of the most powerful people in television at the time, called Leslie Moonves, then the president of CBS Entertainment, to complain about the treatment of the network’s star.

Days later — after Rather had recorded his audio for 60 Minutes — CBS News decided to scrap the segment. CBS executives denied any corporate interference, saying journalistic reasons had prompted the move.

In the biography Cosby, Mark Whitaker writes that bad blood between Don Hewitt, the powerful executive producer of “60 Minutes,” and Rather also drove the decision. Hewitt, who despised Rather, was furious that the newsiest excerpts had already been broadcast.

Moonves and Rather declined to comment.

During this recent spate of accusations, the Cosby team has suggested that the proliferation of accounts is itself a reason to distrust them and has pointed to apparent inconsistencies in some of the women’s stories. It has also systematically directed its ire at the news media, which it claims is engaged in a blind rush to judgment against a man who has never been convicted or charged.

Singer threatened to sue BuzzFeed last month as it prepared an article about accusations by Janice Dickinson, a onetime supermodel, that Cosby drugged and raped her in 1982 in Lake Tahoe, Calif. “You proceed at your peril,” Singer wrote, saying that Dickinson had told a contradictory story in her memoir more than a decade earlier.

And in the past 10 days, he has sent angry letters to CNN and The Daily News, accusing them of abandoning any journalistic rigour in their coverage. “The media has consistently refused to look into or publish information about various women whose stories are contradicted by their own conduct or statement,” he wrote in his letter to The Daily News.

Singer isn’t the only one following the blame-the-media handbook. On Dec. 15, Cosby’s wife, Camille, finally broke her silence and joined the defense of her husband. In a statement released by David Brokaw, she said, “There appears to be no vetting of my husband’s accusers before stories are published or aired.”

She concluded: “None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking the victim. But the question should be asked – who is the victim?”

But casting doubt on or aiming vitriol at the accusers can have consequences.

In 2005, when Cosby’s team denied Tamara Green’s accusations that he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in Los Angeles in the early 1970s, she did not pursue legal action. But this month she was ready to fight back. Cosby’s team had greeted her renewed claim of sexual assault by saying it was “a 10-year discredited accusation that proved to be nothing at the time, and is still nothing.” On Dec. 10, Green filed a defamation suit against Cosby, saying the denials basically branded her a liar.

“I want it put to a jury,” Green said this month. “I want it ended, finally. I want my name restored.”","2014-12-29 16:20:29","1","49.0","22.0","3.0","0.0","24.0","0.0","97.0","87.0","0.0","134.0","17.0","8.0","7","1753","93.99","77.94","15.42","6.99","24.35","25.44","75.93","44.89","7.42","3.82","0.40","0.06","0.11","2.51","0.74","3.59","9.58","14.66","5.53","3.54","5.42","1.08","10.67","4.28","2.80","1.37","2.62","1.77","4.22","1.25","2.91","0.68","1.60","0.23","11.47","0.63","0.06","2.17","1.48","7.76","2.00","0.97","1.08","2.17","0.74","2.45","2.62","0.97","1.43","0.17","1.54","0.29","0.57","0.57","0.11","6.90","1.37","2.11","3.59","0.40","0.63","6.05","4.11","0.68","13.63","1.43","5.93","6.67","4.73","1.88","0.17","0.63","0.11","0.11","0.11","0.00","0.06","0.06","0.00","0.00","16.37","4.05","5.99","0.17","0.11","0.06","0.06","0.57","2.74","1.83","0.46","0.34","8516","8.09","30.724137931034484","2636","1749","72","55.27","12.8","11.6","12.48","14.6","360","25.0","19.95327615780446","687","27.21","19","0.43","0","62","44","190","0","231","98","5","3","12","272","225","3","91","0","0","48","29","69","4","2","2","45","0","46","125","38","61","16","30","8","10","2","10"

Five years earlier, after an actress on Cosby’s TV series Cosby told the police that he had tried to put her hand down his sweatpants at his New York town house, Cosby’s lawyers threatened The National Enquirer with a $250-million defamation suit for publishing detailed comments about the incident by the woman’s relatives.

And when Cosby acknowledged an extramarital affair in a 1997 interview with Dan Rather, his agent telephoned the president of CBS Entertainment to demand that the segment not air on 60 Minutes as planned. It did not, although CBS News said the decision had nothing to do with the call.

As accusations of sexual assault continue to mount against Cosby — more than two dozen women have gone public, the latest last Monday — the question arises as to why these stories never sparked a widespread outcry before. While many of the women say they never filed police complaints or went public because they feared damaging their reputations or careers, the aggressive legal and media strategy mounted by Cosby and his team may also have played a significant role.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-president-bush-the-third","George F. Will: President Bush the Third","WASHINGTON — The human kindling that makes up the flammable Republican base may soon burst into flames, again. Portions of that excitable cohort are looking — some with fawn-like eyes filled with hurt, others with sparks shooting from eyes narrowed like gun slits — askance at other Republicans urging Jeb Bush to seek the 2016 presidential nomination.

A candidacy by Florida’s former governor would be desirable. But if Republicans want to avoid intra-party carnage, they should be very careful about doing what The Washington Post recently reported: “Many of the Republican Party’s most powerful insiders and financiers have begun a behind-the-scenes campaign to draft former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush into the 2016 presidential race.”

How “behind the scenes” is an enterprise reported on the Post‘s front page? And what does “draft” mean? No shrinking violet will be nominated. The last time there was anything like a draft was the nomination of Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson in 1952, whose acceptance speech to the Democratic convention contained cringe-inducing treacle:

“I would not seek your nomination for the presidency, because the burdens of that office stagger the imagination. … I have asked the Merciful Father — the Father of us all — to let this cup pass from me, but from such dread responsibility one does not shrink in fear, in self-interest, or in false humility. So, ‘If this cup may not pass from me, except I drink it, Thy will be done.’”

American voters showed what they thought of the reluctant Stevenson posing as the crucified Jesus, saying in effect: “You don’t want to be president? We can help you with that.” He lost 39 of the then 48 states.

It would not be a moral failing for Bush to decide against enduring the marathon gantlet of presidential politics. He will not, however, have the nomination handed to him on a silver salver. And the nomination fight would be especially bruising because Bush has been admirably forthright, but certainly impolitic, about two divisive issues — immigration and the “Common Core” national education standards for grades K through 12.

There are too many Republicans who seem to derive more satisfaction from burning Republicans at the stake than from defeating Democrats

He wisely favours immigration reform responsive to the needs of the U.S. workforce and the realities of the 12 million who are not here legally but are neither going to “self-deport” or be deported. His enthusiasm for the Common Core is misplaced but conservatives, in judging it, should judge Bush with a generosity he has earned by his exemplary record as an education reformer favouring school choice.

Unfortunately, there are too many Republicans who, honing their knives and lengthening their lists of unforgivable heresies, seem to derive more satisfaction from burning Republicans at the stake than from defeating Democrats. And there are too many other Republicans who think their task is to save the party from its base of principled activists.

The time is ripe for Republicans to do as well with Hispanics as Jeb Bush’s brother did in 2000

Bush is fluent in Spanish and accomplished at courting the approximately 17% of the Florida electorate that is Hispanic: He received 61% of their votes in 1998 and almost that much in 2002. The time is ripe for Republicans to do as well with Hispanics as Jeb Bush’s brother did in 2000. Political analyst Michael Barone writes in the Washington Examiner:

“By my estimate, about one-third of the homeowners foreclosed on in the years just after the housing price collapse were Hispanics.” And since the Obamacare rollout, during which the Spanish-language version of the website was completely inoperative for weeks, “the president’s job approval has declined more among Hispanics — 23% — than among any other demographic group.” It should be possible for Republicans to find a nominee who can do as well as George W. Bush did in winning 40% of the Hispanic vote in 2004.

Republicans cannot be too frequently reminded that their problem in presidential politics is the “blue wall” — the 18 states and the District of Columbia that have voted Democratic in at least six consecutive elections, and have 242 electoral votes. So Republicans should welcome to their nomination competition any candidate who might remove from the blue wall such bricks as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Bush, burdened by a damaged family brand, might not be the best potential nominee on the deep Republican bench. He does, however, deserve a respectful hearing from the Republican nominating electorate. He will not get this if he allows himself to become perceived as — if his supporters present him as — the choice of fastidious Republicans who think the party’s base is the party’s problem.

The Iraqi military insisted the Sunni inmates were killed when the attackers shelled the facility outside the city of Baqouba. Neither account could be independently confirmed, but a local morgue official said many of the detainees had bullet wounds to the head and chest.

The House Select Committee on Benghazi should not consider the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi its sole or even primary topic. Rather, it should begin at the beginning, with the U.S. military intervention in Libya’s civil war 18 months before Benghazi.

Today, Libya is an anarchy of hundreds of rival militias. The U.S. intervention, for which Barack Obama’s phrasemakers coined the term “leading from behind,” was justified by “R2P” — the “responsibility to protect” Libyans, especially in Benghazi, from the supposed threat of genocide inflicted by Muammar Gaddafi. This humanitarian imperialism quickly became an exercise in regime change. But the prolonged attempt to assassinate Gaddafi from the air made no provision for a replacement regime.

The Benghazi committee should hear from Alan J. Kuperman of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. In his policy brief “Lessons from Libya: How Not to Intervene,” he says:

Gaddafi did not initiate violence against peaceful protesters. Rather, protesters initiated the violence that engulfed four cities. Media reports “exaggerated the death toll by a factor of 10, citing ‘more than 2,000 deaths’ in Benghazi during the initial days of the uprising, whereas Human Rights Watch (HRW) later documented only 233 deaths across all of Libya in that period.” Furthermore, when the U.S. and a few other NATO nations intervened in March 2011, “Gaddafi already had regained control of most of Libya, while the rebels were retreating rapidly toward Egypt. Thus, the conflict was about to end, barely six weeks after it started, at a toll of about 1,000 dead. … [The intervention] enabled the rebels to resume their attack, which prolonged the war for another seven months and caused at least 7,000 more deaths.” The intervention encouraged peaceful protesters in Syria to use violence in the hope of attracting an intervention. This increased the rate of killing there tenfold. And since Gaddafi fell, “sophisticated weapons from Gaddafi’s arsenal — including up to 15,000 man-portable, surface-to-air missiles unaccounted for as of 2012 — leaked to radical Islamists throughout the region.”

Perhaps including Iraq. The Benghazi committee is organizing as Iraq crumbles, its army disintegrating as the enemy approaches. In January, Fallujah fell to forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, an Al-Qaeda affiliate. ISIS’ conquest of Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city (its population of 1.5 million equals that of Philadelphia), then Tal Afar, is redundant evidence that the U.S. experience in Iraq was the worst episode of squandered valour in U.S. history.

Some will say that it would not have come to this if the Iraqi army had not been disbanded, or if there had been better occupation planning, or if there had been a bigger occupying force, or if an agreement had been reached to keep a significant number of U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely, or if …

Enough. Here is a question for Republican presidential aspirants:

Given the absence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, and given that we now know how little we know about “nation-building” and about the promotion of democracy in nations that need to be “built,” and given that Saddam Hussein’s horrific tyranny at least controlled Iraq’s sectarian furies, and given that Iraq under him was Iran’s adversary, and given that 10-year wars make Americans indiscriminately averse to military undertakings — given all this, if you could rewind history to March 2003, would you favour invading Iraq?

Barack Obama is conducting the foreign policy retreat he promised, that then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton facilitated without apparent qualms, and that many Americans said they wanted until it began to make them queasy. The Republican challenge is to articulate a policy that fills the vast space between this retreat and the ruinous grandiosity of the “freedom agenda” of Obama’s predecessor.

Americans prefer not to think about, and rarely allow elections to turn on, foreign policy. Events, however, are not co-operating. Trotsky probably did not really say this, but someone should: “You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.”

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-america-needs-saving-from-downton-abbey-progressives","George F. Will: America needs saving from Downton Abbey progressives","Many “Downton Abbey” watchers are nostalgia gluttons who grieved when Lord Grantham lost his fortune in Canadian railroad shares. There are, however, a discerning few whose admirable American sensibilities caused them to rejoice about Grantham’s loss: “Now perhaps this amiable but dilettantish toff will get off his duff and get a job.”

This drama’s verisimilitude extends to emphasizing that his lordship had a fortune to squander only because he married an American heiress. By battening on what they disdained, this republic’s commercial culture, many British aristocrats could live beyond their inherited means — actual work being, of course, unthinkable.

The deserved decline of Downton’s finances demonstrates why estate taxes are unnecessary: Even when Balzac’s axiom is accurate (“At the bottom of every great fortune without apparent source, there’s always some crime”) and fortunes are ill-gotten, subsequent generations often soon fritter them away. Call this Darwinian redistribution.

If progressivism prevails, America will be Downton Abbey: Upstairs, the administrators of the regulatory state will assume responsibility for the lower orders downstairs, gently protecting them from “substandard” health insurance policies, school choice, gun ownership, large sodas and other decisions experts consider naughty or calamitous.

Americans have an unslakable appetite for British artistic syrup. Charles Dickens, although a noble spirit and literary genius, could be so insufferably saccharine that his flinty Mr. Gradgrind in “Hard Times” (“The Good Samaritan was a Bad Economist”) seemed like a breath of fresh air. In 1841, when Dickens was serializing “The Old Curiosity Shop,” the ship arriving in America carrying the latest installment reportedly was greeted by dockworkers shouting, “Is Nell still alive?”

But Oscar Wilde was right: “One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell without laughing.” And one must have a head of stone to enjoy the “Downton Abbey” scene when Matthew, a fragment of the upper crust whose war wound had left him in a wheel chair, sees that Lavinia, another chip off the old crust, is about to trip while carrying a heavy tray. Gallantry propels Matthew up from his chair and he is ambulatory once again and ever more.

It is fitting that PBS offers “Downton Abbey” to its disproportionately progressive audience. This series is a languid appreciation of a class structure supposedly tempered by the paternalism of the privileged. And if progressivism prevails, America will be Downton Abbey: Upstairs, the administrators of the regulatory state will, with a feudal sense of noblesse oblige, assume responsibility for the lower orders downstairs, gently protecting them from “substandard” health insurance policies, school choice, gun ownership, large sodas and other decisions that experts consider naughty or calamitous.

Americans do not call the freedom to figure out one’s place in the world a burden; they call it the pursuit of happiness

Why, however, does a normally wise and lucid conservative such as Peter Augustine Lawler, professor of government at Berry College, celebrate the “astute nostalgia” of “Downton Abbey“? Writing in Intercollegiate Review, he interprets the Abbey as a welfare state conservatives can revere:

“Everyone — aristocrat or servant — knows his place, his relational responsibilities. … The characters aren’t that burdened by the modern individualistic freedom of figuring out one’s place in the world. … Many of the customs that seem pointlessly expensive and time consuming, such as dressing for every dinner, are employment programs for worthy servants given secure, dignified places in a world where most ordinary people struggle. … The nobility of living in service to a lord. … What aristocracy offers us at its best is a proud but measured acceptance of the unchangeable relationship between privileges and responsibilities in the service of those whom we know and love.”

Good grief. Americans do not call the freedom to figure out one’s place in the world a burden; they call it the pursuit of happiness. And to be “given” a “secure” place amid “unchangeable” relationships is not dignified, it is servitude.

One reason Thomas Jefferson, a child of Virginia’s gentry, preferred an agricultural society to one in which people are “piled upon one another in large cities” (“let our workshops remain in Europe”) is that he valued social stasis, as the privileged are wont to do. One reason his rival Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant striver thriving in Manhattan, wanted a restless market society of ample and volatile capital was as a solvent of the entrenched hierarchies that impede upward mobility. “Downton Abbey” viewers should remember the following rhapsodic hymn to capitalism’s unceasing social churning:

“Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions. … All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air.”

This (from “The Communist Manifesto“) explains why capitalism liberates. And why American conservatives should understand that some people smitten by “Downton Abbey” hope to live upstairs during a future reign of gentry progressivism.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/barbara-kay-parental-rights-are-trumped-when-decisions-are-based-on-ignorance","Barbara Kay: Parental rights are trumped when decisions are based on ignorance","When a child is critically ill, who has the final word on treatment – both the “if” and the “what” regarding treatment – when doctors and parents disagree? In Canada, the question has been settled, and more than once, by courts that have consistently ruled against Jehovah’s Witnessses parents who, if not coerced into compliance, would have refused blood transfusions to their children in deference to their faith’s tenets.

[np_storybar title=”Leukemia treatment disputes reopen debate whether parents should have final say over children’s welfare” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/10/07/should-parents-have-final-say-in-childrens-medical-treatment-disputes-over-leukemia-cases-reopen-debate/”%5D

On a shaky home video, Marco Pedersen argues heatedly with a social worker who warns that his son could be apprehended if the family fails to consent to chemotherapy for the toddler, just diagnosed with leukemia.

“Chemo is a death sentence,” Mr. Pedersen asserts from behind the camera, as he trails the Children’s Aid Society employee down a hospital corridor and insists there are alternative treatments.

Oncologists have made huge strides in recent decades treating childhood leukemia, with long-term survival rates reaching close to 90%. But in surprisingly similar disputes now unfolding in Ottawa and Hamilton, parents have opposed the standard courses of chemotherapy for their children, insisting on shots of cannabis oil in one case, and aboriginal remedies in the other.[/np_storybar]

The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that state intervention is a legitimate limitation on religious freedom, privileging the rights of a “child in need of protection” over parents’ Charter rights to freedom of conscience and religion. The decisions were clear-cut. They disappointed Jehovah’s Witnesses, but satisfied most other Canadians, who do not believe prayer cures disease, and for good reason.

When similar medical stories occur in aboriginal families, though, where a whole culture, not just a religious belief, is the issue, it is a more complicated affair, involving alternative healing remedies going well beyond prayers, some of which may or may not be something more than placebos, not to mention historical and political baggage that create ambivalence in the institutional players.

Last May we saw a perfect case in point: an 11-year old aboriginal child (no longer to be named; I will call her MS) from the Ojibwe reserve of the New Credit First Nation, afflicted with a rare form of leukemia touching fewer than five percent of children with the disease. Once unrelievedly grim, the prognosis for those afflicted today is far more optimistic, with medical protocols estimated to give MS 70% odds of survival if followed to completion. Brant Family and Children’s Services had the law on their side. They could have forced MS to continue the unpleasant, aggressive chemotherapy she hated, but chose the “humane” course of acquiescing to the family’s – including the girl’s – wishes, freeing her to pursue a protocol of painless native healing oils and cultural rituals in which the family placed great faith.

A new case, involving neither religious faith nor native culture, has presented itself. Toddler Aiden Pedersen was diagnosed last month with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. His father, Marco Pedersen, refused to consent to chemotherapy treatment for the boy, which he (erroneously) considers “a death sentence.” The Ottawa Children’s Aid Society having been summoned by the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, convinced the mother, Erica, to give her consent, and treatment was so ordered. But the father remains adamantly opposed. His access has been restricted and he will argue to have the order overturned in court Oct. 14.

Mr. Pedersen’s preferred treatment is cannabis oil, much easier on the body, and apparently endowed with cancer-fighting potential, according to some lab and animal (but not human) studies. A British charity, Cancer research UK, suggests further research is warranted, but cautions it would be “highly misleading to patients and their families” to assume cannabis oil is in any way a proven treatment.

Mr. Pedersen cannot invoke his Charter rights to deny his son standard medical care. His belief in cannabis oil is based neither on conscience nor religious faith. It is in fact based in ignorance. His idea of a “case” is that parents have the right to make these decisions because “they were obviously given the child for a reason, so isn’t it they who are supposed to protect that child and ensure that child comes to no harm?” But as McMaster Children’s Hospital Peter Fitzgerald, riposted, “The reality is a parent or substitute decision-maker cannot make decisions that will cause harm.”

Some observers see similarities in the two cases. I find them quite dissimilar. Mr. Pedersen is an individual who is scientifically ignorant, and in perspective no different from the conspiracy theorists who believe vaccines cause autism. His preferred treatment will not protect his child, as he believes. His view should not prevail.

But in the case of MS, a long ancestral tradition of healing stands behind her parents’ belief system. As Christie Blatchford noted, citing a community leader in a June commentary on her situation, “To many of [MS’s] reserve’s people, Western-style medicine is alternative health-care and native remedies the mainstream.” There has been a resurgence of belief in culturally-rooted “ways of knowing,” encouraged by liberal multiculturalists, who consider cultural stasis in native culture a vehicle for identity pride. So they should not be surprised when identity pride bleeds into ways of knowing that may have existential consequences.

The Pedersen case is an anomaly with no political implications, and nobody should waste a minute’s sleep over it. I predict there will be more cases of culturally-rooted native resistance to “white” healing practices – and the implications are worth Canadians losing more than a few minutes’ sleep over.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-keeping-russia-out-of-its-neighbours","George F. Will: Keeping Russia out of its neighbours","WASHINGTON — Igor Stravinsky, the Russian composer, said of Poland, perilously positioned between Russia and Germany: “If you pitch your tent in the middle of Fifth Avenue, it is quite likely you will be run over by a bus.” Poland has been run over hard and often; indeed, between 1795 and 1918 it disappeared from the map of Europe.

[np_storybar title=”Obama worried Russia may move further into Ukraine, warns Putin that would be a ‘bad choice’” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/03/25/obama-worried-russia-may-move-further-into-ukraine-warns-putin-that-would-be-a-bad-choice/”%5DTHE HAGUE, Netherlands — With no sign of Russia abandoning the Crimean Peninsula, President Barack Obama said Tuesday he’s concerned that Moscow will move deeper into Ukraine and warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that that would be a bad choice.

Obama stood fast on his insistence that Crimea remains a part of Ukraine, even as the fledgling Ukrainian government in Kyiv ordered its troops to pull back from the disputed territory.

“We’re not recognizing what is happening in Crimea,” Obama said at his first news conference since Russia moved to annex Crimea after a referendum 10 days ago. Obama rejected “the notion that a referendum sloppily organized over the course of two weeks” would “somehow be a valid process.”

Geography need not be destiny, but it matters, as Ukraine is being reminded. During its hazardous path to the present, all or bits of it have been parts of Poland, the Austro-Hungarian empire, the Ottoman empire, the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and now another Russian empire. Czarist Russia, which Lenin called “the prison of the peoples,” is re-emerging and has in Vladimir Putin an ambitious warden.

In last week’s Kremlin address, he said, “Do not believe those who want you to fear Russia, shouting that other regions will follow Crimea. We do not want to divide Ukraine; we do not need that.” The word “need” is not reassuring. It suggests that Russia’s needs are self-legitimizing, and recalls the definition of a barbarian as someone who thinks his appetites are their own justification.

Speaking of which: Six months after Germany’s absorption of Austria, which was quickly ratified by a plebiscite, Adolf Hitler, on Sept. 26, 1938, spoke about the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia, home of many ethnic and linguistic Germans. Speaking three days before the Munich Conference began, he said: “This is the last territorial demand I have to make in Europe.” On March 15, 1939, six months after Germany’s annexation of the Sudetenland agreed to at Munich, Hitler swallowed the rest of Czechoslovakia.

Then his attention turned to “protecting” the German-speaking population in Poland. On Sept. 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland on the pretext of responding to a Polish provocation. Ten days before, he had told senior military officers, “I shall give a propagandistic cause for starting the war, whether it be plausible or not. The victor shall not be asked, later on, whether we told the truth or not.” On the night of Aug. 31, a German prisoner was dressed in a Polish uniform, killed and displayed as a casualty of a Polish attack on a German radio station.

Putin, whose lamented Soviet Union was then Hitler’s ally, knows Hitler’s tactics. If Putin had a sense of humor he would justify as “R2P” his policy of bringing home to the safety of mother Russia many of the Russians residing in contiguous countries. R2P — “responsibility to protect” — was the moral principle the Obama administration invoked to justify involvement in the seven-month assault on Moammar Gaddafi, who posed no threat to us but supposedly did to Libyans.

On Sept. 26, 1938, Hitler said “10 million Germans” lived “in two large contiguous regions” outside the Reich, and that “if I were simply to renounce 10 million … I would then have no moral right to be fuehrer of the German people.” Putin, whose Russia had about 142 million people before he added the 2 million in Crimea, must envelop many more if he is to match the 200 million the last czar, Nicholas II, ruled 100 years ago.

Can NATO help restrain Putin? After NATO was created in 1949, its first secretary general, Lord Ismay, said its purpose was to protect Europe by keeping “the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down.” The task of keeping Russia out of its neighbors is being complicated by something that would have improved the last century — German passivity. Angela Merkel may think that bringing Barack Obama to a confrontation with Putin is like bringing a knife — a butter knife — to a gun fight.

In a recent New Yorker interview, Obama praised himself for being “comfortable with complexity” and unraveled the Middle East’s complications: “It would be profoundly in the interest of citizens throughout the region if Sunnis and Shias weren’t intent on killing each other.” This is the president as poseur — detached, laconic, arch, almost droll: If only — apologies to Kipling — the lesser breeds without the law would behave.

Obama evidently harbors the surreal hope that Putin will continue to help regarding Syria and Iran. Continue? Putin’s client in Damascus, Bashar al-Assad, is winning his civil war. And regarding attempts to halt Iran’s nuclear weapons program, Putin’s helpfulness, if not fictitious, has been ineffective.

Obama, always a slayer of straw men, has eschewed something no one has contemplated, “a military excursion in Ukraine.” The American Heritage Dictionary defines “excursion” as “a usually short journey made for pleasure.”

"http://nationalpost.com/news/domo-arigato-mr-obama-u-s-president-meets-japanese-robot-asimo","Domo arigato Mr. Obama: U.S. President meets Japanese robot ASIMO","TOKYO — The voice was slightly halting, childlike. “Welcome to Miraikan, Mr. President, it is a pleasure to meet you.”

President Barack Obama bowed, looking delighted.

His greeter, after all, was a 55-inch-tall, give or take, humanoid robot with the look of a diminutive Star Wars storm trooper.

“It’s nice to meet you, too,” Obama said, pausing to watch the robot, named ASIMO, perform during a tour of the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation.

Despite Obama’s background in constitutional law, there’s a presidential geek side that always seems charmed, if not bemused, by technological advances.

Asimo, made by Honda, announced “I can really run fast” before loping toward a soccer ball and informing Obama, “I can kick a soccer ball, too.”

The robot delivered a well-aimed ball at Obama who trapped it neatly with his foot. For its final demonstration, the robot declared, “Recently I have learned how to jump.” It then proceeded to hop, first on one foot, then on two.

Curious, Obama asked Mamoru Mohri, chief executive director of Miraikan, whether the robot was remote controlled. Yes, Mohri replied, but the robot can act autonomously, too.

Obama also witnessed demonstrations by other robots, including one designed by Japanese technicians and partially financed by the U.S. Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency that was developed to help with disaster response.

“I have to say the robots were a little scary,” he said afterward. “They were too life-like.”

After holding a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama met with the three relatives of two Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea.

At the news conference, Obama said the United States stood with Japan in seeking to resolve such North Korean kidnappings and in a statement issued after the session with relatives, the White House said Obama was “moved by their tragic experiences.”

Later, the relatives said Obama, as father of two daughters, showed empathy over the kidnapping of their loved ones. He said he would do his utmost to resolve the problem, possibly by adopting a U.N. Security Council resolution to pressure the North.

As father of two teenage daughters, Obama seemed particularly empathetic to Sakie Yokota, 78, whose daughter Megumi was kidnapped by North Korean agents 37 years ago when she was only 13. Yokota said Obama carefully looked at the pictures she brought and seemed to understand the pain of waiting such a long time.

“President Obama said it’s not just another political or human rights issue. He said he cannot tolerate this problem as a human being and a father,” Yokota told reporters after the meeting. “He reassured us that he would give us a firm support to resolve the problem.”

Of prayer cards and archers.

Obama visited the Meiji Shrine that commemorates Emperor Meiji, who died in 1912, and his wife Empress Shoken. The shrine has been something of a regular stop for visiting U.S. dignitaries.

Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went to the shrine in 2009 and Vice-President Joe Biden stopped there in 2011. President George W. Bush visited in 2002.

Like Bush, Obama was treated to a demonstration of yabusame, or horseback archery, where archers in traditional dress ride past a reviewing stand at a gallop while shooting arrows at a target. Obama watched

Moments earlier, Obama had toured the shrine with priests and then written on a prayer card. After hanging it with numerous other cards, a priest removed it, apparently out of fear that someone would take it.

“My only question is,” Obama said to the priest, “will my wish still work if you take it?”","2014-04-24 17:23:10","1","30.0","2.0","3.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","92.0","74.0","0.0","105.0","16.0","7.0","3","605","92.84","81.39","14.10","28.52","17.29","24.30","77.02","42.98","8.76","4.63","0.99","0.33","0.66","2.15","0.50","4.13","8.43","13.88","5.12","3.31","4.63","0.50","12.89","3.64","2.31","1.32","2.64","0.33","4.30","2.15","1.98","0.50","0.17","0.17","11.90","1.65","0.00","0.99","2.31","7.44","2.15","0.66","1.49","2.15","0.50","2.31","3.64","1.32","1.98","0.17","0.83","0.33","0.33","0.00","0.00","9.09","2.81","1.16","3.47","0.83","1.32","7.60","4.96","1.32","12.73","2.64","5.12","5.12","4.79","1.65","0.17","0.17","1.65","0.33","0.66","0.17","0.17","0.17","0.17","0.00","20.99","6.61","8.76","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.83","3.97","0.66","0.00","0.00","2895","8.33","22.62962962962963","884","600","37","63.49","11.0","8.4","12.06","10.7","148","5.5625","18.346666666666668","350","20.7","13","0.4","0","14","15","54","0","76","38","0","0","7","81","89","2","26","0","0","28","8","31","1","0","0","17","0","22","47","14","18","3","10","2","3","1","3"
"http://nationalpost.com/news/north-korea-reopens-investigation-into-fate-of-12-japanese-kidnapped-decades-ago-by-communist-agents","North Korea reopens investigation into fate of 12 Japanese kidnapped decades ago by communist agents","The barbecues are all fired up along the jetty and the beach is dotted with sunbathers. Divers plunge into the water in search of clams, which are dipped in hot sauce and eaten raw right there on the spot. Wonsan, a sleepy port on North Korea’s east coast, is gearing up for a busy summer and, if talks with Japan go as North Korea hopes, maybe a return to livelier days.

Opening the door just a crack to better relations, Pyongyang has set up a committee to reinvestigate the fates of a dozen Japanese citizens who Tokyo suspects were abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 80s. In return, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering easing a broad array of unilateral sanctions that have shut down virtually all trade and most contact between the countries.

It’s unclear how far North Korea is willing to go to satisfy Japan’s demands to resolve the abductions issue, which even more than the North’s nuclear program has galvanized Japanese public opinion against Pyongyang. Popular sentiment in North Korea against Japan – its former colonial ruler – is even more negative.

Envoys for the two sides met Tuesday in Beijing to discuss the new committee, and Abe is expected to announce his decision on the sanctions soon.

In Wonsan, a giant ferry that was once an important link between the countries mysteriously reappeared, dominating the view of the harbor, before talks began.

The Mangyongbong-92, a sleek white ship longer than a football field, was long the symbol of a once-massive flow of goods, people and cash between the countries. Its recent return suggests that Pyongyang wants to resume port calls, and start pulling in Japanese cash, as soon as possible, but there has been no official explanation. Like the proverbial 500-pound gorilla in the room, Wonsan residents are reluctant to even mention it.

Until the Mangyongbong-92 was banned in 2006, Wonsan was a bustling port of entry for Japanese capital.

The ferry was a crucial means for the ethnic Koreans in Japan to visit the North, often laden with gifts, supplies and cash for their relatives or friends, bringing a wide variety of products not normally available in the socialist state. In its peak years, the Mangyongbong-92 was believed to have transported hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods and cash to the North.

Tokyo says it is willing to reward Pyongyang if it comes clean on the abductions issue – including allowing North Korean ships to make port calls in some cases. But, fearing they will be criticized for breaking ranks with allies in Washington and Seoul, officials stress they will still abide by U.N.-backed sanctions on the North’s long-range missile and nuclear weapons tests. Pyongyang says it has no intention of giving up its nuclear program.

Japanese sanctions have taken a toll. According to Japan’s Foreign Ministry, two-way trade between Tokyo and Pyongyang amounted to more than $30 billion in 2003. It was almost completely eliminated by increasingly broad sanctions beginning in 2006. From 2010, there has been virtually no trade between the countries, which have no diplomatic relations.

Since the ban, the Mangyongbong-92 has been seen in use only when North Korea attempted to start a new tourism service bringing foreign visitors from Rason, on its border with China, down the coast to the scenic Mount Kumgang area.

Even a partial thaw could provide Pyongyang with a small but potentially meaningful boost for its recent efforts at promoting international tourism and, perhaps farther down the road, increased trade.

Wonsan has been singled out by North Korean authorities as a key area for its nationwide tourism push. North Korea’s giant Masik Pass ski resort, a signature construction project of leader Kim Jong Un that opened late last year, is nearby.

Although the overwhelming majority of tourists who visit North Korea are Chinese, Pyongyang hopes to entice visitors from all over the region to fuel its drive for much-needed foreign currency.

Selling tours to places like Wonsan to the average Japanese won’t be easy. Japanese officials have given mixed signals about whether the Mangyongbong-92 would be allowed back if sanctions are eased.

Most Korea-bound Japanese vacationers are much more likely to choose the amenities and shopping of the South, though there are about 550,000 ethnic Koreans in Japan, and many of them are at least to some degree sympathetic with the North.

Pro-Pyongyang Koreans in Japan say the ferry operations should be resumed for humanitarian purposes so families can visit relatives in the North and students in ethnic Korean schools can make class excursions. Supporters also say it will make other cultural exchanges more feasible.

A 13-year-old schoolgirl walking home after badminton practice. A 28-year-old restaurant employee sent by his boss to Vienna. A young couple on a date, driving to the beach to see the sunset. They are among at least 17 Japanese – possibly many more than that – who were abducted by North Korea more than three decades ago.

The apparent reasons included training agents in Japanese language and social norms, or stealing identities so the agents could masquerade as Japanese for espionage and terrorism aimed mainly at South Korea.

North Korea allowed five to return in 2002, but the fate of the others remains unclear.

The 12 who Japan says have never come back paint a picture of lives interrupted, as if in mid-sentence, and irrevocably changed. At least three were students in Europe who may have been lured to North Korea by Japanese left-wing radicals. Others were bundled into small boats on the Japanese coast to cross the water to North Korea.

Here are brief descriptions of the 12 missing people, based on information from the Japanese government and support groups for the families of the abductees:

MISSING: Yutaka Kume, security guard in Tokyo

AGE WHEN ABDUCTED: 52

HIS STORY: Disappeared on Sept. 19, 1977, after traveling to Japan’s west coast to meet an acquaintance who was actually a North Korean spy on a mission to abduct a single Japanese male aged between 45 and 50.

MISSING: Kyoko Matsumoto, office worker

AGE WHEN ABDUCTED: 29

HER STORY: Kidnapped on her way to knitting class in western Japan on Oct. 21, 1977. A neighbor spotted her with two men in the pine tree woods near the coast, about 200 meters (600 feet) from her home. The neighbor asked what they were doing, and one of the men punched him in the face. He fell down in pain and when he looked around, the others had disappeared, leaving behind only a sandal.

MISSING: Megumi Yokota, student

AGE WHEN ABDUCTED: 13

HER STORY: The symbol of Japan’s abduction victims, Yokota is widely known for a photo of her in a navy blue school uniform standing under a row of cherry trees in full bloom. She never came home from badminton practice on Nov. 15, 1977, one day after giving her now 81-year-old father a comb on his birthday. A Japanese government website says she was confined in a dark compartment in a boat for nearly two days, crying “mother” and scratching the wall until her nails were nearly peeled off.

MISSING: Minoru Tanaka, Chinese restaurant employee

AGE WHEN ABDUCTED: 28

HIS STORY: Sent by Han Yon Dae, the owner of the restaurant he worked at, to Vienna in June 1978, Tanaka was never seen again. Han turned out to be a North Korea agent living in Japan. The case came to light after another agent told a Japanese magazine in 1996 that he had collaborated with Han and a third spy in Tanaka’s abduction.

MISSING: Yaeko Taguchi, bar hostess

AGE WHEN ABDUCTED: 22

HER STORY: Disappeared in Tokyo in June 1978, leaving behind a 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter. Years later, during the trial of North Korean agent Kim Hyon Hui for the bombing of a Korean Air flight in 1987, Kim said she was trained in Japanese language and culture by a woman who Japanese authorities believe was Taguchi.

MISSING: Shuichi Ichikawa, phone company employee, and Rumiko Masumoto, office worker

AGE WHEN ABDUCTED: 23 (Ichikawa) and 24 (Masumoto)

THEIR STORY: Told their families on Aug. 12, 1978, they were driving to Fukiage Beach, on Japan’s southern island of Kyushu, to see the sunset. Two days later, Ichikawa’s car was found near a campground at the beach.

MISSING: Miyoshi Soga, homemaker

AGE WHEN ABDUCTED: 46

HER STORY: Disappeared with her 19-year-old daughter Hitomi after they went grocery shopping on Japan’s Sado Island on Aug. 12, 1978. North Korea later arranged Hitomi’s marriage to Charles Jenkins, an American army deserter who had crossed from South to North Korea in 1965. Hitomi was one of the five who returned to Japan in 2002. Jenkins and their two daughters followed two years later.

MISSING: Toru Ishioka and Kaoru Matsuki, college students

AGE WHEN ABDUCTED: 22 (Ishioka) and 26 (Matsuki)

THEIR STORY: Both men disappeared while in Madrid in May 1980. North Korea says Ishioka agreed to come after meeting in Spain with two wives of Japanese Red Army Faction radicals who had fled to North Korea after hijacking a Japan Airlines flight in 1970. A letter from Ishioka to his family in 1988 said he and Matsuki were in North Korea. Ishioka’s passport was used by North Korean agents, according to police.

MISSING: Tadaaki Hara, Chinese restaurant cook

AGE WHEN ABDUCTED: 43

HIS STORY: Taken out for drinks and dinner in Osaka by a group of North Korean spies in June 1980. They then took him by train to a beach resort in Kyushu, the southern island, and then by boat to North Korea. One of the spies, Shin Kwang Su, later traveled several times on a passport under Hara’s name, including to South Korea, according to Japanese police.

MISSING: Keiko Arimoto, college student studying in London

AGE WHEN ABDUCTED: 23

HER STORY: Disappeared while traveling in Europe in July 1983. Megumi Yao, another of the wives of the Japan Airlines hijackers, later told a Japanese court that she had approached Arimoto in London, and with the lure of a false job offer, arranged for her to meet one of the hijackers and a North Korean agent posing as a businessman or diplomat in Copenhagen. Yao, who had returned to Japan, was testifying at the trial of another of the wives.","2014-07-02 18:01:56","1","61.0","37.0","3.0","0.0","64.0","0.0","92.0","74.0","0.0","117.0","16.0","6.0","3","1743","97.22","74.17","42.77","19.76","23.24","22.66","73.49","41.08","5.11","2.58","0.00","0.00","0.06","1.78","0.75","2.52","7.97","16.75","4.99","3.04","4.65","0.57","10.90","4.65","2.75","1.66","4.88","1.89","2.58","1.03","1.43","0.29","0.23","0.75","8.55","0.92","0.40","1.49","1.15","5.91","1.03","0.92","0.80","1.95","0.52","1.55","1.89","1.15","0.57","0.17","1.20","0.17","0.29","0.00","0.75","6.25","1.43","0.98","3.56","0.57","0.23","4.53","4.48","0.92","19.91","2.35","11.36","6.37","3.61","1.49","0.69","0.92","0.11","0.00","0.06","0.00","0.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.92","4.42","5.45","1.78","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.55","0.11","0.98","0.57","0.06","8184","7.71","25.142857142857142","2490","1719","74","64.85","12.8","10.0","11.84","13.6","318","12.0","18.679650959860385","755","22.89","68","0.4","0","45","80","148","0","241","137","6","5","10","232","287","2","116","0","1","27","22","56","4","0","11","54","0","43","69","38","48","24","30","6","12","0","3"
"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-cut-the-budget-cancel-the-state-of-the-union-address","George F. Will: Cancelling the State of the Union address would be a good way to cut costs","As undignified as it is unedifying and unnecessary, the vulgar State of the Union circus is again at our throats. The document that the Constitutional Convention sent forth from Philadelphia for ratification in 1787 was just 4,543 words long, but this was 17 too many. America would be a sweeter place if the Framers had not included this laconic provision pertaining to the president: “He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union.”

“Information”? Not exactly.

The Constitution’s mild requirement has become a tiresome exercise in political exhibitionism, the most execrable ceremony in the nation’s civic liturgy, regardless of which party’s president is abusing it. You worship bipartisanship? There is not a dime’s worth of difference between the ways the parties try to milk partisan advantage from this made-for-television political pep rally.

Tuesday evening, Barack Obama probably will concentrate on inequality as a way of changing the subject from his inconvenient triumph, the Affordable Care Act. So he probably will again propose partial public financing of Democratic candidates’ campaigns, by again calling for “high-quality” universal pre-school. This adjectival phrase is code for: Now we will do better because we will employ more certified — and unionized — teachers.

Studies of it strongly indicate that the cognitive and other effects of early preschool are slight and evanescent — gone by the third grade. The few studies of other state programs that indicate better results have possible methodological problems explained by George Mason University social scientists David J. Armor and Sonia Sousa in “The Dubious Promise of Universal Preschool” in National Affairs quarterly.

Even “high-quality” universal preschool would not measurably reduce inequality. It would, however, efficiently convey funds from the federal treasury to a new cohort of unionized teachers, then through union dues to Democratic candidates.

The president will probably again propose combating inequality with a 23rd increase (since 1938) of the minimum wage. This would have no measurable effect on inequality because few heads of household earn the minimum wage and most such earners are part-time workers from households with an average annual income of $53,000. Twenty percent are from $75,000-plus households.

Obama probably also will urge measures to increase college enrolments. For several decades, both parties simply knew that not enough people owned homes. So, federal policy — mortgage subsidies, lower lending standards — encouraged more homeownership than market rationality would have produced. One exciting result was the Great Recession. Now the federal government, which simply knows that not enough people are getting college degrees, has fueled a bubble in higher education by funneling billions in subsidies for student tuition aid. To the surprise of no one, except the government, schools have responded by raising their prices — they are up 23% since Obama’s first election — to capture the subsidies.

The Center for College Affordability and Productivity (“Why Are Recent College Graduates Underemployed? University Enrollments and Labor-Market Realities“) reports that about 48% of those college graduates who are employed are occupying jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests require less than a four-year college education. Thirty-seven percent are in jobs that require no more than a high-school diploma, and about 5 million are in jobs that require less than a high-school education. About 14 percent of waiters and waitresses, 16.5 percent of bartenders, 18 percent of telemarketers and 24.6 percent of retail salespeople– not including the 14.5 percent of counter and sales clerks — have college degrees.

These details probably will not be information that Obama gives to Congress Tuesday evening when legislators from the president’s party will bray approval of his bromides and stillborn panaceas, legislators from the other party will be histrionically torpid or sullen, and some moral exemplars in the House gallery will be applauded.

In 2010, Chief Justice John Roberts said: “The image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering while the court — according to the requirements of protocol — has to sit there expressionless, I think is very troubling.”

Justice Antonin Scalia no longer attends what he calls “cheerleading sessions.” Justice Clarence Thomas, who says “there’s a lot that you don’t hear on TV — the catcalls, the whooping and hollering and under-the-breath comments,” will not be there Tuesday night. Will Roberts attend? No justices or senior military officers should stoop to being props at these puerile spectacles.

"http://nationalpost.com/opinion/george-f-will-florida-election-could-have-unusual-national-resonance","George F. Will: Florida election could have unusual national resonance","Because it is this year’s first federal election, attention must be paid to the March 11 voting to fill the congressional seat vacated by the death in October of Florida Republican C.W. “Bill” Young, who served in Congress 43 years. If Democrat Alex Sink wins, the significance will be minimal because she enjoys multiple advantages. Hence if Republican David Jolly prevails, Republicans will construe this as evidence that Barack Obama has become an anvil in the saddle of every Democratic candidate.

Matters are, however, murky. Tip O’Neill’s axiom that “all politics is local” has been rendered anachronistic by the national government that liberals such as O’Neill created. Today’s administrative state touches everyone everywhere, so all politics is partly national. Politics in Florida’s 13th Congressional District today concerns the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).

Obama carried this Gulf Coast district, a one-county constituency near Tampa, by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 in 2012. Although Sink never lived in the district until very recently, she has almost 100 percent name recognition here because she has run statewide, almost winning the governorship in 2010 when she carried the county by 5.7 points. Between 2007 and 2011, she was Florida’s chief financial officer.

The [insurance subsidy] enables the disproportionately wealthy people who own beach properties to socialize their storm losses while keeping private the pleasures of their real estate.

After Young died, the national and state Democratic parties moved with more dispatch than seemliness. With a robust disregard for traditional niceties, they moved Sink into the 13th District. Her real home in another county is, Jolly says — he exaggerates — closer to Disney World than to this district’s beaches. They also prevented a primary challenge from anyone who really lives here, thereby allowing Jolly to say national Democrats decided no local Democrat was qualified to represent the locals.

While she rented an apartment and began raising money, Jolly fought a nine-week primary race, from which he emerged on Jan. 14 financially depleted. He worked for Young for many years, which helps his resume, but then became a Washington lobbyist, which does not. He thinks it should, saying mordantly that politics “is the one industry in which experience and qualifications count against you.” He notes that whoever wins next month will have to run again in November and if he is running then, the Republican House leadership will want to give him some plums beneficial to his district — perhaps assignment to committees to protect seniors and veterans.

Although the district gave the world the first Hooters restaurant, the district is unusually elderly, white and disapproving of Obamacare.

This is a purple but not a polarized district, with 37 percent Democrat and 36 percent Republican. Although the district gave the world the first Hooters restaurant, the district is unusually elderly, white and disapproving of Obamacare. It also is smoldering about the flood insurance program.

The NFIP is yet another entitlement program that is proving to be more durable, and more emblematic of modern America, than Mount Rushmore. The federal government has long subsidized insurance for homeowners who live in coastal areas or flood plains. This entitlement, covering about 5.5 million of America’s 122 million housing units, is necessary because otherwise people would be required to pay the costs of the risks they choose to run for living where they are pleased to live. The NFIP enables the disproportionately wealthy people who own beach properties to socialize their storm losses while keeping private the pleasures of their real estate. The NFIP is another illustration of the entitlement state’s upward distribution of benefits.

Recent attempts to reform the NFIP — to end subsidized rates for 1.1 million properties and to change rates based on improved risk assessments — threaten to raise by thousands of dollars the annual insurance costs of some property owners here. Both Sink and Jolly are competitively indignant. But the U.S. Senate, an unsleeping defender of entitlements benefiting the privileged (witness the new farm bill), has recently derailed reform.

Sink will benefit from the national trend allowing early voting to obliterate Election Day. Any Floridian who has ever requested an absentee ballot henceforth gets one automatically. Seventy-seven percent of the Republican primary votes here were cast by mail in the Jan. 14 primary, and absentee ballots will be mailed on Feb. 7. Furthermore, early voting at polling places begins March 1, so many — perhaps most — votes will be cast before Jolly has raised much of the money necessary to communicate his message.

Instead of a community deliberation culminating in a shared day of decision, an election like the one here is diffuse and inferior. If Sink wins, Republicans nationally can shrug; if Jolly wins, Democrats should tremble. But no matter who wins, the district loses because it has lost Election Day.

"http://nationalpost.com/news/libyan-fighter-abu-khattala-suspected-in-2012-benghazi-attack-a-shadowy-figure-among-extremists","Libyan fighter Abu Khattala, suspected in 2012 Benghazi attack, a shadowy figure among extremists","CAIRO, Egypt — A strange silence has met the U.S. capture of a Libyan militant accused in the 2012 attack that killed the American ambassador and three others. In his hometown of Benghazi in eastern Libya, there have been few threats of revenge, only speculation among supporters and opponents that Ahmed Abu Khattala was betrayed by an insider.

Abu Khattala had said for months he had no fear of the Americans snatching him, living at his home and saying he worked as a construction contractor. Before U.S. commandos snatched him from Benghazi a week ago, he had been battling alongside the militant group Ansar al-Shariah against the troops of Khalifa Hifter, a renegade Libyan general who has waged an offensive aimed at crushing Islamic militants around Libya, Abu Khattala’s brother Abu Bakr told The Associated Press.

Abu Khattala was a prominent figure in the eastern city of Benghazi’s thriving circles of extremists, popular among young radicals for being among the most hard-core and uncompromising of those calling for Libya to be ruled by Islamic Shariah law. But he was always something of a lone figure. Even after he joined Ansar al-Shariah — the group accused by the United States of carrying out the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi– he didn’t take a leadership position or a post in its decision-making bodies, noted Fadlallah Haroun, a former rebel commander in Benghazi who met Abu Khattala in prison in the 1990s.

“He was always an outsider,” Haroun, who opposes the Islamists and whose brother is a top intelligence official, told the AP. “He was a very simple man, who was honest in his talk and independent.”

That may have made it easier for the U.S. to track him down. Among Benghazi officials and militants, there were multiple theories floating over who could have given away his location to the Americans. Some pointed the finger at Hifter. Others said Islamist militias may have turned him, hoping to relieve the pressure on themselves in Hifter’s offensive. So far, a week after his capture, Ansar al-Shariah has not commented — perhaps a sign it was trying to determine who betrayed him.

“For sure he was sold out,” Abu Khattala’s brother, Abu Bakr, told The Associated Press on Friday. “It’s very clear that he was betrayed. We will pin it down until we figure out who did it.”

Mohammed Hegazi, a spokesman for Hifter’s forces, described Abu Khattala as a “spiritual leader” of the extremist religious groups and militias in Benghazi. He accused him of orchestrating the looting of banks in the central city of Sirte, without offering evidence.

“Abu Khattala’s source of power is the large following among extremist and terrorist groups that believe in him,” Hegazi said. “He was their spiritual leader and he was a financier.”

But Abu Khattala was not the group’s top leader — that was its founder, Mohammed al-Zawahi. While he was close to its leadership, he didn’t join any of its decision-making bodies, Haroun said.

Abu Khattala’s brother Abu Bakr said that in past months, he would disappear from his home in Benghazi for several days at a time because of the fighting with Hifter’s forces. Their father last spoke with Abu Khattala on the morning of June 16, he said — and after that his phone went dead.

Abu Khattala acknowledged in an interview with the AP in January that he was present during the storming of the U.S. mission in Benghazi. But he denied involvement in the attack, saying he was trying to organize a rescue of trapped people.

In the attack, gunmen fired rocket-propelled grenades and stormed the mission, many waving the black banners of Ansar al-Shariah. The compound’s main building was set ablaze. Ambassador Chris Stevens suffocated to death inside and another American was shot dead. Later in the evening, gunmen attacked and shelled a safe house, killing two more Americans.

At the time, several witnesses said they saw Abu Khattala directing fighters at the site.

One witness told the AP that when he tried to take a picture of Abu Khattala at the scene with his mobile phone, he was snatched by Abu Khattala’s followers, beaten and taken to Ansar al-Shariah’s headquarters in Benghazi. He said he overheard Abu Khattala vowing to “flatten the consulate.”

Haroun and Abu Khattala’s brother said Abu Khattala arrived in the middle of the chaos. “He was not the one who set everything off,” Haroun said. No evidence has emerged that Abu Khattala was involved in the later attack on the safe house.

Abu Khattala is among a number of suspects named in a sealed indictment at the U.S. District Court in Washington for alleged involvement in the attack. The identities of the others in the indictment have not been revealed. Earlier this year, the Obama administration accused two branches of Ansar al-Shariah in the attack — the Benghazi branch and another based in the northern city of Darna — and listed them as terrorist groups.

The Darna branch is led by Sufian bin Qumu, a former detainee at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who was identified by American officials at the time as a probable member of al-Qaida. He was handed over to Libya in 2007 and later freed.

Abu Khattala was born in Benghazi to a middle class family originally from the western city of Misrata. He quit school in the 7th grade to work as a car mechanic, his brother said. His father was a soccer player on Benghazi’s team.

In the 1990s, he had close ties to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, the main militant group battling Gadhafi’s rule. From the age of 24, he was detained multiple times, spending a total of 12 years in prison. After his last stint in Tripoli’s Abu Selim prison, he was freed in 2010 under a reconciliation program led by Gadhafi’s son, Seif al-Islam.

Mohammed Abu Sedra, an Islamist lawmaker, said he knew Abu Khattala at Abu Selim. “He was very introverted, depressed all the time and never talked to anyone. I always thought that he was not normal,” he said.

Abu Khattala told the AP in January that he became involved after watching the confessions and executions of Islamists on television — a common occurrence during Gadhafi’s crackdowns in the 1980s and 1990s.

He rose to prominence during the civil war commanding a small rebel unit he created, the Abu Obaida bin Jarrah Brigade. He was one of the last rebels who held out in a siege by Gadhafi’s troops of the town of Ajdabiya before the troops overran it in a march toward Benghazi, Haroun and Abu Khattala’s brother said.

Abu Khattala also was implicated in the killing of the rebels’ military commander, Abdel-Fattah Younis. The slaying in June 2011, in the midst of the civil war, was the first strong signal of the deep divisions among rebels, particularly between Islamic extremists and army units that defected to the rebellion.

Many militants had memories of Younis’ involvement in Gadhafi’s bombings of hideouts of the Islamic Fighting Group and other Islamists in the 1990s. Others suspected him of loyalties to Gadhafi even after he defected. The rebels’ top political body ordered his arrest, and as he was being transported for questioning, gunmen attacked his convoy and abducted him.

Younis’ nephew, Mohammed Hamid Younis, said he was taken to headquarters of Abu Khattala’s brigade, where the killing took place. Abu Khattala has acknowledged Younis was held at the headquarters but not that his brigade carried out the killing.

Younis’ body was found dumped outside of Benghazi, burned and mutilated, along with the bodies of two aides.

“The body was burnt to the extent that some parts melted, his fingers were chopped off and one eye pulled out,” the nephew told the AP.

Abu Khattala was among 11 people referred to a rebel military tribunal for Younis’ death. He was detained for a few days, then set free, and later the tribunal abandoned the case apparently because of death threats.

After his indictment in the U.S. over the killing of the Americans was made public, Abu Khattala remained in the open, living in his unguarded home in Benghazi’s al-Leithi district. He said he was working as a construction contractor.

“We only fear God,” Abu Khattala said then. “The American government has nothing to do with me.”

"http://www.courant.com/business/connecticut-insurance/hc-phoenix-annual-meeting-20141120-story.html","Phoenix's Restatement Reduced Stockholders' Equity By $294.3 Million; Audit Fees Continue To Climb","— The Phoenix Cos. told shareholders Thursday that the value of their equity in the insurer dropped by $294.3 million — 31.1 percent —as a result of the company's correcting errors during its restatement of financial documents.

The life insurance and annuity company said its lengthy restatement process that concluded in April cost $110.9 million, including $58.9 million in audit fees. Additionally, audit fees and other remediation expenses continue to pile up, totaling $57.5 million for 2013 and 2014, according to figures the company has reported so far.

""The restatement was triggered by an error related to classifications of cash flows,"" Phoenix CEO James D. Wehr said Thursday during a much-delayed annual shareholders meeting, the first since 2012.

""Through the course of the restatement, we identified additional errors that were highly complex and required significant time and effort to correct,"" Wehr said. ""We also had to make additional adjustments and corrections driven by a retrospective adoption of new accounting guidance that we had originally implemented in the first quarter of 2012.""

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is providing auditing and accounting services as the insurer catches up on financial reporting as required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The restatement has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on Phoenix, Wehr said.

""It cost a lot of money, and expenses will continue to be elevated as we complete the catch-up and implement remediation plans,"" Wehr said. ""Of course, those additional expenses will gradually decrease. But at this point, we need to invest the time and resources to make sure we resolve our systems and processes.""

The company said it continues to take remedial actions to correct accounting errors and failures in the design and implementation of internal controls.

The company's six board members who were up for election were approved during the annual meeting, according to preliminary voting results. Those members are Martin N. Baily, Arthur P. Byrne, John H. Forsgren, Ann Maynard Gray, Arthur F. Weinbach and Wehr.

PricewaterhouseCoopers was ratified as the insurer's independent registered accounting firm for 2014, and the company's methodology for compensation was approved, all according to preliminary results of voting by shareholders. Final results will be reported to the SEC by next week.

The shareholders' meeting was largely uneventful, with about 50 people in a meeting room at the company's headquarters in the Boat Building downtown. Two shareholders asked questions, and only one asked about the restatement.

""Who is responsible for why there was such a discrepancy, and why, after all that grief, did Phoenix also miss the filing date for this year in August for 2014, and who is responsible for that?"" Dr. Brian Grogan of Simsbury, who identified himself as a shareholder, asked at the meeting.

Phoenix's Board of Directors chairman, John H. Forsgren, responded, saying that the restatement was a very complex process triggered by a relatively minor discovery of a problem in an earlier financial statement. The process that unfolded required reviewing a series of assumptions made over five years, which included the financial crisis, Forsgren said.

""Retrospect clearly raises lots of different views of things, and, in addition to that, there were evolving accounting standards during that period,"" Forsgren said.

Grogan also asked about a Reuters article published by The Courant in July that Phoenix has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Sandler O'Neill and Partners to explore a sale of the company.

""Well, we're not going to comment on that,"" Forsgren said. ""There are rumors from time to time that get reported in the press. We can't, you know the standard corporate practice, you really can't comment on stuff like that.""

The parent company announced Nov. 8, 2012, that its financial statements for 2009, 2010 and 2011 needed to be restated. During the process, the company discovered and corrected errors related to actuarial finance and valuation, investments, reinsurance accounting, pensions, limited partnerships and other investments, taxable income reporting, and cash flows and changes in classifications.

In April, Phoenix restated financial reports for the first two quarters of 2012, all of 2011, all of 2010 and some selected financial data from 2008 and 2009. The previously filed documents had errors in actuarial finance, investments, reinsurance accounting, pensions and cash flows. Additionally, the company is catching up on delayed filings.

In August, Phoenix reported a full-year net income of $5.1 million for 2013 — the first time in six years Phoenix was profitable.

The company has reported net losses of $168.5 million in 2012; $30.7 million in 2011; $34.4 million in 2010; and $407.1 million in 2009.

Wehr said to shareholders at Thursday's meeting, ""Despite everything this company has been through, I can still say with confidence that we are a financially sound enterprise with a good future and sound business prospects.""","2014-11-20 13:22:20","1","27.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","36.0","18.0","0.0","74.0","4.0","12.0","0","795","95.75","78.97","18.39","36.86","18.07","33.33","77.48","42.01","6.42","1.89","0.13","1.26","0.25","0.13","0.13","4.53","7.92","15.72","4.78","2.64","5.79","0.38","9.06","2.64","1.26","0.88","6.67","1.38","1.89","1.26","0.63","0.00","0.00","0.50","8.30","0.13","0.38","0.00","0.13","8.05","2.26","2.14","0.38","0.63","1.76","1.26","2.14","0.25","1.76","0.13","0.13","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","7.04","2.01","1.64","2.39","0.63","1.01","4.78","4.53","1.01","12.45","1.13","5.41","5.91","9.31","0.00","0.13","7.30","0.00","0.13","0.25","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.13","0.00","19.75","5.79","7.92","0.00","0.38","0.13","0.00","0.38","2.52","1.51","0.00","1.13","4126","8.19","23.314285714285713","1288","794","55","56.86","12.7","8.9","13.8","11.5","193","3.3","17.482921914357686","374","21.26","13","0.41","0","35","57","77","0","106","52","1","0","7","119","80","1","65","0","0","15","5","23","0","0","3","21","0","19","48","15","27","12","15","5","3","0","2"
"http://www.courant.com/sports/chi-blackhawks-beat-wild-in-ot-20140513-column.html","Can Crawford get some help before overtime?","Patrick Kane went forehand. Then backhand. Then top shelf.

Hello, Western Conference final.

Kane launched the Blackhawks into their fourth conference final in the last six seasons with a sweet and completely expected overtime game-winner.

Sweet because he followed a fluky bounce off a stanchion and deked Minnesota goalie Ilya Bryzgalov and the annoying and sometimes scary Wild into next season.

Completely expected because that’s what Kane does in these kinds of moments. In seven potential clinching Game 6s since 2009, Kane now has 11 goals, three of them game-winners, meaning he has ended almost half of the matches with some kind of sudden brilliance.

Indeed, the Hawks have no more dramatic player than Kane.

They had no better player in Game 6, however, than Corey Crawford.

Without Crawford, Kane never would’ve had a chance to be a hero. In fact, we might’ve seen the first Stanley Cup playoff game with a running clock.

Crawford stopped 34 of 35 shots, and he was under such a siege that you wondered what he’d done on the flight to Minnesota that was so bad that his teammates abandoned him.

It didn’t start out that way. In fact, it started out lucky for the Hawks when Kris Versteeg banked a puck past Bryzgalov from below the goal line less than two minutes after the opening faceoff.

The Hawks carried the play for most of the first 10 minutes, and then, pffft.

It was all Wild the rest of the first period.

It was all Wild in the second period.

It was all Wild in the third period.

Remarkably, stunningly, this mess the Hawks allowed went into overtime, and only because of Crawford.

What save did you like best? His stop on Mikael Granlund short side in the first period?

Or how about the second-period collection of point-blank saves on Jason Pominville, Justin Fontaine, Cody McCormick, and then two more on Fontaine?

You get the idea. This was a goalie win by a goalie about whom some people still wonder he can win a Cup even though he already has.

Even though he just closed this series by allowing only two goals in the last two games.

Even though he’s the only visiting goalie to win in Minnesota this postseason.

You know those numbers I cited earlier about Kane’s clutch histrionics? Well, Crawford has some of his own, such as a convincing 6-1 record and gaudy .950 save percentage in potential clinching games.

The Hawks needed every bit of their goaltender in Game 6 because they had nothing that looked like a puck possession game.

The Hawks could not make a pass, and if they did, they couldn’t catch it, and if they did, they couldn’t do anything with it. This was some lame hockey. It was bad enough to get them beat and force a Game 7, except for Crawford.

This has now become a disturbing road trend. The first two games in St. Louis and all three in Minnesota smacked of bad, sloppy and/or uneven play, you pick it.

The Hawks have won just two of their six road games this postseason, and while they were the two games that ended the home season for their opponents, the Hawks have to be better than that. They have to dictate the pace and terms of play, and they have to be smarter on the road.

The first two games in St. Louis were all kinds of stupid, starting with Brent Seabrook’s suspendable hit on David Backes. Expecting a brutal series, the Hawks wanted to be the ones who lashed out first. Took them a week to wise up. Took them a week to remember that wasn’t their game.

The first two games in Minnesota were a pile of stubbornness against whatever version of the trap the Wild were playing. The Hawks believed they could stickhandle through anything, even 1-on-5, but no, they couldn’t, and here come the Wild on yet another rush. Finally, the Hawks played a dump-and-chase game that loosened up the disciplined Wild in a Game 5 win. In Game 6, the Hawks had the better goalie and the luckier moment.

They will take all of it, of course. They will take whatever invitation there is when it comes to the conference final. But they need to play better on the road -- smarter -- especially when they’re in the unusual position of perhaps not having home-ice advantage in either of the next two rounds.","2014-05-14 01:34:00","0","34.0","2.0","3.0","0.0","24.0","0.0","48.0","21.0","0.0","78.0","4.0","12.0","0","752","80.40","67.43","32.16","75.18","15.04","16.62","82.31","50.93","11.04","5.72","0.27","0.13","0.80","1.60","3.06","5.32","9.44","13.30","7.31","5.19","5.98","1.73","12.63","4.65","2.93","1.46","5.72","2.79","6.12","4.39","1.73","0.27","0.53","0.27","8.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.60","12.23","1.33","1.60","1.99","3.06","1.99","3.32","0.80","0.27","0.13","0.13","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.27","10.24","2.93","4.65","2.39","3.86","0.66","6.12","5.32","1.46","16.89","1.99","7.18","7.71","2.26","3.86","0.27","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.13","0.13","0.13","0.00","15.69","6.12","5.32","0.00","0.00","0.53","0.00","1.86","0.00","1.73","0.00","0.13","3287","6.73","15.958333333333334","949","742","50","81.83","9.0","5.5","9.16","7.9","111","5.642857142857143","13.903827493261458","352","14.65","1","0.49","0","23","31","98","0","101","50","7","2","7","98","80","0","29","0","0","46","8","35","4","0","5","12","0","26","45","11","7","14","12","5","5","0","4"
"http://www.courant.com/sports/football/hc-roger-goodell-ray-rice-0911-20140910-story.html","Report: NFL Got Rice Video In April","An act of domestic violence has already cost a professional football running back his job. Bumbling an investigation into the incident might cost the NFL's commissioner his.

Roger Goodell, who heads the nation's most successful sports league, has been adamant that no one at the NFL had seen video of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice striking his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City elevator in February until surveillance footage was publicly released earlier this week.

Media reports are now challenging that claim. An unnamed law enforcement official said he sent a video of the attack to an NFL executive five months ago, the Associated Press reported Wednesday. The official allowed the AP to hear a 12-second voicemail from an NFL office number, with a woman's voice confirming receipt of the video and saying, ""You're right. It's terrible.""

The NFL immediately responded by repeating what it has been saying all along: ""We are not aware of anyone in our office who possessed or saw the video before it was made public on Monday,"" league spokesman Brian McCarthy said. ""We will look into it.""

But late Wednesday, the NFL reported that former FBI director Robert Mueller will conduct a probe into how the league handled evidence in the case.

The National Organization for Women called for Goodell's resignation, and 12 members of the House Judiciary Committee signed a letter to him questioning his handling of the incident.

Before the AP report, John Mara, co-owner of the New York Giants, released a statement supporting Goodell and the league's handling of the case.

NFL players took to social media with their reaction, and within no time the hashtag #fireGoodell was trending on Twitter. Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin threw Goodell's words back at him with a post that read, ""Sean Payton was suspended for one year. 'Ignorance is not an excuse…'"" — Goodell's words when he handed out punishment against the New Orleans Saints coach in 2012 for his role in setting bounties on opposing players.

Recently retired linebacker James Harrison, who was among the most heavily fined players in Goodell's tenure, chided in a message to the commissioner, ""ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun huh?"" And retired running back Brian Westbrook wrote, ""Being a leader is not a part time job. If Goodell holds the players to a high standard, he should be held to that same high standard!""

The woman Rice struck, Janay Palmer, is now his wife. Video of Rice dragging her out of the elevator surfaced in July, but it wasn't until this week that TMZ released footage of the blow to her face that knocked her into a railing and left her limp on the floor.

Rice was charged with third-degree assault, a felony; Palmer with simple assault, a misdemeanor. Rice agreed to enter a diversionary program, allowing him to avoid trial.

The NFL suspended Rice for two games after the first video's release. When the additional footage went public, the Ravens immediately terminated his contract and the league suspended him indefinitely, meaning that no team could pick him up.

In a letter to NFL team presidents Wednesday, Goodell defended his actions, saying, ""When the new video evidence became available, we acted promptly …""

Goodell was widely criticized for initially suspending Rice for only two games.

When the new video of Rice surfaced, and the public saw the brutality of the incident, criticism grew to a roar. The questions: When did the NFL first see the video? And if the league actually didn't see it until Monday, why not?

The law enforcement source who spoke to the AP said he had no further communication with any NFL employee and could not confirm if anyone had watched the video. The person said he was not authorized to release the video, but shared it unsolicited so the NFL would have the information when deciding on Rice's punishment.

In his letter Wednesday to the 32 teams, Goodell said that while deciding how to penalize Rice, the league asked New Jersey state and local authorities to provide all relevant information, including video, but did not ask the same of the now-closed Revel Hotel and Casino, which had the footage from the elevator.

Suspicion lingers about what the NFL knew, and when.

""Given the important role the NFL and the other major professional sports leagues can play in shaping public perceptions concerning domestic violence, it would appear to be in the public interest to have the highest level of transparency associated with reviews of potential misconduct,"" said the letter from the House Judiciary Committee, which was signed by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich, the committee's ranking member, and 11 other Democrats.

NOW said that the league had ""a violence-against-women problem"" and that the commissioner's stepping down is ""the only way to restore honor and integrity to the country's most lucrative and popular pastime.""","2014-09-11 00:06:18","0","26.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","47.0","21.0","0.0","69.0","4.0","12.0","0","818","93.29","75.33","18.07","15.46","23.37","25.18","79.34","44.99","7.58","3.55","0.00","0.49","0.12","2.81","0.12","4.03","11.98","11.98","5.62","3.30","5.13","1.83","11.49","3.67","1.59","2.32","1.71","0.86","3.42","1.34","2.08","0.24","0.98","0.12","10.88","0.24","0.12","1.22","2.32","7.95","1.83","1.10","1.10","1.96","0.24","2.81","4.65","2.44","1.83","0.24","1.47","0.37","0.00","0.00","1.10","7.82","3.30","1.47","3.18","0.37","0.37","6.48","3.67","0.61","14.79","1.34","6.60","7.33","4.52","3.55","0.49","0.61","0.12","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.12","0.00","16.50","4.03","5.62","0.24","0.12","0.37","0.12","0.98","2.44","2.44","0.00","0.12","3932","8.5","24.58823529411765","1216","812","34","55.68","13.1","11.4","12.36","14.3","189","9.0","20.87034482758621","403","22.24","21","0.45","0","23","9","108","0","85","52","0","1","9","156","108","1","24","0","0","23","14","29","1","3","4","21","0","20","62","26","16","5","15","4","6","0","11"
"http://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-coltsville-national-park-congress-20141204-story.html","Hartford's Coltsville Moves Closer To National Park Status","Legislation that would allow for the creation of a Coltsville National Park passed the House of Representatives on Thursday as part of the federal defense bill.

The bill would allow for the establishment of a new unit within the National Park Service at the 260-acre site within the Coltsville Historic District, according to Rep. John Larson, D-1st District. Larson introduced the bill and it was co-sponsored by the state's four other members of the House.

""This is a major thing for the community,"" Larson said Thursday night. ""This really has been an enormous effort and great testimony to everyone's resiliency.""

The site, along I-91 and the Connecticut River, was formerly the home of Colt's firearms. The national park, if established, would include 10,000 square feet of the East Armory.

The defense bill moves to the Senate after Thursday's vote in the House. Larson said he believes the bill will pass there as well.

""This has had bipartisan support,"" Larson said of the legislation. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., introduced the legislation in the Senate and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., co-sponsored it.

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra also support the bill.

The bill, according to Larson, received unanimous approval in the House natural resources committee.

Legislation designating Coltsville a national park was introduced in 2010 by then-Sen. Chris Dodd and Larson. The bill failed to pass. Larson said that since 2010 the House has not been able to pass a land bill, marking Thursday's vote as an accomplishment.

The work to make Coltsville a national park started with a bill in 2002 introduced by Larson, Dodd and then-U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman to study the possibility of the district's becoming a national park, according to Larson's office. The legislation was passed and was signed into law by former President George Bush.

""This has been ongoing for over 12 years and it has been close to passage before but it's never been at this point,"" Larson said.

In 2009, the National Park Service released a study determining that the area was nationally significant and was suitable for the designation, Larson's office said. It has had the designation of a National Historic Landmark since 2008.

In 2011, then-Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar visited the area and supported the idea of making Coltsville a national park. Salazar said at the time: ""As a historical site that draws visitors from across thenation,Coltsvilleagain promises to be an economic engine, producing jobs and spurring growth in the Hartford area.""

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation could cost about $9 million to implement from 2015 to 2019 and its operating costs would be less than $1 million, Larson's office said.","2014-12-04 22:40:09","0","20.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","25.0","0.0","49.0","21.0","0.0","83.0","4.0","13.0","0","460","98.12","54.33","22.78","45.75","14.84","24.57","71.30","43.48","4.57","0.43","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","4.13","12.83","14.13","6.96","1.30","5.00","0.43","11.52","5.00","2.17","0.00","3.91","0.43","2.39","1.74","0.65","0.00","0.00","0.22","3.04","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","5.87","0.87","1.74","1.30","0.43","0.65","1.30","1.96","0.22","1.74","0.00","0.43","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","4.57","0.43","1.30","2.39","0.22","0.65","6.30","4.57","0.87","15.65","1.96","8.91","5.00","5.00","0.00","1.30","3.04","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","20.22","7.61","5.43","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.17","2.17","2.17","0.00","0.43","2230","7.64","18.84","672","448","29","64.3","11.5","8.1","12.82","11.0","92","7.666666666666666","16.374285714285715","225","17.24","7","0.42","0","14","19","64","0","54","24","1","0","6","72","92","1","7","0","0","7","1","14","0","0","0","13","0","12","30","11","14","0","13","2","0","0","0"
"http://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-hartford-ana-grace-school-0903-20140902-story.html","CREC Renames School In Honor of Sandy Hook Victim","The Capitol Region Education Council has renamed one of its magnet schools in honor of Ana Grace Marquez-Greene, a former Hartford resident who was among the young victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting.

Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts Elementary Magnet School, located temporarily in Avon, will now be known as CREC Ana Grace Academy of the Arts Elementary School, the education agency announced Tuesday.

A formal dedication ceremony will happen when the school moves to a permanent building, possibly in Hartford, by January 2017, CREC officials said.

But already, CREC said in a statement, the school's signs are being changed and the curriculum will reflect the principles of ""Love Wins,"" a motto advocated by Ana's family ""to promote love, connection, and community for every child and family.""

Ana was 6 when she died on Dec. 14, 2012, with 19 other first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. Her brother, Isaiah, then a third-grader, survived the shooting.

Naming the CREC school after Ana — especially an elementary arts school with a diverse group of students — is ""a perfect way to honor her life,"" said her mother, Nelba Marquez-Greene.

Ana ""loved to draw, loved to dance,"" Marquez-Greene said Tuesday. ""And she loved school ... Loved school. And she didn't get to attend a whole lot; just kindergarten and half of first grade. It just seemed pretty special that now, even though her life was so short, she gets her own school.""

Marquez-Greene and Ana's father, saxophonist and jazz educator Jimmy Greene, have extensive ties to CREC. Both graduated from the Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts high school program in the 1990s, and years ago they were CREC employees — Greene as an instructor at the arts academy and Marquez-Greene as an intervention specialist in the Open Choice program.

Marquez-Greene, trained as a marriage and family therapist, worked with CREC students, parents and schools to resolve conflicts.

Even as a toddler, Ana was thrilled with the idea of school and being a student, said Marquez-Greene, now the director of the Ana Grace Project of Klingberg Family Centers. There was a period of time, when the family lived in Wethersfield, when they would take Ana to the town library on Tuesday afternoons.

""She would call it her library school,"" Marquez-Greene said. ""She would be so excited at her appointed time to go to library school.""

The family moved to Canada in 2009, then relocated to Connecticut — choosing the Sandy Hook village in Newtown — in summer 2012 after Greene accepted a job as an assistant music professor at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury.

When the family heard about CREC's gesture, ""we cried for a long, long time,"" Marquez-Greene said. ""There doesn't seem to be a more special way to honor her ... We can't thank them enough.""

CREC Executive Director Bruce Douglas said the agency is ""deeply proud to name the arts academy after Ana Grace. By doing so, we honor her life and her inextinguishable spirit. The legacy of Ana Grace, and her classmates and teachers, will be forever present in our students and our community.""

Last fall, in a ceremony outside its Hartford central offices, CREC dedicated a stone bench and planted a bed of tulips in memory of the Sandy Hook victims.","2014-09-02 18:00:00","0","21.0","2.0","3.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","40.0","21.0","0.0","79.0","4.0","13.0","0","555","93.99","86.02","12.35","94.53","19.82","23.96","79.10","41.26","5.77","4.50","0.00","0.90","0.00","3.06","0.54","1.26","9.37","13.51","4.86","3.78","6.67","0.54","9.73","4.68","2.34","1.08","2.34","1.08","5.59","5.05","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.18","11.35","2.16","0.18","3.24","0.36","5.05","1.98","0.18","0.54","1.08","0.72","0.90","2.52","0.00","1.80","0.72","1.98","0.00","0.90","0.00","0.00","10.63","4.50","2.16","3.96","1.26","0.00","5.05","4.68","1.08","14.77","1.44","7.03","6.31","10.81","2.88","1.62","0.00","0.18","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.72","5.77","7.93","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","1.98","3.60","1.26","0.00","0.00","2626","7.98","21.615384615384617","810","549","27","59.33","12.5","10.0","12.01","12.5","116","13.375","18.571730418943535","275","19.23","11","0.41","0","20","10","52","0","62","35","0","0","8","87","111","1","26","0","0","14","15","19","1","0","0","16","0","20","32","7","7","5","6","0","1","0","5"

Jose Rodriguez, 44, who police said is a member of the Los Solidos gang, was charged with possession of narcotics, possession of narcotics with the intent to sell, among other charges.

He was also served a parole absconder warrant , according to police.

Members of the Shooting Task Force, the Hartford FBI Task Force, the Hartford Parole Fugitive Task Force and the South Conditions Unit spotted Rodriguez involved in drug deals while conducting surveillance at 115 Zion Street, police said.

Rodriguez was arrested inside the residence at that address, police said.

HARTFORD, Conn. - Ebola seems to be all anyone is talking about these days and with the most recent case now confirmed in New York City, many are scrambling with questions about the potential for an outbreak in the United States. Though there are no proven treatments at this time, modern medical intervention has shown to be effective. However, a person infected with Ebola cannot spread the disease until symptoms appear.

In light of all the news coverage and questions swirling around this disease, Connecticut Children's Medical Center will hold a webinar on Ebola Wednesday, November 19 from 12:15 - 1:15 PM. The webinar, presented by Nicholas Bennett, MD, Medical Director of the Division of Infectious Diseases & Immunology, will address the actual risks related to the current outbreak from both a natural health and epidemiological point of view.

The hour-long webinar will feature Infectious Disease expert, Dr. Nicholas Bennett, who will share his medical perspective and put common myths to rest about the virus that has made headlines across the nation. Topics discussed will include:

• Disease transmission

• Risk assessment

• Treatment options

• Potential for cross continental spread

• How to discuss Ebola with patients

A Q&A session will follow. To register, please visit www.ctchildrenswebinar.com.This webinar is free and open to the public.

"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-cell-phone-charges-blumenthal-20141229-story.html","Blumenthal Urges Cellphone Users To Claim Their Refunds","HARTFORD — If you had a cellphone with T-Mobile or AT&T in the past five years, you might be owed money for unauthorized charges that have been recovered through settlements.

Both wireless carriers settled allegations of ""mobile cramming"" with the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and 50 U.S. states. Cramming is when phone companies and wireless carriers allow some other entity to add charges to a consumer's phone bill without authorization by the consumer and, in many cases, without the consumer receiving anything in return.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Federal Communications Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel held a news conference Monday afternoon in the Legislative Office Building to explain how the billing worked and to urge people to get refunds that are owed to them.

""Those carriers have been profiting from those false, fraudulent fees to the tune of 30 to 40 cents of every dollar, and that is not only wrong, it's illegal, and it should produce refunds for consumers, but it won't automatically do so,"" Blumenthal said.

""That's why we're here today,"" Blumenthal said. ""Ask the carrier, through the website or the phone number … and make the claim for refunds.""

Blumenthal estimated that thousands of customers in Connecticut are owed a refund. It's not clear how much a person might get in a refund, but the monthly charges appeared as small amounts — as little as $1.99 or $2.99 — to as much as $9.99.

The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, of which Blumenthal is a member, produced a report finding that cramming on wireless phones is widespread. The report was issued in July and found that third-party wireless billing ""has been a billion dollar industry that has yielded tremendous profits for the four largest wireless carriers, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon,"" according to Blumenthal's office.

To settle the allegations, T-Mobile recently paid $90 million and AT&T paid $105 million in October. The problem is industrywide, but T-Mobile and AT&T are the companies that have settled so far, Blumenthal said.

""What this is is modern-day pickpocketing, and it's fraud, pure and simple,"" Rosenworcel said.

However, consumers don't automatically get their money back. They have to ask for it.

T-Mobile customers can request a free account summary from July 2010 to present. The account summary is available by visiting http://t-mobilerefund.com/billing, or by calling 1-855-382-6403.

"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-flublok-vaccine-20141223-story.html","As Sales Lag For Breakthrough Vaccine, Senators Offer Aid","MERIDEN — Connecticut's U.S. senators are trying to put public pressure on the Centers for Disease Control to buy flu vaccines from a local drug company, escalating Sen. Richard Blumenthal's private lobbying.

The senators sent a letter to the CDC director Tuesday asking the agency to buy 250,000 FluBlok doses in January from Protein Sciences Corp., for this season.

The traditional flu shots that millions of people had in the fall are less likely to prevent infections against this year's dominant strain, the senators said, and those flu shots may still help patients have less severe bouts of the flu.

Sen. Chris Murphy and Blumenthal held a press conference at Protein Sciences to publicize their support. Rep. Rosa DeLauro and Rep. Elizabeth Esty sent a similar letter to the CDC on Monday.

The actions by the elected officials come as Protein Sciences' sales struggle, two years after the company received approval to sell Flublok — the first flu vaccine made from DNA-derived cell cultures rather than grown from eggs.

The flu strains circulating this winter have ""drifted"" or mutated slightly, the CDC warned several weeks ago. Protein Sciences says its biologics-based flu vaccine has a higher antibody response than traditional vaccines against influenza ""A"" viruses such as the H3 N2 virus that drifted this year.

""We should make a commitment as a nation to have the most effective vaccine,"" Murphy said.

He said not only should the CDC buy FluBlok so that some high-risk individuals can be injected a second time, but the federal agency should commit to buying from Protein Sciences next year, instead of only buying from larger companies that make egg-based vaccines.

Protein Sciences has struggled to penetrate the market. As recently as August, the company's CEO said she hoped to sell 350,000 doses during this flu season. But so far, it has only sold 50,000 according to Rachael Felberbaum, the company's director of communications.

Egg-based vaccines cost between $12 and $26 a dose, compared with FluBlok, which costs $32 a dose, Felberbaum said.

""It's worth the price,"" Murphy said.

""The prices will come down as more and more of this product is bought,"" Blumenthal said.

Consumers do not necessarily pay more if injected with FluBlok rather than a traditional vaccine, because many private insurers and Medicare cover the cost of the vaccine.

Felberbaum said the biggest buyer so far has been hospitals, which vaccinate all staff members. More than 30 percent of hospitals use FluBlok, she said.

With the news of the viral drift a few weeks ago, Felberbaum said the company has been approached by some buyers. Nursing homes are one market that could open up, as the vaccine was just approved for use in the people age 50 and older at the end of October.

""That's why we sold so little,"" she said, because pharmacy buyers want one vaccine that can cover all adults. ""Now we kind of missed the season.""

FluBlok was first approved in January 2013, and sold roughly 35,000 doses that year. ""Initially we had a shelf life of 16 weeks,"" Felberbaum said, which hurt sales, but now shelf life is six months.

In each of the first two years of production, Protein Sciences manufactured 300,000 doses. ""We can't keep doing this,"" Felberbaum said..

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services granted the company $150 million spread over the last five years to develop the technology that allows Protein Sciences to develop vaccines faster than the traditional way of growing viruses in eggs — including recent work on a possible vaccine for the ebola virus.

Murphy said, ""It only makes sense the government should continue to contribute"" to the company's viability.

Protein Sciences has applied to sell 300,000 doses to the CDC and 500,000 doses to the Department of Defense next year. If the company gets those orders, it will produce 1.2 million doses next year.

Blumenthal said making vaccines through genetic manipulation rather than egg cultures is like the difference between jet airplaines and propeller planes. ""I predict in 10 years, FluBlok will be the dominant product.""","2014-12-23 18:02:07","1","28.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","35.0","18.0","0.0","73.0","4.0","12.0","0","686","95.65","66.38","12.65","10.89","18.54","26.97","80.17","38.34","5.39","1.60","0.15","0.73","0.00","0.58","0.15","3.79","9.18","12.68","5.54","2.62","4.37","0.44","12.39","5.54","4.66","0.58","5.39","2.33","2.62","0.73","1.90","0.87","0.29","0.29","7.29","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.15","9.48","0.29","3.21","1.75","1.75","0.73","3.21","2.77","0.00","2.33","0.29","4.81","0.00","3.94","0.00","0.73","7.43","1.75","1.02","4.23","0.29","0.58","5.10","6.41","0.73","12.83","2.33","3.94","6.85","5.83","0.73","0.15","3.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.08","6.27","5.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.73","3.21","1.46","0.00","0.58","3292","7.78","21.181818181818183","998","678","38","61.87","11.6","9.1","12.06","11.6","140","6.916666666666667","17.379587020648966","336","19.73","16","0.4","0","15","33","77","0","72","38","7","1","12","90","76","12","57","0","0","14","2","29","3","1","2","20","0","28","37","13","20","15","16","8","0","0","1"
"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-grants-help-unemployed-20141015-story.html","Connecticut Agencies Receive $12 Million To Help Long-Term Unemployed","Ten months after the Obama administration tried to cajole businesses into considering hiring people who have been out of work for six months, a year, or several years, White House officials are reporting the results.

Some large companies have changed their hiring practices — for instance, putting in writing they do not discriminate on the basis of employment status — and some have increased the proportion of new hires who were out of work at least six months.

At Frontier Communications, 20 percent of this year's hires were previously long-term unemployed

At KPMG, a major accounting firm, 9 percent of this fiscal year hires were previously long-term unemployed

At CVS and Procter & Gamble, managers are being trained not to discriminate against applicants with work history gaps.

Wednesday, the Obama administration announced additional initiatives to spur re-employment for the long-term unemployed. It announced $170 million in grants to local job placement agencies around the country, funded by the fees for H1-B visas. Connecticut received two of the federal grants, with a combined total of $12.2 million.

Once people pass the six-month mark of unemployment, their chances of getting re-hired drop precipitously, economic papers suggest. One experiment with faux applications found employers were more likely to call someone with no experience in the field who had been out of work a month than someone with specific experience but who'd been out of work eight months.

Still, as the economy improves, so, too, have the prospects for the long-term unemployed. By the middle of 2014, someone who was long-term unemployed a year earlier had a 38 percent chance of being back to work. Someone who had been out of work just a few months had a 50 percent chance of being back to work a year later.

In January, 38 percent of all unemployed people had been out of work more than six months. Now it's 32 percent. There is no unemployment benefit paid once someone has collected for six months.

Of the Connecticut grants announced Wednesday, Capital Workforce Partners, which serves 37 towns in metro Hartford, received $6.7 million — a significant addition to its $20.2 million annual budget. The non-profit agency, which runs the one-stop employment centers, focuses on training workers for manufacturing, construction and health jobs.

Workforce Alliance, which serves New Haven, New London, Tolland, Windham, and part of Middlesex and Fairfield counties, received $5.5 million.","2014-10-15 00:00:00","0","17.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","34.0","17.0","0.0","73.0","4.0","12.0","0","404","96.65","62.62","58.42","39.01","23.76","27.23","83.42","40.10","5.45","0.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.74","4.70","6.93","16.34","7.18","2.23","2.23","0.99","10.40","4.46","2.48","2.23","7.43","3.96","0.74","0.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.94","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","6.68","0.50","1.24","0.00","2.72","0.74","1.73","0.74","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","7.18","0.74","3.47","2.23","0.74","0.25","5.94","5.69","0.25","20.05","2.23","8.17","10.89","12.13","0.00","0.25","2.72","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.83","4.21","7.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.72","0.00","0.74","0.00","1.49","2012","8.38","24.176470588235293","611","396","19","58.82","12.8","10.2","13.58","14.0","93","17.166666666666668","19.713939393939395","226","21.53","4","0.41","0","7","32","35","0","58","24","0","1","0","71","32","0","38","0","0","3","3","15","3","0","0","8","0","7","23","11","13","10","7","3","6","0","0"
"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-greenhouse-gases-progress-report-20140606-story.html","Report: Connecticut's Greenhouse Gas Levels Are Down, But More Action Is Needed","Levels of greenhouse gas emissions in Connecticut have been pushed back to where they were decades ago, but much more needs to be done to meet the state's climate goals, a new state report says.

Investments in energy efficiency, a regional shift to natural gas use for electricity, and slowed economic output between 2007 and 2010 were major contributors to the steep slide in the production of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change during that period, the report said.

The decline first dipped the state's greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels in 2008, two years ahead of the goal. Connecticut's next goals call for it to be 10 percent below those levels in 2020 and 80 percent below by 2050.

""Additional action will be required to achieve the state's target,"" said the state's report on greenhouse gas emissions. The report is required by the state Global Warming Solutions Act of 2008.

The report was dated Monday, the day the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency put forward new rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the country's power plants by 30 percent in the next decade and a half.

""There are strong indications that this climate progress is being and can continue to be accomplished while simultaneously assuring that Connecticut enjoys a cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy future, supporting economic growth and job growth, and providing improved quality of life,"" the report said.

In 2010, Connecticut produced 41.38 million metric tons of greenhouse gases across sectors including transportation, power, residential, commercial, industrial, agriculture and waste. In 1990, greenhouse gas emissions were 43.75 million metric tons.

Greenhouse gas production from the power and commercial sectors fell the steepest in the past two decades, while transportation, the largest category for the emissions, and industrial sectors grew by 6 percent and 13 percent, respectively.

Declines in the commercial sector were caused by less overall energy use and fuel switching from oil to natural gas, the report said.

Although meeting the state's goal for 2010 two years early is welcome news to state officials, more recent trends underline how further reducing emissions could prove more difficult.

One reason is that the economy is expanding, not declining as it did during the years leading up to 2010. As businesses increase operations or new firms open shops, demand for electricity will grow, increasing overall emissions. As the economy turned the corner at the end of 2009 and into 2010, carbon emissions in Connecticut began to tick up slightly, according to the state report.

Lauren Savidge, a staff attorney and energy specialist for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, called the report encouraging, but added that it also highlighted how far the state has left to go.

Although the state is comfortably on its way to meeting its 2020 goal — having emissions of just 39.38 million metric tons of carbon dioxide — the 2050 goal will take much more work. By then, the state needs to have just 9.25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

""Connecticut needs a firm plan to reach our legally mandated 2050 target,"" Savidge said. ""A detailed plan with short- and long-term goals will create exciting opportunities for innovation and economic growth while cleaning our air and mitigating climate damage.""

Much of the decline in the power sector can be attributed to a regional cap-and-trade program that required power plants to buy offsets for their carbon dioxide emissions. Proceeds from the purchases are reinvested by the eight Northeastern states participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to fund efficiency programs or renewable energy projects.

Promotion of the state report coincided Friday with the release of results from the most recent auction of carbon credits from the cap-and-trade program. The 24th auction since its founding in 2009 raised $90.7 million for member states by selling 18.1 million carbon credits at $5.02 a piece.

Cumulatively, the auctions have raised $1.75 billion.

Peter Shattuck, director of market initiative for Environment Northeast, an environmental advocate, said that the regional program ""has demonstrated that emissions can come down rapidly and affordably in the electric sector.""

Over the course of the program, electricity prices in the region have fallen by 8 percent.","2014-06-06 18:56:00","0","25.0","2.0","3.0","0.0","18.0","0.0","33.0","21.0","0.0","70.0","4.0","12.0","0","698","98.28","58.50","37.29","69.00","24.93","27.79","75.93","38.25","2.87","0.57","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.29","2.29","9.31","14.90","5.30","1.29","5.30","0.14","9.46","4.30","2.29","0.43","6.45","3.15","3.15","2.72","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.01","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.01","0.57","2.58","0.57","0.72","0.29","1.00","1.29","0.00","1.00","0.14","0.29","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.00","8.17","0.86","3.72","3.01","1.86","0.29","3.58","5.30","1.29","18.05","3.15","9.31","6.16","9.60","0.14","0.14","3.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.75","4.30","5.73","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.86","1.43","1.00","0.00","0.43","3584","7.98","25.5","1078","695","36","51.89","12.6","10.8","13.81","13.5","149","16.833333333333332","18.295539568345326","339","23.11","3","0.38","0","25","52","68","0","90","48","4","2","8","155","36","1","57","0","0","4","6","24","3","1","2","21","0","20","27","19","15","7","14","1","0","0","3"
"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-hartford-insurance-outsourcing-20141008-story.html","High Concentration of Hartford's H1-B Workers Are Employed By Outsourcing Firms","In metro Hartford, nearly a third of temporary visas for skilled workers, known as H1-B visas, are requested by businesses that provide outsourcing and consulting services to other companies, according to a new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

That's the highest proportion of any city in the Northeast, the study said. By contrast, only 10 percent of Boston's H1-B applications were from outsourcing companies.

Robert Clifford, author of the study that came out Wednesday, said he wanted to learn more about how H1-B visas are used in New England because our region has the most highly educated immigrant population of any part of the country.

He said he wanted to explore the question: ""What are the policies that could attract and retain these individuals?""

When outsourcers bring Indian immigrants to do information technology work in the United States, those immigrants rarely have a chance to stay for the rest of their careers, unless they find another employer willing to sponsor them before their six-year visa is finished.

These companies — Indian firms such as Wipro, Infosys, Tata as well as Cognizant and Deloitte — rarely sponsor green cards for the immigrants who work for them, Clifford said.

For instance, according to myvisajobs.com, Deloitte brought close to 1,800 workers on H1-Bs to America in 2014, but only sponsored 27 green cards.

He said another issue is that while they provide some services onsite, they send other work to India. In Cognizant's case, the majority of its technical staff work in India, and they do work for insurers both onsite and offshore on the same projects.

Still, Clifford said he cannot say that the concentration of visas among outsourcing firms is a problem with the program.

""There could be positive effects from the role of outsourcers,"" he said. ""Instead of focusing capital on IT labor force, they may be better able to invest in the core line of business.""

There is a 65,000 cap on the number of H1-B visas that can be issued every year, though there are two loopholes — 20,000 more applicants can receive the visas if they graduated from a master's program in the United States that year, and nonprofits are not subject to the cap.

Yale is the fourth-biggest sponsor of H1-Bs in New England, after Infosys, Wipro and Patni Americas, according to the report. On average, it requested 306 visas a year between 2010 and 2012.

Not all requests are filled, but Clifford said this was the best data available for local geographies.

Clifford said no one knows how many people are currently working in the U.S. on H1-B visas, because the data is kept by more than one agency and is not organized.

However, his study found that on average between 2010 and 2012, there were 1,358 requests for H1-B visas for computer professionals in metro Hartford, where there were 18,960 people working in the field — or about 7 percent of the industry.

That proportion of applications to workforce is lower than in Fairfield County, which is one of the top 10 urban areas in the country in intensity of H1-B demand.

His paper did not say which Hartford firms rely most heavily on these outsourcing companies, but the U.S. Department of Labor documented cases from The Hartford, Travelers, Cigna, Prudential and Mass Mutual in the last five years where local workers (including IBM contractors) lost their jobs because the work was sent to outsourcing companies in India.

Some critics of the program say that the younger, cheaper workers on H1-Bs are driving down wages for native IT professionals. Clifford said there isn't clear evidence that's happening.

Companies that apply for H1-B visas do not have to show that they tried to find a U.S. worker and couldn't.

Clifford said the program is often misunderstood, because he said, the political argument for raising the cap is often made that ""we have a skill shortage.""

He said policymakers should examine the program and think about what problem it's designed to solve. Is it a way to recruit the most talented scientists and technical minds to America? If so, maybe a point-based system would be more effective, as Canada uses.

Is it a way to help tech companies fill jobs? Clifford suggests then the cap should fluctuate by openings and unemployment rates.","2014-10-09 14:13:34","1","28.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","35.0","18.0","0.0","73.0","4.0","12.0","0","735","89.25","64.85","13.15","28.03","24.50","24.08","79.05","45.44","8.16","3.27","0.00","0.27","0.00","1.36","1.63","4.90","7.48","15.10","7.07","3.95","5.31","1.22","12.79","5.17","3.40","1.36","3.81","3.13","1.63","0.82","0.68","0.00","0.14","0.27","8.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.36","10.48","2.31","1.90","1.63","2.45","0.54","2.86","2.72","0.54","2.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.12","0.41","2.99","3.27","0.54","0.27","4.49","8.44","0.27","12.11","1.36","7.48","3.54","10.20","0.41","0.00","2.31","0.00","0.00","1.63","0.41","1.50","0.00","0.14","0.00","16.05","4.63","6.53","0.14","0.00","0.41","0.00","1.90","1.09","1.09","0.27","0.00","3421","8.04","24.866666666666667","1047","719","34","58.52","12.2","10.3","11.66","12.6","153","12.0","18.95182197496523","357","22.6","28","0.45","0","19","25","71","0","101","38","6","4","8","97","84","2","55","0","0","22","7","25","2","2","2","22","0","29","33","15","13","22","20","8","3","0","5"
"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-gina-mccarthy-hartford-return-20141014-story.html","EPA Administrator Makes A Hartford Homecoming","HARTFORD — Gina McCarthy was one of the last people ever to walk into the Phoenix Auditorium on the fifth floor of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection offices here.

And McCarthy, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency who lead Connecticut's environmental department from 2004 to 2009, wasn't about to waste it.

""Yo, yo, yo, yo,"" McCarthy said, laughing and striding into the room to applause from her former colleagues. ""This is so cool to come home.""

She stared out at the faces in the auditorium.

""I forget everybody's name"" — the crowd laughed — ""No, I'm just kidding.""

Commissioner Rob Klee introduced and welcomed McCarthy, a ""witty and inspirational presence,"" he said, before announcing that the crème, pink and green auditorium would be renamed the Gina McCarthy Auditorium to honor her long list of accomplishments in Connecticut as well as her work pushing the country through its first major attempt to beat back the effects of climate change.

""I was worried about what you were going to actually name it. I've been known to have some pointed statements and colorful language. I thought you might call it the 'wicked-cool auditorium,'"" McCarthy said, her Boston accent in full force.

One employee said McCarthy would hold monthly meetings with managers in the auditorium, where she would sit on the stage, with her feet swinging off the ground, and take all sorts of questions.

McCarthy, 60, made other stops in Bridgeport and New Haven on her trip through the state Tuesday, stopping at a fuel cell park in Bridgeport and an aquaculture school in New Haven. In Hartford, she stressed how environmental protection and economic growth need to be seen as complimentary, rather than as opposing, forces.

The nation's economy would not be where it was today, she argued, if it did not take care of its environmental issues. ""We just wouldn't be and we need to remind people of that,"" McCarthy said. ""I can make that case to any human being that comes in front of me.""

In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a draft rule that calls for the state to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from existing power plants by nearly a third in the 15 years. While Connecticut and other New England states should make quick work of that target, the plan quickly gained opponents from those in areas where the power sector largely relies on coal and oil.

""The one thing that the EPA needs to be a little bit clearer about is what we do for a living and why it matters, because in the end all that remains is about public health and about the next generation,"" she said, ""And you helped me focus that. You helped me stay energized. You taught me so much. I will forever be grateful.""

McCarthy joked and took questions from her former employees.

Yes, her current chief of staff who also worked for her in Connecticut is doing well, although he works too much and eats too many candy bars. Yes, there's assigned seating at White House cabinet meetings. No, McCarthy is not in the line of presidential succession, which she said is a good thing.

""Washington is great. They are just as mission driven as you guys are. It's just not quite as fun,"" she said.

McCarthy has sensed a change in tone in the forums and visits about climate change she makes around the country. ""There are big differences now,"" she said.

""You are feeling the impacts of climate. The science is very definitive, and we have solutions to offer. We no longer have to worry that once we admit it, we've got nowhere to go: We have technologies out there. And we can do this in a way that will continue the strong economic growth we have been seeing.""

But there are many challenges too, she said.

""Our challenge is to convince people that what we are doing is following the direction of the energy transition in the United States, and that we have provided the flexibility for that to work in every state. … Climate resilience is going to be one of the toughest issues we deal with,"" she said.

The power sector, parts of which have been some of the most vocal opponents of the climate change plan, McCarthy said, are coming around and are being modernized by the push to cut greenhouse gases.

""They were a sector that was growing old fast, wasn't investing in itself, wasn't frankly doing anything and they got bypassed,"" she said. ""They are now catching up because we are telling them to integrate the things that you want in the world for them to do. We want them to be efficient. We want them to be reliable. We want them as cheap as we can get them, and we want them to be sustainable, which means low carbon.""","2014-10-14 16:44:12","0","33.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","29.0","0.0","43.0","21.0","0.0","97.0","4.0","13.0","0","812","67.14","86.62","16.47","63.12","18.45","18.97","86.08","53.45","14.53","8.99","1.35","2.46","0.99","2.83","1.35","5.54","7.02","14.41","9.48","4.68","5.54","1.48","17.36","4.19","2.09","1.60","1.48","1.48","3.94","2.96","0.99","0.37","0.25","0.12","12.44","0.00","0.25","2.59","0.37","9.36","1.60","2.09","1.97","1.48","1.11","1.97","3.45","0.86","1.85","0.49","0.99","0.37","0.25","0.00","0.37","8.99","2.83","2.22","2.59","1.11","0.74","5.05","10.34","0.99","15.02","3.08","8.62","3.82","4.80","0.37","0.37","0.62","0.00","0.00","1.23","0.00","0.49","0.49","0.25","0.00","17.98","5.79","6.28","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.12","3.94","1.72","0.00","0.00","3654","7.25","18.75","1120","815","45","70.02","10.0","8.0","9.8","9.9","140","6.5","16.11116564417178","392","16.77","11","0.53","0","27","8","74","0","94","56","0","1","11","105","58","1","40","0","0","73","12","40","1","1","5","26","0","42","38","23","13","35","22","7","5","0","5"
"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-general-electric-executive-compensation-20140306-story.html","General Electric CEO Immelt Made $11.3M In 2013","Jeffrey R. Immelt, chairman and chief executive of Fairfield-based General Electric Co., made $11.27 million in 2013, a steep decline from the $20.45 million he took home the prior year, a federal filing Thursday showed.

The drop in earnings for the year is mainly attributable to a decline in performance-based pay for 2013, which more than outweighed the company board of directors' approval of a higher cash bonus for Immelt and his first salary increase in almost a decade.

In addition to the higher earnings, the company awarded Immelt, 58, stock now valued at $7.78 million. The ultimate value of the stock will depend on how well the company's stock performs, and it will only be awarded after a vesting period if the company meets certain financial performance targets.

The compensation committee on GE's board of directors increased Immelt's base pay 6 percent to $3.47 million and upped his cash bonus by 11 percent to $5 million, and said his ""pay reflects the [committee's] view of his outstanding leadership and, consistent with prior years, represents a balanced approach to compensation.""

Immelt's last base salary increase was in April 2005.

The details were contained in the company's proxy statement filed with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission on Thursday in advance of a shareholder meeting in late April, where votes will be held on the election of directors, the company's executive compensation packages, auditor approval and other proposals.

From Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 last year, the company's stock increased 37.1 percent to $28.03 a share. Revenue fell 0.5 percent for the year, while net income rose about 10 percent.

The Courant calculates compensation as the sum of salary, bonus, value exercised from stock options and vested stock awards, plus other forms of direct pay, such as incentive payments and personal use of corporate aircraft.

The company's proxy also listed compensation for other key company executives: Jeffrey S. Bornstein, chief financial officer, $11.32 million; Daniel C. Heintzelman, vice chairman, $8.77 million; John G. Rice, vice chairman, $10.88 million; Keith S. Sherin, vice chairman, $9.57 million; and Brackett B. Denniston III, general counsel and secretary, $6.0 million.","2014-03-07 10:34:00","0","15.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","31.0","18.0","0.0","70.0","4.0","12.0","0","357","98.41","62.12","9.60","94.40","18.79","31.65","73.95","33.89","2.80","1.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.40","0.00","1.40","8.96","13.73","2.24","2.52","5.32","0.00","5.32","3.64","1.96","0.84","9.24","1.68","4.76","4.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.40","5.32","0.56","1.96","0.56","1.40","0.28","1.40","0.84","0.56","0.28","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.28","10.36","0.56","2.80","5.60","3.36","0.28","2.80","2.24","0.84","13.17","2.24","5.32","5.60","12.61","0.28","0.28","7.56","0.00","0.00","0.84","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.28","0.00","23.81","6.16","8.68","0.28","1.12","0.00","0.00","0.56","0.56","2.80","0.00","3.64","1784","8.09","34.45454545454545","549","355","28","67.04","10.8","7.1","12.8","10.1","86","7.333333333333334","16.770140845070422","206","29.0","10","0.34","0","13","44","32","0","43","38","2","0","3","88","42","0","16","0","0","2","4","6","1","0","0","7","0","3","15","0","9","1","7","1","0","0","2"
"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-health-insurance-rates-20140604-story.html","Health Insurers Propose Rate Increases For 2015 Coverage","Insurance companies selling health plans next fall for coverage in 2015 are asking state regulators to approve prices that reflect medical-cost inflation, and, in some cases, federal mandates, and expensive drugs to treat Hepatitis C.

Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Connecticut and ConnectiCare are asking for increases. HealthyCT is asking for a price decrease.

Summaries of the proposed rate increases were posted this week on the Connecticut Insurance Department's website. Insurers were required to file 2015 rates by May 31 for review by the department, which could approve, modify or deny them. The insurance plans will be available next fall to customers who buy insurance either on, or off, a public exchange, Access Health CT, which was created by the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare.

One major theme in the rate requests is that all insurers expect a continued rise in ""trend"" — the rising cost in medical services and the increasing demand for those services.

Anthem, the state's largest health insurer, and ConnectiCare both say their higher prices also reflect taxes, fees and requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, Anthem said prices reflect expensive pharmaceuticals to treat Hepatitis C, including Sovaldi by Gilead Sciences Inc. Sovaldi was approved for use in December by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

New this year, UnitedHealthcare will sell individual health plans on the exchange. Last year for 2014 coverage, UnitedHealthcare only sold small-group plans on the exchange.

Here is a summary of rate requests submitted this week:

— HealthyCT Inc., is asking for rate decrease averaging 8.9 percent on individual health plans sold on and off the exchange for coverage beginning Jan. 1. The lower rate would affect 7,248 policyholders. HealthyCT is too new to the market to have claims experience on which it can base its 2015 rates. It used the consulting firm Milliman to develop rates using various data sources and models. HealthyCT anticipates a 5.2 percent increase in the cost of medical services and demand for those services, but that will be offset by other adjustments that lower the rates. For example, HealthyCT is spreading the cost of administrative expenses and fees over a three-year period instead of one policy year.

— Anthem Health Plans, Inc., a part of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut, is asking for a rate hike averaging 12.5 percent on individual health plans sold on and off the exchange. The new rates would affect 66,200 policyholders. Anthem attributed the rate hikes in part to federal mandates from the Affordable Care Act, such as ""guaranteed issue,"" which is a requirement that insurers offer plans regardless of a person's health condition. Additionally, Anthem said its new rates reflect taxes and fees.

— ConnectiCare Benefits Inc. of Farmington is asking for a rate increase of 11.8 percent on individual health plans sold on the exchange. The increase would affect 27,500 policyholders. ConnectiCare expects a 10.7 percent increase resulting from medical costs and utilization of medical services. The company also expects a $14.68 per-customer, per-month charge related to fees associated with the Affordable Care Act. The fees include Patient Centered Outcomes Research Fee, Transitional Reinsurance Program, Health Insurer Fee and the Risk Adjustment Program. ConnectiCare based its rates on the claims experience of health plans it sold off the exchange in Connecticut because there isn't enough claim history for 2014 alone, the first year of the exchange.

— UnitedHealthcare is selling individual health plans for the first year on the exchange. The company based its prices on the claims experience of fellow UnitedHealth Group subsidiaries — Oxford Health Insurance and Oxford Health Plans, which sold small-group plans on the exchange. UnitedHealthcare expects that taxes and fees will account for about 7.3 percent of its rates.","2014-06-04 19:53:31","0","17.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","34.0","19.0","0.0","70.0","4.0","12.0","0","626","97.30","63.13","9.86","46.36","18.97","27.96","78.27","36.10","4.47","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","4.15","8.31","13.42","4.79","1.60","4.15","0.16","10.22","3.83","1.12","0.96","3.99","2.56","2.40","1.76","0.64","0.16","0.00","0.48","4.95","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.16","6.71","0.80","2.24","1.44","0.80","0.32","1.44","1.60","0.64","0.48","0.00","3.67","0.00","3.51","0.00","0.16","7.35","0.48","2.56","3.67","0.32","0.32","2.56","4.15","3.67","12.46","2.08","6.71","3.83","6.23","0.32","0.00","9.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.06","5.91","5.59","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.96","0.64","0.64","0.00","0.16","3230","7.56","22.0","992","623","42","56.45","12.2","9.1","13.33","11.3","126","6.583333333333333","16.00988764044944","272","20.07","5","0.35","0","22","29","61","0","78","38","2","1","9","100","100","2","65","0","0","4","6","9","0","0","1","10","0","17","15","18","13","13","16","7","1","0","0"
"http://www.courant.com/community/mansfield-edition/rnw-wm-p5-israel-palestine-0725-20140725-story.html","Local groups involved in rallies supporting Palestine","On June 12, three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped in Gush Etzion, in the West Bank, as they were hitchhiking to their homes. The Israel Defense Forces began a search for the three teens. In the early days of the investigation, Israel arrested approximately 250 Palestinians, including nearly all of the West Bank leaders of Hamas, the group which has governed the Gaza Strip after winning a majority of seats in the Palestinian Parliament in 2006. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that the teens had been kidnapped by Hamas, but the group and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas denied Hamas' involvement.

On June 30, search teams found the bodies of the three missing teens. Netanyahu vowed a tough response to the killings, kicking off the most recent uptick in the long-standing clash between Israel and Palestine.

As of Monday, July 21, the Gaza Health Ministry said that the death toll in Gaza has risen to 511 since the conflict began. The number of Palestinians seeking refuge with the United Nations continues to increase, growing to at least 85,000 people now living in 67 shelters, mostly at schools, according to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency. The United Nations also said a preliminary review in Gaza found that more than 72 percent of those killed were civilians, not militants, and include large numbers of women and children.

During the heaviest day of fighting to date, Sunday, July 20, more than 100 Palestinians were killed, along with 13 Israeli soldiers, after the beginning of a ground incursion into Gaza.

Peace activists around the world have responded to the violence. On March 19, a large group gathered in front of the Old State House in Hartford. Among the groups participating were the Israel/Palestine Peace, Education and Action Group of N.E. Connecticut, based in Storrs, and the Students for Justice in Palestine group out of Uconn. ""From Monday, July 7, until Saturday, July 19, peace activists across Connecticut joined a global outcry to denounce the latest attack on Gaza, Palestine,"" said SJP spokesperson Adam Antar. Activists attempted to meet with U.S. senators Blumenthal and Murphy regarding cutting $3 billion of military aid to Israel. ""Despite a disciplined series of demonstrations and outreach to our representatives, they refused to address the Palestinian plight,"" said Antar ""While hundreds of civilian Palestinians are being murdered by American-made Israeli death machines, our same senators voted to give Israel more emergency aid,"" he continued. ""At the same time that our senators are so staunchly supporting murder with $7 million a day of American tax money, schools are shutting down around the state.

Patrol officer Jaime Yott, suspended for 60 days, has also filed a formal grievance regarding her suspension.

The town fired Worden and suspended Yott and another officer, Michael Emons, after an April 1 arrest resulted in allegations the officers used excessive force.

Worden and Yott argue in the grievance filings that they should be reinstated and compensated for any loss of wages.

Since the town denied Worden and Yott's requests, according to the town's human resource director Steven Bielenda, the appeals will go to the Department of Labor's State Board of Mediation and Arbitration.

Worden is named in a number of lawsuit notices filed with the town. The latest involves an incident on Christmas Day in 2012 when Worden and Yott responded to a home on a medical assistance call.

According to the notice, a family member of Tyler Damato's called police for assistance in having him transferred to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation.

Damato had been in a car accident a few months earlier and suffered a traumatic brain injury. Attorney A. Paul Spinella, who is representing the family, said police were told of Tyler's condition before they got to the house.

While waiting for an ambulance to arrive, Damato came out of the house and, Spinella said, ""was suddenly assaulted by Officer Worden who tackled Damato from behind, slamming his head into the curb several times.""

The notice, filed by Amie Olschafskie the adminstratix of Damato's estate, claims the injuries that Damato suffered from that incident helped lead to his death six weeks later. Damato died a few days after a second car accident in February 2013.

""But for the attack by Worden he would not have died a few months later,"" Spinella said. ""In my mind it is just another in long continuing series of cruel acts. This one is more shocking because it was Christmas Day right in front of the whole neighborhood.""

The Damato case is the ninth notice of intent to sue the town filed by Spinella alleging police brutality by Worden.

"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-iran-pratt-joint-strike-fighter-documents-20140702-story.html","Judge Refuses To Release Suspect In Iran Documents Case","BRIDGEPORT — A federal judge Wednesday denied a motion to release a former Pratt & Whitney engineer facing trial on charges of trying to send sensitive documents to Iran regarding the U.S. military's latest tactical aircraft, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

U.S. Magistrate Judge William I. Garfinkel concluded that the details of the case and the potential punishment for Mozaffar Khazaee, 59, render him too great a flight risk, even if he were to wear an electronic tracking bracelet and deposit $50,000 with the court's clerk.

Khazaee ""has very good reason to leave the country,"" Garfinkel said. ""In fact, it would almost be irrational for him not to attempt to leave, under the circumstances. … This is a case that the flight risk is way too high.""

In January, authorities arrested Khazaee at Newark International Airport in New Jersey as he was boarding a flight to Frankfurt, Germany, where he planned to connect to a flight to Tehran, Iran, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Connecticut. He was found with $60,000 in his carry-on — money prosecutors have seized and the defense says was to pay for medical care for Khazaee's mother in Iran.

Prosecutors said Wednesday that Khazaee could face up to 30 years in jail for more serious crimes that the government has yet to charge him with.

Defense attorney Hubert Santos, in arguing for Khazaee's release before trail, said holding him at the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, R.I., makes it difficult for Santos to meet with him about the highly technical engineering manuals and documents found among items Khazaee was shipping to Iran. The solution he proposed was to have Khazaee stay in an apartment in Greater Hartford, with a tracking device, and post $50,000 bail.

Prosecutors have offered to move Khazaee from Rhode Island to detention facilities in Connecticut, including Hartford and Bridgeport, which would be closer to Santos' offices.

In addition to the decision on pre-trial release, the hearing Wednesday gave Santos the chance to raise an issue he sees surfacing when the trial begins next year. Are the documents that were found among Khazaee's belongings in December decades old manuals with little value in the present, as Santos says, or are they, as the government contends, extremely sensitive plans for some of the military's latest technologies?

""A lot of this material is 40 years old,"" Santos said.

Government prosecutors described Khazaee as an extreme flight risk, unlikely to be deterred by an electronic bracelet and bail. Assistant U.S. Attorney Krishna Patel said the government's fear would be that Khazaee cuts the bracelet and escapes to Canada. There, he could enter an Iranian embassy, get a new passport and leave for Iran.

In a memo opposing Khazaee's request for release until his trial is expected to start next year, prosecutors said that Khazaee had, years earlier, emailed documents about the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to individuals at a university in Iran — in one case openly acknowledging the documents' inherent sensitivity.

The documents ""are very controlled … and I am taking a big risk,"" Khazaee wrote in the 2008 emails, the government said.

Prosecutors said Wednesday Khazaee appeared as if he would not be returning from his trip to Tehran. Agents searched his Indianapolis apartment, finding nothing but a mattress and a lamp, Patel said. He spoke in emails about wrapping up his life in the United States and needing only to figure out how to send a vehicle to Iran.

The defense argued that if Khazaee was itching to leave for good, he would not have left $60,000 in U.S. bank accounts.

Santos said Khazaee was looking for employment at a university in Iran because he was laid off from Pratt & Whitney in August. If prospects were good for a job there, he might have stayed. Otherwise he would have returned. ""He was not sure he wanted to stay in Iran,"" Santos said.

That, and visiting his sick mother, were reasons for his visit, Santos said. The documents made their way into his belongings because Khazaee would often work from home, he said.","2014-07-02 17:24:00","0","22.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","21.0","2.0","31.0","20.0","0.0","76.0","4.0","13.0","0","685","95.75","75.38","9.11","9.58","22.83","26.57","72.99","44.67","7.01","4.96","0.44","0.00","0.00","4.23","0.29","2.04","8.32","16.64","6.57","2.63","4.38","0.73","14.60","3.80","1.90","0.58","2.19","0.44","3.65","1.17","2.48","0.88","0.73","0.00","9.64","0.29","0.00","0.29","4.23","7.88","1.61","1.31","2.34","2.19","0.58","1.61","3.21","0.58","2.48","0.15","0.88","0.44","0.58","0.00","0.00","6.13","0.44","1.02","2.48","1.02","1.31","6.42","6.42","0.73","15.91","3.36","8.03","4.82","2.63","0.00","0.58","0.73","0.15","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.81","6.28","6.86","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.58","1.46","1.61","0.00","0.88","3269","7.95","24.103448275862068","1023","681","33","59.03","13.4","10.1","11.89","12.6","142","6.333333333333333","18.580675477239357","326","22.03","19","0.43","0","15","15","61","0","89","39","1","2","10","96","108","2","35","0","0","27","9","19","1","0","3","33","0","31","44","20","11","7","15","2","0","0","3"
"http://www.courant.com/community/middletown/hc-middletown-chris-lavoie-pension-1213-20141212-story.html","Middletown Board Delays Action On Officer's Disability Pension Request","MIDDLETOWN — The city's pension board has delayed action for a second time on a request from a fired former police officer to receive a disability retirement.

Former Officer Christopher Lavoie worked for the department for 16 years before he was terminated in February after the city said he violated the terms of a ""last chance"" agreement he signed in 2013.

He has said he filed a request for a disability pension because of on-duty back injuries he sustained over several years.

After a contentious debate Thursday that followed a lengthy executive session, the pension board voted to have Lavoie obtain an additional independent medical evaluation to determine whether he is permanently disabled.

That vote came after an initial vote to grant the disability pension resulted in a 3-3 tie.

Board members, including Mayor Daniel Drew who is on the pension board, argued over whether or not one of the two evaluations Lavoie provided had been tainted when the city provided the doctor with disciplinary records.

""The city should have sent medical records instead of personnel records,"" said Christine Bourne, one of the three who voted in favor of granting the pension. ""The city got involved where it shouldn't have gotten involved.""

Drew, who fired Lavoie in February, said the case is ""unprecedented"" and said he does not think the medical evaluations show that Lavoie is permanently disabled.

""I think we have some board members who are doctor-shopping on behalf of the applicant, and I think that's inappropriate,"" Drew said.

Lavoie's attorney, Andrew Houlding, argued that when the city sent disciplinary records, it supplied information that was irrelevant to a medical evaluation and that the personnel records could make a fair assessment impossible.

Councilwoman Sandra Russo-Driska, one of two council representatives on the pension board, said the board should be responsible for choosing the doctor who will perform the additional evaluation.

""Clearly the city can't handle it,"" Russo-Driska said. ""You don't send disciplinary records for a medical evaluation.""

Lavoie was one of four officers who filed complaints against Police Chief William McKenna last year accusing the chief of seeking prescription pain killers from police officers. A law firm hired by the city said in its investigation report that there was not enough evidence to support the claims of the officers.

Michael McAuliffe, the attorney who represents the city in a separate case concerning Lavoie's workers compensation, said no formal hearing has been scheduled to resolve the compensation claim.

""The issue is whether he is disabled to a point where he is entitled to workers compensation benefits,"" McAuliffe said.

He said it is unusual for a retirement request to be considered before a compensation claim is resolved. Officials have also said Lavoie's case is unusual because the pension board does not typically consider requests from employees who have been terminated.

The board in November approved a disability pension for Gino Pulvirenti, another officer who had been fired. The board determined in that case that Pulvirenti suffered an on-duty knee injury that left him unable to continue as a police officer, and found that the injury predated his termination.

The city fired Pulvirenti after he was videotaped working at his auto repair business while out on temporary disability leave. He is still fighting the termination and the workers compensation case is also pending.","2014-12-12 16:51:19","0","24.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","34.0","16.0","0.0","75.0","4.0","12.0","0","556","92.29","76.95","16.30","17.88","23.17","31.47","79.68","44.42","8.45","3.60","0.36","0.18","0.18","2.88","0.00","4.86","11.15","11.51","8.09","2.16","3.06","1.44","14.75","2.34","1.62","2.88","2.34","0.54","3.78","1.62","2.16","0.00","0.90","0.18","10.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.88","8.63","3.42","0.90","1.26","0.90","0.18","2.16","3.06","0.36","2.52","0.18","2.52","0.72","2.34","0.00","0.00","7.91","0.54","1.80","5.58","0.72","0.00","7.37","7.19","0.18","13.31","1.44","6.29","5.94","8.09","0.36","0.00","3.06","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.31","4.32","3.60","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.08","2.88","1.44","0.00","0.00","2848","8.47","23.5","878","551","24","48.13","14.7","12.3","14.16","15.3","129","13.0","20.564791288566244","253","21.04","4","0.43","0","6","12","66","0","64","37","0","0","5","103","45","0","32","0","1","22","3","12","0","0","1","11","0","17","48","10","21","11","19","4","9","0","4"
"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-lembo-caremark-pharmacy-benefits-20141017-story.html","Lembo: State's Pharmacy Benefits Expenses Could Have Been More","The cost of providing pharmacy benefits to state workers, retirees and their families increased from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014, but state Comptroller Kevin Lembo said in a statement Friday it could have been worse.

The state spent $345 million to provide pharmacy benefits to Connecticut workers and their beneficiaries during fiscal 2014, which ended June 30. That's up from $341 million the previous year.

However, Lembo said his office negotiated a better contract with Caremark for fiscal years 2014 to 2016 and saved about $50 million annually as a result. In other words, the pharmacy benefits would have cost $395 million for fiscal 2014 under the previous contract, according to Lembo's office.

""These savings — totaling approximately $50 million — directly resulted from aggressive renegotiation of our state contract,"" Lembo said in a statement. ""Strong and smart contract negotiations, backed up by innovative benefit designs that focus on preventive care and chronic care management, continue to bend the health-care cost trend in the right direction.""

Caremark, a division of CVS Health of Woonsocket, R.I., also had the previous state contract for pharmacy benefits. The state's medical coverage contract is with both Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Connecticut and Oxford, a division of UnitedHealthcare. The state contracts with Cigna Corp. for dental coverage.

The state had about 210,000 people on its medical-coverage plans as of March, which includes employee dependents and retirees.","2014-10-17 12:53:04","0","12.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","33.0","16.0","0.0","71.0","4.0","12.0","0","236","97.57","66.42","15.18","92.90","19.67","30.08","72.46","37.29","5.51","2.12","0.42","0.42","0.00","0.42","0.85","3.39","7.20","16.53","3.81","1.69","5.51","0.00","7.20","3.81","1.69","0.85","8.05","0.85","5.93","5.08","0.85","0.00","0.42","0.00","5.51","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.42","4.66","0.85","0.85","0.85","0.42","0.42","1.27","2.12","0.85","1.27","0.00","3.81","0.00","3.81","0.00","0.00","8.05","0.85","1.69","3.39","2.54","0.85","4.66","4.66","0.42","13.56","0.42","7.63","5.08","6.78","0.42","0.42","2.12","0.00","0.00","0.42","0.00","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.22","5.93","6.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.85","1.69","1.27","0.00","2.12","1232","8.78","21.727272727272727","384","234","13","53.21","13.5","10.3","14.32","13.5","63","8.6","19.96923076923077","135","20.55","3","0.37","0","9","19","19","0","30","18","2","0","2","43","27","0","19","0","0","2","5","6","0","0","1","7","0","4","12","3","4","1","2","4","0","0","0"
"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-larry-butler-climbing-back-20141123-story.html","Frustrating Job Search? This Lawmaker Can Relate","WATERBURY — State Rep. Larry Butler didn't intend to bare his soul when he got up to speak at the Platform to Employment graduation in October.

But his voice filled with emotion as he told the job seekers he knows how hard it is to tell your spouse: ""I've put in four or five hours today. Still, nothing.""

He said he knows how it feels to get to the third interview but still be passed over for the job.

Butler, like the people he spoke to, has been unable to find a job after a long search. He's been looking for more than three years.

His last job was with DST Output, a communications and IT outsourcing company, where he designed class-action checks, college savings plan statements and more. He worked there for more than six years before being laid off in March 2011.

""I just felt compelled to speak to them in that matter,"" he said later, reflecting on the speech he gave. He wanted them to know ""somebody in a policy-making decision capacity understands what you're going through.""

The DST job was a position he found after 10 months of searching, after losing his job as a consultant with Howard Systems International, a job he had for about 10 years, and the best-paying job of his career.

Butler knows mainframe computers and the computer languages that manage them. He worked in IT at Travelers and Cigna before becoming a consultant.

Butler was just re-elected to his fifth term in the Connecticut General Assembly, a part-time job that pays $32,000.

Although the state legislature has funded several programs designed to spur hiring of the long-term unemployed — including $3 million for Platform to Employment — Butler said he's never shared his struggles on the floor of the House.

""I support those initiatives, certainly,"" said Butler, a Democrat. ""I don't want to be defined by this. It's not really who I am.""

Butler said he doesn't think the demands on his time during the session are keeping him from getting hired. He said as a committee chairman, he can schedule meetings around his work. In the past, he used half-days of vacation during the session without any trouble.

""There are many people out there that have very similar skills to me,"" Butler said, and the number of jobs maintaining large mainframe systems in Connecticut has shrunk with globalization.

""A vast amount of our jobs in our area are being sent overseas,"" he said.

In fact, Butler said, one of the last job interviews he had was for a contract job to package work to send offshore. He laughed bitterly.

Butler, 60, said he thinks his age is working against him, even though when he's filling out online applications, he says he's willing to work for a salary in the $50,000s, about $20,000 less than his best wage, two jobs ago.

He worries about what pricing his skills so low says to employers. Do they think he's a bargain? Or that he must not be that good? He said he didn't really consider getting retrained in a more modern segment of information technology. He said he worried if he spent $10,000 on a Java or C++ course, he still wouldn't find a job.

And, he said, ""I spent a good portion of my retirement money just surviving."" Tens of thousands of dollars, he said.

After so many unsuccessful attempts at getting computer jobs, Butler has lowered his sights, applying for a cashier's job at CVS, Walgreens, Cumberland Farms and for a warehouse job at Sears.

In all, he estimates he's applied to more than 550 positions.

""It wasn't like I thought any other employment was beneath me,"" he said, but still he wasn't successful.

""A Cumberland Farms, they won't hire me,"" Butler said, because they know as soon as he finds a better job, he'll leave. He said the owner of one store told him that directly.

Butler's children are grown, and his wife works, but her job as a career counselor at Waterbury Adult Education was definitely the smaller paycheck in the household.

He said he's been blessed, because before he was laid off, they had been making extra payments to their mortgage. They were able to pay off the loan during the first year of his unemployment, when he was still getting unemployment checks.

""If I hadn't had accelerated payments to my mortgage prior to that, I would've lost my house,"" he said.

Butler said he thinks he could work his network to get a state job that would pay $40,000 or $50,000. But to do that, he'd have to resign his seat, which he's not willing to do.

""I know there are a lot of people out there that would like to apply their skills,"" he said, just as he would. ""Over 20 years of knowledge, experience goes to waste.""

Butler is considering trying to get a spot in Platform to Employment. About four of 10 of the most recent round of graduates have found work in the past two months.

"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-malloy-jobs-branford-1024-20141023-story.html","Genomics Research Lab Planned For Branford","The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is opening a satellite Genetic Testing Lab in Branford, in space formerly occupied by 454 Life Sciences.

The managing director of Mt. Sinai Testing Lab-Connecticut was vice president of research and development at 454, and the director of laboratory operations was the director of the sequencing center at 454.

The Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology announced the move in September, and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy toured the facility Thursday and talked about the government incentives offered to the medical school.

The Department of Economic and Community Development gave it a $9.5 million subsidized loan and, if the institute meets hiring projections and reaches a staff or 142 people over the next five years, $7.25 million of the loan will be forgiven.

454 Life Sciences, the DNA sequencing machine company that had occupied the space, employed about 200 people in 2007, when it was bought by Roche for $155 million. Roche announced a year ago that it would close and lay off 100 employees.

Glenn Farrell, a spokesman for the Icahn genomics institute, said Mt. Sinai has been working for months to renovate the former 454 space and has shipped equipment there. The facility has hired 10 people, and is recruiting for about 10 more, including entry-level technicians, early career technicians, a quality assurance professional, managers and an accessioning specialist. He said it should open in December.

Currently, the Genetic Testing Lab in New York employs about 100 people. The largest part of its work is doing genetic screening for couples planning to have a child. The lab also does more comprehensive screening for patients whose illness is a mystery and cancer target-specific gene testing.

The Institute had 340 employees at the end of last year in New York, including 188 staff, 87 professors and 65 post-doctorate researchers. It has been aggressively expanding in all those areas, and in its 2013 annual report, boasted of recruiting a Yale University professor. Mt. Sinai's medical school is ranked in the top 20 nationally, and its genetics specialty is ranked 15th.

In New York, it is exploring genetic markers in cancer, autism, schizophrenia, colitis and Crohn's disease, congenital heart disease and Alzheimer's.

It outgrew its testing lab space in New York, and Farrell said New York City is a difficult place to find affordable space where you can expand quickly.

Mt. Sinai looked on Long Island, in New Jersey and in Stamford before choosing Branford.

This spot was appealing for a number of reasons: the building had previously contained lab space, there's space for more expansion if needed, and, with Yale nearby, there's ""local biomedical expertise."" The new lab will occupy 16,500 square feet.

And, of course, the state money. ""DECD was fantastic, the support they gave us was truly phenomenal,"" Farrell said.

He declined to say how much Mt. Sinai spent on the new lab except to say it's tens of millions of dollars.

The Malloy administration said the subsidy is part of the state's strategic economic development plan to target the bioscience industry.

""The addition of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai facility in the state is another big win in our long range plan to strengthen and expand our bioscience sector,"" said DECD Commissioner Catherine Smith. ""We are creating a critical mass of industry leaders in the state — great organizations like Yale, UConn Health, Jackson Labs and now, Mount Sinai. The interplay between these important and growing industry players will help create a robust ecosystem that will help drive Connecticut's economy for decades to come.""

The director of the Institute said Mt. Sinai hopes to collaborate with UConn Health, Jackson Laboratory in Farmington, and Yale.","2014-10-23 17:17:01","0","23.0","3.0","3.0","0.0","25.0","0.0","36.0","19.0","0.0","81.0","4.0","13.0","0","621","95.79","71.89","18.50","56.17","17.25","28.18","73.91","38.49","4.51","1.29","0.00","0.64","0.16","0.32","0.16","3.22","8.86","13.04","6.44","2.09","5.15","0.00","12.08","4.03","1.45","0.64","4.51","1.29","2.58","2.09","0.48","0.00","0.32","0.00","5.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","3.54","0.97","0.64","0.97","0.81","0.64","0.64","1.93","0.32","1.61","0.00","3.06","0.32","2.58","0.00","0.00","8.37","1.45","2.25","4.99","0.48","0.16","5.31","5.64","1.13","15.30","0.97","9.18","5.15","10.63","0.00","0.16","1.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.59","5.80","6.92","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.64","1.29","1.29","0.00","0.48","3079","8.63","18.02857142857143","947","617","35","62.07","12.9","9.0","12.64","11.9","161","7.416666666666666","19.477601296596436","328","16.6","4","0.38","0","27","29","59","0","71","41","2","1","7","104","102","2","31","1","0","14","6","11","1","0","1","10","0","20","30","19","12","2","20","2","0","1","3"
"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-median-income-tolland-economy-plus-20140917-story.html","Middle-Class Earnings Continue To Stagnate In CT, Census Figures Show","VERNON — The middle class in Connecticut and the country was clobbered in 2009 and 2010 — and while those wounds haven't gotten deeper, they haven't healed yet, either.

Much of the pain is hidden. As Pete Pusztai said Wednesday afternoon, ""You drive around South Windsor, people are driving nice cars, everybody has a nice phone.""

So, the South Windsor resident said, the bad economy is like a low-level headache that lasts for days, so long that it starts to seem normal.

""I think people are numb to it, and I think people are just doing what they can to get by.""

However, annual U.S. Census surveys — the largest questionnaire in the country — bring the struggles of the middle class into focus.

The typical Connecticut household — right in the center of the income distribution — earned about $67,000 last year, about $5,000 less annually than in 2009, according to Census figures released Thursday.

And while New London County is the only place where median incomes fell from 2012 to 2013, that doesn't mean the rest of the state is bouncing back.

The median income is below where it was in 2009 in Fairfield, Hartford, New Haven, New London and Tolland counties, and, the data show, in Tolland, it continued to fall in 2011 and 2012 before finally stabilizing last year.

Why does the median income fall? It can be that one spouse loses a job and finds a new one, but the new one pays far less or is only part time. One 55-year-old Vernon man, too embarrassed to tell his story in full, admitted that the job he started in July pays 60 percent less than his previous supervisory job he lost in February.

Pusztai said he knew four people who lost their jobs during the Great Recession. Two, in their 60s, never worked again, though they had not planned to retire so young. He said the other two, one who was a computer programmer, and one who worked at an insurance company, went from well-paying, full-time jobs to 20- to 30-hour-a-week low wage jobs, one in home health care, one in a restaurant.

It can also be that employees keep their jobs, but overtime evaporates.

Eryn Gilligan of Stafford said that's what happened to one of her relatives who's a machinist. He used to get overtime all the time, she said. ""It made a difference in his income.""

Gilligan, a single mother of three teenagers, has worked for the state for 31 years. She hasn't seen a big cut in pay like some, but inflation is slowly eating away at her standard of living. She just had her first raise in three years, and that 3 percent raise immediately went toward a higher contribution to her pension, she said.

She said she feels the economy is not improving: ""Prices continue to rise, and it's just hard to make ends meet.""

Connecticut is no different from most of the country in this regard. The last time the middle class received raises that outpaced inflation was in the late 1990s.

Oscar Santiago of Hartford remembered those years fondly. Santiago, who was shopping at Kmart in Vernon with his 1-year-old son in the shopping cart, used to wash cars back then, and earned $125 a day. Now, he said, he earns $68 a day working in a warehouse. He started the job six months ago, moving from another warehouse job that paid the same minimum wage, but was a temp job.

""Bill Clinton was the best president,"" he said in Spanish.

While the median income drops because of what happens in the middle class, the ranks of the working poor are swelling, too. In Vernon, the proportion of children that qualify for free or reduced-price lunch have swelled from 23.9 percent at the end of the 2005-06 school year to 41.7 percent at the end of the most recent school year.

To qualify for a reduced-price public school lunch, a family of four must earn no more than $44,123.

The median household income can also fall because people can't get into the workforce after having staying home with a child, or can't land a first job.

Gilligan said her younger two daughters, 17 and 16, decided not to play sports this fall so they could have time to work, but neither has been able to find a job.

Gilligan's friend Kim Post, also of Stafford, was listening in the Kmart aisle as Gilligan talked about how the recession affected her family. ""We have grown adults that are doing the jobs now the teenagers used to do,"" Post said.","2014-09-18 11:19:37","0","28.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","26.0","0.0","31.0","15.0","0.0","85.0","4.0","13.0","0","780","87.36","70.94","56.97","25.77","21.08","15.90","86.03","45.90","9.10","4.62","0.26","0.13","0.13","3.21","0.90","4.49","8.97","13.21","6.41","4.36","5.13","1.67","14.36","6.41","3.85","1.54","6.28","2.18","2.82","1.41","1.41","0.26","0.00","0.64","10.51","0.90","0.13","1.79","1.92","7.18","1.54","1.28","0.26","0.90","0.51","3.33","2.56","0.38","1.79","0.38","1.54","0.00","1.03","0.00","0.51","6.41","0.90","2.56","2.31","1.28","0.26","6.79","7.82","0.13","20.38","2.18","9.49","9.23","7.82","0.90","0.90","4.10","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","18.33","4.87","7.95","0.13","0.00","0.13","0.00","1.79","1.54","1.28","0.00","0.64","3368","6.95","21.43243243243243","1022","770","40","77.27","10.3","7.3","9.52","10.0","115","8.7","15.694025974025976","384","19.05","5","0.45","0","22","50","79","0","96","53","6","3","8","118","55","0","38","1","0","32","12","35","0","1","1","22","0","26","49","15","14","17","23","5","8","0","4"
"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-medical-marijuana-growers-connecticut-20140817-story.html","Connecticut Growers Tending Marijuana Crops, Preparing For Sales Starting In September","For months, Advanced Grow Labs LLC — one of Connecticut's four medical marijuana growing companies — slogged through the process of competing for a state license, securing local zoning approvals, and outfitting a building to state regulations that are as a tough as those at any pharmaceutical manufacturer.

Now, managing partner David Lipton knows his West Haven company is getting close: He planted his first marijuana seeds almost three weeks ago.

""I did my own tray, the D.L. tray,"" Lipton said last week. ""My tray is looking pretty good; they're about 3 or 4 inches high now. Finally, we're not just buying stuff, we're dealing with something that grows.""

Nearly two years after the state legalized it, the first medical marijuana is expected to go on sale next month. About 2,000 residents with qualifying chronic illnesses have registered with the state and with one of Connecticut's six dispensaries.

The four medical marijuana manufacturers are at varying stages of growing pot. It remains unclear which company will be the first to market, turning the raw plant into medicine that is smoked, used in a vaporizer, eaten or rubbed on.

Connecticut's six licensed dispensaries have fielded calls from potential clients for months, and at least one has passed the final state inspection and is consulting with clients to map out treatment plans with pharmacists on its staff.

In South Windsor, Prime Wellness of Connecticut last week met with as many as 50 people suffering with some of the 11 illnesses covered under the law.

""There are patients that are really, really in need, and so they have been waiting for two years,"" said Tom Nicholas, chief executive of the Prime Wellness dispensary. ""We're almost at the end of the tunnel, but not quite.""

The passage of the law in Connecticut did not come without controversy. Opponents raised concerns that once the medicinal marijuana left the dispensary, it could get into hands of those for whom it wasn't intended.

Pro-medical marijuana groups now say they are thrilled that pot will soon be available for the sick. But they also are worried that the state's stringent regulations — including on that requires every batch of processed marijuana be tested for purity — will drive up costs and make it unaffordable for some, at least at first.

As exciting as it is watching his tray of plants grow, Lipton said he doesn't have much time to relax.

AGL's manufacturing plant on Frontage Road is still under construction, with the plants growing only in a small, state-approved test area. He knows he won't be the first supplier to dispensaries but he wants to have his marijuana in all six. He's coming up against three competitors: Connecticut Pharmaceutical Solutions LLC in Portland, Curaleaf LLC in Simsbury and Theraplant LLC in Watertown.

""Until we are out there selling and bringing in revenues,"" Lipton said, ""we're not out of the woods.""

Prices To Be Determined

When the state legislature legalized medical marijuana in 2012, it ended a wide-ranging sale ban in Connecticut that dated back more than 80 years.

Regulations written by the state Department of Consumer Protection allow a broad array of products — including what can be smoked; tinctures, creams, and oils; and baked goods, such as brownies, bars and cookies. Marijuana-infused beverages and candy are not permitted under the regulations.

Before a patient can register with the state, a doctor must certify that he or she has a qualifying chronic condition with symptoms that could be eased by marijuana The doctor also certifies how much marijuana the patient is allowed a month, with a maximum of 2.5 ounces. Then a plan of treatment is worked out with the pharmacist in a consultation at the dispensary.

What isn't yet known is how much the medical marijuana will cost users, with growers saying it is still too early to predict their pricing to the retail dispensaries. The costs are all out-of-pocket to the patient because medical marijuana is not covered by insurance.

""It really depends on the market and the regulations,"" said Chris Walsh, editor of Marijuana Business Daily, based in Rhode Island. ""Connecticut is probably going to be higher. It costs a lot more to get started there than in other states.""

In Maine, the wholesale cost for a gram of medical marijuana ranges from $6.50 to $8.50 and rises to $12 to $13 when it is sold to patients, Walsh said.

The website priceofweed.com, which compiles user-reported entries anonymously for marijuana purchased on the street, gives a current range of $250 to $340 an ounce in Connecticut, depending on quality. Based on 28 grams in an ounce, that would be roughly $9 to $12 a gram.

""We expect once the program is fully operational and all producers and dispensary facilities are up and running, competition within the program will provide medical patients with better medicinal quality products and better pricing than the black market,"" said William M. Rubenstein, Connecticut's commissioner of consumer protection, which oversees the state's medical marijuana program.

Machinery, Security

The three manufacturers now growing marijuana — AGL, Curaleaf and Theraplant — declined requests by The Courant to visit the actual areas where plants are growing. The state must approve any outside visitors, but the growers make the ultimate decision on who they allow in.

Each company described similar components in the manufacturing process: flowering rooms with dozens of grow lights; a room with ""mother"" plants used for clippings and breeding new strains; harvesting and drying rooms; a room to store ground-up buds while batches are independently tested; extraction rooms; commercial kitchens; and packaging areas and storage vaults.

Each company has a research and development operation to develop new strains to treat the symptoms of illnesses that one day may qualify for medical marijuana treatment — and perhaps, one suggested, lead to cures for illnesses.

The start-up costs were considerable. Each raised $6 million to $10 million from private investors, including $2 million for a state-mandated escrow account intended to ensure companies got up-and-running quickly. Initially, the companies will have between 15 and 30 employees.

At Simsbury's Curaleaf, equipment cost about $2 million, a third of the $6 million raised to start production.

""Extraction equipment is extremely expensive,"" April Arrasate, Curaleaf's founder and chief operating officer, said. ""We have an entire extraction department to isolate the desired compounds, and we reformulate them together in rations that make sense for qualifying conditions.""","2014-08-17 00:00:00","0","70.0","14.0","3.0","0.0","24.0","0.0","37.0","21.0","0.0","84.0","4.0","13.0","0","1073","93.86","60.66","20.38","46.37","22.35","28.98","79.50","43.80","6.24","2.70","0.28","0.75","0.00","1.12","0.56","3.54","7.64","15.94","6.62","3.54","5.03","1.03","12.67","3.36","1.86","1.12","5.03","2.05","2.33","1.68","0.56","0.28","0.00","0.19","5.50","0.09","0.09","0.19","1.03","8.20","0.65","2.33","0.93","1.96","0.84","2.24","1.68","0.37","0.93","0.19","4.29","0.09","3.36","0.00","0.84","7.18","1.12","1.77","3.63","0.93","0.37","2.80","7.55","1.77","14.91","2.05","7.83","5.31","6.80","2.70","0.75","2.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.89","4.66","5.78","0.28","0.84","0.00","0.00","1.12","2.24","1.77","0.00","1.21","5345","8.22","23.319148936170212","1656","1067","51","50.26","13.8","11.4","13.17","13.8","240","7.583333333333334","19.35718837863168","521","21.34","10","0.43","0","36","48","96","2","136","75","5","2","14","148","75","1","99","0","0","34","7","55","0","0","5","28","0","34","34","41","34","29","35","13","4","0","5"

The organization, based in New Haven, also said it will match an additional $500,000 donated by the public to the K of C Christian Refugee Relief fund.

""The unprovoked and systematic persecution and violent elimination of Middle East Christians, as well as other minority groups, especially in Iraq, has created an enormous humanitarian crisis,"" said Supreme Knight Carl Anderson.

Donations can be made by visiting http://www.kofc.org/Iraq or by sending checks or money orders to: K of C Christian Refugee Relief, Knights of Columbus Charities, P.O. Box 1966, New Haven, CT 06509-1966. The organization said 100 percent of the donations will go toward humanitarian assistance.

Tens of thousands of Christians have fled to Irbil, the Kurdish capital now being protected by airstrikes authorized last week by President Obama. In Mosul, the center of a Christian community for centuries, Islamic State militants destroyed churches and confiscated homes of Christians.

The Knights donated a record $170 million to charity in 2013. The donations come in part from revenues generated by insurance sold by the Knights.

The program, ""Remembering the Fall of the Berlin Wall: 25 Years Later,"" is free and open to the public, and will run from Noon to 2 p.m. in the Michael J. Adanti Student Center, Grand Ballroom.

The wall's demolition on Nov. 9, 1989, marked one of the final moments of the Cold War. It had divided East and West Berlin for 28 years, as well as having been a tangible symbol of Soviet oppression of Eastern Europe.

Burns was involved in the discussions on Berlin and Germany before and during the time that the wall came down. In 1990, he was appointed by President George H.W. Bush to the National Security Council, a post he would hold until 1995, effectively bridging the administrations of Bush and President Clinton. He would later serve as undersecretary of state for political affairs under President George W. Bush, the third highest post in the State Department. Today, he is a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.

Burns will discuss what the Bush Administration and the State Department were thinking during the lead-up to the fall, as well as how they addressed the situation before and after the wall came down.

A panel discussion will follow the keynote and is scheduled to include Troy Paddock, chairman of the SCSU History Department and an expert on German history; Kevin Buterbaugh, SCSU professor of political science and an international relations specialist; Stephen Breese, dean of the SCSU School of Arts & Sciences who lived in West Germany in 1989; and Eileen Kane, assistant professor of history at Connecticut College, where she specializes in modern Soviet/Russian history.

Video clips of major historical milestones pertaining to the fall will be shown. A question-and-answer period will follow the panel discussion.

"http://www.courant.com/community/new-london-edition/rnw-jc-p2-fusion-paperboard-plant-closing-0808-20140804-story.html","First Selectwoman says Fusion Paperboard's closure is 'investment' decision by owners","The blow that struck the town of Sprague two weeks ago reads like the script of a Hollywood drama, except the events in this little town are all too real.

Workers at Fusion Paperboard in the Versailles section of Sprague were told on July 23 that they will be out of a job by September.

On July 24, Fusion Paperboard filed notice with the state Department of Labor that 145 jobs will be eliminated when the plant closes on Sept. 22. The town will also lose about $250,000 in annual tax revenue.

According to Sprague First Selectman Cathy Osten, the owners of Fusion Paperboard – an investment firm called OpenGate Capital – is closing the Sprague plant in order to boost profits for another company it owns, a Paperworks Industries plant in Wabash, Indiana.

OpenGate Capital purchased Fusion – formerly known as Cascades – in 2011.

Since then, management has made millions of dollars of capital improvements and has formed a close and cooperative working relationship with the town of Sprague. That's why the closure is such a shock, Osten said.

Osten, a Democrat in her seventh year as first selectman who also is a state senator representing Sprague, said she has enjoyed a positive relationship with Fusion's management for the last six years. ""I was able to help resolve a tax appeal case"" that resulted in a $124,000 tax rebate, Osten said.

The town also was able to reach an agreement to reduce permit fees for a roof construction project by $50,000.

The town also intervened on Fusion's behalf to keep utility costs down, Osten said.

Most recently, the town supported Fusion's application for a $2 million loan from the state Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD). According to an April press release, these funds were earmarked for repairs to the plant's machine that processes recycled paper and the turbine that generates power for its operation.

However, OpenGate sold the equipment to Paperworks, and by doing so, made it impossible for Fusion to continue to operate, Osten said. The owners' goal, Osten said, appears to be to remove Fusion's share of paperboard products from the marketplace in order to boost Paperworks' market share.

The $2 million DECD loan was supposed to help Fusion not only retain its full workforce, but create 20 new jobs by 2016. One of the stipulations of the loan is the recipient must continue to do business in Connecticut for at least 10 years. Fusion will now be required to begin repaying the loan immediately and will be assessed a penalty.

""It was heart-wrenching to walk into the plant after getting the news... both management and the workers were shell-shocked,"" Osten said.

Her response was to reach out for as much help as possible for the employees. ""The first day, when I heard about it, I was at the plant within 10 minutes. Then I called the governor's office, Congressman Courtney, the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board... we all started brainstorming ways to provide options for the workers,"" Osten said.

She also contacted local agencies involved in attracting and retaining businesses, including the Norwich Community Development Corp., the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce and others who might help the workers who come from 31 towns, Osten said.

On July 25, a ""Rapid Response"" team from the Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board was already at the plant, Osten said.

According to an update she received from the team's leader, John Beauregard, employees will receive counseling on searching for new jobs, but the agency is also working with Fusion management on a petition for funds for job training from the U.S. Department of Labor, known as Trade Adjustment Assistance.

The agency plans to ask help from the Eastern Advanced Manufacturing Alliance with placing Fusion employees with member companies. The update states, ""This initiative was appreciated by Fusion and they are working on how to best represent the skillsets they possess in-house so would-be employers can match up.""

In the meantime, Osten said she's already received several calls from potential buyers for the plant's real estate, and she is putting them in touch with the consultant hired by OpenGate to supervise the plant's ""disbursement.""

Commenting on the grievance filed last week by United Steelworkers Local 1840, which represents Fusion Paperboard employees, Osten said, ""This is a normal part of the process in these cases, to protect the interests of the workers... such as what will happen to their health benefits, their retirement funds.""

Calls to OpenGate Capital were not returned, and an email inviting response to comments in this story was not answered.","2014-08-14 09:22:50","1","27.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","36.0","20.0","0.0","79.0","4.0","13.0","0","769","97.65","74.65","17.85","52.61","21.97","26.66","78.67","43.56","5.72","2.34","0.52","0.13","0.00","0.91","0.78","3.38","10.01","16.91","5.98","2.99","4.42","0.39","11.05","2.47","1.69","1.17","3.90","1.30","2.47","1.95","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.26","8.58","0.00","0.00","0.91","0.00","5.59","0.91","1.82","0.39","0.91","0.52","1.17","2.21","0.26","1.69","0.26","0.65","0.26","0.39","0.00","0.00","9.49","2.21","3.51","4.94","0.91","0.26","5.59","4.81","1.56","14.17","1.43","7.02","5.85","10.66","0.39","0.13","3.64","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.78","5.72","6.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.52","1.82","1.69","0.26","0.65","3755","8.28","25.193548387096776","1158","766","36","58.32","13.0","10.4","12.47","13.4","174","8.6","19.606161879895566","374","22.94","8","0.42","0","14","25","87","2","99","32","0","2","11","117","110","1","48","0","0","19","6","25","0","0","3","28","0","34","40","21","20","6","18","5","4","0","4"

"http://www.courant.com/community/rnw-all-1016-ebola-20141009-story.html","What do we know about Ebola, and what are we doing about it?","Until Thomas Eric Duncan died in a Dallas hospital at 7:51 a.m. on Oct. 8, the Ebola virus was, for most Americans, a hideous disease that happened to people somewhere else. Duncan's death on U.S. soil made it personal. It punctuated earlier calls from President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to unite the world's people against the virulent disease that has recently killed almost 4,000 people in West Africa.

According to Dr. Yaw A. Nsiah, a professor of biology at Eastern Connecticut State University who runs a NGO (non-governmental organization) clinic in Ghana, the best weapons against Ebola are prevention and control. Information is critical to both.

""Those people in Texas didn't follow the instructions,"" Nsiah said the Wednesday morning that Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian succumbed to Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. ""He knew he was sick, he told them he was just back from West Africa, but nobody paid any attention to the information.""

Calling the fact that Duncan was originally sent home from the hospital ""unpardonable,"" Nsiah added that the protocol followed after his diagnosis was just as faulty. ""First they left the people [his fiancée Louise Troh, her son and two nephews who he had shared an apartment with] in the apartment for three or four days before quarantining them..and they didn't think they needed to move these people into another area and decontaminate the apartment until 10 days later,"" he said.

Nsiah, a native of Ghana who has lived in the U.S. for the past 14 years, explained that West African countries like Sierra Leone have been through multiple civil wars and have a very elementary health system and no good way to handle the outbreak. ""That is how these diseases spread,"" he said. ""Here, we have one of the best health care systems in the world, although also one of the most expensive, so we can control it.""

Gov. Dannel Malloy declared Ebola to be a ""public health emergency"" on Oct. 7, signing an order empowering Dept. of Public Health Commissioner Jewel Mullen to prepare the state's health services to deal with the virus should a case present itself here. He said that the state Dept. of Public Health has been closely monitoring the epidemic and ""has sent regular Ebola-related updates and guidance to medical professionals, local health directors, hospitals and emergency medical service providers."" Further, Malloy said that hospitals have been asked to complete a detailed checklist for Ebola preparedness.

""Literally, all hospitals in this country – including Connecticut – have to have at least an isolation unit and complete apartment within the hospital to have ready, because they never know when something like that is going to [happen],"" said Nsiah.

Nsiah said the incubation period for Ebola is 2 to 21 days, with 8 to 10 days being the average. ""If you are not showing symptoms, you are not contagious,"" he elaborated, adding that in order to contract the disease from someone who is infected, ""there must be close physical contact with body fluids like saliva, blood - especially blood - urine or sweat."" If a person who has been exposed to Ebola is monitored for 21 days and exhibits no measurable symptoms and is ""still standing"" at that point, they are out of the woods, said Nsiah.

Symptoms of the disease include fever higher than 101.5 degrees F, severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain and unexplained bleeding or bruising. The fact that most of these symptoms occur with forms of influenza can make it difficult to diagnose, said Nsiah.

""We have learned some lessons...in terms of what happened in Dallas,"" Obama told the nation last week. ""We don't have a lot of margin for error. The procedures and protocols that are put in place must be followed.""

According to USA Today, Duncan was being treated with what officials at Dallas Presbyterian described as an ""investigational medicine"" called brincidofovir, which has not been tested in humans and required special permission from the Food and Drug Administration.

Other experimental medicines that have been used against Ebola in this country include Zmapp, which contains man-made antibodies against Ebola and TKM-Ebola. Zmapp was administered to American health care workers Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who were treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and recovered. According to an AP report, the drug was made in small quantities and there are no more supplies of it at this time. Dr. Rick Sacra was released from Nebraska Medical Center after being treated with TKM-Ebola and two blood transfusions from another American aid worker who recovered from Ebola at an Atlanta hospital.

Drug companies in the U.S. and Europe have started gearing up, said Nsiah, but it takes time for a new drug delivery to occur. He also sees a potential vaccine being developed in the future.

In the meantime, caution and careful handling is what keeps the disease from spreading. Two Yale doctoral students who went to Liberia in order to help the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare monitor the disease have returned home and voluntarily sequestered themselves for three weeks, even though they are not exhibiting symptoms of the Ebola virus. In Texas, Troh and her family are quarantined and receiving daily blood tests and temperature monitoring. All people known to have had contact with Duncan have been interviewed and some of them have also been isolated for observation.

Probably the most difficult precaution had to do with Duncan's final arrangements. Because the body is still infectious post mortem, CDC guidelines require the body to be wrapped in a plastic shroud with all tubes and IV lines intact and then placed into two leak-proof zippered bags before being placed in an airtight casket and either buried or cremated, without embalming. The restrictions run counter to West African funeral rituals which traditionally involve family members handling the corpse, and that is one of the reasons that the disease spreads so rapidly in those communities. Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said that Duncan's family cooperated with all his recommendations and had agreed to cremation, which according to the CDC kills the virus so that Duncan's ashes can be returned to the family.","2014-10-09 12:33:00","0","24.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","25.0","0.0","41.0","21.0","0.0","82.0","4.0","13.0","0","1048","87.37","71.65","12.59","17.45","22.78","25.19","77.96","44.56","8.30","2.96","0.00","0.38","0.19","1.43","0.95","5.25","7.25","13.74","7.73","2.48","5.73","1.24","12.60","3.15","2.29","1.62","2.48","2.10","2.39","0.86","1.43","0.00","0.48","0.19","8.78","0.57","0.19","0.19","1.53","7.44","1.34","1.05","0.57","1.91","1.24","2.39","1.62","0.29","1.05","0.19","7.16","1.24","5.92","0.00","0.10","4.87","1.43","0.76","2.19","0.57","0.57","6.39","6.30","0.57","12.40","1.24","6.58","4.39","3.53","0.57","0.95","0.29","0.38","1.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.70","5.92","5.44","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.95","2.86","0.86","0.19","0.38","5114","8.39","25.261904761904763","1586","1037","51","59.33","12.5","10.0","12.53","12.9","246","6.214285714285714","19.608910318225654","515","23.0","16","0.44","0","41","26","99","0","126","60","2","5","6","142","146","1","66","1","0","34","5","33","1","2","1","34","0","22","51","28","45","33","26","10","11","0","2"

Restaurant at the Pan Pacific Vancouver hotel. An in-house restaurant at a hotel is a must if you want to trim your travel expenses.

Not every hotel has a pillow butler or tanning assistant on staff, but there are certain amenities travellers have come to expect with their accommodations.

Not every hotel has a pillow butler or tanning assistant on staff, but there are certain amenities travellers have come to expect with their accommodations.

Hotels.com recently surveyed 1,000 people to rank 33 different hotel amenities to determine which were the most important to guests.

The most desired amenities that made the top of the list are:

1. Complimentary breakfast

It’s nice to be a member of parliament who can afford $16 glasses of orange juice when you travel. But most travellers — especially those vacationing with families — look to save a bit of cash by seeking hotels that offer free breakfasts.

2. Restaurant

Not every hotel is surrounded with a choice of nearby dining establishments. Consider your average airport hotel or something that is on the outskirts of town. If you need to hire a taxi to go out for a meal, eating out becomes even more expensive. An in-house restaurant is a must. It also doesn’t hurt if the restaurant has an attached bar.

3. Internet and free Wi-Fi

A hotel room without Internet access is like having no bed. It is an amenity that guests expect so not having it can be a deal breaker for many. Mid-range and budget hotels often give free wireless access to their guests, but some higher-end places, especially those catering to business travellers with expense accounts, still charge for access.

4. Parking

Having a place to park your car, whether it be for free or at an affordable fee, is a godsend for travellers with their own vehicle. In some cities, you can end up spending more money parking your car off-site than you will for your hotel room.

5. 24-hour front desk service

When the toilet overflows at 3 a.m. or some other emergency arises outside of normal working hours, it’s reassuring to know there is hotel staff on hand. Having 24-hour service at the front desk seems like something every hotel should have, but you’d be surprised how many don’t.","2014-05-05 00:00:00","1","2.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","159.0","179.0","0.0","74.0","1.0","4.0","1","416","79.16","56.69","20.73","81.93","16.00","19.47","83.89","47.60","8.17","3.85","0.00","0.00","2.88","0.00","0.96","4.33","7.21","13.70","10.82","3.37","5.53","2.16","15.14","5.05","3.12","1.68","3.12","4.33","3.61","3.37","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","6.49","0.24","0.72","0.00","0.00","14.90","1.68","0.72","3.12","4.81","2.64","5.53","1.20","0.72","0.00","0.48","3.12","0.24","0.00","0.00","2.88","4.81","0.72","0.72","2.40","0.96","0.48","0.48","11.30","0.96","12.02","1.68","7.69","2.64","3.37","6.49","1.92","3.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.42","6.73","3.12","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.16","0.00","1.68","0.00","0.48","1891","7.2","16.92","573","405","22","69.72","9.6","8.1","11.14","10.9","68","9.0","16.076049382716047","218","16.32","1","0.47","0","13","13","40","0","44","30","2","1","8","81","17","0","27","0","0","13","9","13","1","2","3","14","0","21","4","16","4","17","17","5","1","0","4"

With so much sprinting throughout a match and training, it’s easily one of the most common injuries in soccer.

A hamstring strain (pulled hamstring) is a tear of the muscle located in the back of your leg. With so much sprinting throughout a match and training, it’s easily one of the most common injuries in soccer.

The vulnerable time for hamstrings is prior to the foot striking the ground. At this stage, the muscles are maximally activated and are approaching their maximum length. A strain can also occur when pushing off to sprint, as the explosive movement recruits all the power of the hamstring muscles.

While sometimes this type of injury can happen to some of the fittest players in the game, an essential reminder is to always warm up correctly and completely.

The hamstring group comprises three muscles at the back of the thigh, which bend the knee and extend the hip.

Like groin injuries, hamstring strains are evaluated according to severity by grades. Grade 1 (mild) consists of minor tears within the muscle. Grade 2 (moderate) is a partial tear. Grade 3 (severe) is a complete rupture.

It’s important that this injury be managed conservatively, as a mismanaged hamstring pull can be one of those slow-healing, nagging injuries. The first couple of days post-injury are truly important. The PIER principle is helpful to control inflammation. Pressure: compress the area; Ice: 10-20 minutes every two hours for the first 48-72 hours; Elevation: encouraging blood flow away from the injured area; and Rest: resting from any activity that can cause any pain to the hamstring.

With this type of injury, the athlete should visit a therapist with experience in sports injuries to assist with an evaluation. This allows the injury concern to be treated properly, giving the player the best opportunity to return to play in a safe manner.

Peter Kent/Facebook

Voters in B.C. continued to turn up the heat on their participation in municipal elections but there’s nowhere the results were hotter Saturday than in Squamish. Preliminary and unofficial results from CivicInfoBC. the co-operative information service, had voter turnout around the province up to 33.3 per cent of eligible voters, although that didn’t include regional districts, the Islands Trust and school districts. The total represents a significant improvement from the 29.5 per cent turnout in 2011 and the 28.9 per cent in 2008.

Voters in B.C. continued to turn up the heat on their participation in municipal elections but there’s nowhere the results were hotter Saturday than in Squamish.

Preliminary and unofficial results from CivicInfoBC. the co-operative information service, had voter turnout around the province up to 33.3 per cent of eligible voters, although that didn’t include regional districts, the Islands Trust and school districts. The total represents a significant improvement from the 29.5 per cent turnout in 2011 and the 28.9 per cent in 2008.

The turnout in the Sea To Sky community of Squamish was well above that at 44.5 per cent, torching the 2011 turnout of 41.2.

Eyes are now on council candidate Peter Kent, who used to be a stunt double for action star Arnold Schwarzenegger; inspired by the youth-vote promotion appeal RockTheVote, Kent made a pledge in a YouTube video to torch himself if the community could beat that 2011 percentage.

Kent finished fifth among the six victorious Squamish councillors. But just because he’s got a new job doesn’t mean he’s going to back away from his promise.

“I have to speak to the district,” said Kent, 57, of getting permission for turning himself into a human torch.

He’s not at all concerned about the stunt.

“I’ve been a stunt man professionally for about 30 years,” he said. “I’ve done it a few times.”

He’s also lit other people on fire as part of his Peter Kent School of Hard Knocks stunt school.

“I’ve probably lit 120 students and never burned a one of them,” said Kent.

But as fiery as his fun may be, Kent is a lot hotter about the reaction it drew.

“It appealed to the youth demographic, the demographic that is so disenfranchised,” he said. “They have a demographic that generally doesn’t vote: ‘Well, what’s the point? Nothing will ever change, my voice will never be heard.’”

The challenge to vote, which he also made to other municipalities and councillors, “apparently worked,” said Kent.

Whether it was nice weather or local issues, turnout around B.C. was up enough to drive the provincial average higher.

Little Zeballos, a village of less that 200 inhabitants on north Vancouver Island, may have had the highest turnout at 87.25 per cent while the District of Stewart was at 83.2 per cent.

Fort St. John may have had the worst turnout at 15.2 per cent.

Election fever wasn’t really burning in Langley, either. Just 20.9 per cent of voters marked a ballot in Langley City, although the Township was at a more respectable 29.9 per cent.

But much of the attention around the province was drawn to B.C.’s biggest city, where the forecast was for a race between incumbent Vision Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson and challenger Kirk LaPointe of the Non-Partisan Association.

A chastened Robertson apologized to voters in the last week of the campaign for not paying enough attention to their concerns and he managed to hold off LaPointe by more than 10,000 votes. The incumbent scored a tally of 83,529 votes, beating out the political newcomer’s 73,443.

The mayoral duel attracted an estimated turnout of 44 per cent, far better than the goal of 40 per cent and significantly higher than the 35 per cent that bothered to cast a ballot in 2011 when Robertson cruised past NPA opponent Suzanne Anton.

Robertson was the top vote-getter, maybe because of his apology, or possibly his experience but undoubtedly due in part to the Vision party machinery that operates from year-to-year compared to the NPA’s hibernation between elections.

Like in 2011, the NPA council candidates got more total votes than Vision (475,210 compared to 462,384); this time out they got one more councillor elected than in 2011, running their representation to three.

But Vision was further chastened with Green Party incumbent Adriane Carr finishing first in the council vote with 74,077 — which was more votes than LaPointe attracted. Only Roberston managed more in any Vancouver race.

The three victorious NPA councillors finished second, third and fourth behind Carr, as incumbents George Affleck (68,419 votes) and Elizabeth Ball (67,195) were joined by former Vancouver Park Board commissioner Melissa De Genova (63,134).

The NPA also took control of the Park Board and increased their presence on the Vancouver School Board, although Green Party winner Janet Fraser holds the deciding vote there.

“I’m thrilled,” Carr said on Sunday. “I think people across the board valued my work on council, which was to listen to them and to work hard to try get their ideas into council decisions.

“When the Mayor made his apology three days prior to the election and said he could do things better, I think the voters were signalling where he needs to go by their resounding support of me,” she said.

Carr said she hopes to work collaboratively with her Green colleagues on Park Board and School Board.

Aflleck also said the elected NPA candidates will caucus together.

“I think the city wanted to punish the mayor and they punished him through council, not through mayor,” said Affleck,

Probably the biggest gain for the NPA was that Vision lost its so-called super majority on council of eight votes, which means Vision will need to win a vote from another party for financial approval of any decisions.

“We have more of a say in the financials,” said Affleck. “We will be able to get, I hope, the kind of details we want.”

Over the last three years, Affleck in particular was stymied in getting enough information about the financial workings of the city.

A lot of people sure think so","Victoria ghost researcher John Adams believes the B.C. legislature and the nearby Empress Hotel are both haunted by the ghost of Francis Rattenbury, the young English architect who designed both iconic buildings and was later murdered.

High tea served on Royal Doulton china at the stately Fairmont Empress hotel, built in 1908, is a major attraction for tourists.

Francis 'Frank' Mawson Rattenbury is one of British Columbia's most well-known architects and is responsible for many of the province's most famous landmarks, including the B.C. legislature. /PNG

In B.C.’s most haunted city, it forms a kind of devil’s triangle of ghostly high jinks, where spirits and spectres gather as Halloween draws near.

VICTORIA — In B.C.’s most haunted city, it forms a kind of devil’s triangle of ghostly high jinks, where spirits and spectres gather as Halloween draws near.

Begin at the grand and gothic Empress Hotel, where startled guests spy strange apparitions ascending creaking staircases. Then take a walk down Government Street to the century-old James Bay Inn, where objects move and doors mysteriously open and shut for no apparent reason.

And then there’s the B.C. legislature itself, which has got to be the spookiest spot of all.

Not because it’s full of scary politicians. This place is full of ghosts. Just ask the frightened people who work there.

“Oh, yes, the building is haunted,” assures Craig James, the kindly clerk of the legislature, who invites me into his comfortable book-lined study, and proceeds to scare the wits out of me.

“Many of the staff around here have seen things and heard things — things they can’t explain.”

Like the committee clerk who was working alone in her office a few years back.

“She looked out her door, just down the corridor from the legislative chamber. All of a sudden she saw a figure in a black cloak floating along the hall. It went along the speaker’s corridor, past the entrance to the chamber, and then turned left into the library.

“She was terrified and phoned security. They came and checked it out, but there was nothing, nobody there. She was so scared she had to be escorted out of the building.

“The security people told her, ‘Don’t worry. It was probably just Rattenbury.’”

That would be Francis Rattenbury, the dashing young English architect who designed the parliament buildings, and the nearby Empress Hotel, too.

Rattenbury became famous for his work in Canada, but he returned to England and died tragically — savagely murdered in 1935 by the young lover of his adulterous second wife.

“Rattenbury was egotistical and arrogant and full of himself,” said John Adams, a Victoria historian and researcher into the paranormal.

“But in England, he was completely unknown. That’s why his ghost returned to haunt the legislature and The Empress — to gratify his insatiable ego and cravings for attention.”

Adams conducts popular “ghost walks” for tourists (check ghostlywalks.com) and a few years ago a honeymooning couple told him they encountered Rattenbury at The Empress.

“They were talking in the lower lobby and the newlywed wife noticed a man in an old-fashioned suit peeking around a corner at them. Then, as they walked up a staircase, she looked over her shoulder and the man was suddenly at the bottom of the stairs.

“She whispered to her husband, ‘There he is again.’ Now they both looked back — and the figure instantly disappeared before their eyes.”

He heard another spine-tingling tale from one of the legislature’s Parliamentary Players, the troupe of young actors who portray costumed historical characters to the delight of tourists.

“One young man, playing the role of Rattenbury in full period costume, was waiting for his fellow performers in the upper rotunda. They arrived and said, ‘How did you get up here so quickly?’

“He said, ‘What are you talking about? I’ve been standing here waiting for you.’ They said, ‘No, you haven’t! We saw you downstairs and you came up in the elevator with us!’ They realized Rattenbury’s ghost must have been in the elevator with them.”

If you think these political poltergeists rattle the nerves of parliamentary employees, you’re absolutely right. That’s why many will escape a few blocks away to the friendly bar at the James Bay Inn, a favoured watering hole.

But just let bartender Eric Stofer pour you a drink and bend your ear, and you realize you haven’t escaped the spirit world at all.

“Emily Carr died in this hotel,” Stofer explains as he pulls a perfect pint. “And she never left.”

Carr, one of B.C.’s most famous, beloved and eccentric artists, haunts the hotel’s cozy pub, Stofer said. Her portrait hangs on the wall, near the exact spot where she’s believed to have died in 1945, when the hotel functioned as a private hospital.

“One night, after we had closed, I was here with just one other staff member, cleaning up and counting the cash,” Stofer said.

“The back door opened and then it closed. Then it happened again. We said, ‘Who’s there?’ No answer. Then the door opened and closed again, and I ran to see if someone was playing tricks.

“But there was no one there. Just a silent, empty parking lot and not a breath of wind — and a heavy door that would open and close by itself.”

Stofer is convinced: It was the ghost of Carr, playfully making her presence known.

“Another night, during the Stanley Cup playoffs, we had a large inflatable easy chair hanging over the bar. It was a raffle prize donated by Molson’s, and I personally tied it securely to a metal TV stand because I wanted to make sure no one tried to steal it.

“It was closing time, and one of the waitresses was standing right under the chair. She said something about Emily Carr. And literally a moment later, the chair fell to the floor right next to her.”

The inflatable chair was not heavy. If it had hit the waitress, she would not have been hurt. Another sign, Stofer believes, that Carr’s ghost is a friendly one.

“Did you know Emily Carr kept chairs suspended by ropes from the ceiling in her own home? If she wanted you to stay a while, she would lower down a chair. Well, that’s what happened right here, right when her name was spoken.”

I knock back the rest of my drink to calm my frayed nerves and head back to the legislature. As Halloween gets closer by every witching hour, the ghosts appear to get more mischievous.

They seem to like the library best.

“I was working up here alone one night,” librarian Iona Reid tells me. “Then one of the cleaning staff rushed up and said, ‘Were you just in the cataloguing department?’ I said, ‘No, I haven’t moved from my desk.’ He said he had heard footsteps and someone shuffling papers — but there was no one there.

“Other people have heard similar stories. Some people get the chills and don’t want to go into the stacks. A few others have seen things.”

Things real. Or things imagined. Decide for yourself. But in British Columbia’s cryptic capital, many believe there is more than political hot air swirling through the halls of the people’s haunted house.

Running this B.C. government costs a lot of money. That money has to come from somewhere. And that somewhere is you and your wallet, write Province columnist Michael Smyth. The April Fool’s Day increases — including today’s nine-per-cent hydro-rate hike and four-per-cent ferry-fare increase — are bound to inflict significant hurt on anyone whose income hasn’t increased at a similar rate. That’s most of us. And the government can’t ignore it. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick

If you’re feeling acute pain in your wallet from Tuesday’s hikes in B.C. Hydro rates and ferry fares — not to mention recent Insurance Corporation of B.C. and Medical Services Plan increases — try to look at it from the government’s point of view.

If you’re feeling acute pain in your wallet from Tuesday’s hikes in B.C. Hydro rates and ferry fares — not to mention recent Insurance Corporation of B.C. and Medical Services Plan increases — try to look at it from the government’s point of view.

Where do you think the money comes from to send MLAs and their spouses to Africa so they can tickle giraffes and pet lion cubs?

Where do you think they get the cash to funnel into Downtown Eastside “charities” run by people who eat at Gotham Steakhouse, ride in limos and vacation at Disneyland?

Where are they supposed to get the big bucks for bonuses and double-dip pensions to reward executives running government monopolies?

Do you think it all grows on trees? Do you think they find it in loose change under sofa cushions in the legislature’s new MLA TV lounge with the $733 snack rack to hold their free muffins?

Running this B.C. government costs a lot of money. That money has to come from somewhere. And that somewhere is you and your wallet.

The April Fool’s Day increases — including today’s nine-per-cent hydro-rate hike and four-per-cent ferry-fare increase — are bound to inflict significant hurt on anyone whose income hasn’t increased at a similar rate. That’s most of us. And the government can’t ignore it.

“There is an impact when rates go up,” Energy Minister Bill Bennett acknowledged Monday. “I don’t want to say anything that would minimize the impact on people.”

But he also says B.C. Hydro needs money to build new dams and repair old ones. B.C. Ferries needs money to subsidize money-losing ferry routes.

ICBC must pay out higher injury claims and MSP faces increased demand for health care from an aging population of baby boomers.

Yes, the demands for more money are everywhere. But the government’s siphoning of your bank account would be easier to accept if they led by example, eliminated waste and told the whole truth about where your money goes.

For example: Not all the loot you fork over to hydro and ICBC pays for new dams or car-accident claims. Billions will be transferred directly to government in the form of “dividends” and “excess optional capital” — also known as “stealth taxes.”

At the ferries, top managers continue to bank performance-driven “salary hold-backs” — the government’s new name for “bonuses.”

But why you need to pay bonuses to managers of a government monopoly is beyond me (especially when they don’t pay any bonuses at all to ferry executives in neighbouring Washington state).

At the Health Ministry, they’re jacking up MSP premiums at the same time that they’re pumping millions into barely accountable organizations like the Portland Hotel Society, where audits revealed lavish personal spending, but no government appetite to dig deeper into the scandal.

And at the legislature itself, MLAs from both major parties have been forced to pay back money to taxpayers for dubious personal spending, including that giraffe-cuddling trip to Africa.

So crack open that wallet and dig a little deeper, tax slaves. They couldn’t have picked a more appropriate day to make us all feel a little more foolish.

Xiaofeng Huang, Yuen Ching Li and Shaohui Liu have filed a petition in B.C. Supreme Court claiming the school board policy, adopted June 16 in front of a deeply divided audience, violates the School Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Three Vancouver parents are taking the Vancouver School Board to court in a bid to quash a controversial policy that provided more support for transgender students. Xiaofeng Huang, Yuen Ching Li and Shaohui Liu have filed a petition in B.C. Supreme Court claiming the school board policy, adopted June 16 in front of a deeply divided audience, violates the School Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

It said the policy, which allows transgender students to use washrooms and locker-rooms that correspond to their gender identities, violates students’ rights to privacy and encroaches on parental rights over their children.

""Some students are uncomfortable with sharing very personal information or private spaces with members of the opposite sex and deeply care about their privacy when using the washroom or change room,"" said the petition, filed Oct. 31.

""The board never proposed how to accommodate the wishes of students who are uncomfortable with sharing the same washroom and change room with members of the opposite sex.""

The policy also allows transgender students to be addressed by the name that corresponds with their gender identity.

In sex-segregated activities such as physical education, it gives them the choice to join the gender group they identify with.

It also calls for gender-neutral, single- stall washrooms in schools.

The petition argued the board has no authority under the School Act to make its decision, which it also called unconstitutional.

It also said the policy granted school officials ""unfettered discretion"" to withhold from parents information on their child’s gender identity and expression.

The three petitioners all have children, ranging in age from six to 17, who attend Vancouver School Board schools.

The petition is also supported by more than 180 affidavits from likeminded parents.

School board chairwoman Patti Bacchus told The Province that the policy updated a 10-year-old policy that had already been updated in practice.

""We made revisions to a 10-yearold policy,"" said Bacchus of the 2004 school board policy seeking to support LGBTQ students.

""What is now in policy now is in fact what was in practice.""","2014-11-12 00:00:00","1","2.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","162.0","182.0","0.0","74.0","1.0","4.0","1","421","96.14","76.20","6.94","47.75","21.05","28.50","71.50","38.95","6.18","1.90","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","1.66","4.28","9.26","13.54","3.56","3.33","4.99","0.48","8.55","2.14","1.43","1.90","3.09","1.66","4.28","2.61","1.43","0.48","0.95","0.00","8.55","1.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.70","1.19","2.14","0.24","0.71","0.71","1.19","0.95","0.00","0.95","0.00","1.19","0.00","0.24","0.71","0.24","11.40","2.85","0.71","7.60","0.48","0.00","3.33","5.94","0.24","9.98","0.71","6.41","2.85","9.03","0.24","0.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.54","5.23","3.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.66","2.38","0.48","0.00","0.00","2124","7.89","22.210526315789473","646","413","19","49.45","14.6","11.8","13.75","14.6","83","8.0","18.718740920096852","189","20.16","5","0.39","0","13","11","42","0","43","19","3","0","0","82","51","2","32","0","0","8","6","11","0","0","0","15","0","10","16","9","12","12","12","7","4","0","2"

Dear Tony: Our strata council has been struggling with an issue in our building that involves insurance claims in a strata lot.

Our property manager tells us that if a claim happens in a strata lot, it is the owner’s responsibility and expense, and if it happens on the common property, the strata is responsible, but both the strata insurance company and the owner’s insurance company cannot agree on a current claim.

A pipe has broken in the ceiling between two strata lots, causing about $17,000 damage to the strata lot below. Our water deductible is $10,000, but the damage is only to the strata lot below and the insurer says it is the responsibility of the strata owner, but the owner’s insurance company has advised that this is an insurable loss on the strata corporation’s insurance.

We need some help to answer this question so we can get moving on the repairs.

— Karen, North Vancouver

Dear Karen: There are a few simple rules to follow that help in understanding the obligations of insurance and claims in a strata.

The first issue everyone needs to clarify is to define what was damaged. If the damages occurred to the original assets and fixtures, and the amount is equal to and greater than the deductible, then the claim will be covered under the strata policy.

It is also important to understand that strata lot owners are named insureds on the policy by virtue of the Strata Property Act (SPA) and as a result can directly file a claim with the strata insurance provider without the consent of the strata corporation.

Whether or not there is a claim is a decision that will be determined by the adjuster’s assessment of the value of damages.

In Karen’s strata, if the claim is for the strata common assets and fixtures and it exceeds the value of the deductible rate, then it is a claim on the strata corporation insurance.

The second issue to assess is what caused the claim. Now we know what is being covered and under what policy, it is important to identify the cause of a claim and whether it was the responsibility of the owner or the strata corporation.

The pipe identified in Karen’s strata is common property as defined under the act, and is therefore the responsibility of the strata corporation to maintain and repair, and the strata corporation will not be able to recover the $10,000 deductible from either owner. However, if the water loss was caused by the failure of a toilet tank or leaking dishwasher, failed washing machine or bathtub, the owner may likely have been responsible for the maintenance and repair of those fixtures and the strata council would have been able to seek an action to recover the $10,000 deductible from the owner who was responsible for or caused the claim.

An underlying principle of the SPA is that owners are responsible to maintain and repair their strata lots to the extent that the repairs are not damages caused by an insurable claim, a critical issue that is missed by many strata owners.

If, in Karen’s situation, the damage was caused by the neighbour overflowing the tub, and the damage amount was below $10,000 with no claim, Karen would be required to go to her own insurance provider to file claim for the restoration to her strata lot or pay it directly herself. There would be far fewer disputes over insurance claims if owners would simply invest in proper insurance coverage for their condos as there would be much less need to sue the neighbour who caused an underinsured claim because you as an owner failed to buy insurance.

The old Harmony Express was dismantled, carted over to Blackcomb, and rechristened as the new Crystal.

The amazement begins the moment the Harbour Air plane takes off from Coal Harbour in downtown Vancouver. The view is terrific and immediately gets better crossing Georgia Straight to Vancouver Island.

The amazement begins the moment the Harbour Air plane takes off from Coal Harbour in downtown Vancouver. The view is terrific and immediately gets better crossing Georgia Straight to Vancouver Island. Touching down in the marina at Comox Harbour in less than an hour, the dazzled visitor gazes up at the Comox glacier looming over a bright green valley criss-crossed with hundreds of farms and dozens of streams and begins to wonder. So, is this the Promised Land?

My assignment was to review the annual Shellfish Festival, which meant tasting Fanny Bay oysters and devouring fresh barbecued salmon and grilled scallops on a stick. As onerous as that task sounds, I was more interested in wandering around the valley and wondering what it would be like to live there. The rumour was that the Comox Valley represents the ultimate in penturbian living. So I went for a ramble.

About 25 years ago, Jack Lessinger, a retired University of Washington professor, invented the term “penturbia.” This promised land, he wrote, lay in the future. It would be found beyond the normal commuting range of big cities, well beyond suburbia. It would be replete with farms, forests, lakes, and rivers. Living in penturbia, he predicted, would be a relaxed and healthy lifestyle with walking, cycling, kayaking, fishing, and golfing.

My first destination was the Saturday farmers market. The Comox Valley stretches over 25 kilometres wide, a gentle sloping coastal plain criss-crossed with a web of fresh mountain streams and protected by a ridge of mountains capped by the Comox glacier and Mt. Washington, a mighty peak that blocks much of the rain and snow. A mild coastal winter, a long growing season and more sunshine hours than virtually any other region in the country allows for the valley’s tremendous agricultural output.

Comox is derived from the original aboriginal word K’omoks, meaning “plentiful, rich or wealthy.” The rich soil means the farmers’ market boasts farm fresh greens, cheese, meats and sweets produced on many of the 400 farms scattered throughout the valley. On this Saturday morning it was packed. Several vendors informed me that famed film producer James Cameron has just bought property in the valley. Several new wineries had just opened. Things were booming.

Penturbian regions in B.C. can be measured by how many hours it takes to reach from the Lower Mainland. Anything under a four-hour drive, properties can fetch a big city-like million-dollar price tag. The Comox Valley, however, now boasts direct flights from Vancouver’s downtown harbour, and in summer jets from YVR land at the new airport at the former Canadian Forces Base. WestJet also flies direct from Comox to Mexico in the winter.

Courtenay, a 10-minute drive from Comox, is actually the bustling centre of the valley. A walk through its busy downtown core turned up Thai restaurants, yoga studios, youth hostels, art galleries and adventure sports stores. Mountain biking, kayaking and skiing seemed to be the big draws. Comox might be where all the retirees live, but younger people and families looking to buy an affordable home or start a small business head for Courtenay. The Puntledge River runs right through the heart of town, so you can rent a kayak at lunch and go for a paddle. It was a sunny summer’s day on my visit, and every park in town was filled with kids playing soccer or having a picnic.

The Shellfish Festival at historic Filberg Park was rocking, with country star Sue Medley on the stage.

Big name chefs from Vancouver like Nathan Fong held cooking demonstrations, with the focus on shellfish harvested straight from local waters. Dozens of other music, arts and culture and sports festivals crowd the annual valley calendar. Winter brings swarms of skiers to Mt. Washington. There’s even half a dozen high-end restaurants in the valley to enjoy. Who knew?

Looks like the old professor was right. The promised land finally exists. The folks who live there are keeping it a secret for themselves, but now the rest of us know where to find it. Darn, there goes the neighbourhood.","2014-09-24 00:00:00","0","2.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","158.0","179.0","0.0","74.0","1.0","4.0","1","796","96.69","50.00","57.35","87.93","15.61","24.50","73.87","41.33","4.52","1.38","0.75","0.13","0.13","0.25","0.13","3.14","10.55","13.57","5.53","3.64","5.03","0.13","11.06","5.65","2.26","1.01","1.88","1.51","3.89","3.77","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.13","2.39","0.25","0.13","0.00","0.25","5.90","1.76","0.63","0.50","1.51","0.63","1.63","1.88","1.13","0.38","0.13","1.88","0.25","0.63","0.00","1.01","4.90","0.25","0.63","2.89","1.26","0.13","3.02","6.16","0.88","18.72","2.14","11.18","5.40","2.01","3.64","0.63","1.63","0.00","0.00","0.50","0.13","0.25","0.13","0.13","0.00","15.33","6.28","6.53","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.88","0.50","0.75","0.00","0.13","3848","7.91","16.3265306122449","1129","786","48","71.75","10.3","7.3","11.89","10.7","172","8.5","17.31318066157761","431","15.41","8","0.38","0","32","9","89","0","96","71","3","0","10","133","96","1","58","2","0","16","2","25","3","0","2","12","0","24","24","26","15","10","30","3","2","0","3"

DUBLIN – St. Patrick may have banished snakes and brought Christianity to Ireland, but perhaps his greatest feat was one of sheer endurance. After all, there were hundreds of other future saints roaming Ireland at the time, but Patrick is the one who gets the party.

On March 17, Guinness will flow from Malin to Moscow, the Chicago River will run green and parades will be held worldwide to celebrate the fifth-century preacher and patron saint of Ireland.

“St. Patrick’s legacy is pretty impressive,” says historian Brian Lacey, “especially considering he wasn’t even Irish.”

Patrick was British, captured at the age of 16 by a band of raiders and brought as a slave to Ireland. For six years he tended sheep on a remote mountain in County Antrim and wrestled with visions from God. After escaping, he went on to become a bishop who travelled throughout Ireland building churches, baptizing converts and performing countless miracles along the way.

In recent years there have been calls to rein in the revelry and reclaim the religious aspects of the national holiday. Some are even attempting to boost the name recognition of other saints (early Irish records list as many as 1,700) and bring their stories to the attention of the world.

There are hundreds of holy wells, sacred round towers and monastic remains all over Ireland and it seems every town and village boasts its own special miracle maker.

At Glendalough (valley of two lakes) in County Wicklow, visitors can wander through the remains of a monastic settlement that for 500 years was one of Ireland’s greatest centres of learning. Founded by Kevin in the sixth century, the soaring round tower, churches and gravestones, as well as “St. Kevin’s Bed” — a man-made cave carved into the rock high over one of the lakes — creates a strikingly evocative scene and almost mystical sense of the past.

Tour guides offer tales of how Kevin cast a monster into the upper lake, rebuked an ardent woman suitor (one unlikely legend has him hurling her from his cave into the depths below) and once, while fasting, allowed a blackbird to build a nest on his outstretched hand. The story goes that he kept his arm outstretched until the chicks hatched.

There are endless such yarns woven around the saints. At the time Ireland was dubbed “the Island of Saints and Scholars” and monastic settlements had to compete for pilgrims and patrons — causing in-house scribes to pen ever more dramatic tales of saintly powers.

KILDARE, COUNTY KILDARE: ST. BRIGID

Brigid, for example, is said to have turned water into ale, diverted rivers from their courses and conjured up extra bacon for unexpected guests. When she decided to build a monastery in Kildare in the fifth century, she needed land from a local chieftain. He grudgingly agreed to give her as much as her cloak would cover. Miraculously, the cloak kept spreading for as many acres as she wanted.

Today, a round tower and cathedral mark the spot in Kildare where Brigid’s abbey once stood. On the outskirts of the town is a tranquil park with an ancient well, said to have healing powers, next to a tall bronze statue of the saint wearing a cross and holding a flame.

CLONMACNOISE, COUNTY OFFALY: ST. CIARAN

In neighbouring County Offaly, visitors can explore the magnificent remains of the sixth-century monastic site founded by Ciaran in Clonmacnoise. It includes the ruins of a cathedral, two round towers, three Celtic crosses and the largest collection of early Christian gravestones in Western Europe.

Ciaran’s path to sainthood was launched as a young man, when he supposedly restored life to a dead horse — just one example of his way with animals. Legend has it that a fox carried his psalter (psalm book) and a stag held his books on its antlers while he studied.

After performing the usual round of miracles, Ciaran decided to build a monastery at Clonmacnoise, smitten, he said, by the beauty of the lush green plains and sweeping views of the river Shannon. First though, he had to settle a boundary dispute with a neighbour who offered him land as far as he could throw his cap. After uttering a prayer, a gust of wind swept Ciaran’s hat across the fields. To this day, a sudden squall in the midlands is sometimes called “Ciaran’s wind.” The neighbour was eventually made a saint as well — St. Manchan.

ARDMORE, COUNTY WATERFORD: ST. DECLAN

Farther south, at the picturesque seaside village of Ardmore, visitors can learn about St. Declan and how he crossed the sea on a huge flagstone which ran aground on a local beach. High on a hill above the village are the spectacular remains of his fifth-century settlement, including an ancient church decorated with intricate stone carvings, one of the tallest round towers in Ireland, and the remains of an oratory where Declan is buried.

The saint still has a cult following in County Waterford, which he christianized before St. Patrick. The waters of St. Declan’s well are said to possess healing powers, especially for aching joints and backs. And every year pilgrims flock to Ardmore to celebrate his feast day on July 24 and throw a weeklong party in his name.

ST. PATRICK AND MANY MORE

There are hundreds of other saints and saintly shrines. At Fenit harbour in County Kerry in southwest Ireland, a large bronze statue depicts St. Brendan, the sixth-century navigator who set off on an epic voyage across the Atlantic in a wooden boat covered with ox hides. Brendan is said to have landed in Newfoundland, and to this day his followers claim the saint was the first to discover America.

Relics of saints also abound. The preserved head of St. Oliver Plunkett — who was hanged, drawn and quartered in Britain in 1681 for his Catholic faith — is housed in an elaborate shrine at St. Peter’s Church in Drogheda, a port town north of Dublin.

For centuries St. Laurence O’Toole’s 900-year-old heart was on display at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin until, shockingly, it was stolen in 2012 and has not been recovered.

And, though he wasn’t Irish, St. Valentine’s third-century remains also ended up in Dublin, preserved in an elaborate reliquary at the Carmelite church on Whitefriar Street.

Still, Patrick remains the star. This year Dublin will host a four-day extravaganza including beer fests, ceilis (Irish folk dancing), street performances and a lavish parade in honour of “La Fheile Padraig” (St. Patrick’s feast day). Downpatrick in Northern Ireland, where the saint is reputedly buried (and which has a huge visitor centre dedicated to all things Patrick) is throwing a nine-day program of events.

All this for a man who famously described himself as “a sinner, the most unlearned of men, the lowliest of all the faithful, utterly worthless in the eyes of many.”

""We broke up and I got the house,"" I quipped when friends asked why, suddenly, I was going to Ireland. It wasn't actually his house, and became mine only for a few weeks.

“We broke up and I got the house,” I quipped when friends asked why, suddenly, I was going to Ireland.

It wasn’t actually his house, and became mine only for a few weeks.

We’d talked about going to Europe in April, and his friends had offered the use of their house in Kinsale, a town of 4,900 on the southern coast.

When the trip together evaporated along with the relationship, I asked: “Would they still lend me the house?” Although I didn’t know them well, they graciously agreed.

Tom, the taxi driver whom my hostess had arranged, met me at the airport in Cork. After 20 kilometres of pleasant country roads and conversation we were almost there.

“We can take the scenic route to the house,” offered Tom. “It’s a fixed rate from the airport anyway, so there’s no extra charge for the view.”

At the next intersection we emerged from a copse of black alder onto a cliff overlooking Kinsale; a pretty little harbour full of sailboats, narrow, winding streets of shops, and crayon-coloured houses on the hills above.

The house, Clara’s Cottage, was a three-storey Victorian on a hill so steep that Tom parked the car at the end of the road and lugged my suitcase the half-block to the door.

Next door lived the lead singer of a well-known 1970s rock band — who will remain nameless in order to prevent Kinsale from being overrun by paparazzi. Despite slowing down every time I passed his door, I never managed to bump into him.

The sights

To orient myself, I took Dermot Ryan’s heritage walk.

“Did you know that there is a Kinsale in Canada?” said Ryan.

“A town of 200 in Ontario.”

With the rest of the group gathered, he continued: “The history of Kinsale is the history of Ireland. The battle of Kinsale in 1601 is said to be the turning point in Irish history. Even though the Irish enlisted Spain as an ally against England, they were defeated on Christmas Eve, the beginning of the end of the old Gaelic way of life in Ireland with the loss of power of the chieftains and clans.”

Ryan pointed out the Kinsale Regional Museum and suggested it was worth a visit. Small and unassuming, if I hadn’t been determined to take in everything, I might have given it a pass.

When my friend and I visited, local historian Paul Slaney greeted us at the door. Noticing the “No Photos” sign I asked, “Is that to protect the artifacts from being damaged by the flash?”

“It’s for the insurance. You could be scouts working for an international smuggling gang and the next thing you know Tom Cruise will come down from the ceiling,” he said.

In 1915, when the museum was still a courthouse, the inquest into the sinking of the RMS Lusitania was held there. On its way from New York to Liverpool, the Lusitania was torpedoed by a German submarine 13 miles south of Kinsale. The ship sank in 17 minutes and more than 1,200 drowned. The incident brought the United States into the First World War and launched many conspiracy theories, including that the English allowed the ship to be sacrificed to that end.

As we were leaving, Slaney said — somewhat sadly — “It’s just a small regional museum and we don’t really get the young people.” That’s a shame. The museum had an old-fashioned charm, and with Slaney to entertain us, Kinsale’s history came alive.

Kinsale also has not one fort, but two — Charles and James Forts. I visited the larger Charles Fort, built in the 1670s by the British, and said to be one of the best-preserved 17th-century star-shaped forts in Europe.

The shape is difficult to discern from within, and the fort was a bit crumbly, but the setting, four kilometres from the centre of town, is serene. The best view of both forts is from the water, and the one-hour harbour tour offered by Kinsale Harbour Cruises sails by both.

The food

Known as the gourmet capital of Ireland, Kinsale has more restaurants than one would expect for a town its size. The Taste the Wild Atlantic Way Street Food Festival, held in early April, was on. I grazed my way through the stalls offering appetizer-sized servings focusing on Irish cuisine — halibut chowder, fish cakes, seaweed scones, and sticky toffee pudding. I saved the black pudding, a local delicacy made from pork blood and oatmeal, for next time.

The following day, I was invited to be a judge at the 4th All Ireland Chowder Cook Off Competition. When I told some of the entrants that I was an international judge from Canada, they seemed excited to meet me. Along with the two hundred other judges, I tasted as many types of chowder as I could.

Most days, The Poet’s Corner, a café and book exchange on Main Street, became my second home: Old-fashioned armchairs, walls lined with books, cheese toasties, carrot, cumin, coconut soup, sticky hot chocolate, Simone, the friendly proprietor, and most importantly, free Wi-Fi.

The credit card machines at the Kinsale restaurants that I visited didn’t have a tip option on them. “It wouldn’t be Irish to ask for a tip even if it’s on the machine,” explained one server. However, in the larger Irish cities credit card tipping had been discovered.

The pubs

No trip to an Irish town would be complete without visiting a local pub, and I had the opportunity to acquaint myself with a few.

A short walk from the centre of town was the Spaniard Bar, the second oldest pub in Ireland — more than 400 years old. It looked as if it had been untouched since the Spanish Armada: a warren of tiny rooms with low timbered ceilings, walls and floors of stone, and a peat fire smouldering in the corner.

At the Spaniard for the Saturday evening “trad session,” the pub was shoulder to shoulder with people of all ages. The physical closeness, the warmth of the room, and the heart-touching melodies, swept me in and I was no longer a stranger.

At Monday night’s trad session in Dalton’s pub, the band of musicians grew with the addition of an accordionist, hand drummer, a man playing spoons, and three young lady flutists. When they sang in Gaelic, the soft melodic, almost mournful cadence was a language I’d not heard before.

At the White House, another pub in the centre of town, we were treated to a group of young people playing a mix of folk, pop and trad.

At closing time, when the musicians started playing the Irish National Anthem, everyone stood up and sang.

“Is this something special because it’s Good Friday tomorrow?” I asked another friendly local. “No, every day at closing time,” she said.

When I returned to Canada, an acquaintance asked: “What did you find to do in one small town for two weeks?”

Everything! I walked every street, visited every attraction, took in every event, and savoured every moment.","2014-09-29 00:00:00","0","2.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","158.0","179.0","0.0","74.0","1.0","4.0","1","1307","95.10","56.08","67.92","39.44","18.67","20.58","78.88","47.13","8.42","5.66","3.29","0.84","0.31","0.61","0.61","2.75","11.78","14.77","6.12","3.06","5.05","1.22","12.17","4.51","2.07","1.07","2.14","2.30","3.06","1.84","1.07","0.08","0.15","0.54","6.89","0.00","0.69","0.15","0.61","6.27","1.22","0.69","0.77","1.15","0.99","1.99","2.45","0.84","0.84","0.46","2.30","0.46","0.31","0.00","1.53","6.12","2.22","0.84","2.60","0.99","0.31","6.58","3.60","0.61","18.67","2.45","10.71","5.51","0.84","2.52","1.38","0.69","0.15","0.31","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.08","0.08","19.82","5.20","7.88","0.38","0.08","0.38","0.08","0.99","2.60","1.84","0.00","0.38","5781","7.32","22.183333333333334","1769","1292","70","69.62","10.2","8.1","10.33","10.2","226","6.642857142857143","16.396904024767803","614","20.27","34","0.46","0","38","26","170","0","169","90","8","5","8","223","136","1","58","0","0","75","12","39","0","3","4","28","0","29","100","23","31","17","19","1","3","0","11"

Many homes in the 40-to-50-year range are being renovated on the outside, giving their “street face” a much more up-to-date look.

New and existing homebuyers like to freshen up exteriors to both change the look and to upgrade energy efficiency — both of which create future value for the residence.

The most common upgrades include roofing, windows, siding and doors (both the garage and the entrance). This pretty much covers the exposure to the street, often referred to as curb or street appeal. Over the past few years, there have been grant programs enticing homeowners to add these upgrades to their homes.

Changes such as exterior siding, windows, doors and roofing will completely change the way your home will perform before these energy-efficiency upgrades. Let me explain.

Roofing: When you remove a cedar or duroid (asphalt) roof and apply plywood sheathing or oriented strand board (OSB), the application of your new roof would likely include a stick-down membrane under the actual roofing material. This tightens the air cavity and will require the installation of extra venting by the roofing contractor.

Replacing windows and doors: Installing new windows and doors with proper weatherstripping provides more energy efficiency and tightens up the envelope of the home. This adds another requirement for additional controlled exhaust ventilation, such as bathroom, laundry room and kitchen exhaust.

Siding: Replacing siding and adding extra rigid foam insulation on the outside walls acts as a thermal bridging protection. This insulation stops the cold outside air coming directly in contact with the wall studs, transferring cold air to the inside of the home. The additional comfort to the home again adds more reason to control potential moisture buildup inside the home, requiring the extra exhaust fans as mentioned above.

The point I want to stress is that, before you begin any home improvement, it’s important to check with a professional to know what is required.

It’s just that easy if you do it right!

If so, you'll pay more than anyone else in North America.

This story originally appeared in The Province on Tuesday, Aug. 13, 2013.

Will you fill up your car’s tank at a Lower Mainland gas station today? If so, you’ll pay more than anyone else in North America.

According to statistics released on gasbuddy.com last week, B.C. is home to the 10 most expensive places to buy gas on the continent. Delta topped the list at $1.44 per litre, with Surrey, Vancouver, Coquitlam and Burnaby only fractions of a cent away.

Surprised? You shouldn’t be, experts say, because B.C. has some of the highest gas taxes in North America.

""It’s primarily taxes. Canada has a lot higher gas taxes than the U.S., and that’s why gas prices are much higher,"" said Jason Toews, co-founder of gasbuddy.com. ""The Vancouver area is especially expensive with their gas tax.""

According to Jordan Bateman, the B.C. director for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, Lower Mainland gas taxes add up to about 49 cents per litre. The biggest pieces of that number go to a 17-cent TransLink tax, a 10-cent federal tax, and GST, which is slapped on top of everything else.

""Honestly, gas taxes in the Lower Mainland are just so unbelievably high,"" Bateman said.

Gasbuddy.com’s statistics, compiled last Thursday, were pulled from gas prices in nearly 5,600 cities. According to Toews, the 24-hour snapshot is an accurate reflection of the bigger picture.

""It definitely is. We’ve been doing this since 2000, and B.C. is always up there,"" he said.

In fact, there are a handful of small towns in B.C. that have even higher gas prices than Delta; Fort Nelson came in at $156.9/litre on Monday. However, gasbuddy.com considered only communities with five or more gas stations.

The temporary closure of an Alberta oil refinery jacked up prices, according to an industry insider.

""Part of the refinery had some maintenance issues and they ended up being a bigger deal than they thought,"" said Keith Schaefer, the editor of the Oil and Gas Investments Bulletin. ""When you have reduced supply, that means higher prices.""

The 50-day closure of the refinery, owned by Syncrude Canada Ltd., eliminated about 125,000 barrels of oil from the market, Schaefer said.

""I talked to them Tuesday last week … it’s almost ready to reopen,"" Schaefer said. ""Then I would expect gas prices to come down here fairly quickly.""

Many Lower Mainland drivers who are fed up with paying chart-topping prices have begun looking south for cheaper fuel. Trips across the border just to fill up on gas have become more popular, Bateman said.

""It’s just common sense,"" he said. ""It needs to be made worthwhile for them financially, and when you cross the border you’re saving $20 at the pump immediately.""

The news of Delta’s chart-topping gas prices was met with little surprise on Monday.

""I’m not shocked at all. It’s so high, so expensive,"" said Naz Grewal, 18, as she pumped $20 worth of gas into her van at a Delta Esso station. The price: $143.9/litre. ""I’m just getting enough to make it home.""

For Wendy Wilson, 63, of Surrey, filling up the tank got so pricey that she decided to buy a fuel-efficient Smart Car last year.

""That’ll be good for three weeks now,"" Wilson said after paying $46 at the pump. ""I only drive my bigger car when I have things to move.""

A former communications director in the Liberal government and an employee of the B.C. Liberal party have been charged with Elections Act violations stemming from an RCMP investigation launched in the wake of the so-called “ethnic outreach” scandal.

A former communications director in the Liberal government and an employee of the B.C. Liberal party have been charged with Elections Act violations stemming from an RCMP investigation launched in the wake of the so-called “ethnic outreach” scandal.

The justice ministry announced Monday that charges against Brian Bonney and Mark Robertson were approved by independent special prosecutor David Butcher, who was put on the case in August 2013.

Bonney, then-communications director in the ministry for multiculturalism, and Robertson, the Liberal party’s director of field operations, are alleged to have made an illegal political contribution between Feb. 22 and April 19, 2012 during the Port-Moody-Coquitlam provincial byelection, said a statement by the Criminal Justice Branch.

The two men face two counts of making/accepting political contributions and one count of an offence in relation to election expenses.

According to court documents, Bonney and Robertson are alleged to have paid a woman named Sepideh Sarrafpour to work on the campaign of Liberal candidate Dennis Marsden without disclosing the payment to Terry Hawes, Marsden’s financial agent, in contravention of the Election Act.

By doing so, the pair are also alleged to have incurred an election expense unauthorized by the Election Act.

A numbered company, 0750837 B.C. Ltd. dba Mainland Communications, is also named in the charge. Bonney and Robertson are directors.

Robertson remains employed by the Liberal party, which issued a brief statement Monday.

It said it became aware in November 2013 of a $2,240 expenditure that was “misreported” during the 2012 byelection and filed an amendment accepted by Elections B.C. to “reallocate the expenditure” in December.

“The B.C. Liberal Party takes its financial reporting obligations seriously,” said the statement, pointing out that amendments are allowed under the act and are a common practice used by all parties.

The Criminal Justice Branch said the investigation remains ongoing, with a final report expected early next year.

Neither Butcher or the Criminal Justice Branch were able to comment further “as there is now an active prosecution before the court,” said the Criminal Justice Branch in a statement.

Former NDP leader Adrian Dix wrote a letter to RCMP in August 2013 raising concerns about information uncovered as a result of an internal government review of a controversial Liberals strategy of earning political “quick wins” by pandering to ethnic communities.

After the ethnic outreach scandal broke in the spring of 2013, several party staffers resigned and Premier Christy Clark launched a review into the strategy headed by deputy minister John Dyble.

Buried among thousands of pages of documents related to Dyble’s report that were dumped by the government on its open information website was an email chain that suggested the Liberals offered some kind of inducement to silence a former employee, later identified as Sarrafpour.

At the time, Sarrafpour said she never accepted any kind of offer and stressed she never did anything wrong while working for the Liberals.

1918 was a brutal year.

The First World War had come to an end, the Spanish flu pandemic had spread across the globe to B.C. and workers here had organized the Vancouver General Strike in protest of a labour activist’s murder.

The Daily Province newsroom was tasked with covering some pretty grim stories, and something needed to be done to lift spirits before the year was out.

On Dec. 5, 1918, the paper announced The Province Santa Claus Fund, a Christmas fundraiser to help struggling British Columbians over the holiday season.

In a particularly gloomy message to readers, with no byline but signed “The Province Santa Claus,” its author lamented Christmas being “the time of goodwill and cheer” — but only for some people.

“Have you ever seen children — eager, trusting children — in the cold grey dawn of Christmas morning with an empty stocking in their hands,” The Province Santa Claus wrote.

“An empty stocking! Childhood knows no greater grief than this. Santa Claus has forgotten them.”

The Daily Province asked readers for a “surge of unselfish giving” to help raise $6,000 (about $82,000 today) destined for “the poor,” “the widowed and fatherless” and “the brave who have been maimed in the Great Cause.”

It’s been 96 years since that Dickensian message prompted readers to donate $3,000 — it was a bad year, after all — but it was the start of something big.

Fifty years ago, the paper’s name had shortened to The Province and the fundraiser was called The Empty Stocking Fund, but tough times continued.

“Poverty has a smell to it,” Province reporter Nikki Moir wrote Dec. 8, 1964. “It is damp and woody and acrid. It hangs like a pall over Vancouver’s slums. Yes, there ARE slums in Vancouver.”

Moir wrote again the next year about hundreds of families struggling with “feelings of fear and desperation” as the holidays approached.

“They are weary from worrying as to how they can have a Christmas for their children. Christmas trees at a dollar a foot aren’t for them, nor the lights that go on them, and gifts to go under them. Poor children get just as fanciful ideas as the rich when it comes to building up hopes for a toy car, a pair of skates.”

The fund ballooned to a record $30,212 (about $225,000 today) by the end of 1965.

Sadly, British Columbians continue to fall on tough times, but the generosity continues.

Last year, The Province Empty Stocking Fund raised more than $324,000 to warm the holidays for thousands.

The fund will continue with your support so long as empty stockings need filling.

A decade ago, as a girl of 15, Rayanne Tupman used to ride SkyTrain for free. She was caught almost a dozen times, and issued tickets, but she never paid them or told her parents.

This week, the now 25-year-old Maple Ridge mother of two was shocked to learn those fines had come due, thanks to a new crackdown at ICBC. Nearly 40,000 other B.C. residents could soon find themselves facing the same nasty surprise.

The Douglas College nursing student is upset that she must pay more than $2,000 in unpaid TransLink fines in order to upgrade her driver’s licence.

“They are taking the food out of the mouths of my children for something that occurred a decade ago, something that my parents were never informed of since I was a minor,” she said.

She argues TransLink should have sent a notice to her parents, because she was a minor and didn’t understand the repercussions.

“How is this justified that the government can bring old skeletons out of our closets from when we were kids?” Tupman said.

Upset as she is, Tupman admits she is responsible and says she will pay the fine. But she wants her experience to serve as a warning to other youths what could happen.

A 2012 legislative provision that came into force at ICBC Monday will now make it impossible for drivers like Tupman with pre-2012 unpaid fines to renew licences or vehicle registrations without paying their TransLink debts.

ICBC’s Adam Grossman said approximately 37,000 B.C. residents with some $5.7 million in outstanding tickets incurred between 2002 and 2012 would now find licences and registrations subject to a “refuse to issue” hold.

“The refuse to issue restriction is part of the legislation introduced by government in May 2012 to reduce fare evasion on the transit system and has been in place on new transit debt since Sept. 4, 2012,” Grossman explained. “We’ve now made the system changes required to support refuse to issue holds on older, provincial transit tickets.”

Grossman said ICBC would send out notices to affected drivers prior to their renewal date.

TransLink warns on its website that unpaid tickets can impede an individual’s ability to renew driver’s licences or vehicle insurance.

Overdue fines are sent to collections. Once a ticket is more that 180 days past due, the $173 fines increase by $40 to $213. Once a ticket is more than one year overdue, fines increase another $60 up to $273.

Fare infractions issued before Sept. 4, 2012, are considered provincial offences and are collected or disputed through ICBC.

TransLink spokeswoman Jiana Ling referred inquiries on this case to ICBC, as they were in charge of fine administration prior to 2012 and therefore have jurisdiction.

If fines remain unpaid after a year, ICBC refers them to collections. Between 2010 and 2012, ICBC collected $10 million in unpaid fines on 60,000 tickets, averaging 2,500 a month.

In September 2012, following the introduction of the South Coast B.C. Transportation Authority Act, TransLink gained responsibility for issuing fare-infraction tickets and collecting fines.

At that time, TransLink admitted it was losing $18 million a year in revenue to fare evaders.

In 2013, the first full year TransLink took over fine administration, the transit authority issued 25,400 tickets worth about $5.6 million. They managed to collect on 33 per cent of the tickets.

Fare evasion is expected to decline following the implementation of the $170-million Compass Card faregate program.

Passengers can pay fines in person, online or by mail. They can dispute a ticket, even if they have paid some or all of it. They must fill out a Notice of Dispute form on TransLink’s website and submit it within 14 days of the date the ticket was issued. Passengers unhappy with the outcome of dispute resolution can appeal the decision.

NO PAY, NO LICENCE

ICBC can refuse to issue a licence if the following debts are owed:

■ Violation tickets issued under the Offence Act that are motor vehicle-related;

■ Criminal Code fines that are motor vehicle-related;

■ Intersection Safety Camera tickets;

■ Immediate Roadside Prohibition fees;

■ Motor vehicle court fines;

■ Liquor Control Act violations;

■ Family Maintenance Enforcement Program;

■ Golden Ears & Port Mann Bridge tolls;

■ Transit fines;

■ Various debts owed to ICBC.

The changes have raised questions about whether the B.C.’s economy will take a hit.

B.C’s massive pot industry is in for some tough times because of changes in U.S. marijuana policy and a shrinking market south of the border.

The changes have raised questions about whether B.C.’s economy will take a hit.

Washington state’s liquor board is expected to issue the first wave of retail marijuana store licences on July 7, with some of the 334 outlets set to open the next day. Pot growers for recreational marijuana already operate legally in Washington state. Colorado began allowing the sale of recreational pot on Jan. 1.

Marijuana sales haven’t started in Washington but the effects of the loosened drug laws are already being felt in B.C., said Simon Fraser University criminologist Neil Boyd.

“There’s not that export market any more, and taking that market out of the picture, your profitability is going to reduce,” said Boyd, adding there are indications the wholesale price of marijuana in B.C. has fallen to up to half of what it used to be.

Marijuana activist Dana Larsen estimates that pot prices in B.C. have dropped about 20 to 25 per cent retail and up to 30 per cent wholesale in recent years, with about half the decrease since 2011. Part of the drop was due to new laws in Washington and Colorado, but the fact that 22 U.S. states have legalized medical marijuana also plays a big role, he said.

Other factors include better technology, stricter U.S. border controls, and the exchange rate. Most experts predict the price of pot will only continue to go down.

“It’s a risky business to be in (for) the long term for profitability, especially when a marijuana high is cheaper than an alcohol high,” said Boyd. “I wouldn’t want to invest in the industry.”

It is difficult to get accurate data on an underground industry, but most agree the majority of B.C. bud is exported to the U.S. or Eastern Canada.

According to a 2004 study, B.C.’s marijuana industry is worth $4 billion to $7 billion annually. The RCMP believes about 50 to 80 per cent of marijuana grown locally — about $2 billion to 5 billion worth — is smuggled to the U.S., a figure that rivals the province’s agricultural or lumber exports.

Daniel Werb, a public health policy researcher with the University of B.C. who specializes in drug policy, believes the expansion of California’s medical marijuana program in recent years has played a larger role in the decrease in U.S. demand.

“Even if growers in (Washington and Colorado) were to replace all the B.C. bud being trafficked in those places, it would not make the same kind of dent (as California),” Werb said.

The question for law enforcement and health policy researchers right now is how the local cannabis industry will change or compensate for the smaller U.S. market.

“There are obvious pressures on the export of B.C. bud because of policy changes elsewhere,” said Werb, who is in the early stages of a study that will look at the impact of U.S. drug policy changes on B.C.’s lucrative industry.

“Are people who are in control of the market here going to shift to other industries? Are they going to shift to other drugs? What’s going to happen? That’s something we need to know.”

While figures on the underground marijuana economy are guesstimates at best, the illegal trade earns real dough that goes toward local goods and services and business, which may influence the provincial economy as a whole.

“If you compare the size of the (marijuana) revenues to B.C.’s GDP, it’s way up there,” said Werb. “The entire market has estimates that suggest it is comparable to the forestry sector or mining sector in B.C. In fact, estimates suggest it’s larger. We’re talking about billions in revenue.”

Marijuana activist Jodie Emery, whose husband Marc Emery is serving the last two weeks of a five-year jail term for selling marijuana seeds to the U.S. in the ’90s, believes B.C. will undoubtedly feel ripple effects, from “car dealerships to Rolex shops and house sales.”

The money may be illicit, she said, but it goes into the legitimate economy.

“People who grow pot and sell it, whether they’re mom-and-pop types or big-time gangsters, they spend their money in restaurants and stores and (on) clothing and cars.

“There’s a lot of money out there,” Emery said, pointing out it’s money that’s off-limits to law-abiding Canadians and benefits mostly “unsavoury characters.”

With Oregon and Alaska voting on the legalization of recreational marijuana in November, Emery thinks B.C.’s marijuana money woes will only get worse.

“We’re going to be squeezed through … overgrown on both sides. One day we will be importing pot from Washington State. I hope not.”

Not everyone is convinced the B.C. economy is going to feel an impact.

SFU economist Stephen Easton, who wrote a 2004 report on marijuana growth in B.C., said there will no “apocalyptic” repercussions for B.C. due to growers or dealers losing their purchasing power.

“They’d have to go get other jobs,” he said.

Very few people are full-time marijuana growers, unless they’re members of organized crime, said Easton: “Most people will also have other jobs and they’ll just have to change the balance of how much work they do.”

The B.C. finance ministry said it has not commented on the issue because marijuana is a federally regulated substance and its economic impact cannot be measured.

Starring the late Paul Walker in one of his last roles, ""Brick Mansions"" packs gunfights, car chases, acrobatic stunts and humour into one stylized package.

Adrenalin runs high in the entertaining, action-heavy remake of the 2004 French film ""District B13."" Starring the late Paul Walker in one of his last roles, ""Brick Mansions"" packs gunfights, car chases, acrobatic stunts and humour into one stylized package.

In the urban ghetto of Detroit, which has been surrounded by a containment wall, narcotics officer Damien (Walker) goes undercover and teams with ex-con Lino (David Belle) to infiltrate a crew of criminals and defuse a confiscated bomb.

Originally set for a February release, the film comes five months after Walker’s death in a car accident and it was a bit unsettling to see him running around in the future. But his love for action roles comes through clearly in this movie. From the detailed fight scenes to the subtle humour, Walker was in his element. He’s as gutsy and charming as ever.

Wu-Tang Clan rapper RZA plays crime lord Tremaine. As the ring leader of the slums, RZA looks the part. But rarely do you believe a word he says when he attempts to be threatening. There’s too much hesitation and not enough conviction. Later, Tremaine reveals redeeming qualities, which RZA embodies with more believability.

There’s an element of camp to this movie as well, which allows those who aren’t the best actors — Walker included — to prompt a few laughs.

""Brick Mansions"" was directed by newbie Camille Delamarre and written by Luc Besson, who also wrote ""District B13."" Like the original, ""Mansions"" is set in the near future, although there’s really nothing in the film that shows us we’re a few years ahead other than the ""2018"" that is flashed on the screen.

The many fight sequences were choreographed using a technique called Parkour, which was created by Belle, also a star in the original film. Parkour incorporates vaulting, flipping, swinging, rolling, etc., to move through various obstacles in a scene. The action is frozen for a split second during many of these moves and extreme close-ups put us right in the action.

At times the Parkour technique requires the ability to suspend disbelief, especially when a character is jumping from one rooftop to another, climbing brick walls or overpowering as many as four men at once.

Focused on finding Tremaine, who he believes killed his father, Damien’s motivation is rooted in revenge. Lino’s subplot revolves around his ex-girlfriend, Lola. Tremaine has dragged her into the slums, which she had worked hard to escape. But she’s no damsel in distress.

Lola can fight and handle a gun — all while showing off quite a bit of leg in a waitress outfit that looks like a truncated schoolgirl uniform. At one point, Lola and the main dame in Tremaine’s clique, Rayzah (Ayisha Issa), who sports a tiny leather ensemble, duke it out. Though it’s a clichéd fantasy come to life, it’s still a hot scene.

At the heart of the film is the social commentary focusing on a community divided. Within Brick Mansions, there is no school, hospital or police station, and those who live there are mostly minorities. It’s made clear that the government could care less about the Brick folks, as they’re said to contribute nothing to society.

This is not a film that will shift anyone’s moral compass. But it’s worth it to see Walker in the last film he was able to complete.

""Brick Mansions,"" a Relativity Media release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""frenetic gunplay, violence and action throughout, language, sexual menace and drug material.""

SEATTLE — Global warming is already altering forest landscapes in the U.S. Northwest, increasing wildfire risks and threatening coastal communities, according to a new federal scientific report released Tuesday.

The National Climate Assessment provides a detailed look at the regional and state-level effects of climate change. It lists key concerns for Washington, Idaho and Oregon:

WATER RELATED CHALLENGES

Regional warming has been linked to changes in the amount and the timing of snowmelt, which provides a bulk of the region’s water supply, the report says.

Declining snowpack and changes in the snowmelt timing are already happening and will continue, reducing the supply of water for farming, communities and fish.

Without changes, annual hydropower production is much more likely to decrease than to increase in the Columbia River basin; such hydropower changes could cost millions of dollars a year.

COASTAL VULNERABILITY

Rising sea level, erosion and ocean acidification pose a major threat to infrastructure, ecosystems and economic activity, the report says.

As sea levels continue to rise, more than 140,000 acres of coastal lands in Washington and Oregon that lie within 3.3 feet in elevation of high tide will be inundated more frequently.

The rising acidity of the ocean also threatens oysters and other marine food web, such as Pacific salmon, while increasing coastal water temperatures and changing conditions may alter how well certain marine species survive.

IMPACTS ON FOREST

Climate change will alter Northwest forests by increasing wildfire risk and insect and tree disease outbreaks, and by forcing long-term shifts in forest types and species, the report says.

Those impacts are already causing widespread tree die-offs and are certain to cause more forest die-offs by 2040.

Though wildfires are natural events in the Northwest, warmer and drier conditions have helped boost the number and extent of wildfires in U.S. Western forests since 1970s, and that trend is expected to continue.

Higher temperatures and outbreaks of mountain pine beetles, for example, area increasing pine tree die-offs in drier forests.","2014-05-07 00:00:00","0","2.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","161.0","182.0","0.0","74.0","1.0","4.0","1","360","94.09","53.33","48.89","25.77","27.69","35.28","66.11","34.72","1.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.67","6.39","12.50","4.72","3.06","7.78","0.28","8.06","4.72","3.33","0.56","1.39","1.67","4.44","2.22","2.22","2.22","1.11","0.00","2.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.22","0.83","3.61","0.56","0.56","0.56","1.39","3.33","0.28","0.83","1.67","1.94","0.28","0.28","0.00","1.39","4.17","0.83","0.56","1.94","0.00","1.94","1.67","6.39","1.39","19.17","4.44","9.44","5.56","2.78","0.00","0.00","0.83","0.00","0.83","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","13.89","5.28","6.39","0.28","0.28","0.00","0.00","1.39","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","1935","9.17","28.076923076923077","569","355","17","50.26","13.2","11.4","15.66","15.8","101","6.833333333333333","21.740281690140847","198","25.69","15","0.33","0","22","6","25","0","38","33","4","3","5","67","39","0","41","0","0","1","0","8","2","0","0","9","0","12","5","18","5","7","13","1","0","0","1"

For the same amount of water used for the same purpose, the provincial government charges up to $1.10.

This story originally ran in The Province on Nov. 1, 2013.

—

For gas companies doing hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" near Dawson Creek, the city charges $4,500 per million litres of water. For the same amount of water used for the same purpose, the provincial government charges up to $1.10.

Dawson Creek’s director of infrastructure said that gas companies in the region have no problem paying the rate of $4.50 per thousand litres. He said the fee’s introduction a few years ago drew little concern from the corporations and did not decrease industrial operations in the area.

Meanwhile, the provincial government charges $1.10 per 1,000 cubic metres for water used in fracking. That works out to less than a penny per thousand litres, or less than 0.03 per cent of the rate charged by Dawson Creek.

The stark gap highlights the difficulty of pricing such an invaluable resource – and critics say it also suggests the province is forgoing substantial revenues.

Dawson Creek’s $4.50 charge includes a $1.90 levy specifically for industrial users, the vast majority of which are fracking operations, said Kevin Henderson, Dawson Creek’s director of infrastructure and sustainable development. ""The $4.50 is a higher rate for industrial uses because council realized as well that it’s a precious resource,"" Henderson said.

With the B.C. government’s Water Sustainability Act proposal in its public consultation period until Nov. 15, critics are calling on government to raise water prices for industry.

Geoff Morrison, manager of B.C. operations for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said gas companies are paying close attention to the proposed Water Sustainability Act. ""Competitiveness is important for us and fairness is important, and how we arrive at those two things is part of the discussion.""

Morrison added that the disparity in water prices for fracking is not necessarily an ""apples to apples"" comparison because of complexities, including who bears the cost of infrastructure.

Ben Parfitt, who wrote about Dawson Creek’s water in a recent report called ""Counting Every Drop,"" said Morrison’s point is valid, and that a straight comparison between rates is not simple.

""But I feel very comfortable saying that somewhere between the extremely low price (charged by the province) and the extremely high price (in Dawson Creek) is probably a figure that’s closer to the mark of what should be paid,"" said Parfitt.

(with video)","B.C.’s top doctor is calling for electronic cigarettes and “vaping” to be regulated after an 11-year-old was able to buy one in a Tsawwassen corner store.

B.C.’s top doctor is calling for electronic cigarettes and “vaping” to be regulated after an 11-year-old was able to buy one in a Tsawwassen corner store.

But one anti-smoking activist said the relatively new products — which allow users to inhale vapour that’s been flavoured and in some cases infused with nicotine — are difficult to regulate because they exist in a grey zone.

The province’s chief medical officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, and others concede not enough evidence exists to determine whether puffing on the battery-operated inhaler without producing “smoke” is dangerous, but he said everyone should avoid it.

“Sucking up vapour that’s got ethylene glycol and other chemicals in it is properly not a good idea,” he said. “I can’t see why people would want to.”

“The bigger public health concern is that vaping — it’s a verb now — would become an acceptable social habit. Young children are vaping. It’s just a gateway to smoking.”

B.C. health officials are writing to schools to ban it from schoolyards and drafting a letter to urge Health Canada to regulate the devices.

“They should be restricted to people over 19 years,” said Kendall.

Joe Braico of Delta said his 11-year-old son called for him to check out an e-cigarette that vaporized a blueberry-flavoured substance the boy had bought from a local lottery store.

“He said, ‘Hey, Dad, look,’ and he’s trying to blow a smoke ring with this thing,” said Braico.

Braico returned to the store, the Tsawwassen Lottery Centre at Tsawwassen Town Centre Mall, and the woman who sold the $10 device to him assured him there was no nicotine in it and told him it was like candy.

She told him there was nothing illegal about selling to children.

“I don’t think it’s appropriate for an 11-year-old boy,” said Braico.

The staffer, who said her name was Nanshim and had limited English, told The Province she sold the e-cigarette.

“It’s not illegal,” she said, saying she sold it to “not many children. They are very curious. It’s just for fun.”

Braico said he discovered many of his son’s friends had the same device and said sales should be restricted, although he doesn’t oppose their sale to adults.

“My friends at work are using them to quit smoking and they’re loving them,” he said.

E-cigarettes with nicotine are marketed online as a way to quit smoking and Kendall conceded they may be less harmful than a traditional cigarette, which has 4,000 toxins, including 60 to 70 carcinogens.

But the nicotine version cannot legally be sold in Canada because it would then require approval by Health Canada, said spokesman Gary Holub. And neither can manufacturers claim any health benefits without Health Canada’s review and approval, he said.

Products without health claims or known toxic ingredients can be sold in Canada and “the onus is on the manufacturer that they do not pose a danger to human health or safety,” he said.

Health Canada in 2009 issued a product safety warning, “advising Canadians not to purchase or use electronic smoking products, as these products may pose health risks and have not been fully evaluated for safety, quality and efficacy by Health Canada.” Holub said the advisory still stands.

Veda Peters of the B.C. Lung Association said e-cigarette makers are careful not to make any claims for their products as a quit-smoking tool so that they won’t be subject to government review.

She said there isn’t enough research done on the devices to prove they’re harmful, but she worries that it would reverse the public health efforts to ensure children and others are getting the message that smoking kills.

“We would hate to see the hand-to-mouth action of a white stick becoming normal again,” she said.

Paul Bergen of the Electronic Cigarette Trade Association of Canada told the Delta Optimist that e-cigarettes are safe and designed as adult pleasures.

He also said retailers usually refuse sales to minors and called the Delta sale an anomaly.

Melodie Tilson of the Non-Smokers Rights Association in Ottawa said her group doesn’t insist on banning the devices and they may help people quit smoking, but she said the federal government needs to regulate them, especially so they aren’t sold to children.

She said it may be necessary to create a new law to do so if it can’t be done within the current regulatory framework.

“They’re in a regulatory grey zone,” she said.

Kendall said B.C. may be able to regulate them as a “health impediment,” as was done recently with trans fats.

Mayor Gregor Robertson says he’s disappointed with an Elections B.C. decision to prohibit candidates in the municipal election from using social media.

Until polls close on Saturday night, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other social media outlets are off-limits for candidates and political organizations running in the municipal election.

According to Elections B.C., the Local Elections Campaign Financing Act prohibits candidates and electoral organizations from using social media on general voting day, including tweeting about where to vote, sending private messages on Facebook and sending mass emails.

Sending out such messages would be considered advertising, and candidates cannot sponsor new advertising or alter their existing advertising on election day.

The mayor, who was in the West End Saturday to accompany his three kids to vote, said not being able to tweet or use other social media is “really disappointing” for Vision staff.

“It’s not a good thing,” he said. “I disagree that we should be banned from social media on election day. Hopefully we will see that overturned soon. I hope that it doesn’t suppress the young vote today.”

Elections B.C.’s decision to ban candidates and their organizations from using social media was made in May, but Robertson said he only received final confirmation of that decision in the last 48 hours.

“It’s a last-minute ruling that is surprising and disappointing,” he said. “I think this has an impact on young voters, who certainly use social media more than the older generation.”

The social media ban applies to any account that may have been used in relation to campaigning.

Elections B.C. says candidates could potentially use a personal social media account in a non-political way, as long as that account was set up before they were ever a candidate and it has never mentioned the candidacy.

For example, if someone wants to use a personal Twitter account that has never in any way been linked to or referenced their candidacy to share a video of a puppy and a kitten doing something adorable, that could be allowed.

Personal, one-on-one emails to family and friends are OK, if they are not election advertising that promotes themselves or opposes other candidates. Personal, one-on-one text messages to family and friends are also fine.

Individuals other than candidates, however, can use any social media to express their personal views on a non-commercial basis on general voting day, including promoting and opposing candidates or elector organizations.

Robertson said he was excited to see that it was a sunny day in Vancouver, and hoped that would boost voter turnout. “Hopefully we get a big turnout today, that’s the important thing, because we want as many people in Vancouver as possible to come out and vote.”

“I’m confident, I’m optimistic. I think we fought a really tough campaign and tried to be as positive as humanly possible,” said Robertson.

Hey Mike: You should be more than “disappointed.”

Finance Minister Mike de Jong is officially “disappointed” at the latest news of under-the-table payments to public-sector executives in B.C.

Hey Mike: You should be more than “disappointed.” You should be mad as hell.

It started with revelations of unreported payments to executives at Kwantlen Polytechnic University, where president Alan Davis and another executive received $50,000 “pre-employment contracts” not properly disclosed to government.

Now comes word of even more.

The government says the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) has been overpaying the CEO of the B.C. Cancer Agency through a lucrative contract that was not properly approved.

Dr. Max Coppes was hired in 2012 for $500,000 a year, even though the government’s maximum salary cap for the position was $400,000.

Now the government has ordered that the good doctor’s salary be surgically reduced by 10 per cent as a “symbolic” gesture.

This is ridiculous. It’s not Coppes’s fault he accepted what was offered to him. The real culprits here are the people who approved the contract.

The government says Coppes’s contract was “negotiated” by Lynda Cranston, the former CEO of the PHSA. Cranston resigned last year after approving 118 raises for other health-care managers in contravention of government policy. But if Cranston negotiated the contract, who approved it? The PHSA board of directors?

“No, the board did not approve the contract, though they were aware an offer had been made,” PHSA spokeswoman Theresa Kennedy told me Wednesday.

Kennedy said the board members — who are still in place — assumed the contract met provincial salary guidelines, but they didn’t know what the guidelines were. Oh, that’s just great! Then why have a board of directors at all?

Meanwhile, the CEO of the Royal B.C. Museum also bagged bonus bucks that the government says it didn’t know about.

Jack Lohman was given a “secondary contract” that included more than $50,000 in perks and bonuses. Again, the payouts were not properly reported and approved.

The government’s response? De Jong says the government is cutting the museum’s $11.8-million annual operating grant by $53,000 as punishment.

Lohman’s contract, meanwhile, is being stripped of three annual business-class upgrades for flights to London, one of the unreported perks he received.

Once again, they are penalizing the wrong guy. It’s not Lohman’s fault he accepted a contract in good faith. And cutting the museum’s operating grant just penalizes the museum and the people who visit it.

Where are the consequences for the people who approved the perks and payoffs?

The government says Lohman’s secondary contract was “signed” by John Williams, the former chairman of the museum board.

Isn’t it interesting — and convenient — that the government is pinning this stuff on two officials no longer with the public service?

Was the secondary contract approved by the museum board? A museum spokesperson could not answer the question Wednesday.

Don’t wait for any heads to roll on this one. That’s not the way this government operates. When your money goes down the drain, they want you to forget the whole thing as quickly as possible.

Late in the winter of 1990, I sat in the bleachers of the old gymnasium at Burnaby’s St. Thomas More Collegiate and watched, for the first time, a Grade 10 kid named Steve Nash playing at the B.C. junior basketball championships with his high school team from Victoria.

Last week, just nine months shy of a quarter-century later, I sit with filmmaker Michael Hamilton in his south Surrey home, getting a personal screening of his latest project, Nash: A Documentary Film.

It doesn’t take long before snippets from the now famously fuzzy highlight reel that a high school-aged Nash sent college recruiters fill the screen.

The images shake and wobble. The focus is far from pristine. Yet like early newsreel footage, it has not only endured, but become even more stirring with the passing of time.

“Where,” I ask Hamilton, “have the last 25 years gone?”

THE REAL STORY

If we drafted a blueprint of everything a professional athlete should be to his family, his team, his community and his world, Steve Nash would be that guy.

But how to best tell that story when the subject in question — one named by Time Magazine in 2006 as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World — breaks so many of the stereotypes associated with the professional athlete?

“I guess, at the onset of the film, we were struggling a bit because in documentaries there is always some drama,” says Hamilton, the film’s producer, who began work on the movie in 2010 with co-director Corey Ogilvie.

“But that is something that we never had with Steve. He’s a pretty nice guy.

“Then the lightbulb went on for us. Why were we trying to find some kind of drama in a guy’s life, when there wasn’t any? He is the anomaly. He is the quintessential athlete who is doing it on his own terms.”

And thus over the course of the film, Nash grows from sketch to painting, its overall depth as a work eventually reflecting all of the shades and complexities of its subject: two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, filmmaker, father, humanitarian.

So much of the film’s strength, in fact, lies in the diversity of the interviews conducted by Hamilton — who met Nash years ago through mutual friends — and Ogilvie, because this isn’t just a basketball movie, and Nash isn’t just a basketball player.

“We don’t want people to think we have all of these celebrities in the film just to name-drop because all of them have a connection to Steve,” Hamilton says, laughing, alluding to the likes of actor Owen Wilson, director Ron Howard and even the most famous man in the world — the P.O.T.U.S.

FANS IN HIGH PLACES

Through the course of filming, Hamilton had learned that Marvin Nicholson, special assistant to U.S. president Barack Obama, was not only from Victoria, but also a graduate of St. Michaels University School, the same high school as Nash.

Nicholson agreed to be interviewed for the film, but then said to Hamilton: “You know what would be really cool? We might be able to get five minutes with the president, because he is a big fan of Steve’s.”

At various points over the next year, Hamilton figured it wasn’t going to happen. But in April of 2011, both he and Ogilvie found themselves at the White House.

“My heart is just pumping and Corey is miking up the president,” recalls Hamilton. “And then he says to us, ‘I just want you guys to know that this never happens.’ And it doesn’t. Never had a sitting president agreed to do an interview for something that isn’t related to politics or the State of the Union. But he did it for Steve and that is just a testament to Steve’s character and personality.”

Said Obama, in the film, of Nash: “People will look back at Steve as one of the greatest players of all time, and my suspicion is he’ll be in the Hall of Fame. But I think you’re measured not just by your skills and your wealth, but by your character. And by that standard, I think he’ll do very well.”

THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS

At one stage of the film, Nash is quoted as saying: “A lot of guys have been told since they were 13 or 14 years old that they were going to be in the NBA, whereas I was always told I would not be in the NBA.”

Placed amidst the images of a post-college, pre-NBA Nash, it’s a powerful image, and one which plays perfectly to the film’s recurring theme of an underdog who refused to quit.

Through self-narration, Nash is placed within the Myth of Sisyphus, the ancient Greek tale of a man condemned for eternity to roll a boulder to the top of a steep hill, only to have it come rolling back down just as he nears the peak.

“Corey is a big philosophy guy,” Hamilton says of Ogilvie, a former UBC Thunderbirds player.

“One day he and I were just sitting in a coffee shop and we were asking ourselves, ‘What is the narrative? What is our special thing?’ He came to me with this story and it’s amazing because it speaks exactly to Steve’s struggles.

“Every step of the way, Sisyphus is pushing this boulder up the hill. And there is something to be said for process. It’s a continual thing. And through the process, you get better and stronger, and in Steve’s career, that is what he has done.”

THE REAL STEVE NASH

Nash: A Documentary Film begins its journey within the pages of Nash’s family scrapbook, takes us through his early days with the Phoenix Suns, to his breakthrough years with the Dallas Mavericks, and later his triumphant return to the Suns. It concludes just as he leaves Phoenix for the start of a new chapter with the Los Angeles Lakers.

Along the way, no topic is taboo.

On a personal note, I have had the pleasure of interviewing Nash over the years on many stages.

On campus following practices at Santa Clara University; in his hotel room the night before the 1996 NBA draft; throughout his early days in the league, when our paths crossed in my capacity as The Province’s beat reporter covering the Vancouver Grizzlies; even in the back of a limo cruising through the streets of Philadelphia during his first all-star weekend in 2002.

The person I got to know is exactly the person portrayed in the film.

“Meeting all of these different people,” begins Hamilton, “from the people he grew up with to the President of the United States, they all say the same thing about the guy. They all took away a piece of Steve that was consistent across the board. And it was amazing to see that.”

Nash: A Documentary Film has completed a short theatrical run in Toronto, Vancouver and Victoria. It is now available across Canada on iTunes, and through both Shaw and Telus video-on-demand services. It is set to begin a U.S. release in advance of the 2014-15 NBA season.

Rock music brought Drew Burns a measure of fame and fortune but left his heart cold.

Rock music brought Drew Burns a measure of fame and fortune but left his heart cold. His own passions ran to opera, jazz and blues.

Burns, who ran Vancouver’s Commodore Ballroom from 1969 to 1996, was open to any music that drew a thirsty crowd. In the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s, his calculating open-mindedness made Vancouver one of the best places in North America to see cutting-edge rock music.

Burns, who died a week ago at 81, brought everyone from Captain Beefheart to David Bowie to The Clash to the Commodore.

“Drew wasn’t a fan of punk rock,” says Vancouver musician and writer Aaron Chapman. “But he was smart enough to realize that if kids liked it, he would do well selling drinks. He knew that all sorts of musical styles could work at the Commodore.”

Chapman learned of Burns’s death mere hours before his new book about the Commodore was to go to the printer. He had just enough time to make last-minute changes to reflect the passing of the man who discovered the ballroom’s soul as its longtime operator. The book, Live at the Commodore: The Story of Vancouver’s Historic Commodore Ballroom, is being published Nov. 1 by Arsenal Pulp Press.

The Commodore Cabaret, which opened on Granville Street in 1930, spent much of its first four decades catering to the jazz- and crooner-inflected tastes of the day. Patrons in gowns and tuxes danced to jazz big bands or swing combos, swigging from contraband liquor bottles hidden under tables.

But the Commodore was always waiting for Drew Burns. He was the visionary who saw what it could become — a showcase for the world’s leading pop musicians that also nurtured homegrown talent.

Burns, who had been running a Vancouver group for singles called the Fifth Day Club, leased the building in 1969, got a liquor licence and changed the name to the Commodore Ballroom.

At the start, he was a bit clueless.

“What am I going to do with this place?” he asked himself at night, standing alone in the silent ballroom, Chapman reports.

Burns spent the next 27 years answering that question. He rampaged through musical genres to book a vast and multi-faceted array of performers: James Brown, Muddy Waters, Kiss, Iggy Pop, The Police, Nirvana and U2, to name only a few.

“He sort of spoiled Vancouver,” Chapman says in an interview. “The city became the beginning or the end of many bands’ North American tours.

“Drew cross-pollinated local musicians with big acts from other places.”

Burns presented his first rock show at the Commodore in July 1971. It featured Detroit-based singer Mitch Ryder. Burns lost money on it because he had to pay a high guarantee to Ryder. Still, the event gave Burns a taste of the future.

Not every show proved to be an artistic or commercial victory.

Of a New York Dolls show in 1974, The Province rock critic Jeani Read wrote: “The New York Dolls are two million dollars’ worth of hype, and two cents’ worth of talent. They have a song called Trash and that describes them perfectly.”

Other shows were aesthetic triumphs but hygienic catastrophes, Chapman writes. In 1981, a vodka-gulping Joe Cocker fled the stage to vomit in a backstage toilet, rinse his face and return to deliver a scorching performance.

In 1978, Patti Smith became the first punk performer to sell out the Commodore. She asked Bud Wandrei, who worked for concert promoter Perryscope, for towels to take a bath backstage.

The backstage tub hadn’t been used for a bath in 20 years. It had been regularly used for almost every vile purpose.

Wandrei awkwardly told Smith that she didn’t want to take a bath in there.

“Oh, it’s OK — I’ll rinse it out afterward,” Smith reportedly answered.

Burns was blessed with a high tolerance for risk that let him take a chance on acts that had yet to become well known.

“He had a gambler’s guts,” Chapman says. “Another person who wasn’t as open-minded might have passed on them.”

One of Burns’s great skills was knowing what he didn’t know, Chapman says. He sought advice from music journalists and young employees about the merits of different bands.

“If he was unsure, he would call and pick my brain,” says arts publicist Ellie O’Day, who was then working part-time in radio.

DOA singer-guitarist Joe Keithley says Burns accepted punk music at a time other club operators feared its sometimes abrasive practitioners.

“If you get 500 people in here and the bar’s active, I’m happy,” Keithley recalls Burns telling him. “Play whatever you want.”

Burns wasn’t about just maximizing the bottom line. He went out of his way to help struggling local bands by getting them gigs as opening acts or packaging multiple bands for a show.

“He would give breaks to all kinds of people,” says Zulu Records owner Grant McDonagh. “He was one of the handshake generation whose word is gold.”

Burns left the Commodore in 1996 following a quarrel with the building’s owners. But Live Nation Entertainment, the company that now leases the Commodore, has kept alive his vision of the venue as a haven for top-notch global and local musicians.

“Drew has been our mentor and has guided us through the years,” says Gord Knights, who became general manager when the Commodore reopened after its closure from 1996 to ’99. “Music in Vancouver wouldn’t be what it is today if it weren’t for Drew.

“Anybody that was touched by Drew found their lives changed for the better.”

In the years since Burns’s departure, Knights and his team have managed to build on Burns’s vision of the Commodore as a music hub. And they’ve done it at a time many young people are as inclined to go see a DJ as they are flesh-and-blood musicians, Chapman says.

Among the memorable Commodore performances during the past 15 years have been those given by the White Stripes, Coldplay, Tom Waits, The Black Keys, The Roots and Lady Gaga, Chapman says.

Vancouver band 54-50 has played the ballroom more than 50 times, holding the record for most appearances.

But the current operators have broadened the Commodore’s showbiz palette beyond music. Its talent buyers have booked comedy acts such as Adam Carolla and have embraced, so to speak, wrestling by erecting a ring in the middle of the dance floor.

In 2011, Billboard magazine ranked the Commodore as one of the 10 most influential concert venues in North America. It took its place alongside legendary halls such as the Fillmore in San Francisco, the Bowery Ballroom in New York, the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., and the Troubadour in West Hollywood.

“The Commodore is the oldest club on the list and the only Canadian club,” Chapman says.

The Commodore’s sprung floor, which has put a bounce beneath the feet of generations of dancers, has long been part of its enduring charm, Chapman says.

Burns’s innermost mojo may not always have been stirred by the music of the bands he booked but he genuinely cared about the human beings in those bands, those who knew him say. In a business that had its cutthroat side, Burns is said to have been a decent person.

“He was a completely straightforward, totally nice guy,” Keithley says. “There was no ‘I’m better than you.’ He was just welcoming.”

Chapman says Burns’s love for people generated a goodwill that helped the Commodore prosper.

“In those days, if someone else had taken over the Commodore without Drew’s openness, imagination and fun-loving spirit, I don’t think it would have survived. It would have been demolished and become another long-forgotten ballroom.”

The Commodore’s future is not to be taken for granted. Chapman quotes Live Nation Canada senior vice-president Erik Hoffman as saying the club, for which the operating costs are “astronomical,” has been at risk several times.

“It’s on prime real estate,” Hoffman says. “It doesn’t make good business sense on its own to run the ballroom.”

But the Commodore has symbiotic value as a musical nursery and dating service. For bands, it acts as a springboard to playing stadiums. It lets Live Nation form a connection with bands that go on to play those arenas.

“The successful shows we do at the arenas allow us to take chances on bands in smaller venues, to book new talent, so one feeds the other,” Hoffman says in Chapman’s book. “The Commodore is at the cornerstone of this process.”

BLONDIE TO B.B. KING TO THE CLASH

The Commodore Ballroom hit its stride in the late ’70s and early ’80s, mounting many of its best-loved shows.

But the single month of January 1979 is remembered as an early creative peak. January saw a string of remarkable performances scattered like pearls across its 31 days, says Aaron Chapman, author of Live at the Commodore.

New wave band Blondie kicked the month off with its Vancouver debut on Jan. 2. Four days later, New York punkers The Ramones returned for a sold-out show with local band D.O.A. as the opening act.

Vancouver fans of new wave music had just enough time to catch their breath before Devo made its Vancouver debut with two shows on Jan. 12. The band’s then controversial music stunned concertgoers.

Country singer Tanya Tucker played on Jan. 13, followed by venerated bluesman B.B. King on Jan. 16 and 17.

For some, the month’s highlight was the North American debut of British punk band The Clash. American rock ’n’ roller Bo Diddley was the opening act.

“As with the nights that Captain Beefheart, the New York Dolls, or Kiss played the Commodore, the Clash show is remembered as a you-had-to-be-there, unforgettable night in the ballroom’s history,” Chapman writes.

A B.C. Supreme Court judge granted Beverly Mary Abraham’s request for dismissal on Friday.

One of the women who accused former Vancouver Olympic CEO John Furlong of sexual abuse has withdrawn her lawsuit.

A B.C. Supreme Court judge granted Beverly Mary Abraham’s request for dismissal on Friday.

Just over four months ago, Abraham lost her brother and shortly after her cousin and her 16-year-old nephew both died. Then, a month ago, her 91-year-old mother broke her leg and Abraham said she felt like she couldn’t deal with the stress of the lawsuit.

She said after speaking with her husband and hereditary chief, “it was time to let it go.” She said she stands by her allegations but she is too tired and stressed out to continue.

“A lot of weight came off my shoulders. I felt a hundred times lighter instead of dragging all these problems around,” she said Tuesday morning from her home in Burns Lake. “I just want to give it up to God. I told the truth. That’s all that matters. It hurts me deeply inside when I think of all the people that supported me saying ‘way to go Bev.’ It seems to me I let them down, but I had to take care of myself too.”

The allegations surfaced following an article, published two years ago in the Georgia Straight and written by Laura Robinson, suggesting he physically and verbally abused First Nations students at Burns Lake while teaching at a Catholic school there in the late 1960s.

Furlong has stated that he is innocent and that the allegations against him are false and defamatory. He still faces suits from Grace Jessie West and an unidentified man, both of whom allege they were sexually assaulted by Furlong.

His lawyer, Claire Hunter, said in a statement that Furlong has always maintained that all three claims are false.

“The dismissal follows the RCMP’s conclusion following an investigation that, ‘Based on the facts uncovered, the allegations made by Beverly Abraham are not supported.’”

She said Furlong will not comment with respect to the two outstanding claims because they remain before the courts.

Furlong has said previously that the article had “devastating and pulverizing consequences” on him and his family, and that he wished only to take action against “the source of these lies.”

He dropped a lawsuit against the Georgia Straight but is continuing a defamation suit against Robinson. He alleges that Robinson has a “personal vendetta” against him.

Abraham said her case was dismissed by consent without costs to either party. In her claim, Abraham alleged Furlong sexually molested her 12 times when she was 11 years old and attending the school. She also alleged Furlong justified his touching by saying, “You’re my beautiful Indian girl and my protege,” and his “favourite of all the girls.”

Furlong still faces suits from Grace Jessie West and an unidentified man, both of whom allege they were sexually assaulted by Furlong.

None of the allegations has been proven in court.

Then they made a comedy about the apocalypse (This Is the End) and turned that into a hit as well. And as the now-shelved assassination comedy The interview was being filmed last year in B.C., everyone involved was thinking Seth Rogen and co-director Evan Goldberg had another hit on their hands.

They made a comedy about cancer (50/50) and scored a hit. Then they made a comedy about the apocalypse (This Is the End) and turned that into a hit as well.

And as the now-shelved assassination comedy The interview was being filmed last year in B.C., everyone involved was thinking Seth Rogen and co-director Evan Goldberg had another hit on their hands.

“I think the crew is laughing more on this than on anything we’ve ever done,” said Goldberg as they filmed in a Burnaby soundstage interior set meant to be North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s mountain palace.

The movie, which stars Rogen and James Franco as two clueless journalists coerced into a plot to assassinate dictator Kim (actor Randall Park), was abruptly pulled from release this week and may never be seen at all after distributor Sony Pictures was crippled by a corporate cyber attack now linked to rogue dictatorship North Korea. Sony opted to cancel altogether the Dec. 25 release date after anonymous hackers subsequently threatened 9/11-style terrorist reprisals against theatres that showed the film.

Rogen and Franco cancelled all media and print interviews last week just before the movie was pulled. But all of that was in the future last year as Goldberg, Rogen and Franco filmed a bawdy script that mixed politics with penis jokes.

“We did have to get another person to write the script because we’re not smart about politics,” said Goldberg, who has been writing scripts with Rogen since their high school days together at Point Grey secondary.

A fictional story about the assassination of a real-life dictator seems like an odd choice for a comedy — call it Zero Dark Superbad.

But when Rogen and Goldberg pitched their idea, Sony Pictures gave them a free hand.

“After This Is the End, they’re back into saying these guys can pull off wild stuff, so let’s just let them do whatever,” Goldberg said, adding all Sony was worried about when they were making the movie was that Franco should not have a beard, as he did in This Is the End.

“In this one we kept Franco real handsome . . . we had a huge battle over his facial hair in This Is the End.”

In that 2013 hit, Rogen, James Franco and several of their friends played themselves at a party interrupted by the apocalypse.

As it turns out, Franco’s facial hair or the lack thereof was the least of anyone’s worries.

The Interview’s fictional story originally formed around the notion of killing Osama bin Laden.

“Seth came to work one day and was like, if Charlie Rose or someone got an interview with bin Laden, why wouldn’t they just kill him, they’d be saving a lot of people,” Goldberg said. “We thought that’d be a good movie, then we went, ahh we’re too stupid to write it. But then we’re like what if we didn’t write it? What if we found someone who was smarter, and dumbed it down on our own?”

They enlisted writer Dan Sterling (The Daily Show, The Office), who shifted the story to a North Korean setting.

While the Middle East stirs debate from all sides, Goldberg said, North Korea was more straightforward.

“It’s a pretty cut-and-dried situation, s—’s crazy over there and it’s not cool,” Goldberg said. “People all generally agree they should have more freedom there.”

In Sterling’s script, actor Park plays the North Korean leader as a Katy Perry-loving pop-culture fan, who invites tabloid TV interviewer Dave Skylark (Franco) and his producer (Rogen) to North Korea for an interview. The CIA gets wind of the meeting, and coerces the journalists into an assassination plot.

“Leading up to it we’ve been heavily researching, which is the first time I’ve ever said that,” Goldberg said.

“We tried to make this realistic — the uniforms the wallpaper, the murals in the movie. The way people’s hair is cut the attitude of the people . . . we’re not just like loosey goosey doing a new North Korea. We’ve got some professors to look at it and nobody told us it’s bulls—.”

North Korea had figured in movie comedy before, in 2004’s Team America: World Police, which mocked Kim’s father, the late Kim Jong Il. That movie made the news again last week when Vancouver’s Rio theatre and several U.S. independent theatres announced plans to screen it in place of The Interview. But distributor Paramount kiboshed that idea by refusing to make Team America: World Police available.

“It just got pulled,” said Rio programmer Rachel Fox. “We’re likely going to screen The Great Dictator at some point . . . unless Hitler has an objection.”

And the creative chill continues, with news that film producer New Regency has cancelled a March filming start for a North Korea-themed thriller called Pyongyang, which was to star Steve Carell.

FRANCO ON ROGEN: ‘THERE’S NO BOSS’

James Franco and Seth Rogen have been working together since 1999’s cult TV hit Freaks and Geeks, and as they filmed the now-shelved comedy The Interview in Vancouver last year, they were revelling in an unprecedented degree of creative control.“(The Interview) feels like all the other movies we’ve done, but with the added bonus of, the kids get to control, the kids are in the kitchen,” Franco said last year during a break in filming on a Burnaby soundstage. “There’s no boss, there’s no one overseeing anything anymore, so it feels very free and very creative. . . . We get to do exactly the movie that we want to do.”For his part, producer-director-star Rogen was still getting used to that free hand on set last year.“There’s a moment where I have to remind myself — we’re the ones who have to say whether or not it’s acceptable,” Rogen said. “We’re used to the idea that if it’s really bad, someone will say something. I always have to remind myself like, no, we’re the ones who have to say something.”Rogen was talking about the need to keep doing scenes until they were as strong as possible, but after The Interview sparked an international wave of cyber-crime against studio Sony Pictures, and threats of terrorism against theatres that showed the movie, he can likely expect more scrutiny on his next feature project.Franco and Rogen first met at the beginning of their careers, as castmates on Freaks and Geeks, a short-lived but critically acclaimed series about a group of high school misfits.“That was Seth’s first professional job as far as I know as an actor,” Franco said. Rogen was 17 when the show came out in 1999, and Franco was 21. “I was very fresh, I hadn’t done much.”Their careers have continued to intersect over subsequent years, as Franco went on to projects that included the three Spider-Man movies and his Oscar-nominated role in 127 Hours. Rogen, meanwhile, turned to writing for TV’s Undeclared and Da Ali G Show, with supporting roles including Undeclared and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, before his breakout starring role in 2007’s Knocked Up.Franco had a cameo in that latter film, and the two paired up to star in 2008’s pot comedy Pineapple Express, which Rogen also co-wrote and produced. They were together again in last year’s apocalyptic comedy This Is the End, Rogen’s directing debut.“What’s so impressive to me about what he does is that it’s a fully dimensional kind of creating,” Franco said. “He does all sides, and this directing thing is kind of the last step.”As with This Is the End, Rogen co-directed The Interview with his writing partner Evan Goldberg.“When they started This Is the End, it was perfect. They had done everything else, and now why not, why shouldn’t they direct?” Franco said, adding Rogen “learned so much . . . gradually just developing all the skills. Now he’s a fully rounded story teller and entertainer. He’s taken all the best ways of working from his earlier jobs.”Studio Sony insisted that This Is the End (in which Rogen, Franco and others played themselves at a party interrupted by the end of the world) film in New Orleans, and execs also worried about the movie’s oddball premise. When This Is the End was a better-than-expected audience hit, Rogen and Goldberg got more latitude for The Interview, including the OK to film in their hometown.","2014-12-19 00:00:00","0","2.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","159.0","180.0","0.0","74.0","1.0","4.0","1","1478","76.57","80.67","23.39","59.06","25.05","17.79","80.65","47.63","11.50","5.35","0.68","1.69","0.00","1.01","1.96","6.16","8.46","12.58","7.78","4.47","6.56","1.08","15.22","4.80","3.04","1.89","1.83","2.17","4.87","3.32","1.56","0.47","0.68","0.00","11.16","0.07","0.34","0.00","1.22","8.59","1.22","1.89","0.95","1.83","1.35","2.17","2.91","0.95","1.42","0.54","1.01","0.54","0.27","0.14","0.14","7.78","2.64","1.49","2.71","1.42","0.27","6.90","6.63","0.74","14.55","1.15","6.77","6.56","4.26","4.19","0.20","0.34","0.00","0.47","0.95","0.27","0.34","0.20","0.20","0.00","21.79","5.89","5.55","0.20","0.00","0.20","0.00","1.62","3.04","3.59","1.35","0.34","6637","7.16","24.206349206349206","2017","1432","74","68.7","11.2","8.5","11.14","11.3","232","5.642857142857143","16.240446927374304","600","21.83","27","0.47","1","53","22","162","0","162","93","4","2","6","239","189","0","48","3","0","79","17","72","3","0","5","33","0","38","113","36","35","37","41","11","10","0","10"

Long Hoh is a small Qualicum Beach lumber manufacturer serving a unique niche market in Japan.

In a series of conversations with workers and business operators, the Province and the non-profit society, Resource Works, explore the contributions that trade, industry, and natural resources make to the British Columbia economy. This week, we talk with Alan Chen, sales manager for Long Hoh Enterprises Canada. Long Hoh is a small Qualicum Beach lumber manufacturer serving a unique niche market in Japan.

Postmedia News: Long Hoh markets itself as a small manufacturer of forest products focusing on quality and sustainability. How did you get started?

Alan Chen: In the beginning, some immigrant families came here to try to continue their expertise in wood processing and making building components. They acquired land (at Qualicum Beach) and built from scratch. In 1997, the sawmill opened for business. They chose the location because of its proximity to the required resources, which are the logs.

People in B.C. take pride in their natural resources, and value their trees. With help of government and community we have a set of regulations and guidelines governing our practice. People are getting more and more cautious about where they are getting their wood. I believe the owners had great vision.

PM: Could you talk about the specialty products your clients require?

AC: Our core business is to supply temple components, especially to Japan. Shinto temples hold sacred objects, statues or artifacts passed down from generation to generation, and people can go worship or pray. The wood was once a living thing, so it’s easy for the spirits in these temples to accentuate each other.

Because Japan historically had an abundant lumber resource, it’s very natural that they chose wood as the material to build the temples. They try to build without any nails. Our job is to map out our logs and cut exactly what they want. We try not to make too much waste in doing so.

PM: I’m guessing that when you have an order to fill, you have to have it into a container and out of the yard (and then onto a ship) on a pretty tight set of deadlines?

AC: Once we cut the trees into lumber — and dry it — we bring in the container trucks, load the containers on-site. Then they’re transported over to the Vancouver area and loaded onto vessels.

Because we are a small company, we have learned to do everything ourselves. We have a great team that handles our logistics. We map out the time frame from the beginning of the cut to loading the containers and then set up a schedule for the trucking company as well as the shipping line.

PM: How long have you been with the company, and what are your duties?

AC: I joined Long Hoh in 2005 and I started as a quality control and inventory clerk. Now I’m in charge of about half of our sales. Whenever there is a training session opportunity, the company will provide me time and pay my tuition. I take all the courses I can and the company supports that.

PM: Does work keep you awake at night wondering about production and shipping schedules?

AC: I’m very fortunate that I have many skilled colleagues helping me. Our contract shows that our responsibility ends when our containers are loaded onto those vessels, but we do have moral obligations so we are only satisfied when our customers receive the wood with smiles on their faces.

PM: How do you like living at Qualicum Beach?

AC: In summer, tourists flock in to enjoy the forest, the beach, and the things that the little township and the vicinity have to offer. In the winter the cold and damp air stops all these activities — but it is only then the perfect time for nature to recuperate and get back on its feet.

I’m well aware that what we do has an effect on the beautiful landscape. Because our business is close to the resource we use, we can be closer to reaching the balance between reducing the environmental impacts and growing the local economy.","2014-05-11 00:00:00","0","53.0","5.0","6.0","0.0","31.0","0.0","227.0","244.0","0.0","225.0","1.0","34.0","5","706","78.72","88.83","36.82","68.54","16.42","23.09","81.44","50.14","12.75","8.50","1.84","3.82","1.27","0.00","1.56","4.25","8.92","13.31","6.94","3.82","7.79","0.28","11.05","3.68","1.42","1.70","0.71","1.42","3.12","2.69","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.20","0.14","0.14","0.00","0.00","6.09","0.85","2.27","0.28","1.42","0.85","0.99","0.85","0.28","0.00","0.57","0.71","0.28","0.42","0.00","0.00","10.48","4.82","1.70","2.69","1.70","0.28","1.56","9.49","0.85","15.58","1.13","9.92","4.67","8.07","1.13","0.28","2.41","1.27","0.00","0.42","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.28","0.00","13.74","5.38","3.97","1.70","0.00","0.85","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.99","0.57","0.00","3229","7.49","16.58139534883721","1002","706","43","71.75","10.7","7.3","10.03","9.2","136","8.0","16.26538243626062","337","15.12","22","0.5","0","32","2","71","0","82","37","2","1","4","109","58","0","53","2","0","48","21","24","1","0","3","22","0","29","13","17","9","44","16","3","3","0","6"

Tom Bradley has been in the investment industry for more than 30 years: he has been a equity analyst, a portfolio manager, an executive (he was the chief executive at Phillips Hager & North, one of country’s oldest institutional money managers that was sold to the Royal Bank in 2008) and the founder of another money manager, Steadyhand Investment Funds.

And when he set up that manager he did it his way with a model based on no loads, low fees and external management. Bradley also writes a blog where talks about his investment philosophy and also what he doesn’t like. As a generalization he doesn’t like products that come with high fees, too much structuring, and where it’s not clear how much the investor will gain.

“We’ve built a firm around the way we want our own money managed. And we provide a level of service and reporting that makes sense to us. This means your experience with Steadyhand is likely to be a little, well, different than what you may be used to,” says a posting on its web site.

This week Bradley wrote a blog that has attracted considerable interest given that the material focused on the interests of investors and where they stand in the pecking order. (The short answer is not very high.)

The chances are that the Royal Bank, in particular, won’t take too kindly to what he wrote given that he referenced one of its products. But it’s not a difficult jump to take his comments and apply them to the product manufacturers in general.

Indeed Bradley seems to be invoking retail investors to ask two questions: “what’s in it for me? And what’s in it for the issuer or the agents.” After all it’s their money.","2014-11-07 23:02:00","0","2.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","160.0","181.0","0.0","74.0","1.0","4.0","1","323","61.51","66.77","10.01","60.99","23.07","20.43","89.16","52.94","14.86","6.81","0.31","1.55","0.62","3.41","0.93","8.05","8.98","12.38","8.67","5.26","6.19","2.79","15.17","6.19","2.79","3.72","1.55","2.17","3.10","2.48","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.31","8.05","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.41","9.91","2.17","2.79","0.31","1.55","1.24","2.79","1.55","0.62","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.29","1.55","0.93","5.88","1.24","0.31","4.33","9.91","1.24","11.76","0.93","8.98","1.55","10.53","0.62","0.00","6.81","0.00","0.00","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.31","0.31","0.00","17.03","4.02","4.64","0.62","0.00","0.31","0.00","0.00","1.24","4.64","1.24","0.31","1442","7.47","25.76923076923077","453","323","14","64.95","12.3","9.9","10.04","12.1","55","23.75","18.051145510835916","175","22.85","0","0.53","0","13","5","34","0","39","23","1","1","3","54","17","1","20","0","0","23","8","15","0","0","1","9","0","9","10","1","10","8","15","3","5","0","7"

The accord was signed as Premier Christy Clark, bringing with her what she described as possibly the largest B.C. delegation to Ottawa in Canadian history, declared that the LNG sector could be a “nation-builder” at least as important as Alberta’s oil wealth.

But she said that the industry’s enormous LNG potential depends on access to skilled Canadian and, if necessary, foreign workers.

Without that workforce the industry could look for other opportunities, she warned.

“You cannot build an economy without people who are trained and ready to take those jobs,” she told a gathering of federal and B.C. politicians.

The memorandum of understanding says Canada’s resources industry “is a significant economic catalyst in rural and remote regions that is becoming increasingly important to British Columbia’s economy and strategically important to Canada’s economic future.”

The growing global demand for those resources, including LNG, “has created a highly competitive global environment, requiring Canada and British Columbia to move quickly and responsibly to ensure Canada’s energy industry is export-ready.”

The meeting, and an elaborate signing ceremony between B.C. and federal ministers, appeared designed to send a message to industry that the federal and B.C. governments will move aggressively to ensure that Canada’s training, educational, and especially immigration policies will help the LNG sector expand.

But both Clark and her federal cabinet colleagues stressed that the temporary workers won’t be allowed to take jobs away from qualified Canadians.

The TFW has been plagued by abuses, and the federal government has recently taken steps to toughen sanctions against employers who use it to abuse vulnerable foreign workers and drive down wages.

“Our commitment is this: British Columbians first, Canadians second, and then when we have maxed out every opportunity to put Canadians to work on these projects we will need to begin to look oversees for temporary workers,” she told reporters after speaking to a gathering of LNG industry executives, First Nations leaders, federal MPs and senior federal ministers and officials.

B.C. wants at least three LNG terminals in operation by 2020, and is anxious to quell industry concerns about potential wage inflation that hurt the industry in Australia.

B.C. Jobs Minister Shirley Bond said the industry executives who expressed that concern were impressed with the level of cooperation shown here Monday by both levels of government.

“What we’re trying to avoid is what happened in Australia” where wage inflation caused by a shortage of workers created “significant issues,” Bond told The Vancouver Sun.

“We’re hearing today (from industry attending the session) that this is the first time we’ve seen this kind of cooperation early in the process, where both senior levels of government understand this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and we need to be working together.”

David Keane, an executive with BG Canada, one of the LNG proponents, and a member of Clark’s working group on labour-related LNG issues, said the industry doesn’t want to be faced with the kind of “overly restrictive immigration policies” that caused problems in Australia.

“I think the federal government is working with the provincial government so we can address those issues,” said Keane.

Bond said Victoria is enthusiastic about the federal government’s new “expressions of interest” immigration program, which takes effect next January.

That program will actively prioritize foreigners who have skills being sought by Canadian companies.

Premier Christy Clark speaks to reporters in the Foyer of the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Monday, March 31, 2014. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Sean Kilpatrick/THE CANADIAN PRESS

OTTAWA — The federal government is making it harder, not easier, for employers like B.C.’s natural gas industry to bring in temporary foreign workers, Employment Minister Jason Kenney said Tuesday.

Kenney was responding to New Democratic Party allegations that governments are using the excuse of a possible West Coast natural gas boom to bring in an even larger number of temporary workers who will drive down wages and cost Canadian jobs.

The NDP’s criticism was focused on the Ottawa-B.C. non-binding agreement struck Monday on resource development that includes a commitment that the federal government continue its controversial Temporary Foreign Workers program.

The Harper government has “made it more difficult to bring in temporary foreign workers,” Kenney said.

“I was absolutely clear yesterday with the B.C. liquefied natural gas industry that it must employ and train Canadians first, particularly young Canadians and aboriginal Canadians, and only look to the TFW program as a last and very limited resort.”

Premier Christy Clark brought executives from the liquefied natural gas industry to Ottawa Monday to discuss their need for skilled workers.

Both levels of government made clear that Canada’s education and training systems won’t be enough to produce all the skilled workers needed, meaning that both immigrants and temporary migrants will be needed to meet the LNG sector’s needs.

But the NDP argued in Parliament Tuesday that the non-binding agreement that includes clear support for the temporary worker program is a cover to allow industry to bypass Canadians in favour of foreigners with no legal right to stay permanently in Canada.

“Projects like B.C.’s natural gas development (should provide) a generation of quality, decent-paying jobs for British Columbians,” Jinny Sims, the MP for Newton-North Delta, said during question period.

“Why are Conservatives making it easier to bring in even more temporary foreign workers when there are plenty of Canadians who could do the job?”

She later said in an interview that the true objective of the program is to lower Canadian wages, even though the government had dropped a provision allowing employers in some circumstances to pay foreign workers 15 per cent less than Canadians.

Kenney said during question period that Sims is one of a number of MPs, including B.C. New Democrats Libby Davies, Nathan Cullen, Alex Atamanenko and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, who have written supportive letters on behalf of constituents trying to bring in foreign workers.

“The hypocrisy from the NDP on this question is really bizarre,” Kenney said.

Sims said she recalls sending a letter to the government in connection with a constituent’s frustration in getting a visa for a worker who had legitimately obtained permission from the federal government.

But she said that move wasn’t an indication she supports the program.

Data was unavailable Tuesday to indicate whether the Harper government’s recent harder line on temporary workers, in the face of numerous controversies over employee abuse, has had an affect.

The government imposed a $275 application fee on employers, insists that only English and French can be required languages, and is planning to bring in tougher sanctions that include “significant” fines, though the government won’t yet say how large they could be.

Over the long term, however, temporary foreign workers have flowed into Canada at a record pace. While the intake was relatively flat in the 1990s, peaking at 164,972 such workers in 1999, the number started growing dramatically starting in 2004. And since the Conservatives took power in 2006 the figure has almost doubled — from 255,331 that year to a record 491,537 in 2012.

B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan have had a disproportionately high number of temporary foreign workers, with Kenney saying the cause has been a geographic and industry-specific skills shortage in the West.

Tim Hortons has ended its relationship with a franchisee in Fernie and Blairmore, Alta. who was the target of an Employment Standards Branch investigation after a temporary foreign worker from the Philippines claimed he was denied overtime pay for years.

In an emailed statement, Tim Horton’s spokeswoman Olga Petrycki said the company has “terminated our relationship with the Blairmore, Alberta/Fernie B.C. franchisee for failing to comply with Employment Standards requirements, a matter Tim Hortons takes very seriously.”

She did not specify which employment rules the franchisee had breached.

B.C.’s Employment Standards Branch and the restaurant chain launched an investigation after Filipino Richard Pepito, a former employee, went public with accusations that the franchise owner gave him paycheques that included overtime, but then required Pepito to pay the owner the overtime back in cash.

He told The Sun last year he wasn’t alone in being denied overtime pay, and staff were led to believe that if they complained they would lose their status under the temporary foreign worker program and be sent back to live in poverty in their home country.

“I felt discriminated against, harassed and bullied,” said Pepito.

Tim Hortons has assumed corporate control of the two restaurants and no employee jobs have been affected, Petrycki said.

Scott Lunny, assistant director of the United Steelworkers union in Western Canada, said his union has filed a complaint with the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal against the Fernie Tim Hortons franchisee and the corporate entity. He said the action was filed in December after workers came to the union seeking help.

“It came to our attention locally in Fernie that temporary foreign workers from the Philippines were not being treated properly within the confines of our human rights legislation,” he said.

“There’s a number of allegations which we say are either violations of employment standards or human rights violations given the status of these workers. These workers aren’t being properly treated and are being discriminated against in terms of their pay and working conditions.”

Lunny said the union believes similar abuse of temporary foreign workers is going on across Canada. “(Employers) are using (the program) to mistreat very vulnerable workers in some instances. We’re seeing more and more examples of that on a daily basis.”

McDonald’s Canada has also been stung by recent criticism of its use of temporary foreign workers. Three of its Victoria franchises are at the centre of program abuse allegations involving Canadian employees alleging foreign workers were given priority work status and in some cases took their jobs.

McDonald’s senior vice-president of human resources Len Jillard said Wednesday it will be putting its use of the program on hold while conducting an audit by a third party to ensure there have been violations or abuse of workers — foreign or Canadian.

“The reason why we’re doing that is we want to communicate to everyone we’re taking this very seriously,” Jillard said. “We’re taking a pause. We’re making sure that we’ve got everything in order, which I’m convinced we have.”

Jillard said McDonald’s has already informed the federal government about its plans, including federal Employment Minister Jason Kenney.

“We’ve had a couple conversations directly with Minister Kenney in terms of the approach we’ve taken,” he said.

Jillard said McDonald’s is voluntarily suspending its use of federal Labour Market Opinion applications for all of its Canadian restaurants for the hiring of temporary foreign workers. The LMO process is designed to ensure there are no Canadian workers available before a company receives permission to hire foreign workers.

McDonald’s is in the process of taking full ownership of the three Victoria franchises from the Victoria operator who previously held an 80-per-cent share in the three outlets.

Shortly after the Victoria restaurants were singled out by the federal government for breaking the rules, B.C. Federation of Labour president Jim Sinclair called on the company to stop using the program and asked the government to eliminate the use of the temporary workers for entry-level jobs.

“If McDonald’s does not take action to achieve these solutions, the B.C. Federation of Labour will consider further actions, including but not limited to, calling for a boycott of McDonald’s,” read the letter Sinclair sent to McDonald’s CEO John Betts.

Four per cent of the more than 80,000 McDonald’s employees in Canada are temporary foreign workers, Jillard said.

Jennifer and Shane Palmer’s house in the Victoria neighbourhood of Fairfield looks old in style, but was built just 14 years ago and has a modern interior. Times Colonist

VICTORIA — It started when the couple decided to replace a bathroom mirror, and then wanted a new vanity, too.

“Pretty soon the ball started rolling and we were renovating the bathroom, gutting the kitchen, laying down new wood flooring,” said Jennifer Palmer. She and her husband Shane moved here from Calgary five years ago and found a lovely neighbourhood in Fairfield and a perfect home. Well, almost perfect.

“We were looking for a good place to raise our kids who are nine and seven,” said Shane.

“Enjoying nature is a bit of an ordeal in Calgary. Just getting out of the city is a chore, but in a community like this, there are so many opportunities within a short walk or drive. You can enjoy nature so much more easily — just like that,” he said, snapping his fingers.

Jennifer spotted the house online and flew out from Calgary for a closer look. She loved what she saw: A home with a historic-looking exterior, but modern interior.

“We’d probably have preferred a heritage house and did put in an offer on one, which we didn’t get,” Jennifer said.

“But then we thought how older homes are very broken up inside, whereas this house is so open and spacious.”

Their former house in Calgary was 1,000 square feet, whereas this is just shy of 3,800, which they wanted so they could do more entertaining.

The Palmers love the 14-year-old home’s “fabulous flow and room layout,” but gagged slightly when they saw the kitchen, which was completely pink inside. “The counters were pink and all the whitewashed cabinets had a pink undertone,” Jennifer said.

They planned to renovate down the road but. …

“All I did was go shopping for a bathroom mirror,” Shane said, helplessly. “And then we thought about a new vanity, and then we decided to gut the bathroom, and then the kitchen. …

“Jen was in Calgary at the time and I sent pictures of vanities from Home Depot, Rona, Slegg. Then I had a bright idea of going to a cabinetmaker. That was my fatal mistake,” he said.

He walked into the workshop of Jason Good Custom Cabinets and saw the owner covered in sawdust. “I could see Jason was a hands-on guy and that sold me.”

The meticulous Jennifer sought seven other quotes, just to be sure. One estimator said he could install a new kitchen in two days, whereas Good said his would take two weeks, and they liked that.

A makeshift kitchen was set up in the basement and they camped there for four months, during which “the fire alarm went off every day.”

“I started calling my wife General Jen,” said Shane, noting the former teacher was a brilliant general contractor who didn’t pick any tradespeople without references and multiple interviews.

“Jason’s attention to detail is incredible,” said Jennifer, who is detail-oriented herself. “We are forever in the kitchen, so it made sense to spend money here. This is where we live, where the kids do their homework, it’s the hub of the house.”

The new island seats six instead of three, and the oven, which used to be inconveniently opposite the island, is now part of the Blue Star range. It has a cast-iron top and no electronics, just simple switches, so fewer things to go wrong. The new fridge and stove are 48 inches wide instead of 30.

The house previously had white carpet in the family room, office and living room — “not very practical for our young family and dog” — so S & I Hardwood Floors laid new oak flooring to match that in the kitchen, hallway and bathroom. The matte finish is forgiving and doesn’t show dog or kid prints.

“The challenge was to lace it in, and they did a great job over the course of a week, so there is not a trace of a joint,” said Shane, who is chief pilot for VIH Aviation. His company works everywhere from Pakistan and Peru, to Taiwan, Africa, Australia and Brazil, and he has worked around the world.

“We wanted a bit of a focal point above the stove and that snowballed, too,” joked Shane, but they are delighted with the craftsmanship and way Good hid the exhaust chimney through cupboards at left.

“Just look at these joints,” said Shane, proudly pointing above the range. “Doing this reno, we learned a lot about why something is attractive. It’s not just one thing. It’s all kinds of little details.”

The fridge fit was so tight it couldn’t slide into place until Good came and trimmed a quarter inch off the base, said Jennifer. It fits like a glove, and he built a window seat, too. “It was an afterthought but we are really pleased. For one thing there is less storage now, because of our bigger appliance, and these drawers hold a lot.”

Good’s kitchen designer, Claire Reimann, “gave us unbelievable customer service.”

“I talked to a lot of kitchen people and they always went along with my suggestions. But Claire was different. She’d say, have you thought about this, or that? We didn’t need ‘yes people.’ ”

Reimann said the kitchen was challenging because the fridge wall had an awkward U shape. “You can’t tell now, but it was really uneven. Jason camouflaged that with cabinets of different depths.

“He created furniture kicks at the bottom of the cabinets, custom profiles, so your toes can slide under,” and put a vacuum in the kick, as well as classic style corbels in the wide, custom range hood.

“He put a panel on the dishwasher so it’s hidden, put light valances under the cabinetry and took cabinets to the ceiling, whereas before there was a good gap for dust collection.

“The island has big square posts on the corners now, hand carved in cherry like the new bathroom vanity, and it’s stained rather than painted so it won’t show nicks,” Reimann said.

Thick countertops make the kitchen look more custom and the microwave is hidden in the dark wood island. “It used to be over the range — not a great focal point.”

Other features include glass doors, undermount sinks and a valance above the window, with recessed puck lights. “A nice touch in houses with tall ceilings so it doesn’t leave that high void.”","2014-02-14 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","12.0","0.0","174.0","177.0","0.0","86.0","9.0","5.0","1","1225","80.12","68.49","38.61","65.97","17.50","18.20","81.71","48.00","9.39","5.06","0.90","1.39","0.41","1.39","0.98","4.33","10.04","11.18","6.86","4.90","7.59","1.14","14.20","5.47","2.04","1.47","1.80","1.80","4.08","3.10","0.98","0.24","0.00","0.08","8.24","0.41","0.24","0.57","1.06","7.92","1.31","0.90","1.06","0.90","0.98","3.18","4.65","2.53","1.39","0.65","2.20","0.65","0.24","0.00","1.14","6.53","2.04","0.90","2.20","1.63","0.24","7.27","6.37","0.82","16.33","1.80","9.31","5.22","1.39","1.31","5.14","0.49","0.00","0.08","0.33","0.00","0.08","0.08","0.16","0.00","20.90","5.80","7.76","0.08","0.00","0.08","0.00","0.90","4.57","1.63","0.00","0.08","5439","7.0","20.39344262295082","1620","1220","70","79.19","9.5","6.5","9.86","9.6","193","6.285714285714286","15.287868852459017","554","18.97","15","0.46","0","61","21","138","0","126","92","5","0","7","230","87","1","63","1","0","64","14","67","1","0","4","19","0","25","101","17","16","26","34","7","5","0","7"

Supreme Court judgment.

Guiyun (Han) Ogden, a financial adviser for wealthy clients at the bank’s Imperial Service division, was fired in March 2011 after managers had issued her a pair of disciplinary letters that Justice Randall Wong dismissed as unwarranted in his decision, released Tuesday.

""They forged ahead with a termination for cause based on inaccurate and incomplete information despite knowing they had a heightened responsibility to get it right,"" wrote Wong in his decision, adding the firing killed Ogden’s chances of working as a licensed financial adviser anywhere.

A panel of managers and other CIBC staff decided unanimously to terminate Ogden after she made a decision in September 2010 that the company later claimed was made in contravention of its Code of Conduct.

Wong found two of the panel members — Ogden’s superiors, Paula Vanni and Rod Fossen — ""were motivated to fire an unhappy employee before she quit,"" ensuring they would retain her client accounts — worth $233 million — after she was gone.

But Ogden’s unhappiness at the bank appeared to come after she began to receive the disciplinary warnings from her managers toward the end of her nearly seven years of impressive performance, according to trial evidence.

Ogden came to Canada from China in 2000 with little English, according to the decision. She entered Royal Roads University and graduated at the top of her class with a business degree. Soon after that she became a level two certified general accountant, then a certified financial planner.

CIBC hired the hard worker as a personal banker at its University of B.C. branch in 2004. She was promoted to her position as a financial adviser within two years.

In her first years in the new position, she built a large, loyal clientele, mostly comprising wealthy Chinese immigrants. According to a 2009 performance review, she was a brilliant employee.

""Congratulations Han on an absolutely spectacular year,"" wrote David Fawkes, her then general manager.

""Your commitment to your own excellence shines through in everything you do, from maintaining a well-balanced book of business to providing excellent client service that goes above and beyond what is expected for your role. Your results truly speak for themselves.""

In 2010, Vanni called Ogden ""an exceptional adviser"" and an ""annual achiever.""

But in 2008 and 2010, Ogden had been issued warnings that Wong later dissected in his ruling and found lacking a reasonable basis.

One warning came from ""document deficiencies"" that the justice found either did not occur, were caused by confusing and changing policies, or were systemic procedural problems in the branch that Ogden was ""singled out"" for.

Another warning came after a pair of contraventions that resulted from the actions of other CIBC employees, Wong found.

Ogden was devastated by that warning, wrote Wong. She protested, told Vanni she was unhappy and thinking about quitting, and wanted to escalate the matter to a senior vice-president at the company. But in the end, Ogden decided to drop the issue.

The final incident that led to Ogden’s termination involved a pair of wire transfers structured to work around Chinese regulations that prohibited individuals from transferring more than $50,000 US out of the country annually. The issue was not the fact that Ogden used the work around — a practice CIBC supported, Wong wrote — but the unconventional way she did it.

In September 2010, Ogden received a panicked call in the middle of the night from a client. The client was trying to transfer $500,000 into the country for the deposit on a home, something she needed 10 separate Chinese and Canadian accounts to do. But she was short two Canadian accounts and the money needed to arrive the following day or the real estate deal would collapse. The client asked to transfer the money via two of Ogden’s own accounts. She agreed.

""This was not a case of ‘don’t do x’ and Ms. Ogden ‘did x’,"" wrote Wong about the transaction. ""The rule she is alleged to have breached was far from clear, was open to interpretation, and was sometimes confusing in its application. This was also a transaction in which there was no actual conflict of interest, but only a potential conflict of interest.""

Months later, the CIBC panel debated the incident and decided to fire her.

In his decision, Wong chastised CIBC staff for having lost or destroyed relevant documents, contrary to company policy, and noted that Vanni, Fossen and another employee had changed their stories during testimony.

Wong found CIBC liable for breach of contract, declared the firing was without cause, and ordered costs and damages to be determined at a later trial.

During the trial, Wong heard testimony from Ogden that her goal when she came to Canada was to become ""the best financial adviser.""

""I felt I did it. I became a top performer. I built a large portfolio. I was proud of myself,"" she said.

""All of a sudden everything was taken away from me. I loved being a financial adviser. I can’t do it anymore . . . I feel all my hard work was for nothing.""

The number of workers admitted under the controversial program has more than doubled nationally over the last 10 years, increasing to 213,573 in 2012 from 102,932 in 2003, Citizenship and Immigration Canada figures show. In B.C., the rate of growth has been even faster, with the number of temporary workers hitting almost 50,000 in 2012, up from just over 20,000 in 2003.

The people who come in under the program range from seasonal agricultural workers to highly skilled IT professionals, but it is the fast-food industry’s use of such workers that has been under scrutiny in recent days after Ottawa announced it was investigating a McDonald’s franchisee in Victoria for allegedly abusing the program.

The Sun reported Wednesday on a Kelowna-area Dairy Queen employee who said she went from 30-plus hours a week to weeks at a time without a shift after temporary foreign workers arrived from the Philippines. The worker, Alisha Harris, is an 18-year-old Grade 12 student who was working to earn money for university tuition.

Alexandra Fortier, a spokeswoman for Employment Minister Jason Kenney, said Wednesday that the government’s assurances of protection for Canadian workers also apply to part-time employees.

The risk that temporary foreign workers will take employment opportunities away from young Canadians is not one that should be lightly dismissed, according to Christopher Worswick, an economics professor at Carleton.

“The kinds of jobs that are more and more likely to be filled by TFWs (such as less-skilled fast-food-industry jobs and hotel work) were traditionally first jobs for many young Canadians and/or supported them while they pursued post-secondary education,” he wrote in an October 2013 report on the economic implications of changes to the temporary foreign worker program. “If employers are able to bring in TFWs rather than raising wages to induce young Canadians to take these jobs or perhaps move to regions where such jobs exist, this could mean that young Canadians may face even greater difficulties in becoming established in the labour market and accumulating the skills they need to move into higher-skilled occupations.”

The reason employers choose to bring in foreigners rather than hire local youth is the “elephant in the room” in the debate around temporary foreign workers, Worswick said, and it has to do with work ethic. There are many low-income workers around the world who would welcome the chance to work in Canada if it meant a better life for their family. Given this motivation, they are likely to work harder and be less likely to complain about working standards than a similarly trained Canadian worker, according to Worswick.

Employers “may see an opportunity to gain extra profit by either advertising jobs at too low a wage (given the job requirements) or perhaps by being overly critical of Canadian applicants, so they could gain permission to hire a TFW who would be more productive.” Worswick called this “the greatest challenge regarding the Temporary Foreign Worker Program.”

Despite this, Worswick argues in favour of a limited, tightly regulated version of the program that focuses on situations in which firms need to hire highly skilled workers. Those who show an ability to support themselves for a given period of time should be able to apply for permanent residence, he added.

A crowd of nearly 200, about two-thirds of whom were visible minorities — many Asian, came to SUCCESS, a multicultural service agency, to hear how candidates from COPE, NPA and Vision, and a trio of independents, would address issues of importance to them.

But as questions came in from audience and panel members, it soon became clear that issues of importance to many in the crowd were identical to those of concern to residents across the city — foremost among them, high levels of homelessness, overcrowding on key transit routes, expensive housing and concerns about job opportunities.

“There is no majority culture here in Vancouver anymore,” said incumbent Mayor Gregor Robertson, tapping into a theme that emerged as the debate progressed.

But even in a city with a strong multi-ethnic identity like Vancouver, issues specific to visible minorities remain. The first question posed to candidates was what they would do to address concerns that Chinese immigrants are being excluded from city jobs.

NPA candidate Kirk LaPointe was first to tackle the question, saying he had a history of working on diversity initiatives, noting that he created CTV’s first diversity initiative more than a decade ago. LaPointe said he wants a city that is equitable and fair.

LaPointe told members of the panel — journalists from foreign and English-language news services — that he would ensure information from the city would be translated and made available at the same time as the English version.

Beyond that, he said he would introduce new measures to achieve “the most inclusive and tolerant city that we can have.” LaPointe did not detail what those would be.

Robertson said the city has made “significant progress in being a more inclusive city.

“When we look at our checkered history on this there are lots of challenges and conflicts between races in Vancouver and a lot of that history, we are trying to reconcile now. We’re working hard to address and acknowledge that that history happened (and) learn from that,” he said.

COPE mayoral candidate Meena Wong said from what she’s seen, many immigrants coming to the city from different parts of the world cannot get fair treatment. She said she would push for a fair and transparent employment policy.

“I experienced discrimination at the workplace myself,” she said, adding it is essential to “know your rights.”

Rounding out the list of mayoral candidates who attended the event were independents Mike Hansen, Bob Kasting and Tim Ly.

Other questions the candidates faced included whether the city’s network of bike lanes should remain in place — all candidates but Hansen agreed they should, and most, like Wong and LaPointe, pointedly noted the network should expand, but only if residents want that.

LaPointe was asked about his defence of a proposal by Chevron to donate money to schools, something he has said was wrongly turned down by Vision school board chairwoman Patti Bacchus. He said that as an educator himself he is opposed to advertising in classrooms, but because the program had no strings attached, free money for school equipment had been turned down for ideological, not practical reasons.

Barbed comments were exchanged at times between LaPointe and Robertson, but neither candidate got the better of the other. If applause can be considered a measure of popularity, Robertson had the most fans in chairs Wednesday, many of whom asked him for photographs after the event.

Freedom-of-information requests from The Vancouver Sun to 21 Metro Vancouver municipalities are highlighting the arbitrariness and frequent lack of transparency at city halls in the region.

One straightforward request for a complete list of the mayors’ email correspondence for July 2014 provided a perplexing and troubling array of municipal responses.

At one extreme, Burnaby demanded $2,677 for Mayor Derek Corrigan’s emails for that month and Delta $2,598 for Mayor Lois Jackson’s emails.

At the other extreme, White Rock provided The Sun with electronic copies of Mayor Wayne Baldwin’s emails, while Langley City and Bowen Island each mailed a stack of photocopied emails — free of charge — from acting mayor Ted Schaffer and the late mayor Jack Adelaar, respectively.

Vincent Gogolek, executive director of the B.C. Freedom of Information and Privacy Association, said he is puzzled by the vast differences in fee estimates provided to The Sun.

“You have a nice representative sample of Lower Mainland municipalities. You’d think they’d be in the same ballpark. Not so much,” he said.

“I’m hard pressed to come up with any way you could come up with $2,600 in fees (Delta) for one person’s email for a month.”

Information was severed from the records under various sections of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, notably due to unreasonable invasion of a third person’s personal privacy.

Whether the differences are reflective of the overall openness of the various municipalities is hard to say.

“It could be, or they’re just not doing a very good job,” said Gogolek, noting that high fees can represent a deterrent to the public pursuing their right to access information.

Burnaby records and information administrator Pierrette Hodnett wrote The Sun to say that the $2,677 fee included 43 hours of “onerous” staff time for disclosure preparation at $30 per hour plus 5,548 copies at 25 cents per page.

Delta’s municipal clerk, Robyn Anderson, explained that a release of the mayor’s 813 emails for July “would not be a matter in the public interest” and that due to the sensitive nature of some emails, preparing the records for disclosure must be undertaken by “exempt employees” in the clerk’s office.

Of the $2,598 fee, Delta wants to charge $1,936 just to locate the records.

“You’re just asking for one person’s email,” Gogolek commented in an interview. “It’s not like you have a lot of searching to do. There’s the email box and there’s the emails. It seems pretty straightforward. You or I could go to our email box and do that in what, two minutes? And I’m no technical wizard.”

New Westminster charged nothing but provided just four emails for Mayor Wayne Wright.

Wright said he told his staff to provide everything to The Sun and that was simply all the emails for July. “You got everything I had,” he insisted. “Well, when you’re doing the job, what are you going to do? (The electorate) seem to be pretty happy.”

Upon further scrutiny, Jacque Killawee, the city’s records and information administrator, said that the “majority of email received during this time were personal in nature and do not fall under the scope of the Act.” Gogolek strongly disagreed with that determination.

Even more incredulously, Langley Township deputy clerk Wendy Bauer said “staff conducted a search of our email server” and identified only two emails sent or received by Mayor Jack Froese during that period and that the third parties are being asked if they object to disclosure.

Pitt Meadows also provided only two emails for Mayor Deb Walters, noting information had been exempted due to third-party privacy reasons.

Other municipalities are still in the process of responding to The Sun’s request sent Aug. 25.

The Sun posed two other requests to all 21 municipalities to judge the speed and openness of their responses: copies of the mayors’ travel receipts for January-June 2014, and a list of the five largest cellphone bills incurred by municipal staff plus the mayor in 2013.

Municipalities had little trouble complying with those requests, with some, such as Vancouver, already posting elected officials’ general expenses online.

Only North Vancouver district failed to fully comply with the two requests, demanding a fee of $424.16 to provide the cellphone costs — more even than the fee estimate for Mayor Richard Walton’s email for July.

To which Gogolek offered: “Did you tell him you just wanted the bill and that you didn’t want to buy the phones?”

The district’s manager of municipal services, James Gordon, explained that “many district staff pay a monthly fee to use their cellphone for personal use as well as business” and that to find the five largest bills, finance staff would have to “pull all bills (12 months’ worth) for all staff, ascertain and deduct the personal use charges and then total the bills.”

A request for Mayor Walton’s cellphone bill is ongoing.

Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson racked up the biggest cell bill in 2013 at $3,309.45 for 2013, which compares with Coquitlam Mayor Richard Stewart at $3,017 and Surrey Mayor Dianne Watts at $2,811. Langley township Mayor Jack Froese incurred a bill of just $261.

Among senior bureaucrats: Dave Semple, Richmond’s general manager of community services, $2,927; Vancouver chief of staff Michael Magee, $2,129; West Vancouver festivals and events manager Christie Rosta, $2,082; and Surrey fire chief Len Garis, $1,912.

When it came to redacting — the process of deleting sensitive passages in documents that are exempt from release under the Act — Bowen Island distinguished itself by doing the clumsiest job of all. Someone obviously went over the exempt portions by hand with a black felt pen. The job is so substandard that one can easily read the passages meant to be redacted; in some cases, only parts of the words or emails are poorly blanked out.

Software programs are available that leave blank spaces in the copy. However, some public bodies still use heavy black ink to disguise passages.

Bowen Island’s acting mayor Andrew Stone said he will raise the issue, noting the municipality has only a handful of staff and that FOI requests are “probably done off the side of someone’s desk.”

He added: “If you could read through the marker strikes, then there’s a problem.”

What may seem comical can have serious repercussions, said Gogolek, noting there can be good reasons for keeping information from the public.

“There is an issue there,” he said. “If you were asking for the names of police undercover officers and who they are working with … and if they’re just highlighted through, then there’s a real problem. That’s dangerous. You have to be professional about it.”

METRO VANCOUVER — A lawyer for accused Surrey Six killer Matt Johnston said that even if he was in the apartment where six men were shot to death on Oct. 19, 2007, he should only be convicted of manslaughter.

Mike Tammen said in his closing submissions Friday that there is no evidence Johnston was part of any plan to murder rival drug trafficker Corey Lal.

""At its highest, the Crown’s case gets to establishing to the requisite standard that Matthew Johnston was part of a plan to rob or jack Corey Lal, but certainly not to kill him,"" Tammen said. ""At most, Johnston knew of a plan afoot to commit what would clearly be a home-invasion-style robbery.""

Tammen said drugs and cash were taken from the apartment where Lal, his brother Michael, associates Ryan Bartolomeo and Eddie Narong, and bystanders Chris Mohan and Ed Schellenberg were killed execution-style.

Tammen said even if Justice Catherine Wedge decides Johnston was inside suite 1505 with co-accused Cody Haevischer and a man dubbed Person X, there’s ""a very obvious reasonable doubt that he possessed knowledge that one of the others was going to commit murder.""

""If the court finds that Johnston was present in 1505 at the time of the killings . . . then the appropriate result is that he should be convicted on counts one through six on manslaughter,"" Tammen said.

He said even Johnston’s own admissions on a wiretap suggest he didn’t know the whole story about what happened and may not have been inside the suite when the shooting started.

Johnston was taped saying to another Red Scorpion who was working for police that ""I wasn’t inside, man.""

At another point, Johnston says that just one of the murder weapons was left in the apartment, when in fact both guns were found there.

""That’s powerful evidence that Johnston wasn’t in the apartment when the shootings occurred. He had left,"" Tammen said.

After Tammen concluded his final arguments, Crown prosecutor Mark Levitz countered the defence submissions made over four and a half days this week.

Levitz rejected a suggestion by Haevischer’s lawyer that key Crown witnesses lied when they claimed final details of the murder plot were still being worked out two hours before it happened.

Levitz said the defence argued that it made no sense that experienced gangsters would ""be in such disarray.""

""Essentially what’s pointed out here is that the plot was engineered by a group of complete incompetents, or the witnesses are not telling the truth,"" Levitz said.

""In my respectful submission, the proof is in the pudding. Based on all the evidence, they went to kill one person and ended up killing six.""

The Crown is expected to finish its submissions Monday, marking the end of the trial.

The email, three thousand words in length, was about their experiences during the Second World War. While Remembrance Day has come and gone, their intertwined stories were at once so terrible and so miraculous I thought they deserved repeating here.

Their story began in Poland.

“My father, Tadek, about to start college, was acutely aware of the rumblings of war. As a 19-year-old youth, he was part of an aircraft observation group in the small town of Olkusz.

“In Warsaw, my future mother Barbara … was hearing news of Polish troops on horseback, fighting first the Germans and then the Russians. These distant rumours became horribly real when she returned from a country holiday to behold her beautiful city of Warsaw in ruins.”

Poland fell to the invading German and Russian armies. Barbara, only 15, joined the Polish underground army, distributing newsletters created from secret radio broadcasts.

Tadek and his father left home to join up with what was left of the Polish defence forces. The nights were turning cold: they slept in barns. On Sept. 24, their unit was fired on. They returned fire, but then — “a white flag appeared and a voice proclaimed that ‘the Soviet Red Army was coming as a friend!’ ”

It was a trap. The Soviets took the Poles prisoner, then shot every fifth man, including Tadek’s father. “Sobbing, my father, tried desperately to staunch the blood while a priest moved him aside to administer last rites.”

The Soviets pressed Tadek and the remaining prisoners into slave labour hauling garbage, but Tadek escaped by mingling with locals scavenging for old clothes. Later, he would find out most of his fellow prisoners had been shot.

Back in Warsaw, Barbara watched the war decimate her family and home — an uncle in a prisoner of war camp, two young cousins tortured and shot by the Nazis. Her grandmother had been feeding a Jewish family — “they appeared one day with yellow stars on their sleeves, a grim foreshadowing.” The horrors of the Warsaw ghetto were just beginning: she heard stories of mass suicides, of “women jumping from roofs with babies in their arms.” Barbara took a first aid course and was sworn in as a soldier in the Home Army.

Meanwhile, Tadek tried to make his way back home. He was captured by the Germans this time, but escaped again and joined the Polish underground. But in January 1940 he was captured by the Soviets again, beaten, and sent to a gulag in Naryan Mar, on the Russian coast of the Arctic Ocean. “Prisoners were dying by the dozen of pellagra yet my father survived, his diet augmented by seeds of wild rose and rowan berries.”

Tadek befriended a young Polish doctor imprisoned in the camp and they formed an impromptu medical team, once helping deliver the baby of the camp commander’s wife. They were paid in vodka, “which came in very useful as an anesthetic when they later operated on a prisoner with appendicitis.” Others were not so lucky. Pellagra took its toll. “My father vividly remembers these young boys, so terrified, looking up at him as they died in his arms.”

When the Nazis invaded Russia in 1941, the Polish prisoners, now allowed to fight against the Germans, were freed and sent to southern Russia for military training. They arrived to a macabre sight — “box cars filled with frozen German soldiers, their bodies tightly pressed in a vertical position.”

After military training in Russia, he made his way through Iran, Iraq and Pakistan, then shipped out to England on the Empress of Canada, an ocean liner doing duty as a troop ship. En route, on March 13, 1943, it was torpedoed and sunk off the coast of Africa. Tadek spent three days in a crowded life raft before being rescued by a British ship. Finally, reaching England, he joined the Royal Air Force’s 315 Polish Fighter Squadron and began flying sorties over Germany.

On Aug. 1, 1944, Warsaw rose up against the German occupiers. It was a disaster: The promised help from Soviet forces never came. Barbara was 18, the leader of a patrol of field nurses. “The trips back and forth with the wounded were nightmarish, pulling heavy stretchers through narrow alleys, often not knowing if their human cargo was unconscious or dead.”

Warsaw held out for two months. Barbara was arrested and sent to a concentration camp for women in northern Germany. There, she contracted scarlet fever but survived. On April 12, 1945, the camp was liberated by a Polish armoured division. Offered the chance to go to England if she joined the Air Force, she enlisted and shipped out.

“And here,” Liz wrote, “fate took a hand.”

Tadek, on leave, was asked by a friend in his squadron to stop and see five friends of his sister who had recently been released from a German concentration camp and relocated to England. Barbara was one of the five. Tadek spent the rest of his leave with her. They married in 1946.

When Tadek was offered a job with a Canadian company, they emigrated and settled in Quebec. Their marriage lasted 62 years. Tadek died in 2008.

Barbara now lives in a care home in Quebec.

She celebrated her 90th birthday Tuesday, on Nov. 11.

The Best (fill in noun here) is always a tricky proposition, as claims of superiority always smack of subjectivity.

Be it ice cream. sportscars, watches or films, personal tastes and preferences dictate what constitutes the best in each of our minds.

That said, on some topics there is little wiggle room when ascribing the bold adjective ‘Best.’ Which brings us to today’s topic, the Fairmont Pacific Rim‘s Presidential Suite, the Best Hotel Suite in all of Vancouver.

Located on the 22nd floor of the downtown luxury hotel, the 2,230 sq.-ft, one-bedroom suite features stunning panoramic views of Coal Harbour and Stanley Park to the west, the North Shore mountains to the north and Burrard Inlet and the Ironworkers Bridge to the east. The grass-roofed Vancouver Convention Centre is below, and a high-powered telescope in the living-room provides no shortage of viewing options through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

The decor is contemporary, in keeping with the other 376 guest rooms in the Pacific Rim, and like those other rooms is tastefully modern with a high level of rich finish.

Spacious is a word that comes to mind when you enter the suite, with the large living room furnished with low-slung couches and chairs and a large glass coffee table. The book shelves surrounding the large flat screen TV are filled with hardcover books, and various sculptures and painting add to the room’s special ambience.

In one corner of the living room is a desk with a commanding view of the North Shore mountains.

Beside the living room is a large dining room with a beautiful table that seats 10, and just off this room is the Butler’s Pantry, a very modern kitchen with a wellstocked fridge and wine cellar, an oven, and dishes and cutlery.

Don’t worry though, you won’t have to cook if you don’t want to. There is a separate entrance into the Butler’s Pantry that provides Fairmont chefs and serving staff access to prepare and serve catered meals.

Past the dining room is the large bedroom, featuring a king-sized bed with those famed Fairmont pillows and duvets. Again, views are provided through floor-to-ceiling windows, which also allow natural light to fill the room. A massive walk-in closet provides all the room you’ll need for luggage and clothes to be out of sight.

Then there’s the bathroom. Make that two bathrooms, as the bedroom’s ensuite has two full oversized marble spa matching bathrooms, a him and a her proposition if you like. They are identical in layout except one has a deep, jetted soaker tub with incredible views; the other a large marble shower with huge rainfall shower head.

A separate bathroom off the dining room means guests won’t be traipsing through your bedroom, though you’d be remiss in not giving complete tours to all who enter the suite. The dual marble bathrooms are simply incredible.

Rounding out the suites features are a large private outdoor patio with table for four – ideal for breakfast – and a double sofa bed. And if that’s not enough room for your entourage, two connecting guest rooms can be accessed, bringing the total square-footage to 3,200.

Guest of this suite also receive Fairmont Gold services, which include private check-in, concierge and butler services and access to the Gold lounge on the 20th floor, itself a stylish space with stunning views of downtown, Stanley Park and the mountains. Daily breakfast

in the lounge is complimentary, as are evening canapes.

It doesn’t hurt that the suite is in, arguably, the best luxury hotel in Vancouver, a West Coast city bursting at the seams with high-end accommodation.

At $7,500 a night, the only downside of the Presidential Suite is that you’d be reluctant to not spend every minute of your stay in the room, though catching some live music in the lobby lounge and going for a swim in the palm tree-lined heated outdoor pool might coax you out for a little while at least.

What’s most amazing perhaps is that the Presidential Suite is not the most expensive suite in the Pacific Rim. That honour goes to the Owner’s Suite, a 2,250 sq.-ft two-storey salon inspired by a Balinese villa. Features in the so-called ‘Rock Star Suite’ include an eight-foot Swarovski crystal chandelier, a hand-carved soaker tub and a private gazebo with meditation pond and fire pit.

Rock Star is a fitting moniker for the Owner’s Suite, as its location overlooking the pool and just a few floors off Cordova Street appeals to the extrovert who craves being seen living the lush life. It truly is like staying in a goldfish bowl, figuratively and literally.

So why isn’t it the ‘Best,’ you ask? ""They’re so different,"" says Pacific Rim public relations manager Kaylyn Storey. ""The Presidential Suite is up on the 22nd floor and gets all the views that the hotel offers. That’s what makes that suite – it’s all about the view.""

Storey says the average length of stay in the Presidential Suite is two days, ""and it is booked more often than not.""

Put it on your bucket list — and pack your camera.

She had planned to take Friday, Oct. 19, 2007 off so she could be home when a gas fitter came to service the fireplace in the penthouse apartment she shared with her husband Sunil and son Christopher, 22.

They had lived on the top floor of Surrey’s Balmoral Tower for less than a month, having moved from a 14th-floor unit they rented before it was sold.

She woke her son up to tell him that plans had changed and she would need him to stay home and wait for the person servicing the fireplace.

“We sat down at the dining table and had breakfast together. Eggs and toast, and he made pancakes for himself. That was his favourite. We spoke. Honestly, I didn’t know that would be my last time speaking to my son,” Mohan recalled.

“We hugged and kissed goodbye, and I walked out of the house not knowing that that day would turn out to be such a disastrous day.”

B.C. Supreme Court Justice Catherine Wedge will hand down her verdict Thursday in the trial of accused Surrey Six killers Matt Johnston and Cody Haevischer.

Each is charged with conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder in the deaths of drug dealers Corey and Michael Lal, Eddie Narong and Ryan Bartolomeo, as well as bystanders Ed Schellenberg and Chris Mohan.

Jamie Bacon will be tried on murder and conspiracy charges in a separate trial.

According to Crown evidence at the Surrey Six trial, suite 1505 across the hall from the Mohans’ was a stash house for Corey Lal and Eddie Narong.

The 22-year-old high school pals had been successful on the streets of Surrey and beyond, selling cocaine and heroin through their dial-a-dope lines.

Neither lived in the penthouse apartment, but they cooked crack, stored drugs and cash, and met there with others involved in the street-level drug trade.

Mohan still laments that she had no idea what was going on next door.

“I literally did not know that my neighbours were drug dealers. Had I known, I would have moved my family in a heartbeat. But no one told us what was happening on the 15th floor.”

Corey Lal obviously had no idea what would happen that fateful day, either.

He had been warned by his Red Scorpion gang rivals that he was selling drugs on their turf. He had even been roughed up by the other gangsters at a meeting inside a Surrey McDonald’s a few weeks before. One Scorpion had taken Lal’s 9-mm Glock handgun. Lal had been ordered to pay a $100,000 “tax” for operating in their territory, or else.

Lal didn’t pay.

About 9:15 that morning, Red Scorpion Jamie Bacon and a man who can only be called Person Y due to a publication ban arrived at a Port Coquitlam gym as undercover police officers watched.

Y later testified that Johnston arrived a bit later at the World Gym, along with Person X, another Red Scorpion whose identity is shielded by court order.

Y said the final details of a nefarious plan to kill Corey Lal were discussed inside the gym before he and Bacon left at 9:54, again captured by police surveillance.

Over the next three hours, there was a flurry of calls between Red Scorpion gangsters and their associates.

In the early afternoon, Johnston joined other Red Scorpions at the Seoul House Korean restaurant on 104th Avenue in Surrey.

He had already picked up an electronic key fob that would give the killers access to the Balmoral Tower where Lal lived, the trial heard.

At the restaurant, Johnston met Red Scorpion founder Michael Le, both Person X and Y, and some friends of Le’s who were triad members.

Person X was given the Glock seized from Lal weeks before.

The gangsters left the restaurant separately. Le went to lease a new Maserati at Blue Star Motors in Vancouver.

Johnston and X headed over to the nearby Stanley apartment building, where Cody Haevischer lived on the 16th floor with his girlfriend.

Police doing an unrelated drug investigation captured them on video going into the building about 1:50 p.m.

The trial heard Johnston and X cleaned their guns with Windex and paper towels as Haevischer changed and popped in and out of the living room. All three men headed down to the parkade at 2:08 p.m. and left in a black BMW.

The Crown said an identical BMW arrived in the parkade of the Balmoral, less than three kilometres from the Stanley, just before 2:23 p.m.

The driver nearly ran over Helen Lee and her three-year-old son. Helen had been at her Bible study group inside the highrise.

Lee testified that she saw three men get out of the car and make their way to a gate leading to an elevator into the Balmoral.

“They covered their faces with their hoods and … had leather gloves on,” she said.

The key fob alleged to have been passed to Johnston earlier that day was used to enter the building gate at 2:23 p.m.

Inside suite 1505 were Corey Lal, his older brother Michael, and friend Ryan Bartolomeo. Michael and Ryan had been cooking crack in the kitchen while Corey did some paperwork at a glass desk in the living room.

Gas fitter Ed Schellenberg arrived to service the fireplace in the neighbouring suite. It was supposed to be his last apartment of the day.

Phone records show that Corey Lal called a friend at 2:27 p.m.

The call was cut off, as Lal was heard saying: “Oh f–k, the door. He sounded really worried when he said it,” the friend later told police.

That was when the killers arrived, prosecutors said.

Chris Mohan’s bad luck was his timing. He left for a basketball game as one of the gangsters was checking the hallway. He was dragged into suite 1505. Eddie Narong also arrived to the unfolding nightmare.

As the apartment was ransacked for cash and drugs, the six victims were forced to the floor with hoodies or jackets thrown over their heads.

Eddie Narong lay beside Ed Schellenberg, almost perfectly parallel, and Corey Lal was to Eddie’s right.

On the other side of a leather loveseat, closest to the door, was Chris Mohan. To his left was Michael Lal and on the other side of Lal was Ryan Bartolomeo.

They were confined like that for several minutes, the trial heard. And then each was shot in the head and back, execution-style.

Nineteen shots were fired — 17 of them hit the victims. The two murder weapons — the Glock and an Ultrastar handgun — were left inside the suite. Their magazines had been emptied.

Police were later told the victims had begged for their lives.

“They saw our faces. We had no choice,” Johnston was said to have told his gang leader afterwards.

Three men in hoodies were seen leaving the Balmoral parkade in the black BMW at about 2:45 p.m. by another woman in the Bible study group.

Police still staked out at the Stanley saw the BMW linked to Haevischer arriving there just before 3 p.m. The men in hoodies were again captured on video.

Police were soon on the scene of the biggest gangland massacre in B.C. history.

And the Mohans and Schellenbergs, as well as three other Lower Mainland families, were soon to get the most devastating news of their lives.

"http://vancouversun.com/News/Metro/federal-environmental-screening-lacks-clarity-clear-rules-study/wcm/533842af-10f8-4def-87f3-1b60ff0818c9","Federal environmental screening lacks clarity, clear rules: study","OTTAWA — The Harper government isn’t providing adequate information to the public or industry on how it determines what major projects get an environmental review.

That conclusion is in a report by federal Environment Commissioner Julie Gelfand, who looked at how the government has handled project screenings since sweeping 2012 legislation changed the way projects are assessed.

Since that period, 37 projects have been subjected to federal assessment by federal agencies, including 17 in B.C.

That’s a far cry from the more than 4,000 that were assessed in 2010 before Ottawa, as Green party leader Elizabeth May put it, took a sledgehammer to the environmental review process.

The federal government now focuses only on reviewing major projects. The 37 proposals that faced federal scrutiny since 2012 include Kinder Morgan’s Alberta-B.C. oilsands pipeline expansion, the Point Roberts Terminal 2 project, and a number of liquefied natural gas and mining projects across B.C.

Gelfand said the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency has been “unclear” in its rationale for deciding which projects get screened, and details of its decision-making process aren’t made public.

“As the intent of the new legislation is to focus on projects that have the greatest potential for significant adverse environmental effects, it is important for the agency to have a clear, transparent basis for identifying those projects,” she wrote.

Among other criticisms in the report, which was tabled in the House of Commons on Tuesday:

• The report also said the agency and the National Energy Board, another federal body that conducts environmental reviews, have inconsistent rules on who can participate. The Environmental Assessment Agency “must hear” from those with “relevant information or expertise,” while the NEB “may hear” from potential witnesses who could be considered experts or have important information to share.

• The federal government doesn’t explain how it determines what weight it gives to public input at hearings.

• The 2012 reforms says the government must consider “adverse environmental effects,” yet Ottawa doesn’t define adverse.

• Despite a 2012 commitment to engage with First Nations, the Environmental Assessment Agency hasn’t put together a “systematic” approach to Aboriginal engagement. That criticism echoes a government-commissioned report by Vancouver lawyer Doug Eyford which said Ottawa hasn’t adequately met its court-mandated obligation to consult and accommodate First Nations on pipeline projects.

• The new 2012 legislative changes never provided federal review panels with guidance on how to define whether a potential intervener met the test of whether they were an “interested party.” As a result, the panel set up to assess the proposed New Prosperity gold-copper mine in B.C. came up with its own rules in a process that ultimately led to Ottawa rejecting the mine.

The Environmental Assessment Agency and the NEB both agreed with most of Gelfand’s criticisms and vowed to be more transparent, but the Green party’s May questioned that pledge given the Harper government’s reputation for secrecy.

“Stephen Harper is the least transparent prime minister in recent history,” she told The Vancouver Sun.

Supreme Court judge dismissed an application by Surrey Six killers Cody Haevischer and Matthew Johnston to stay their murder charges, but agreed their rights were violated by ""egregious"" police misconduct and prison conditions that were ""harsh in the extreme.""

Justice Catherine Wedge agreed with defence lawyers that the state misconduct in the case was ""serious, prolonged and systemic."" But she disagreed that it warranted staying all charges.

She said society’s greater interest is seeing the gang killers held to account for the ""horrific"" slaying of six men in a Surrey highrise on Oct. 19, 2007.

""The circumstances of the offences could not be more shocking. The murders were execution-style killings, carried out with deliberation while the six victims were defenceless,"" Wedge said.

""In light of the number of victims and the motivation underlying the murders, society’s interest in seeing justice done on the merits of this case is profound. Society’s interest weighs all the more heavily in the context of this case because the carnage was the result of gang members fighting for turf in the illicit drug trade.""

Despite the Charter violations in the case, Wedge said: ""I am satisfied that the price of staying these convictions could not be worth the gain to our justice system.""

Both Haevischer and Johnston appeared at the Vancouver Law Courts via video monitor. A date for their sentencing will be fixed Thursday.

Wedge found both men guilty of six counts of first-degree murder on Oct. 2 for the murders of rival drug dealer Corey Lal, his brother Michael, associates Eddie Narong and Ryan Bartolomeo, as well as bystanders Chris Mohan and Ed Schellenberg.

She also found both Red Scorpion gangsters guilty of conspiracy to commit murder for plotting the hit on Corey Lal that spiralled into the deaths of six.

Neither man had been sentenced in the mass murder, pending the outcome of their application to stay the charges.

Mohan’s mother Eileen said she was relieved at Wednesday’s ruling and looking forward to sentencing.

""That kind of puts a lot of pressure off my shoulders and helps me to re-collect my thoughts and prepare myself for sentencing,"" she said. ""I sat in court for almost 120 days now. And these convicted criminals can sit down and listen to me for half an hour. It’s my time to represent my son who’s not with me now.""

Mohan said while Wedge found there was police misconduct and abuses of the killers’ rights, ""my son’s life was way more precious than the mistreatment of these two criminals in prison.""

""At some point, we have to come to a conclusion that if you are a criminal and you’ve led a criminal lifestyle, your rights do not supersede our rights,"" she added.

Crown prosecutor Mark Levitz earlier urged Wedge to dismiss the application, saying it would amount to the ""stay of the century"" if charges were dropped against two multiple murderers.

Defence lawyers Dagmar Dlab and Brock Martland had argued that the four RCMP officers now facing criminal charges behaved outrageously when they had sex parties and went to strip clubs with potential witnesses in the case.

And they argued that both their clients spent more than a year in segregation after their arrest, on the orders of police and in violation of their Charter rights.

Wedge said she accepted the allegations against the police as true for the purpose of the application. All four officers go to trial next September.

""The misconduct of the officers was unquestionably egregious. They engaged in exploitative sexual relationships with protected female witnesses, endangered their safety by revealing protected information about them to others, lied to their superiors, and manipulated overtime and expense claims to cover up their conduct,"" Wedge said. ""The misconduct of these officers as alleged could constitute an abuse of process and conduct offensive to fair play and decency.""

She noted that the RCMP dealt with the allegations when it learned of them, resulting in the charges being laid. None of the officers, nor the women involved, testified at the Surrey Six trial, she said.

Wedge accepted that both Haevischer and Johnston ""suffered physically, emotionally and psychologically"" during 14 months of segregation.

But the restrictions eased in June 2010 after a B.C. Supreme Court ruling condemned the jailers of their co-accused, Jamie Bacon, for holding him in similar conditions.

Wedge said that despite the Charter violations, a stay of proceedings would not serve society.

""The applicants chose to go to the Balmoral Tower, an apartment building which is home to hundreds of residents, and to settle their score with Mr. Lal on the doorstep of those residents. They were apparently undeterred by the prospect of imperilling anyone caught in the crossfire. The result was the murder of six persons,"" Wedge said.

""The surviving victims of these crimes are the families of the six men who were executed, and their interest in seeing convictions entered for these crimes is equally profound.""

Rick Hansen, who inspired millions of people — and raised millions of dollars — with his Man in Motion tour was cited by British Columbians this week as one of their top-five heroes.

Hansen, who seemed surprised and delighted when he heard about the poll results, was quick to say no hero stands alone.

“I’m honoured that my name would stand among people that have made a difference. The work that I do is a reflection of hundreds and thousands of people that share my dream.”

He said his wheelchair journey around the globe would not have been possible without the dedicated team that travelled with him, encouraging him not to give up.

“It wasn’t the monumental earth-shattering cumulative impact of the journey, it was every moment along the way.”

The gruelling venture to raise funds and awareness took two years to complete, during which he often travelled a distance equivalent to two marathons in a day.

What kept Hansen going through the endless hours, the sleep deprivation and physical exhaustion, the robberies, the days and months when it seemed nobody was on board, the two years of slogging through ice, heat and storms?

“My team. That’s what kept me going. If I didn’t have my team with me — my wife Amanda, Don Alder, who was in the truck with me when we had the accident (that left Hansen a paraplegic at the age of 15), to support me, and when it looked like we wouldn’t have enough support, we had a home team that would be responding to help keep us going. That to me filled me with a sense of gratitude and inspiration.”

Hansen finds a parallel spirit in the character of British Columbians. “We need to help each other and that’s what we do. People have come to B.C. and have carved a life for themselves and made great sacrifices and taken great risks. We built our province together.”

Hansen knows the province well.

Although he was born in Port Alberni, his father worked for BC TEL, so the family travelled and lived in various B.C. communities including Fort St. John, Williams Lake and Abbotsford. He isn’t afraid to say he falls into the B.C.-first camp. “I’m a proud Canadian but I’m definitely born and raised in B.C. and proud of it. Because I’ve moved I’ve really seen a large part of the province as a resident and I’ve travelled almost every part along the way.”

Hansen is proud of how British Columbians have embraced inclusion. “I’ve talked to people from around the world who have come from around B.C. and across Canada and they see it as a progressive and accessible province.”

Hansen has heroes too. The first on his list is Stanley Strong who organized and played on Vancouver’s first wheelchair basketball team in 1950 after a car accident left him paralyzed.

Strong had been an athlete before his 1940 accident, and spent his life encouraging others. “He’s one of those obscure, great Canadians, a British Columbian who helped form the Paraplegic Association and wheelchair sports, a peer counsellor. He was injured in the early days when people with spinal cord injuries often wouldn’t survive. He refused to yield, kept a positive attitude and ended up not just living a good life but a great life, and helped young kids like me not give up.”

Strong was team manager of the Vancouver Cable Cars, the wheelchair basketball team Hansen led to five national championships. “He inspired me to recruit Terry Fox when he lost his leg to cancer,” said Hansen. “I just think of him as an incredible unsung hero.”

Hansen says his other hero, “great friend and inspiration” is Terry Fox. “I think the world of Terry, who he was as a human being, what he did to make a difference, what he sacrificed for others, what his legacy continues to be. He stands for facing your challenges, making a difference and serving others. We all have challenges in our life and we all have to face up to them and persevere and we all look for hope and inspiration in our lives if we want to make the best of our time here. Terry really does reflect British Columbian and Canadian values.

“If ever there was a person to reflect what B.C. stands for I couldn’t think two better people than these to stand for our values, one who is high profile and one who is obscure, and it also represents that you don’t have to be famous to make a difference.”Somehow it’s no surprise that when asked what single word he would use to describe B.C., Hansen answered quickly. “Hope.”

"http://vancouversun.com/News/Metro/surrey-six-reform-needed-on-mega-trials-former-bc-attorney-general-says/wcm/250e3a2a-ef7a-46fc-9430-ff35cf52d971","Surrey Six: Reform needed on mega-trials, former B.C. attorney general says (with video)","Former attorney general Wally Oppal says B.C.’s judicial system needs to be reformed to better manage major prosecutions so that they don’t take years to get to trial.

Oppal believes the public loses confidence in the system when people accused of crimes await trial for several years — particularly in so-called mega-trials like the Surrey Six murder case.

“When it takes so long to get disclosure, to bring people to trial and to eventually reach verdicts, it impacts on the credibility of the system,” Oppal told The Vancouver Sun in an interview.

“Our system needs to be reformed, particularly when it comes to timing. Should there be time limits from the time someone is charged to the time that that person goes to trial? Should there be time limits on cross-examination? Should there be time limits on arguments? These are matters that we have to look at. We go on endlessly in our trials.”

Oppal was B.C. attorney general when accused Surrey Six killers Cody Haevischer and Matthew Johnston were charged in April 2009 with the slaughter of drug dealers Eddie Narong, Ryan Bartolomeo, Corey Lal, his brother Michael and bystanders Ed Schellenberg and Chris Mohan, on Oct. 19, 2007.

Haevischer and Johnston will learn their fate today when B.C. Supreme Court Justice Catherine Wedge hands down her verdict in the historic gangland murder case. Both face six counts each of first-degree murder and one of conspiracy to kill.

If convicted on any of the murder counts, they would face an automatic life sentence with no possibility of parole for 25 years.

Haevischer and Johnston were suspected in the killings within days, according to evidence at their trial. But it took 18 months before charges were laid against them.

Also charged at the time was their purported Red Scorpion gang leader Jamie Bacon, who is going to trial next May — more than six years after his arrest. He faces one count of first-degree murder and one of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of Corey Lal.

Another gangster charged with manslaughter in the Surrey Six case doesn’t even have a trial date set yet, according to Neil MacKenzie of the B.C. attorney general’s criminal justice branch. Sophon Sek remains on bail, with a next appearance in Surrey provincial court set for Dec. 2, MacKenzie said.

The Surrey Six trial began under tight security at Vancouver Law Courts on Sept. 30, 2013 and ended in mid-July with closing arguments.

It was dramatic from the start, as lead prosecutor Mark Levitz laid out the Crown’s theory that Corey Lal, a 22-year-old drug dealer, was marked for death after he failed to pay a $100,000 tax to the Red Scorpion gang.

Levitz told Wedge that all the other victims were killed so there would be no witnesses.

The first to take the stand was retired Balmoral manager Norman Carothers. He wept as he described the horror of finding six bodies in suite 1505, where he had gone to search for Schellenberg, a gas fitter servicing the building’s fireplaces that day.

“Everybody is on the floor. There is blood. I don’t know what happened to them,” Carothers said, describing a frantic walkie-talkie conversation he had with his wife that day.

Gruesome police photos and videos of the six bodies lying in pools of their own blood inside suite 1505 were shown on television screens inside the courtroom.

Veteran police officers testified it was one of the worst crime scenes they had ever attended.

Several of the Crown’s 73 witnesses were former gangsters, drug dealers or their associates, which defence lawyers said destroyed the credibility of their evidence.

Two of those witnesses — Red Scorpion gang founder Michael Le and a gangster who can only be identified as Person Y — admitted to having roles in the plot to murder Corey Lal.

Le, who had been on the indictment with Haevischer and Johnston, dropped a bombshell two months into the trial when he pleaded guilty to conspiracy and became a Crown witness. The murder charge against him was dropped.

Le testified that the Red Scorpion gang, at the behest of Jamie Bacon, had conspired to kill Corey Lal and that the plan had spiralled out of control, resulting in the deaths of all six victims.

Le also said that Johnston and Haevischer each later confessed their involvement in the murders.

Johnston said on the day of the murders that all six victims were shot because “they saw our faces. We had no choice,” Le testified.

And he said Haevischer wrote on an eraser board a few days later that “six people got killed.”

Defence lawyers portrayed Le as a lying opportunist who got a great deal from the Crown despite his own violent history.

Another former Red Scorpion, Person Y, pleaded guilty to two unrelated murders and is serving a life sentence.

He testified that he had been willing to kill Lal for Bacon, but backed out when others were directed to accompany him on the hunt.

Y said he turned to police because he was sick of “the game” and wanted to do something good after a life of crime. He wore a recording device as Johnston made cryptic comments about the slaughter.

In closing arguments, Levitz said his team of prosecutors had “proved our case beyond a reasonable doubt against both accused on all seven counts.”

Defence lawyers said the Crown’s case was “woefully inadequate” and reliant on unsavory witnesses who should not be believed.

The Surrey Six murder investigation was one of B.C.’s largest and most complex.

RCMP Sgt. Rob Vermeulen said about 1,200 police officers and employees have worked on the case, with 35 still on the file full-time to support prosecutors.

“While the investigation began with a multiple homicide, it quickly expanded to a larger investigation of Lower Mainland gangs and organized crime. The investigation resulted in multiple charges and three convictions to date, including one subject convicted for two unrelated homicides.”

The Crown had nine lawyers and Johnston and Haevischer each had three lawyers. Le had six lawyers on his defence team before pleading guilty.

METRO VANCOUVER — The evidence in the Surrey Six case suggests there was a conspiracy to rob target Corey Lal, but not one to murder the rival drug trafficker, a lawyer for accused killer Matt Johnston argued Thursday.

Mike Tammen said the only evidence of a murder plot came from former Red Scorpion founder Michael Le and an admitted killer dubbed Person Y.

Both Crown witnesses are untrustworthy and had a motive to lie, Tammen told B.C. Supreme Court Justice Catherine Wedge in his closing submissions.

""Each of them has a particular reason to implicate Matthew Johnston,"" he said.

Tammen said Le wanted to minimize his role in the murders after striking a deal with the Crown to plead guilty to the lesser charge of conspiracy.

Instead of admitting to his own central involvement, ""he is plunking Matthew Johnston into the middle of this conspiracy,"" Tammen said.

And he said Y, who pleaded guilty to two unrelated murders and is serving a life sentence, admitted on the stand that he hated Johnston, though he never explained why.

Johnston and co-accused Cody Haevischer are charged with killing Lal, his brother Michael, associates Ryan Bartolomeo and Eddie Narong, as well as bystanders Ed Schellenberg and Chris Mohan on Oct. 19, 2007 in Surrey’s Balmoral Tower.

Both also charged with conspiracy to murder Lal on behalf of the Red Scorpion gang.

Tammen agreed with a Crown submission that the cell phones of victims were taken from suite 1505 before they were slaughtered.

""That is evidence that supports the theory that this was a robbery,"" he said.

Earlier Thursday, Tammen’s co-counsel Jonathan Desbarats argued that cell phone records disprove testimony from both Le and Y about meetings with Johnston both before and after the murders.

Desbarats took Wedge through records for Johnston, Le, Y and RS leader Jamie Bacon from October 2007.

Desbarats said the records show that meetings said to have taken place on Oct. 18 and Oct. 19 could not have happened as described by Le and Y.

Y testified that he met with Bacon, Johnston and a Red Scorpion member dubbed Person X outside a Surrey protein store on Oct. 18 to hammer out the details of the murder plot.

But Desbarats said the activity of the gang members cell phones on that date show that none of them were in Surrey at the same time.

He said even if you factored in the periods when they were not talking on their phones, police surveillance proved there was no opportunity for all four of them to have met in Surrey that day.

Desbarats also said cell phone records, which show the approximate location of the caller, also undermined Le’s claim that Johnston called him to a meeting at a Surrey Korean restaurant right before the murders. The records indicate that Le arrived in Surrey first.

And Desbarats said that a Burnaby meeting at which Le claimed Johnston confessed hours after the murder also would have been almost impossible given the location of the cell phones that afternoon.

Johnston’s team is continuing its closing submissions this afternoon.

ALBUM: The Art of McCartney

(Arctic Poppy)

2½ stars out of 5

This two-disc Paul McCartney tribute is a decade-in-the-making labour of love by one man, producer Ralph Sall. So it would be churlish to throw cold water on it, right?

Sorry. Sall’s interest in chasing down marquee names, rather than marquee performances, makes this a gigantic missed opportunity.

Sall enlists McCartney’s current backup band to fill the same role on this 34-song effort (42 with the deluxe package). The result is musical consistency — consistently generic. He recruits primarily legacy artists whose best work is behind them, often decades behind. Billy Joel opens both discs with songs (Maybe I’m Amazed and Live and Let Die) that are beyond his range now. And, trust us, the world doesn’t need to hear Steve Miller sing Hey Jude or Alice Cooper do Eleanor Rigby.

To be sure, there are fun moments, like Bob Dylan croaking through Things We Said Today and Brian Wilson’s shimmering take on Wanderlust. The compositions are excellent, even if the performances don’t always rise to that level. But you knew that going in.

Bringing in some current and more diverse artists — maybe a Katy Perry or Pharrell — and letting them interpret the music freed from a band with its own preconceptions would have been infinitely more interesting.

Levitz said the attempt by lawyers for convicted killers Cody Haevischer and Matt Johnston to get the charges against them stayed is grossly disproportionate to the misconduct alleged during the investigation.

“What my friends are asking for, essentially, is the stay of the century for one of the biggest crimes of the century, at least in this jurisdiction,” Levitz told B.C. Supreme Court Justice Catherine Wedge. “The conduct alleged is not the misconduct of the century.”

Levitz said that even if all the allegations made against police are accepted as true for the defence application, a stay of proceedings is not justified in a case where six people were executed.

Haevischer and Johnston were found guilty Oct. 2 of the 2007 murders of rival drug dealer Corey Lal, his brother Michael, associates Ryan Bartolomeo and Eddie Narong, and bystanders Chris Mohan and Ed Schellenberg.

Neither killer has been sentenced. Their lawyers are asking Wedge to order a full investigative hearing in December into the allegations of police misconduct.

Both killers have complained they were held in segregation for 14 months after their April 2009 arrest, in violation of their Charter rights.

And they say former officers on the case who allegedly had sex with potential witnesses shows “systemic” misconduct by police that warrants the stay.

Lawyers for Haevischer and Johnston said both gangsters would testify if Wedge allows a full hearing. The judge said she would rule on the defence application on Nov. 19.

Haevischer’s lawyer Dagmar Dlab said if her client is permitted to take the stand, “he would be giving details of his conditions of confinement and the impact on him — emotional, physical, all of that.”

Neither Haevischer, nor Johnston, members of the murderous Red Scorpion gang, took the stand in their own defence during the Surrey Six trial.

Dlab also told Wedge that she wants to call senior officers from the RCMP, as well as B.C. Corrections, about why the decision was made to hold Haevischer in segregation for more than a year.

And she said she wants former Mountie Dave Attew to testify about allegations of sexual misconduct that resulted in charges against him and three other Surrey Six investigators. Those officers are due to go to trial next September.

“We’d find out more about who knew what was going on. There would be a better indication of how widespread the knowledge was,” Dlab said.

Wedge suggested the defence lawyers are being vague about what evidence they would call if a full hearing were held and how it would assist her on deciding the abuse-of-process motion.

“Surely the court’s entitled to know the parameters of the evidence that you intend to call so that I can determine whether an evidentiary hearing will assist in determining the issues before me?” Wedge said. “I am not embarking on a hearing where the parameters are absolutely completely unknown and in a sense that’s what the applicants are asking me to do.”

A young drug dealer who lived in the Balmoral Tower in 2007 testified at the Surrey Six trial Tuesday about handing over his electronic key fob to accused killer Matt Johnston on the day of the murders. PNG files/...

METRO VANCOUVER — A key witness at the Surrey Six trial was told by police that the Red Scorpion gang would kill him if he didn’t cooperate in the murder case, B.C. Supreme Court heard Wednesday.

The witness, who can only be identified as DY due to a publication ban, agreed under cross-examination that police repeatedly warned him during a 2008 interview that his life was in danger from his former gang associates.

DY testified Tuesday that he gave his electronic key fob for the Balmoral Tower to accused killer Matt Johnston on the day of the murders.

DY also said that he wasn’t told why the gang needed the fob on Oct. 19, 2007, but cooperated as he sold crack and heroin for the Scorpions and hoped to become a full member some day.

But Johnston’s lawyer Mike Tammen suggested Wednesday that DY got his story from the police, who told the young dealer that Johnston was involved in the murders.

""They told you that Matt Johnston was one of the Surrey Six killers,"" Tammen said.

DY replied: ""They did mention his name. I don’t remember what they said about the role he played.""

Tammen went over a lengthy interview DY had with police after he was arrested in February 2008 in connection with the murders of drug dealer Corey Lal, his brother Michael, associates Eddie Narong and Ryan Bartolomeo and bystanders Chris Mohan and Ed Schellenberg.

Tammen said retired Mountie Don Adam, who was part of the interview team, ""told you that Matt Johnston was the person to whom you gave your FOB.""

DY said he couldn’t remember the specifics of what was said.

Tammen said ""a theme"" of police during DY’s interview was ""that you were in danger of being killed by members of the Red Scorpions, correct.""

DY agreed.

Tammen read from a transcript of the interview where Adam told DY that he was ""a huge liability"" and a ""loose end"" to the Red Scorpions.

""You are at that absolute crossroad right now, right?"" Adam said. ""Because you are, right now, either a guy who wanted those murders to occur or you are somebody who has gotten used. Only you can explain that.""

Tammen noted that police told DY several times that he could go to prison for 25 years because his fob was used by the killers.

""Three guys came and they went up to 1505 where they murdered in cold blood six people,"" Tammen read from the transcript. ""They butchered them. And DY, you by virtue of the laws of Canada assisted those people and are guilty of the murders as well as them, and DY you are going to be punished.""

DY told Justice Catherine Wedge that it he agreed to cooperate after seeing videos of the families of the victims and not because of the threat of prison or fear of Red Scorpion reprisals.

He testified that he broke down and cried during the police interview after he saw the videos as well as photos of the crime scene.

During the 2008 interview, DY expressed concern for his family’s safety, but was reassured by the police that they would be looked after.

And he told investigators he ""got tricked into giving the FOB to someone.""

He also identified several Red Scorpion members to police by the pseudonyms they used, including Johnston, aka Josh, and Surrey Six co-accused Cody Haevischer, who he knew as Blake.

The trial continues.

The crew of String Theory celebrate their second overall and first in Division 2 finish at the end of the 2014 VicMaui race.

Fifteen boats competed in the biannual Vic-Maui International Yacht race starting in early July, and the 2014 event saw it all.

From light winds to storms, from idle fishing in the doldrums to tricky navigation around the high pressure zones; it was all there. Great memories were made yet again and we all look forward to the 50th anniversary race in 2016.

The race started in Victoria and took the competitors across the Pacific to Lahaina, Maui; more than 4,000 kilometres away. Most boats took around 14 days to complete one of the world’s longest ocean races.

This year’s competition was very challenging, as the Pacific high that has traditionally developed by this time of the year was split into several high pressure zones.

While high pressure brings us sunny weather in Vancouver, sailors dread it as there is no wind in the centre of a high. The fleet soon split into two groups, one seeking a more westerly path between two distinct high pressure zones, the other staying closer east hoping for stronger winds closer to shore.

Both groups had to endure days of light winds making little progress to Maui, sails flapping idly under the scorching sun. The sailors worked to make some headway towards the elusive trade winds, the day only broken by the lonely flying fish and the odd tuna slicing through the water.

Rumour has it that some competitors passed the time fishing or going for a swim. After days of crawling across the Pacific, the fleet finally reached the trade winds. Competitors who decided on the more westerly route came out on top and enjoyed sailing in a solid breeze, while the other boats farther east had to wait a little longer to enjoy the fresh breeze.

This year’s Vic-Maui race saw its share of excitement. Early on, Anduril lost steering and had to hobble into San Francisco under emergency steering. Kinetic lost two steering cables but had a third in store that got them to Maui. Strong winds and sudden squalls shredded thousands of dollars worth of sails on different boats.

A final storm near the finish line tore through the fleet with brute force, bringing down the mast of Kahuna and ripping up the main sail on Turicum. Luckily, nobody was hurt and all boats made it safely into port. The sail lofts back in Vancouver are looking forward to the fleet’s return.

Long Board crossed the finish line at Kaanapali first and took the overall win. String Theory won their division and took second overall.

Volunteer and sponsors from Lahaina organized a welcome party for each boat and sailors’ families and friends. Mai Tais and champagne flowed freely no matter the time of day or night as the sailors crossed the finish line.

For more information on the race, visit vicmaui.org

The Vic-Maui race would not be complete without a few days of R-and-R on Maui. The island has every thing one can dream of: Turquoise water and sandy beaches for swimming and surfing, mountains to climb, seaside restaurants serving delicious fare, sublime snorkelling, sailing, paragliding, fishing and there is even a submarine.

One of my favourite beaches is Baby Beach, just outside of Lahaina. A reef breaks the waves, making it perfect for families with small children. If you want to give surfing a go, head to the beach just north of Lahaina for the perfect wave. The adventurous can rent a car and drive the road to Hana.

To escape the heat, you can get to the north end of Maui or even drive up Haleakala, one of the worlds’ largest dormant volcanoes.

For accommodation, I personally favour the hotels or small condo complexes in Lahaina over the large resorts of Kaanapali. You can walk everywhere in Lahaina: Down to Front Street for a dinner overlooking the ocean, having a swim or going surfing on the beach or picking up some fresh fruit from the local market.

As I am writing these lines I am sailing aboard String Theory about 500 miles north of Maui, returning the boat back to Vancouver together with her owners and a group of students.

Stay tuned for more stories from the high seas, fishing for Mahi Mahi and gorgeous sunset on the Pacific Ocean. In the meantime you can follow our progress here.

Aboriginal, conservation and community groups are demanding that a federal environmental review of the $2-billion Roberts Bank Terminal 2 container expansion project in South Delta include a range of marine issues that extend well beyond the project’s immediate footprint.

The concern is that Port Metro Vancouver is investigating only marine-related impacts — spills, ship collisions and effects such as noise pollution on endangered resident killer whales — within its navigational jurisdiction, a distance of only a few kilometres from the project site.

Vancouver lawyer Rosanne Kyle, representing the Pacheedaht First Nation of Port Renfrew on southern Vancouver Island, says in a submission to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency that container ships bound for Roberts Bank would pass through her client’s traditional territory.

Natives are concerned about risks of contamination and disturbance to the marine environment, especially alongside other projects such as the planned twinning of the Kinder Morgan pipeline, which has received far more publicity. She urged CEAA to adopt terms of reference that include the wider impact of shipping associated with the Roberts Bank project, especially as it relates to aboriginal rights and treaties.

BC Nature (the Federation of BC Naturalists) said in a separate submission that the project “will have a highly detrimental effect on the natural values of Roberts Bank, and puts at risk the ongoing viability of this critically important avian flyway. In addition, the ensuing large increase in shipping from the port through the Georgia Strait, Southern Gulf Islands and Strait of Juan de Fuca would severely threaten the integrity of these marine ecosystems.”

The planned new terminal at Roberts Bank would be located next to the existing Deltaport and Westshore Terminals and would provide an additional 2.4 million units of container capacity per year. In 2013, Port Metro Vancouver moved the equivalent of 2.8 million 20-foot container units.

“People don’t realize how big this is and the potential impacts,” said Roger Emsley of Against Port Expansion and a member of the port’s liaison committee.

Other concerns relate to increased rail and road traffic, noise and light pollution, and the habitat of juvenile salmon.

Emsley is arguing for an independent environmental assessment into the project, not one conducted by consultants hired by the port.

The port suggests the initial construction is worth about $500 million in wages. During full operation, it would directly employ 7,600 and contribute $1.2 billion to the gross domestic product.

The port estimates 260 vessels would visit the terminal annually, which translates into 520 transits through local waters.

The public comment period on the project’s draft terms of reference ended Sept. 22.

Debra Myles, panel manager for CEAA, noted in an email to port environmental manager Kyle Robertson dated Oct. 3, 2014: “Several submissions maintained that the federal environmental assessment should include the potential effects of container ship traffic activities which are not part of the project as defined for the environmental assessment.”

The port has not yet replied to the email.

Rhona Hunter, port director of infrastructure sustainability, explained in an interview that light emanating from the project and extending beyond the port’s jurisdiction to impact communities would fall within an environmental assessment. A spill from a container ship or a ship collision outside the port’s jurisdiction would not.

Likewise, while the port is considering the impact of the Roberts Bank expansion on endangered resident killer whales within its jurisdiction, it is also considering whether ship noise created within its jurisdiction must be studied because it can travel much farther underwater.

“That’s part of the assessment, to determine the range that noise travels,” said Hunter.

The port’s jurisdiction extends about 1.7 kilometres south of the project site and 11 kilometres west.

Port spokesman John Parker-Jervis noted that the new terminal would only handle containers, meaning the “risks and magnitude of a potential oil spill are limited to the bunker fuel that is onboard any vessels that would call on the new terminal.”

On Dec. 23, 1988, the Sause Brothers barge Nestucca released about 87,400 litres of bunker oil off Grays Harbor, Wash. The oil drifted northward with the currents, including up to the west coast of Vancouver Island as far as Cape Scott. The oil washed up on beaches, and up to 56,000 seabirds are thought to have died. Crab, shellfish and herring were affected along with native fishing practices.

The port’s environmental assessment should be concluded in early 2015.

Once the federal Minister of the Environment appoints a review panel, it will have 14 months to conduct its review, including public hearings, but not including time required by Port Metro Vancouver to gather information required for the environmental assessment.

Last June, CEAA announced the allocation of about $450,000 to 13 applicants — mostly aboriginal groups from Metro Vancouver and southern Vancouver Island — to support their participation in the environmental assessment of the proposed Roberts Bank Terminal 2.

If approved, the project would be completed in the mid-2020s.

When Port Metro Vancouver conducted its own review of a planned $15-million coal-loading facility at Fraser Surrey Docks, it studied the impacts of the project footprint but not the greater impacts associated with increased rail traffic. The project was approved in August despite widespread concerns involving human and environmental health, including by provincial health authorities.

Surrey individuals and organizations opposed to the coal facility have applied to the Federal Court of Canada for a judicial review of that decision.

The price for petrol dipped below a dollar a litre in Abbotsford this week as world gas prices continue to slump. The downshift from four figure gas prompted some residents to post pictures of pump prices that had fallen a low as 98.9 cents at that city’s Costco by late Friday, according to gasbuddy.com.

METRO VANCOVER – The cost of gas continues to drop in Metro Vancouver as world oil prices slump, with prices at some stations 25 cents a litre cheaper than this time last year.

The average price of gas in the region today is a little over 107.8 cents a litre, according to GasBuddy.com, a website that records gas prices from stations’ posted price. But in many areas of Vancouver the prices were less, as low as 105.9 cents. In Port Coquitlam on Friday, gas was posted at 103.9 cents.

That’s down significantly from just a week a go, when gas prices were on average around 112.4 cents a litre, and this time last year the average price in Metro Vancouver was 125.6 a litre.

Last week, the price for petrol dipped below a dollar a litre in Abbotsford. Residents posted pump prices as a low as 98.9 cents at that city’s Costco by late Friday.

Just six months ago, a litre of gas in Abbotsford was going for 142.8 cents. Gas has yet to reach the dollar mark in Vancouver, but at a little over 105 cents, it’s getting close.

A decade ago, gas in the city was going for 76 cents a litre.

Meantime, Statistics Canada said Friday a big drop in prices at the pump helped slow Canada’s annual inflation rate last month to 2.0 per cent.

Gasoline prices were 5.9 per cent lower than a year earlier amid a global slide in world oil prices, StatsCan said. The agency’s gasoline price index fell 7.5 per cent in November — the fifth consecutive monthly decrease.

No one has publicly stuck up their hand to run for mayor, and the only people confirmed running for office are the six incumbent councillors, park board commissioners and school trustees.

But the lack of activity doesn’t mean the NPA isn’t girding for a fight with incumbent Mayor Gregor Robertson and his Vision Vancouver party.

NPA president Peter Armstrong said his party has decided — like Vision Vancouver — to run partial slates for council, park board and school board. It has also narrowed its choice of mayoral candidates down to a handful and has spent months interviewing and checking the credentials of a number of candidates for the three offices. He said the party will likely announce its candidate list within weeks.

One person whose name won’t be on the mayoral list is developer and NPA vice-president Rob Macdonald, who confirmed Monday that he has — for the second time in as many elections — decided not to run for office. Former Liberal MLA and finance minister Colin Hansen also confirmed to The Sun several months ago that he had been asked by the NPA to run but decided to continue with his retirement.

Former Vancouver Sun managing editor Kirk LaPointe, now publisher at Self-Counsel Press, said Tuesday he’d been approached by the NPA. He said he had submitted information to the party but would not say whether he is interested in running for mayor or council.

“They asked if I would be interested in municipal politics,” LaPointe said. “I am keenly interested in the future of the city and I find that interesting. It is premature for me or anyone else to say I am a candidate at any level because there is a process underway and I am not in control of it. The party is in control of it.”

Macdonald said he had considered running for mayor but bowed out in part because he was concerned Vision Vancouver would make him “a lightning rod” for an attack campaign. Macdonald was the campaign finance chair for mayoral candidate Suzanne Anton in the last election campaign, when he donated more than $960,000 to the NPA — in part, he said, because he had been distracted from his fundraising goals because of the illness of a close friend. As a result, he made the donations personally to meet his pledge to assist Anton.

Macdonald said he has been told by several people that Vision Vancouver had plans to use his history — whatever that might mean — to attack the NPA.

“They’ve got a whole bunch of people in communications developing attack strategies … I don’t want to be the lightning rod for the party. It should really be about how to run the city and it shouldn’t be about Rob MacDonald. It is about who is best qualified to run the city,” he said. “I have met the candidates, and any one of them could do a way better job than the current mayor. So it doesn’t have to be Rob MacDonald. There are other qualified people.”

Armstrong would not confirm any names of those who put themselves forward for the NPA.

Coun. Elizabeth Ball, the chair of the NPA’s six-member caucus, said the party has been determined to find the right candidates and avoid the kind of costly election mistakes that have caused trouble in the past.

The NPA suffered through a nasty internal fight when it dumped Mayor Philip Owen in favour of Jennifer Clarke for the 2002 election, only to lose all but two seats on council. In 2008, the party split again when Mayor Sam Sullivan was dumped in favour of ex-councillor and businessman Peter Ladner, and the NPA was reduced to a single seat.

“It is the first time I have seen a process this tough,” she said of the NPA’s vetting system. ”They really are doing their homework so that there aren’t any surprises in the middle of the campaign. You don’t find out somebody has written something shocking. They are spending their time doing this. The truth is they are trying not to end up in any difficult situations, by getting really top people in those positions.”

Ball suggested the silence so far from the party is not unusual.

“It may be frustrating to outside people who want news right now, but all of us feel confident right now that the people who are going to be recommended are going to be top-notch people who have served the community in many ways,” she said, adding the party’s strategy is still to field enough candidates to form government.

“Oh, I think they are working very hard to get a team that can change the government. I think they really want to succeed in having a majority on council. I think that is absolutely the goal and that is why they are being so careful of who they are moving forward with,” she said.

VANCOUVER – A year and a half after a public inquiry called for urgent action to protect women along a stretch of highway in northern British Columbia known as the Highway of Tears, mayors and other leaders in the region say the province has yet to contact them about what needs to happen.

Internal briefing notes also indicate a team of bureaucrats assigned to hold consultations with communities along Highway 16, where women have been disappearing or turning up dead for decades, have put that work on hold for much of the past year.

What emerges is a picture of slow progress that appears to contradict the province’s claims that it has been busy holding a “tremendous number” of meetings about the issue with local governments.

A public inquiry into the Robert Pickton case also examined the phenomenon of murdered and missing women in the province’s north, in particular along the highway between Prince Rupert on the coast and Prince George, a nine-hour drive to the east.

At least 17 women, many of them aboriginal, have vanished or been murdered along Highway 16 and the adjacent Highways 97 and 5 since the 1970s. Most of the cases remain unsolved, though investigators don’t believe a single killer is responsible.

Much of the discussion about the Highway of Tears has focused on a lack of affordable transportation connecting isolated communities, which has led some women to resort to hitchhiking.

First Nations leaders released a report in 2006 recommending a shuttle bus along the highway.

Public inquiry commissioner Wally Oppal produced a report in December 2012 with more than 60 recommendations. Among them, Oppal endorsed the 2006 report and urged the province to “immediately” commit to developing an improved public transit system for the Highway of Tears, in consultation with local governments.

“I don’t know who they’ve been talking to, but they haven’t been talking to the mayor of Prince Rupert,” said Mayor Jack Mussallem, whose community of 13,500 people is located 750 kilometres northwest of Vancouver.

“I’m starting to get a little concerned about whether or not we’re going to see anything. … It’s not an issue that’s going to go away, and hopefully it’s somewhere on their priority list.”

Mayors or city staff in Terrace, Smithers, Vanderhoof, Houston, Fraser Lake and Telkwa said they, too, have not been directly contacted to formally discuss the Highway of Tears issue.

The tribal chief of the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council and the chair of the Regional District of Bulkley-Nechako also said they had not been approached by the province.

Documents obtained by The Canadian Press through a freedom-of-information request indicate there was some work done in early 2013.

Staff within the Transportation Ministry and assistant deputy ministers from three different ministries were assigned to the file.

They identified potential stakeholders and compiled a list of existing transportation options in the region. A status report from February 2013 indicates staff held an initial meeting with the North Central Local Government Association that month.

But by the summer, the work appears to have wound down, according to the documents.

The families of four women connected to the Pickton case filed the first in a series of lawsuits last May, prompting the province to warn that it’s work on Oppal’s recommendations would be constrained by the legal process. None of the lawsuits involved women whose deaths or disappearances were linked to the Highway of Tears.

A Transportation Ministry briefing note in July said staff had not planned any further consultations because of the lawsuits, and the ministry confirmed in a statement last week that consultations had been “put on hold so as not to compromise the legal process.”

The province settled the lawsuits in March.

Transportation Minister Todd Stone told the legislature in April that “there have been a tremendous number of discussions and meetings that have been held, particularly with local government officials, community organizations and other stakeholders throughout the corridor.”

When asked what meetings had actually taken place, the Transportation Ministry identified only two: the February 2013 meeting with the North Central Local Government Association and a meeting last November with the Omineca Beetle Action Coalition, a group of northern mayors and regional district chairs, to discuss “rural and northern transportation challenges.” Another meeting with the action coalition is set for May, the ministry said.

The ministry also noted BC Transit has been talking to northern communities about the possibility of expanding bus service.

Justice Minister Suzanne Anton declined an interview request. Instead, she issued a written statement repeating her previous comments that the issue is complex and that the government is committed to protecting vulnerable women.

A report released by the Justice Ministry last fall said staff had identified potential transportation options for the Highway of Tears and expected to begin consultations soon, though it provided no details.

Anton has insisted the highway is safer than it was 15 years ago and she noted there are several transportation options already in place, including local public transit, Greyhound bus service, rail service and a regional health bus that transports patients from rural communities to medical appointments.

Maurine Karagianis, the Opposition NDP critic for women’s issues, said the Liberal government has done nothing new to improve safety along Highway 16 since the public inquiry report. She also pointed out Greyhound dramatically cut its service last year, which means the situation is actually worse.

“It’s a mystery to me why the government hasn’t made more progress on this,” said Karagianis.

“All of the comments the minister (Anton) has made show how incredibly out of touch she and the government are.”

Terry Teegee, the tribal chief of the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council, said he’s disappointed, but not surprised, by the lack of progress on the issue.

“I think their lack of initiative just to look into the feasibility of this shows that it’s not a priority for them,” said Teegee, whose niece, Ramona Wilson, vanished in June 1994 and was found dead 10 months later.

Teegee disputed the government’s claim that the highway is safe.

“There are still woman going missing,” he said.

“This (proposed) shuttle service and other things that we are doing are to try to prevent this from happening.”

In its notice of hearing, commission staff alleges that Rodney Jack Wharram raised $9.35 million from investors through two companies between December 2006 and October 2010 that was supposed to be used to develop recreational property for the resort, but that only $3.6 million was forwarded to the developer.

Commission staff also allege that Wharram used $469,000 for his own purposes, including $130,000 to purchase his own home, a $240,000 loan to his wife and the purchase of a $24,000 diamond ring for his wife.

Owners of The Falls had ambitious plans to expand the resort with a $250-million winter club and considerable residential real estate, but ran into financial difficulties that saw the resort seek protection from creditors in 2011.

The commission alleges that when The Falls sought protection, Wharram sold his companies’ creditor claims against the development for $63,779, but spent $47,500 of the proceeds for personal expenses. Lastly, the commission alleges Wharram lied to its staff during a 2013 investigation.

During an interview in March 2013, Wharram told the commission he was no longer raising funds through his companies, but according to the notice of hearing, commission staff have evidence that he raised a further $450,000.

None of the allegations have been proven before the hearing panel.

Wharram, who is representing himself, said he will extensively cross-examine the BCSC’s lead investigator on the case, Liz Chan, and that questioning her investigation will be key to his defence, according to hearing transcripts.

The commission issued a temporary order last June barring Wharram and his related companies — The Falls Capital Corp., Deercrest Construction Fund Inc. and West Karma Ltd.— from selling the companies’ securities and prohibiting him from acting as the director of a company or engaging in investor relations before a hearing of the allegations.

The hearing opened Monday. Paige Leggat, counsel for the commission’s executive director, said she plans to call nine witnesses in the enforcement staff’s case.

Supreme Court has ruled.

Justice Brian Joyce said this week that the Maple Trust Company should not have to forfeit its interest in the house at 1173 – 160th Street to the government.

Federal Crown prosecutors had argued that Maple Trust should have checked into claims by Kien Tam Nguyen and his wife Nga Thuy Nguyen that they earned $95,000 a year as mushroom farmers before helping the couple buy the house.

Tax records found in the residence during an RCMP raid in 2003 showed the couple’s annual income was less than $10,500 at the time the mortgage was obtained.

The case has been before various courts for more than a decade.

The Nguyens were convicted of producing marijuana and received a conditional sentence of 18 months in March 2006. They were also ordered to forfeit their equity in the property.

They appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada and lost in 2009.

The Crown had also served Maple Trust with a notice of forfeiture of its interest in the house. The lender had provided a mortgage of $281,250.00, when the Nguyen’s bought the $375,000 house in late 2002.

Maple Trust fought back in B.C. Supreme Court, arguing that it shouldn’t have to hand over its interest in the property.

The case was heard over several days in the spring of 2012, with Joyce issuing his ruling Wednesday.

He accepted evidence from witnesses for Maple Trust who testified that the procedures used by the company for ""non-income-qualified mortgage loans"" like that obtained by the Nguyens were the same as those of other financial institutions at the time.

The Nguyens had claimed the husband was self-employed and had assets worth $344,000.00, including $140,000.00 on deposit with the Royal Bank. ""

Maple Trust underwriter Sannie Fisher testified ""that it was not Maple Trust’s policy to independently verify income, perform corporate searches or obtain criminal record checks with regard to borrowers.""

""Ms. Fisher had not been cautioned in any way, in 2002, that marijuana grow-ops in residential properties were a significant problem in British Columbia,"" Joyce said.

He ruled ""the steps taken by Maple Trust were reasonable in the circumstances, particularly when viewed from the perspective of a reasonable mortgage lender for the acquisition of residential property in 2002.""

""I do not accept that Maple Trust should be denied relief from forfeiture because it failed to make independent inquiries of Mr. Nguyen’s amount and source of income,"" Joyce said.

Sharma, 34, a lawyer and new mother, was elected to her first term with the park board in 2011. She said she wants to move over to city council because she’s interested in citywide political issues.

Sharma is the second park board commissioner to indicate interest in running for council.

Melissa De Genova, one of two Non-Partisan Association commissioners, said she also plans to run for council following an NPA review of candidates.

The announcements come a day after the province said it will introduce changes to election rules to extend terms of office from three years to four.

Under Vision’s rules, Sharma will have to seek nomination in June for any positions left open after the party conducts a review vote of incumbents at its annual general meeting May 4.

Stepan Vdovine, Vision’s executive director, said incumbents wanting to move to a different level of office will not be given a leadership review in May and instead will have to submit to a separate nomination vote in June.

He said about two dozen people who have indicated they want to run for office under Vision will go through a vetting process before the June meeting.

The announcements come amid growing interest from people wanting to run in the November election.

Vision has not yet decided if it will run a full slate of candidates for council, park board and school board, Vdovine said. In the 2011 election Vision ran partial slates to help the Coalition of Progressive Electors, which shared some political views. However, in recent months, COPE has said it won’t split campaigns with Vision and intends to run its own full slates.

Natasha Westover, the NPA’s campaign director, said her party has received more than 100 expressions of interest from people wanting to run for office.

Sharma has received the backing of several Vision Vancouver councillors, including Geoff Meggs and Andrea Reimer, as well as school board chairwoman Patti Bacchus.

De Genova said that in recent weeks she has been encouraged by friends and voters to run for the NPA on council.

There are eight Vision council members, including Mayor Gregor Robertson. George Affleck and Elizabeth Ball have indicated they will likely seek re-election as NPA councillors. Adriane Carr, the Green party councillor, is also seeking re-election.

Liberal side, and alternatively taunted and toyed with the New Democratic Party Opposition.

From the outset Wednesday, Clark saw where the New Democrats were headed with a line of questions about the government’s ethnic outreach scandal, and refused to play along.

“I think the members of the Opposition, rather than standing up here in this kind of theatrical farce — (should) just get the end of the book and let us know what’s going on.”

She reminded the NDP how the scandal had fared as a deciding issue in the last election: “These issues were talked about very extensively in this legislature, outside of it and then during the election campaign. Despite all of these issues having been raised, British Columbians said they wanted this government to serve them.”

She ridiculed: “I have to assume that the question bank for the Opposition’s research group is running a little bit low. Of course, if they don’t have any questions about the current workings of government, perhaps they could ask (MLA Andrew Weaver) of the Green party to get up. I know he’s always got something smart to say.”

She suggested alternatives: “I had thought that members might have some very vital questions about education, vital questions about what’s going on with Mount Polley, vital questions about what’s going on with the coroner’s inquest in Burns Lake for the Lake Babine mill. What about questions with respect to ferries? All of those are issues that we would be very, very happy to talk about in question period.”

She turned tables and asked questions herself: “Do they want a balanced budget, or do they want to stand by all those election promises that would have meant digging into taxpayers’ pockets for $2 billion more?”

She mock-sympathized: “We’ve all had losses in our lives and things that we regret and things that we wish we’d done differently. I take it that the members didn’t feel like they adequately canvassed all these issues a couple of years ago … so now they want to consume a question period talking about those things again.”

She just plain mocked: “They will have to change their name from the NDP to the Irrelevant Party one of these days soon.”

All this to thunderous desk-thumping and applause from her own troops, joined by Green MLA Weaver himself when Clark declared: “In this question period we have never seen a better and stronger argument for official party status for the Greens.”

All the while the New Democrats looked pretty downcast and afterwards mounted a defence-cum-excuse for what they had tried and mostly failed to accomplish.

The goal was to take advantage of one of the premier’s occasional appearances in the house to breathe second life into the scandal — Liberals scheming to use public resources to further the party’s partisan interests with various ethnic communities — that played out in the early months of 2013.

Not all of the questions were backdated, notwithstanding the premier’s taunts.

But the New Democrats choose to front-end-load their attack with concerns that were widely reported in 2013. “Blamelines in ethnic outreach debacle run straight to premier,” as the headline on one of my columns had it in the run-up to the election.

By the time Wednesday that Opposition MLAs had put aside the old news and zeroed in on the more recent developments — the laying of charges in September against two of those connected to the affair — they’d lost whatever initiative existed for them at the outset.

After 18 questions pitched by nine NDP MLAs, Opposition House Leader Mike Farnworth, batting cleanup as he often does, summed up the main point for his side about the multiple players in the scandal:

“They’re the premier’s people. They weren’t inherited. No one forced them upon this government. No one forced them upon this government. Two of those operatives and the company they own are facing charges for Election Act violations. According to the special prosecutor, there may be more to come.”

He spoke those words after the clock had run out, Speaker Linda Reid having exercised her discretion to briefly extend the usual 30 minutes set aside for question period.

Whether that extension was in the interest of the Opposition is open to debate. For by then, there was no moving the premier off her game.

“Well, I have to say I’m disappointed,” she scoffed in closing for her side. “After all of that run-up, a half-hour of question period asking the same question again and again, they finally get to the punchline, and it just wasn’t that good.”

No mercy, in other words. But the lack of respect is mutual and holds many risks for the Opposition in seeking to defeat the government next time.

The New Democrats don’t appear to have gotten over losing the last election to Clark, for they continue to discount her abilities as a communicator, a leader and a premier. Having underestimated both her abilities and her chances before the election, I understand how that can happen.

But unless the New Democrats start taking the premier more seriously than they have done to date, they risk more encounters where they don’t lay a glove on her.
