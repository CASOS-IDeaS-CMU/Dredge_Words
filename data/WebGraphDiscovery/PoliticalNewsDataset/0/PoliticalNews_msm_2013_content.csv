Mega Millions is at the highest it's ever been since Florida joined the game in May — $400 million and growing — and could approach its all-time record of $656 million, set in 2012.

Meanwhile, Florida Lotto is at $43 million, having not been won since Aug. 31. It's the second-highest jackpot in a year that has produced few winners.

We're due down here. No one from Broward County or Palm Beach County has won this year, and there have been only six jackpot winners statewide this year, compared to 21 in 2012.

The Mega Millions drawing is Friday night; Lotto and Powerball are Saturday night. No one has won Mega Millions on a Friday the 13th since March 13, 2009, when Isabel Zelaya of Suffolk County, N.Y., hit for $26 million.

Howard Simon has been a state affiliate Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for almost four decades. He is the ACLU's most senior Affiliate Director. Howard has served as Executive Director of the ACLU of Florida since October 1997, and prior to his appointment as Florida ACLU Director he served as Executive Director of ACLU's Michigan affiliate for 23 years. Howard was raised in New York, and graduated from the City College of New York. He received a Ph.D. degree from the University of Minnesota in legal and political philosophy and social ethics. Prior to his work with the ACLU, he taught philosophy at the University of Minnesota and was a faculty member in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at DePauw University in Indiana. As Executive Director of the Florida affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, Howard has overall responsibility for ACLU's legal, public education, legislative lobbying, and membership and fund-raising programs. Howard has been a frequent guest editorial writer in many Florida newspapers, and regularly appears in the media challenging politicians and government policies that assault constitutional freedoms. The ACLU of Florida has approximately 15,000 members, a staff of 30 and maintains staffed offices in Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Tampa in addition to its headquarters in Miami. The ACLU has been extensively involved in addressing the need for electoral reforms in Florida. Following the voting problems that occurred in the 2006 Congressional District 13 Election in Sarasota, the ACLU played a key role in securing the end of the use of paperless electronic voting systems in Florida, leading to the 2008 election in which every county used the same voting technology (the optical scan voting system) for the first time. The organization has also led efforts to end Florida's Civil War constitutional provision requiring a lifetime voting ban of former felons. The ACLU of Florida is in the forefront of efforts to resist many of the anti-civil liberties initiatives originating from the Legislature and the Scott Administration. The ACLU filed numerous cases challenging efforts to make it more difficult to register new voters, reduce the number of early voting days, specifically banning voting on the Sunday prior to the Tuesday November Election, and more difficult to have your voted counted by requiring more people to vote by provisional, rather than regular ballot. The ACLU has challenged the Governor's Executive Order mandating drug/urine screen tests for state employees in the absence of suspicion of illicit drugs. Another ACLU lawsuit resulted in a federal order blocking the law requiring all applicants for Temporary Assistance for Needy families (TANF) to submit to a suspicionless drug/urine test.

Johnson, vice mayor, West Park; president/CEO, Minority Builders Coalition","Prior to his present role as President/CEO of the Minority Builders Coalition (MBC), Brian worked with at-risk youth in Broward County for nearly 20 years. After realizing that poverty was the consistent root cause of the troubles the children and families he served were facing, Brian shifted his career focus to community economic development. As President/CEO of Minority Builders Coalition, Inc., MBC actively supports a network of minority and small construction related businesses throughout South Florida, has helped to create/retain jobs for workers in construction fields, builds and manages affordable housing for low/moderate income families, and preserves safe and accessible homes for more than 700 seniors every year.

Even after changing careers from human services to economic development, Brian maintained his passion for serving troubled children and families in Broward County. With the encouragement and support from local community leaders, Brian founded Community Based Connections, Inc. (CBCI) in 2009. CBCI partners with the United Way of Broward County to enhance the academic performance of underperforming K-3 grade students at Sunland Park Academy. As a direct result of CBCIs support, Sunland Park Academy recently came with a few percentage points of receiving a “B” letter grade after being an “F” or “D” school for 8 out of the last 10 years. CBCI also partners with the Children’s Services Council of Broward County and Team SOY to prevent child abuse and neglect, expand diversion opportunities for youthful offenders, and the organization is gearing up to launch a new program to provide culturally competent academic supports to underperforming students at Deerfield Beach Middle School.

Brian recently served on the Board of Directors for the Greater Fort Lauderdale Alliance, Broward County's official public/private partnership for economic development. He is the current Chair of the Broward County Small Business Development Advisory Board and he is one of the chief advocates for small/minority businesses in Broward County.

Brian is presently the Vice Mayor for the city of West Park where he is dedicated to growing businesses, creating jobs and planning smart and exciting growth in his city. Brian has been recognized by Legacy Magazine as one of the 50 Most Powerful Blacks in Business in Broward County.

For more than 20 years, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has dedicated her public life to working on behalf of the people of South Florida. On January 4, 2005, she was sworn in as a member of the United States House of Representatives. Rep. Wasserman Schultz represents Florida's 23rd Congressional district, which encompasses parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties. Before joining the U.S. Congress, she was first a Representative and later a Senator in the Florida State Legislature. For the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Appropriations recommended Rep. Wasserman Schultz to serve as a ranking member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, which determines the Congressional appropriations of funds for particular parts of the federal government. Rep. Wasserman Schultz will serve on the subcommittee that determines the funding level for the entire legislative branch. Wasserman Schultz also serves on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, where she advocates for funding for security, economic, and humanitarian assistance, as well as works to reduce poverty around the world. She also serves as a Chief Deputy Whip where she works to help advance legislation important to the Democratic caucus. Rep. Wasserman Schultz is a person respected by her colleagues for her tenacity and her hard work on many important issues. In March 2009, after announcing her own battle with breast cancer, she introduced the Education and Awareness Requires Learning Young Act, or EARLY Act (H.R. 1740), a piece of legislation that directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop and implement a national education campaign about the threat breast cancer poses to all young women, and the particular heightened risks of certain ethnic, cultural and racial groups. This bill became law as part of the Affordable Health Care Act in March 2010. A fighter for South Florida families, Rep. Wasserman Schultz has worked hard to protect children. Some of her accomplishments in the field include the passage of the PROTECT Our Children Act, which creates the largest law enforcement effort ever formed for the protection of children, and, the passage of the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act to combat childhood drowning. The first Jewish Congresswoman ever elected from Florida, Rep. Wasserman Schultz introduced a resolution, which passed the House of Representatives and called on the President to declare an annual Jewish American Heritage Month. The President subsequently did so, with the inaugural month in May, 2006. Since then, Presidents have proclaimed Jewish American Heritage Month annually. All of this experience serves to enhance her commitment to lower health care costs, improve the quality of life for our children, protect Social Security and Medicare, and stand up for South Florida's middle class families.. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was born in 1966 on Long Island, NY. She attended the University of Florida and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science in 1988 and with a Master's Degree in 1990. She has been married to Steve Schultz for more than 20 years and together they have three children. The Congresswoman is proud to call South Florida home where she resides with her family in Weston.

Katrina, which had formed on Aug. 23 and made its way across Florida as a Category 1 hurricane grew rapidly into a Category 5 storm and the largest ever seen in the Gulf of Mexico at the time before striking as a Category 3 with 125 mph winds just south of New Orleans on Aug. 29.

The storm surge, broken levies and flooding that followed left nearly 2,000 dead and billions of dollars in damage. It put FEMA, the president and Louisiana's elected officials into a national debate.

It was only one year after Florida was struck by four hurricanes, and 2005 would see even more destruction later in the season from Hurricanes Rita and Wilma, but nothing was like Katrina.

It was a game changer.","2013-08-29 14:55:00","0","11.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","29.0","17.0","0.0","71.0","4.0","15.0","0","153","96.67","50.00","53.79","5.16","19.12","20.26","71.90","45.75","4.58","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.58","10.46","15.69","4.58","3.92","7.19","0.65","9.15","6.54","5.23","0.65","8.50","0.65","1.96","0.00","1.96","0.00","1.31","0.00","1.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.88","1.96","0.65","0.65","0.65","1.31","0.65","1.96","1.96","0.00","0.00","0.65","0.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.92","0.65","0.00","3.27","0.00","0.00","7.84","1.31","0.00","19.61","1.96","10.46","7.19","0.65","0.65","0.00","0.65","0.00","1.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.46","5.23","3.92","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.31","0.00","0.00","675","7.93","25.833333333333332","219","152","7","66.37","12.5","9.4","9.4","11.1","31","13.25","18.837894736842106","108","22.67","1","0.42","0","9","12","16","0","24","6","1","1","1","23","20","0","8","0","0","3","1","10","0","0","0","0","0","1","12","1","4","1","0","1","0","0","0"

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/celebrity/bal-homeland-recap-uhohah-20131006-story.html","'Homeland' recap, 'Uh...Oh...Ah...'","Everyone in episode two was acting like someone else, with Carrie imitating Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,"" Dana emulating Claire Danes in ""Romeo + Juliet"" and Saul impersonating his own murdered boss and Carrie’s nemesis, David Estes.

Let’s recap. Carrie is in a full-blown mania: paranoid, angry, reckless and loud, loud, loud. She tries to tell “her side” of the story to the press, but the reporter she’s sought out looks skeptical of the lady yelling about covert ops and CIA double-dealing. Three cops saunter into the newsroom saying that someone (Saul) has requested that Carrie be detained for psychiatric evaluation, implying that she is considered to be a threat to herself or others.

Incredulous, Carrie tries to defend herself, but she’s not very convincing. Her appearance and behavior are so unhinged that no one can take her seriously. Even her sister and father realize that spilling state secrets in a manic pique is a terrible idea.

After refusing treatment and attempting to bolt from her commitment hearing, Carrie is forcibly injected with Thorazine, an old-school anti psychotic medication with terrible sedating effects. Beached like Nicholson’s McMurphy in front of a hospital TV when Saul finds her during visiting hours, Carrie issues a deliberate, well-earned epithet to her former mentor.

While Carrie spends the episode trying to break out of a psychiatric unit, Dana is desperate to re-enter the cushy private treatment center where her therapists are sympathetic and that cute boy is still convalescing from his own (still unexplained) mental health crisis. In a cruel trick, she disappears from the bath, making us think she has hurt herself again. Instead, she’s snuck back to the facility to see her guy.

Their laundry room reunion is so romantic and stylized that I was instantly reminded of Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio rolling in white sheets as the young stars of Baz Luhrmann’s 1996 ""Romeo + Juliet."" Confirming the reference, Dana reveals that this boy’s name is Leo, too.

When Jess finally finds her daughter and drags her home, Dana has some harsh but necessary words for her mother. Brody ruined their lives, she says, so stop pretending that he never existed or acting like it’s crazy to be so angry.

At Langley, Saul is following some vague leads that tie the CIA bombing to Iranian associates of Abu Nazir, but he’s making Estes’ old mistake of ordering his subordinates to produce intelligence that confirms his preconceived theories.

Fara, a young CIA recruit with a headscarf and a slight accent, is put to work deciphering the banking transactions recorded on the laptop Quinn recovered from his mission in Caracas. She discovers that the alleged terrorists have been transferring money through a New York-based bank, and Quinn intimidates the bankers into turning over everything they have. I’m interested, I guess, but it’s hard to get excited about this line of inquiry – when will it all connect back to Brody, or someone else we care about?

Despite the dryness of the post-bombing investigation, I like the atmosphere of pervasive paranoia that the ""Homeland"" writers continue to cultivate. In my notes, all of our CIA contacts are now wildcards. Between Quinn, Saul, Dar Adal and Carrie, I honestly don’t know whom to trust.

Finally, what should we make of the film references? Are these just Easter eggs for film-buff viewers, or are the writers giving us clues about what’s ahead for these characters? If so, the allusions don’t bode well for Carrie and Dana: in both ""Cuckoo’s Nest"" and ""Romeo + Juliet,"" the protagonists die at the end.","2013-10-07 10:01:00","0","17.0","2.0","3.0","0.0","26.0","0.0","40.0","20.0","0.0","82.0","4.0","17.0","0","603","74.89","79.18","7.30","8.14","22.33","24.54","75.29","46.27","12.44","7.63","1.00","1.00","0.00","5.14","0.50","4.81","6.47","13.10","6.47","4.98","5.97","0.83","12.27","3.48","1.00","1.16","1.00","1.00","5.64","1.99","3.48","0.83","1.33","0.33","11.61","0.66","0.50","4.64","1.82","10.12","3.32","1.33","0.50","2.49","1.16","2.65","3.32","1.33","1.16","0.83","1.00","0.00","0.83","0.00","0.17","5.97","1.82","1.33","1.82","0.66","0.83","1.16","9.62","0.33","10.95","1.49","4.98","4.48","2.99","0.83","0.66","1.33","0.00","0.33","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","19.40","3.98","6.80","0.33","0.00","0.50","0.00","1.33","2.32","2.99","0.66","0.50","2908","8.8","22.962962962962962","885","596","26","56.69","13.1","11.0","12.65","14.1","152","13.0","21.361342281879196","361","21.0","10","0.45","0","25","3","49","0","71","44","0","0","3","95","71","1","32","0","0","27","20","31","0","0","2","19","0","22","11","25","13","19","29","1","3","0","4"
"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/celebrity/la-et-cm-moca-ann-goldstein-20130829-story.html","Rumors of a MOCA return amid director's resignation","This story has been updated. See details below.

Ann Goldstein, a former senior curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, resigned as director of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam Wednesday, intensifying speculation that she could be MOCA's next director.

Since the departure in July of Jeffrey Deitch, Goldstein's name has been among those mentioned as a possible successor, given her history with the museum and her experience running a major art institution.

A Los Angeles native, Goldstein began her museum career at MOCA, rising to senior curator over the course of 20 years.

TIMELINE: MOCA in flux

She became director of the Stedelijk in January 2010. She led the Stedelijk, which was founded in 1874 and is among Europe's oldest museums of Modern and contemporary art, through the final years of a massive renovation; it had been closed for nine years before reopening in 2012.

At the Stedelijk, Goldstein was curator for a large retrospective of the work of the late Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley, which opened in Amsterdam last December before moving to the Pompidou museum in Paris, where it closed recently. It opens at MoMA PS1 in New York in October and at MOCA in March 2014.

The search for a new director will be headed up by Joel Wachs, a former L.A. City Council president; the co-chairs of MOCA's board of trustees, Maria Bell and David Johnson; and board president Fred Sands.

Goldstein is a longtime friend and colleague of Wachs, a former MOCA trustee who is president of New York's Andy Warhol Foundation; the Warhol Foundation is a primary funder of the traveling Kelley retrospective.

It remains unclear how far along the committee is in its search. A MOCA spokeswoman said in an e-mail that ""the museum has formed a search committee and the search has begun. There is no leaning toward any potential candidate at this point.""

Goldstein, who also didn't respond to requests for comment, appears to be a popular choice for director among some people with knowledge of the situation.

""Ann's name constantly appears on people's lists"" of possible candidates, said John Walsh, a former Getty Museum director who isn't on the committee but who is familiar with the search.

But he added that the museum hasn't begun the formal process of picking a new director yet.

""I hope the rumors are true,"" said Lyn Kienholz, founder of the California/International Arts Foundation. ""It would be great because she's had experience. I think she'd do a good job — I think she knows the territory, and in this town you have to know the territory and the players.""

In an interview with The Times in December 2012, Goldstein said ""MOCA gave me foremost a deeply rooted love and belief in the importance of museums and it gave me a deeply rooted kind of compass of being artist-driven and artist-centered.""

In discussing her challenges at the Stedelijk, Goldstein referred to her MOCA experience. ""One of the things I learned at MOCA was that we had built a great museum but maybe not a great institution.""

She added: ""All I want for that museum is to thrive, be supported, be loved and cherished and nurtured and to be able to always fulfill its best potential. It's an institution that really needs to be there. And it needs to be great.""

For the record: An earlier version of the story did not include MOCA board president Fred Sands as one of the leaders of the search for a new director. A MOCA representative said Thursday that the museum had not yet announced that Sands has joined the search.

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/os-kissimmee-tourism-192-omni-conventions-20130505-story.html","Scaled-down convention-center projects do little for tourism corridor","It was an outrageous claim: Osceola County was going to get a convention-center complex so big you could see it from the moon.

Fifteen years and many fizzled efforts later, the best the county could muster is 46,000 square feet of meeting and event space in the recently opened Osceola County Conference Center.

Meanwhile, 17 miles away, Orange County's government-run convention center, which opened in 1983, has grown to more than 2.1 million square feet of exhibit space and is now the second-largest such facility in the country.

As Osceola works to rejuvenate U.S. Highway 192, the tourist strip dotted with inexpensive motels and second-tier attractions, the question of convention space — and the need for it — continues to divide business owners.

The meeting space in the Osceola County Conference Center, a partnership with the Omni Orlando Resort at ChampionsGate, is essentially an addition to the 720-room luxury hotel, which already has its own convention space.

The project was part of a $120 million incentive approved by Osceola government back in 2008 to promote the construction of more convention space within the county. Another large convention hotel, the Gaylord Palms Resort, was also supposed to add convention space with the incentive money, but more than four years later it is not clear if the Gaylord even intends to follow through with its part of the deal.

Some U.S. 192 hoteliers argue that the county tourist-tax revenue set aside for those ancillary conference centers should be spent instead to generate new business within the main tourism corridor, which extends for 15 miles from Kissimmee to Walt Disney World.

""There's no way somebody coming for a convention at the Gaylord is going to come all the way and stay at our independent hotels,"" said Tammy Miller, who bought her hotel on the eastern end of the tourist strip in 2007 after a convention center was proposed for a site nearby. ""We're not benefiting at all.""

Back in 1997, when the $1 billion World Expo Center — with 80 acres under one roof — was proposed for the heart of the tourism corridor, Osceola businesses had already been burned multiple times by various plans to build centers capable of drawing trade shows, industry conventions and other large events to 192.

Despite millions in available county incentives, World Expo Center never materialized, either. And in the years since then, a succession of other proposals have fizzled as well.

The $120 million center-incentive agreement that the Osceola County Commission signed with Gaylord and Rida Associates, ChampionsGate's general partner, in November 2008 promised tourist-development-tax dollars if the two hotels expanded their convention space and added more hotels rooms.

The agreement kept Osceola out of the convention-center business — something that routinely costs Orange County millions of dollars a year in tax-supported operating subsidies — and made use of two successful resorts that were already well-established in the meetings business.

But in the wake of the financial crisis, which froze or hindered credit for all kinds of development, both hotels defaulted on their agreement with the county by failing to demonstrate by a 2011 deadline that they had the private money needed to carry out the projects. The county could have terminated the agreement but instead granted both companies an extension until February 2014.

Since then, the Omni has delivered on the first phase of its part of the agreement: the conference center. Still to come is a 121-room Hampton Inn & Suites, plus eight outdoor athletic fields that would bolster Osceola's growing sports-tourism industry, which caters to youth athletic camps and amateur championships.

According to Marc Reicher, senior vice president of Rida Associates, the Omni conference center had already generated more than 50,000 additional room-nights booked at his hotel by the time it opened, producing additional tourist-tax dollars for county projects, including tourism promotion. And guests at his hotel sometimes make their way up to the western end of U.S. 192, to dine at restaurants like Carrabba's and Bonefish Grill, which are about 10 minutes away, he said.

""These people are going to come out and spend money in the community,"" he said.

The ballfields, he added, are more likely to benefit hotels along U.S. 192 once they're built. He estimated the Omni and Hampton Inn will capture only about 20 percent of the athletes who come to play on the new fields; the other 80 percent will stay elsewhere, including along U.S. 192.

""The fact that some more ballfields are being built is something that people are happy about,"" echoed Mark Brisson, spokesman for Fun Spot USA, an amusement park in the heart of the U.S. 192 corridor. ""If you're trying to get to ChampionsGate, you don't stay in Lakeland. You stay on 192. … It's economical, it's family friendly and it is actually closer.""

As for Gaylord's portion of the deal — $80 million of the county's $120 million commitment — nothing has happened yet. The sprawling convention hotel, about a mile north of U.S. 192 near Interstate 4 and Osceola Parkway, is supposed to build an additional 594 hotel rooms and nearly double its convention space to 750,000 square feet.

Complicating matters is the hotel's recent change in management: Last October the owner, Nashville, Tenn.-based Gaylord Entertainment Co., sold its Gaylord hotel brand and management company to Marriott International for $210 million.

Jeff Abbatichio, a hotel spokesman, said the county-backed expansion project is ""still on the table,"" though Marriott has not made a decision about whether to proceed.

""Right now, Marriott is still exploring their options,"" Abbatichio said. According to the original agreement with the county, the Gaylord Palms has the option to back out of the deal next year or request to extend the county deadline for up to three years, with the hotel paying the county $500,000 for each additional year.

""But the county will look at other options for investment of the funds if the project does not move forward,"" said Mark Pino, Osceola's public relations officer.","2013-05-05 18:23:00","0","35.0","2.0","3.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","40.0","21.0","0.0","80.0","4.0","15.0","0","1010","96.79","57.09","48.61","75.39","28.86","26.34","79.31","42.08","5.64","1.78","0.00","0.20","0.40","0.69","0.50","3.86","9.41","15.35","5.25","3.47","4.16","0.79","10.00","4.75","2.38","0.99","6.14","2.87","3.37","2.97","0.30","0.00","0.20","0.10","4.85","0.10","0.40","0.10","0.59","7.72","0.59","1.29","1.09","2.08","0.89","2.87","2.08","0.89","0.79","0.20","1.09","0.79","0.10","0.00","0.20","5.74","1.09","1.88","2.48","1.09","0.30","3.66","5.84","0.99","19.11","2.18","12.28","5.54","5.74","3.07","0.59","2.87","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","17.43","5.15","6.24","0.30","0.10","0.00","0.00","1.78","1.58","1.49","0.00","0.79","4963","8.14","29.514285714285716","1519","997","42","55.88","13.4","11.4","13.23","15.0","210","7.583333333333334","19.90527582748245","461","26.46","15","0.4","0","27","54","107","0","125","59","6","2","8","184","110","1","65","1","0","20","12","46","2","0","2","33","0","35","36","18","26","13","28","9","2","0","1"
"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/celebrity/la-et-mn-wolf-of-wall-street-jack-ryan-release-date-20131021-story.html","'Wolf of Wall Street' not moving to '14 (but 'Jack Ryan' likely will)","EXCLUSIVE: After weeks of speculation that Martin Scorsese's ""Wolf of Wall Street"" wouldn't hit theaters until 2014, the financial drama will arrive on Christmas Day and thrust a late entrant into the Oscar race, say three people close to the film.

But in the process, the Paramount release will likely bump the Tom Clancy reboot ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,"" which Paramount has scheduled to open the same day, to early 2014.

""Wolf of Wall Street,"" adapted from Jordan Belfort's memoir about his meteoric rise and fall as a trader in the 1980s and '90s, was originally set to open Nov. 15, but Scorsese and longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker have not yet finished the movie, and making that date has long been considered impossible. A recent cut of the film came in at about three hours; Scorsese is in the process of trimming the film.

SNEAKS: Movie trailers, full coverage

The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, and the cast includes Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey.

As for ""Ryan,"" the Clancy-inspired film is likely to come out in the first quarter, possibly in late January. The movie, which saw new marketing materials released just several weeks ago and gained fresh interest in the wake of Clancy's recent death, will apparently now do battle in a less crowded but potentially less lucrative period.

Paramount could, of course, keep ""Ryan"" in December, though studios tend to maintain at least several weeks of distance between their big releases.

Paramount is expected to announce its new plans in the coming days.

The studio previously postponed the release of Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" from 2009 to 2010, but that film was not considered an Oscar contender. Scorsese was an award-season player two years ago with the fall release of his 3-D period picture ""Hugo.""

""Wolf of Wall Street"" was independently financed by Red Granite (""Friends With Kids,"" the upcoming ""Out of the Furnace""), with Paramount serving as the film's domestic distributor.

A spokeswoman for Red Granite did not immediately return a call and e-mail seeking comment. Paramount declined to comment on the release plans for either film.

The Maroon 5 singer and ""Voice"" coach saw two of his team members -- Judith Hill and Sarah Simmons -- eliminated from the program as the result of public voting, but it was the comment that really seemed to grab the attention of the viewing audience.

Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich tweeted, ""Hey @adamlevine, why don't you ask the Dixie Chicks how ""hating America"" turned out for them. Hint: not well.""

Others have suggested that Levine be fired from ""The Voice"" or leave the country, along with CNN host Piers Morgan (a Brit who has angered conservatives in recent months with his gun control positions).

Levine himself attempted to explain his comment on Twitter by tweeting the dictionary definitions for ""joke,"" ""humorless,"" ""lighthearted"" and ""misunderstand.""

But though there's a considerable amount of name-calling online, it's doubtful that Levine's comment will cost him any fans in the long-run. As even conservative commentator Laura Ingraham tweeted, ""Confession: I still have a signed Maroon 5 CD (from bandmate parents)""

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/celebrity/la-me-ln-martin-bashir-sarah-palin-20131205-story.html","Martin Bashir resigns from MSNBC after trashing Sarah Palin on air","Good riddance, Martin Bashir.

Almost three weeks after his despicable on-air trashing of Sarah Palin, MSNBC host Martin Bashir has lost his job. That’s a hefty price to pay, but a fair one.

I stand with Sarah Palin on this one.

What could Bashir have been thinking when he announced in graphic terms that the former Alaska governor should receive the same vile, scatological abuse that was heaped on a 19th century slave?

He must have thought he was indulging in clever hyperbole by suggesting a physical punishment for Palin's tone-deaf remark comparing America’s Chinese debt to slavery, and her foolish insistence that her claim was not “racist.”

But neither Palin nor viewers of MSNBC deserved to hear about the vulgar comeuppance Bashir imagined for her.

His resignation statement was appropriately contrite:

""After making an on-air apology, I asked for permission to take some additional time out around the Thanksgiving holiday. Upon further reflection, and after meeting with the President of MSNBC, I have tendered my resignation. It is my sincere hope that all of my colleagues, at this special network, will be allowed to focus on the issues that matter without the distraction of myself or my ill-judged comments.

""I deeply regret what was said, will endeavor to work hard at making constructive contributions in the future and will always have a deep appreciation for our viewers -- who are the smartest, most compassionate and discerning of all television audiences. I would also wish to express deepest gratitude to my immediate colleagues, and our contributors, all of whom have given so much of themselves to our broadcast.”

I suppose it's to her credit that having left politics to cash in on her fame as John McCain's 2008 running mate, Palin continues to inflame the imagination of liberals.

At least twice in the last year, clearly bogus stories about her from the satirical website the Daily Currant have circulated in social media, promulgated as truth by people who really should know better.

In one story, Palin claimed Jesus Christ celebrated Easter.

In another, she was about to join Al Jazeera as a commentator. A “New York media analyst” named “Elizabeth Lemon” (that should have been the satirical tip-off right there) was quoted as saying that Palin would help rebrand the Qatar-based network for an American audience. “Alaska is located very close to the Middle East, yet for some reason we don’t have many Arab tourists,” went the made-up Palin quotes. “We may not have camels, deserts and genies, but we’ve certainly got lots of oil and caribou -- which are kinda like the Christian version of camels.”

Who could take that seriously?

The stories caught fire because they play into the stereotype of Palin as an intellectual lightweight. She may not have Ivy League degrees and she is often inarticulate, but she remains a political hero to plenty of conservative Americans who share her Christianist sensibilities.

In the last election cycle, Democrats coined a powerful catchphrase to describe the antiquated attitudes that led some Republican candidates to utter absurdities about rape, contraception and abortion. “The War on Women” was a brilliant stroke and served to crystallize the differences between the parties on important social issues. And the policies Palin embraces would hurt women.

But the War on Palin has nothing to do with policy or justice. It's a reflection of how easily sexist insults go down in our charged political culture. Though Palin has describe Bashir's attack as typical of the way conservative women are treated, both sides are guilty, and liberal women are often on the receiving end. (Just ask Hillary Rodham Clinton or Elizabeth Warren.)

MSNBC’s Ed Schultz called Laura Ingraham a “right-wing slut.” Sexism Hall of Famer Rush Limbaugh called Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke a “prostitute” and “slut” after she testified in Congress about women who need birth control pills for medical conditions. (I can't even bring myself to repeat the disgusting things liberal TV host Bill Maher calls women.)

None of these men have ever paid a meaningful price. Schultz apologized and was suspended for a week without pay. After a sustained outcry, Limbaugh apologized, sort of, and soon renewed his contract. Maher is an unrepentant sexist.

It’s fantastic for Palin that people still get so worked up about her. Misguided men like Bashir allow her to take the high road, accept the apologies ... and laugh all the way to the bank.

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/home-garden/os-nabj-stand-your-ground-20130801-story.html","Lawmaker: Stand Your Ground law is about self control, not gun control","Florida's Stand Your Ground law came under attack from black legislators, journalists and civil rights activists today during the convention of the National Association of Black Journalists.

The law, enacted in 2005, played a role in the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

""What Stand Your Ground did was fundamentally change the self-defense laws in Florida,"" State Sen. Dwight Bullard, D-Miami, told black journalists meeting at the Gaylord Palms Resort in Kissimmee. ""Stand Your Ground defines what self-defense is.""

State Rep. Alan B. Williams, D-Tallahassee, said the characterization of the Stand Your Ground law as a gun-control issue is misplaced.

""It's not about gun control. It's about self-control,"" Williams told broadcaster Roland Martin. ""We hunt too. But we don't hunt young men minding their own business.""

Civil rights leader Al Sharpton said Florida's law, and ones like it in 20 other states, will be a focus of a Washington rally scheduled for Aug. 24 and celebrating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington.

""This state and those states with Stand Your Ground laws must be challenged,"" Sharpton said.

Martin said the scope, impact and implications of the Stand Your Ground laws were largely unknown until Trayvon's death. The ""silver-lining"" of his death is that a national discussion has opened up on whether the laws went too far in defending the rights of the shooter over the victim.

""The reason we know about this law is Trayvon Martin's death,"" he said. ""It has raised the awareness that this has gone beyond what the initial supporters intended.""

Yamiche Alcindor, a reporter with USA Today, said Trayvon's death became an education that went beyond race to a deeper understanding of the new standard for self-defense.

""What does it say that you have a law that says essentially you can follow someone with a gun and it's not illegal?"" Alcindor said. ""For me, it was about how people understand the laws of Florida.""

Martin said the laws have made it more difficult for law enforcement because the shooter can avoid arrest by evoking Stand Your Ground as justifiable self-defense.

""The law is clear that as soon as someone invokes Stand Your Ground, it totally changes how you proceed with the criminal investigation,"" he said. ""If the people of Florida hear that police officers, sheriffs and DAs say that this law makes their job more difficult, I believe it will sway public opinion more than any other argument.""

Williams said there already is movement in that direction. House Speaker Will Weatherford has indicated he might favor revisiting the law if there is a clear consensus among law enforcement that Stand Your Ground makes their job more difficult.

""We hope we can be the first state to repeal or reform Stand Your Ground legislation,"" Williams said.

The state's refusal to revisit or revise its Stand Your Ground law prompted the call for an economic and consumer boycott of Florida, which could affect its economy.

""You had five major black conventions that took place in Florida just in the summer,"" Martin said. ""One way to get people's attention in America is the almighty dollar.""

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/fl-panthers-gambling-121113-20131211-story.html","BB&T Center makes pitch for a casino","In Michael Yormark's vision for his corner of Broward County, a night on the town would include a big-name concert and a bite to eat or a nightcap with a little gambling. A hotel would be handy for tourists.

Not unlike what's available at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood.

But before Yormark's plan for Sunrise could happen, the state Legislature would have to change the rules.

""We need your help to compete on a level playing field in our market,"" Yormark told the Florida Senate Committee on Gaming in Tallahassee on Monday.

Yormark is the CEO of Sunrise Sports & Entertainment, which operates the BB&T Center, home to the Florida Panthers hockey team. At about 21,000 seats, it's Broward's largest concert venue, drawing events like next week's Jingle Ball with Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke.

But Yormark says the Seminoles, with their Hard Rock Live concert venue, shops and restaurants, has an unfair advantage in booking musical talent. ""The Tribe uses the concerts as a loss leader just to get people into the facility. Then they gamble and go to the restaurants and shopping,"" he said.

The BB&T Center is near the internationally popular Sawgrass Mills Mall. A hotel-casino in the area would create an entertrainment draw that could compete with Seminole Hard Rock, Yormark said.

Seminole spokesman Gary Bitner noted that Hard Rock Live holds 5,500 patrons.

""They can sell almost four times as many tickets to see a major act,"" Bitner said. ""That divides the market significantly and really to say we're a direct competitor is a stretch.""

Sunrise Sports announced in July 2012 it had a partnership with Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming in its pursuit of a casino. Boyd's Robert Boughner told legislators that the BB&T Center is ""a very compelling option"" in Florida.

The Senate committee spent the fall listening to all gambling interests as it considers whether to change Florida laws.

""Our No. 1 concern is getting a license for the BB&T Center,"" Yormark said. ""And based on where this situation is, the most likely scenario would be the awarding of additional licenses through the legislature.""

Currently, South Florida horse tracks, dog tracks and jai-alai frontons can offer slots, with 35 percent of revenue going to the state. The Seminoles are a sovereign nation and aren't required to pay any tax on state-approved games. But an agreement with the state allows them to exclusively offer blackjack and other table games, and pay the state about 12 percent of their revenues.

Sunrise Sports could support what companies such as the Las Vegas Sands and Genting are calling a destination casino bill — a term Yormark prefers not to use. He notes that Orlando legislators, seeking to protect their state domination of the convention market, have objected to South Florida plans for casino-hotels that could steal their business.

""We're not looking to be a threat to Disney,"" Yormark said. ""That's not the business we want to be in.""

Boyd's Boughner said a casino-hotel in Sunrise would not siphon off Orlando's convention business.

""We're talking hotel rooms in the hundreds, not the thousands,"" Boughner said. Most Orlando conventions require about 2,000 rooms, experts say.

The Senate committee wrapped up its series of five hearings statewide on Monday.

""We're getting much, much closer to the starting line, where we're starting to get some meat on the bones,"" said chairman Garrett Richter, R-Naples.

Last spring, Richter had asked for a comprehensive gambling study, and the state chose Spectrum Gaming to gather information that included data on horse tracks, dog tracks and jai-alai frontons, Native American casinos, social impacts of gambling and possible impacts destination casinos would have on state revenues. The 464-page report outlined 12 scenarios, ranging from leaving things as they are to full-blown casinos across the state.

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/fl-realtytrac-foreclosures-20131113-story.html","Foreclosure auctions jump in South Florida","The number of foreclosed homes scheduled for the auction block in October skyrocketed by 76 percent in Palm Beach County compared with a year ago, according to figured released by RealtyTrac on Wednesday.

Lenders are aggressively finalizing foreclosures now that prices have rebounded enough to make the transactions worthwhile. The county's auction listings grew to 1,055 homes compared with 610 in October 2012.

Banks ""are working through the backlog of foreclosures,"" said Daren Blomquist, a RealtyTrac vice president. ""Now we are seeing property actually going to auction — they are moving the ball forward. It's a great time to unload inventory.""

Home prices have been rising steadily since the first of year after nose-diving for six years. Many banks have waited for a rebound to unload properties.

""Bankers are like anyone else: They don't want to sell in a declining market,"" said South Florida bank analyst Ken Thomas, who said some foreclosed properties are actually selling for a profit now.

So far, their auctioning off foreclosed properties hasn't dampened the strong surge in home prices in Broward and Palm Beach counties, Thomas said. He hopes that trend continues, and that the banks don't flood the market with homes.

""I am hopeful that the banks are sensitive to the potential impact of their actions on neighborhood housing markets, especially in low- and moderate-income communities that have already been hit so hard with aggressive subprime lending and the resultant foreclosures,"" Thomas added.

The recent uptick in auctions has contributed to Florida once again leading the nation in foreclosures in October, RealtyTrac's Blomquist said. The state and South Florida have about three times the foreclosure activity of the national average, according to RealtyTrac.

RealtyTrac's monthly report tracks the foreclosure stages, including new cases filed, bank repossessions and scheduled auctions. The surge in auctions actually hides the good news: New foreclosures are sharply down in South Florida from a year ago, Blomquist said.

New foreclosure filings on homes by lenders dropped 46 percent in Palm Beach County in October, to 496 from 925 at the same time last year.

The improving economy is making it easier for people to pay their bills, Broward Bank of Commerce president and CEO Keith Costello said. Regulators from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation recently met with South Florida community bankers to share with them the region's improving numbers — from fewer foreclosures to more construction projects to a lower unemployment rate, Costello said.

""The Fort Lauderdale area is especially doing well,"" Costello said, better than West Palm Beach and Miami.

Programs such as the National Mortgage Settlement funded by the nation's five largest mortgage lenders also have helped lower South Florida foreclosure filings by reducing principal and interest rates to struggling homeowners.

More than 9,000 Floridians have had their loan amounts or interest rates reduced, according to a recent release from Bank of America spokeswoman Jumana Bauwens. She didn't have a breakdown of numbers by county.

""Through Sept. 30, $1.1 billion in reduced principal balances has been provided on qualified Bank of America mortgages for 6,872 Floridians who were underwater and delinquent, representing an average reduction of nearly $159,000 in outstanding principal,"" she said.

""Another 2,529 homeowners have realized an average 2 percent drop in interest rates on eligible loans that were underwater but paid current, representing an average decrease of $218 in the monthly mortgage payments.""

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/broward-politics-blog/sfl-autonation-ceo-washington-stupid-incompetent-20131001-story.html","AutoNation CEO calls Washington dysfunction 'incompetent, irresponsible'","Mike Jackson, chairman and chief executive of AutoNation, was sharply critical Tuesday of what’s going on in Washington, calling it dysfunctional and saying he’s never seen it as bad as it is today.

“It’s really stupid, incompetent, irresponsible,” said in a brief interview at the Fort Lauderdale headquarters of AutoNation, the nation’s largest automobile retailer.

He said Democrats and Republicans share responsibility for the failure to pass spending legislation that led to Tuesday’s partial shutdown of the federal government. He said Republicans in the House of Representatives bear a larger share of the blame because what they’re asking for in return for agreeing to temporarily fund the federal government, scaling back or delaying Obamacare, isn’t realistic.

“The quid pro quo [sought by House Republicans] is an impossible ask,” Jackson said.

Jackson leads the largest company in Broward and Palm Beach counties, and the economy plays a major role in its fortunes. He’s a Republican who has also helped some Democrats raise money, though he’s pulled back from some of his political giving since his 2011 appointment to the board of directors of the Miami branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. He’s currently chairman of that board.

He commented about what’s going on in Washington after a news conference devoted to discouraging texting while driving.

“To the extent it continues to demonstrate that Washington is dysfunctional and does not have the ability to resolve issues and challenges that face America, it’s depressing. I’ve never seen it as it is today,” he said.

Jackson said “it absolutely applies to both sides, but you have to say the House Republicans are breaking new ground where they want to say we need a major policy change in exchange for a six-week continuing resolution. I mean forget what the issue is. The quid pro quo is an impossible ask, in effect. I don’t know how it gets resolved, but I can’t support it.”

Jackson said the next big D.C. fight, over raising the ceiling on the national debt so the government can continue to pay its bills, is serious.

“I think the debt limit is a serious issue. Yes it’s appropriate to talk about what our deficits are and what our spending policies are in the contest of the debt ceiling. So I don’t agree with the president to say it’s non negotiable. That’s been a negotiation that’s gone on for 100 years. But if you want to mix in policy issues with the debt ceiling I don’t know how you ever get that resolved. So I’m concerned,” he said.

He said a failure to raise the debt ceiling could cause a series of bad outcomes both for his company and the entire country.

“It’ll be bad for the economy. Forget car sales. It’ll be bad for the American people; it’ll be bad for the economy. And hopefully there is an epiphany in Washington in the next couple of weeks and we pull back from the brink. I think we will, but we have to wait and see,” he said.

"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/broward-politics-blog/sfl-ceasar-supporters-dinner-20130906-story.html","Ceasar supporters plan to fete Democratic leader","Supporters of Broward Democratic Chairman Mitch Ceasar plan a dinner in his honor on Sunday.

It’s a cocktails and dinner party at the New York Yankee Steak House at the Seminole Casino in Coconut Creek. The event is only open to the leaders of the county Democratic Party plus presidents of Democratic clubs and their spouses or guests.

Ceasar is serving his fifth term as Broward Democratic chairman, and there’s always an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with his leadership.

But Chester Just, president of the Council of Club Presidents, said Ceasar deserves recognition.

“This is an appropriate vehicle and opportunity to give Mitch recognition that I think he deserves,” Just said. “He would be the herder or shepherder of cats. Have you ever tried to herd a bunch of cats? He’s been successful.”

Just, who is president of the Coral Springs-Parkland Democratic Club, declined to say how much the event would cost or who’s paying for it.

“The council is the one that’s sponsoring it,” he said. “For heaven’s sake, I don’t have the entire cost before me. What’s a dinner run?”

The Council of Club Presidents hasn’t always been friendly territory for Ceasar. One of its recent presidents, Bernie Parness, president Deerfield Beach Democratic Club, was an outspoken critic of Ceasar’s stewardship of the local party.

Just said past differences people have had with Ceasar aren’t relevant unless “someone wants to deliberately foment a dispute.

“I’m at odds with Mitch Ceasar on a number of issues, and I’m the same way with Bernie Parness, but we’re all Democrats and we’re all intent on changing the political climate in this state. And you don’t do it by carrying grudges.

“Mitch Ceasar won an open and honest election. Hey, whether you like the result or not, it was an open and honest election and he won it fair and square.”","2013-09-06 12:45:00","0","17.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","28.0","15.0","0.0","77.0","4.0","13.0","0","309","78.64","74.14","8.13","90.17","15.45","22.01","80.26","48.54","11.00","6.15","1.62","0.65","0.97","2.59","0.32","4.85","9.06","12.94","9.06","2.59","7.12","1.62","15.21","4.53","1.62","1.62","0.97","1.62","5.50","4.53","0.65","0.00","0.32","0.00","11.97","0.32","0.65","0.00","2.59","9.39","0.97","1.29","0.97","1.62","1.94","3.88","1.94","0.32","1.62","0.00","1.62","0.32","0.00","0.00","1.29","10.36","3.88","2.91","4.21","1.62","0.00","4.21","10.36","0.65","9.71","0.97","5.18","3.56","5.50","3.56","0.32","1.29","0.32","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.71","5.83","4.85","0.00","0.00","0.65","0.00","0.32","3.88","5.18","0.00","0.00","1458","7.68","18.055555555555557","431","308","20","72.76","10.4","6.9","11.48","9.9","64","7.25","16.47168831168831","177","16.72","4","0.5","0","18","1","32","0","37","23","0","2","2","43","52","1","17","0","0","21","5","8","0","0","0","5","0","8","12","5","3","14","10","1","3","0","1"
"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/broward-politics-blog/sfl-congress-pay-shutdown-20131003-story.html","S. Fla. Democrats, Republicans unified; all but one taking pay during shutdown","There’s near unanimity among federal lawmakers from South Florida about one issue related to the partial shutdown of the federal government: they’re still getting paid, and accepting the money, as federal workers are furloughed because they haven’t passed spending authority.

The one exception: U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, the freshman Democratic who represents northern Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties.

He’s narrowly won election last fall, and he’s considered one of the most vulnerable members of Congress in next year’s election, so he can’t afford to do anything that might displease constituents.

He said he would donate pay received during the shutdown to Renewal Coalition, an organization that serves wounded service members, veterans, and their families.

""The residents of the Treasure Coast and Palm Beaches, like the rest of Americans, expect Congress to do its job of funding the government responsibly. If our leaders cannot work together to come to a reasonable solution to keep our government operating it will threaten our economic growth and suspend key services to our seniors and our nation's heroes. In that situation, Members of Congress should not receive pay while our brave service members and their families suffer. I will be standing with them if a shutdown occurs and will donate my pay to help Renewal Coalition continue to serve those who have served our nation.""

All the other members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, from Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties are continuing to collect their pay, according to a list compiled by the Washington Post. All the nonpartisan ratings consider them safe bets for re-election.

U.S. Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., are also taking the money.

Here’s how Nelson responded to a question about whether he’d get paid during the partial shutdown, according to a statement issued by his office:

“I’m not shutting down. I'm going to keep fighting to get reasonable folks on both sides of the aisle to come together and to find a common-sense solution to this budget gridlock. And I will fight to restore the pay of the people who are furloughed.”","2013-10-03 15:00:00","0","15.0","3.0","3.0","0.0","18.0","0.0","34.0","18.0","0.0","69.0","4.0","13.0","0","352","84.08","81.84","11.91","30.57","20.71","30.11","78.69","44.60","10.51","7.10","1.42","1.99","0.00","1.99","1.70","3.41","7.39","13.64","6.82","2.27","6.53","1.42","13.07","1.42","0.85","1.42","0.85","1.14","3.12","1.70","1.42","0.57","0.85","0.28","12.78","0.85","0.00","0.00","1.99","9.38","3.41","1.70","1.42","1.99","0.57","2.84","0.57","0.00","0.28","0.00","1.42","0.85","0.57","0.00","0.00","13.07","5.40","1.99","5.11","1.70","0.57","1.42","8.81","1.99","9.66","2.27","4.55","2.84","7.67","1.42","0.85","5.11","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.32","6.53","5.97","0.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.42","1.14","3.41","0.00","0.00","1738","9.11","24.4","531","347","17","59.23","12.7","10.1","13.17","13.5","98","8.5","21.45682997118156","216","22.07","10","0.46","0","14","3","30","0","33","22","0","0","8","48","45","3","23","1","0","15","13","10","0","1","1","20","0","23","4","12","10","14","6","2","3","0","1"

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-senators-rebuke-franchot-who-strikes-right-back-20130222-story.html","Senators rebuke Franchot, who strikes right back","Two senators who sit on the committee that oversees the state

budget have issued a harsh rebuke to Comptroller Peter Franchot, accusing Maryland’s chief tax collector of misusing taxpayers’ money to travel around the state giving out “questionably invented awards” – a charge Franchot rejected.

Sen. Nancy King, a Montgomery County Democrat, and Sen. David

Brinkley, a Frederick County Republican, sent Franchot a letter this week

charging that the four categories of awards created by the Comptroller’s Office since 2010 “are completely unrelated” to the duties of his office.

“We see no reason why any of your state duties or responsibilities

justified the taxpayer-financed expense of paying for a driver, security, gas, car mileage or the manufacture and purchase of questionably invented awards,” the senators said. Both are members of the Budget & Taxation Committee.

Franchot struck back Friday with equal vigor, insisting that presenting the awards was a legitimate function of his elective office. The comptroller, who offended some of the state’s most powerful elected officials

with his appearances in ads opposing a casino expansion referendum question that passed last year, suggested the letter was retaliation for his role.

“It is glaringly obvious that this letter is motivated not by honest fiscal stewardship, but by lingering resentment over some of the positions that I have taken, and some of the statements that I have made, as an

independently-elected Comptroller,” Franchot wrote. He said the issue was not raised by the legislature’s professional staff and noted that his agency requested a lower budget this year than last -- in part because of travel savings.

The exchange is one in a series of clashes between the comptroller, a Democrat who has frequently strayed from party orthodoxy, and

his former colleagues in the General Assembly. Among other things, Franchot faces the threat of a bill that would strip many of the duties of his office and hand them to another agency.

The honors the senators questioned are known as the Schaefer

Helping People Award, the Silver Hammer Award, the Doing Better With Less Award and the Golden Apple Award. The Comptroller’s Office

regularly issues news releases announcing the Franchot will travel to various locations to present such awards.

The Schaefer Award is named after the late William Donald

Schaefer, the onetime Baltimore mayor and Maryland governor whom Franchot unseated as comptroller in 2006. According to the Comptroller’s Office, it is given to people and organizations that help improve their communities, solve citizens’ problems and help vulnerable individuals.

The Better With Less award recognizes businesses and nonprofits

that succeed in a bad economy through “efficiency and innovation.” The Golden Apple Award is for school volunteers, and the Silver Hammer Award is for “superior school maintenance.”

The senators wrote that they were “troubled” by what they called

the “misleading impression” given to recipients that the awards are broadly endorsed by the state when they are “something solely manufactured and endorsed by you.”

“No other members of the Board of Public Works or prior comptrollers have engaged in this kind of behavior connected to their roles as

members of the board or serving as comptroller,” they said. The senators added the complaint that Franchot was spending too much time away from his office.

Franchot said the complaint he was misleading people “unworthy of

a response” and defended his travel around the state, saying he has “the right and the responsibility to visit communities across our state.”

“The insinuation that I can only ‘carry out the actual job and

responsibilities’ of this statewide office by sequestering myself in Annapolis – which, experience has shown, means soliciting the perspective of other elected officials in hallways and back rooms, or joining lawmakers for the usual round of evening receptions that are commonplace on State Circle – personifies the sense of disconnected arrogance that has alienated far too many people from government,” Franchot replied.

King and Brinkley demanded that Franchot turn over his travel schedule and information on the costs of making, publicizing and presenting the awards.

Franchot said he would provide that information and added an estimate that the production of the awards was just over $5,000 – “or for easy reference, a fraction of what it costs the taxpayers of Maryland to house a lawmaker in Annapolis for the 90-day session.”","2013-02-22 16:29:00","0","38.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","35.0","15.0","0.0","73.0","4.0","14.0","0","711","94.89","78.46","7.22","73.09","28.44","28.69","79.61","45.43","9.85","4.08","0.56","0.28","0.28","1.97","0.98","5.77","11.11","13.36","4.64","1.97","5.06","0.56","9.70","3.23","2.25","1.27","1.13","2.53","6.47","4.50","1.97","0.28","0.42","0.28","10.27","0.00","0.14","0.00","2.25","7.59","2.53","2.11","0.42","2.11","0.28","1.83","1.97","0.56","0.84","0.42","0.28","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.27","1.69","3.80","4.08","3.09","0.98","4.08","5.06","0.14","9.70","1.69","5.20","3.09","8.72","0.98","0.28","2.67","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.63","3.52","4.78","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.70","4.08","1.27","0.00","0.28","3702","9.55","37.78947368421053","1142","712","24","41.33","16.1","14.9","14.81","19.0","200","12.0","25.115955056179775","359","31.79","3","0.45","0","29","8","91","0","96","33","1","1","4","113","80","0","57","0","0","18","14","19","0","1","2","12","0","10","35","23","23","15","17","8","6","0","2"
"http://www.baltimoresun.com/bs-bz-preakness-security-20130425-story.html","Officials considering changes to Preakness security","Pimlico officials still are consulting with federal and local law enforcement agencies on revised security measures for the Preakness.

Maryland Jockey Club President Tom Chuckas said he initiated a series of meetings with those groups April 16, the day after two bombs exploded at the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring more than 260. He said he has two meetings scheduled for this weekend — he would not reveal the other parties — and could announce any changes to Preakness policies as early as next week. This year's Preakness is May 18.

Officials at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., where the Kentucky Derby will be run May 4, announced a new ban on backpacks like the ones used to hold the pressure-cooker bombs in Boston.

""We're still reviewing all of our policies and procedures,"" Chuckas said Thursday. ""As opposed to revealing our changes piecemeal, we'll have an all-encompassing announcement of anything new we decide to do.""

Chuckas said he and officials from many other agencies are reviewing every facet of the event, which last year drew more than 120,000 fans and includes infield concerts in addition to racing.

The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have acknowledged working on many large-scale events such as the Super Bowl, and Chuckas said the procedures for protecting Preakness crowds are similar to those used at NFL games. He said the Jockey Club hires the same private firm that works the Super Bowl, and it provides many of the workers who currently search all Preakness-goers' backpacks and coolers at Pimlico's entrances.

Most of the contraband confiscated in those searches, Chuckas said, is alcohol.

Officials at Belmont Park, which hosts the third leg of the Triple Crown, also are still evaluating whether to tweak security for the June 8 event.

""As the Belmont Stakes approaches, analysis of threat assessments at the time will dictate what enhancements, if any, are necessary,"" said Sidney Anthony, the New York Racing Association's vice president of security, in a statement.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/bal-quick-retreat-from-baltimore-for-preakness-champ-oxbow-and-defeated-favorite-orb-20130519-story.html","Quick retreat from Baltimore for Preakness champ Oxbow and defeated favorite Orb","Most of the horses in the stakes barns at Pimlico Race Course had cleared out by 8:30 Sunday morning, having loaded into vans under the cover of early-morning rain.

Plates with pieces of cake left over from last night's victory party for Oxbow dotted the ground near trainer D. Wayne Lukas' temporary office, as did a few emptied beer bottles.

As he said he would, Lukas began loading his horses into a van bound for Louisville less than 12 hours after winning his 14th Triple Crown race, a new record.

Lukas continues to point Oxbow to the June 8 Belmont, and Shug McGaughey would like to run Kentucky Derby winner Orb there, too, for a rubber match.

They could re-encounter second-place Derby finisher Golden Soul and third-place Revolutionary there.

Oxbow won a meandering Preakness that, as far as big horse races go, was as dull as the gray weather that had settled over the track. His final time of 1:57.54 was the slowest since Carry Back won in 1:57 3/5 in 1961. Secretariat holds the track record of 1:53 2/5.

Frank Stronach, owner of Maryland Jockey club and therefore Pimlico, always enjoys the Preakness festivities. His interest in Maryland's tracks, which he purchased in 2002 two years after his Red Bullet won Preakness, came about in part because it offered a way to buy into the Triple Crown. Pimlico hosted 117,203 people yesterday -- the fourth largest crowd of all time -- and had a handle of $81,940,233, sixth largest.

But Stronach had extra reason to smile as he stood upon the stage of Pimlico's famed cupola winner's circle. He owns Awesome Again, sire of Oxbow.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-maryland-toyota-settlement-20130215-story.html","Maryland and 29 states reach $29 million consumer protection settlement with Toyota","Attorneys General in Maryland and 29 other states have reached a $29 million settlement with Toyota Motor Corp. designed to strengthen protections for consumers impacted by safety defects and prevent miscommunication over faulty equipment.

Toyota had failed to warn consumers in a timely manner about known problems with unintended acceleration caused by sticky accelerator pedals and floor mat pedal entrapment, according to a complaint filed Thursday by the Maryland AG's Consumer Protection Division. Toyota had issued recalls related to the defects in nearly six million vehicles from 2007 to 2010, according to the complaint.

In a consent order agreed to by the automaker and the states, Toyota agreed to improve the safety culture within its U.S. operations and pay the $29 million, including more than $677,000 to Maryland. The payment could be placed in the state's consumer protection law enforcement fund or used for consumer education or civil penalties.

The order, filed with the complaint Thursday in Baltimore Circuit Court, also prohibits Toyota from advertising the safety of its vehicles without engineering data to back up the claims and from reselling possibly defective vehicles without fixing them.

The settlement ""reflects the commitment of Toyota's 37,000 North American team members to put customers first in everything we do,"" including making vehicle information more accessible to promote driver safety, Toyota said in a statement.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-maryland-unemployment-june-20130718-story.html","Maryland gained jobs in June, but unemployment rises to 7%","For the second straight month, Maryland added jobs but saw its unemployment rate go up.

The state's jobless rate rose to 7 percent in June from 6.7 percent in May, the U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday. Unemployment also increased slightly from 6.9 percent in June 2012.

Maryland gained 4,300 jobs last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey showed. The federal estimates are preliminary and adjusted to account for seasonal changes in hiring and layoffs.

Maryland, with a labor force of 3.1 million people, was among 28 states with higher unemployment in June. The state's jobless rate has been increasing since April and is less than a percentage point below the national rate of 7.6 percent.

The unemployment rate and the number of jobs gained are measured separately by government surveys and often appear contradictory.

The unemployment figures ""suggest that Maryland's performance vis a vis the balance of the nation is beginning to deteriorate, and the leading likely cause of that deterioration is sequestration,"" the across-the-board federal spending cuts, said Anirban Basu, head of Sage Policy Group, a Baltimore economic and policy consulting firm.

""What seems to have occurred in May and June is that the sequestration impacts are broadening and now large enough to be reflected in the economy-wide unemployment data for Maryland,"" he said.

While unemployment has risen, Maryland added jobs in June, compared with the previous month and compared with a year earlier. Maryland had gained jobs in May as well — 6,500, according to revised estimates — after losing 4,900 jobs in April.

The state has added 42,800 jobs since June 2012, Labor Department figures show.

Adding more than 40,000 jobs in a 12-month span ""represents pretty healthy job growth,"" Basu said.

Maryland's private sector added 6,200 jobs in June, the survey showed. The biggest gains came in the leisure and hospitality sector, with 3,200 more jobs. Education and health services added 1,600.

The professional and business services sector gained 400 jobs, and the financial activities sector added 200.

But the state lost 1,900 government jobs and saw construction jobs dip by 600.

Maryland has recovered more than 99 percent of the jobs lost in the recession, according to the state Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. Through June, all but one month this year has seen a gain in jobs from the previous month.

The increase in unemployment can be partly explained by the calendar, said Leonard Howie, Maryland's labor secretary, during a conference call Thursday.

""One thing that we know is that June typically brings higher unemployment because students leave school and enter the job market,"" Howie said.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-maryland-jobs-february-20130329-story.html","Maryland adds 10,500 jobs in February","Maryland employers punched the accelerator on job creation in February, adding 10,500 positions and bringing the state much closer to recovering its recessionary losses five years after they began.

The job growth estimates released Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor also pushed the state's unemployment rate to 6.6 percent from 6.7 percent in January.

February's growth, split between the private sector and government, was the third straight month of above-average gains. Maryland employers added 5,300 jobs in December and 7,500 jobs in January.

""The state's doing fairly well, in spite of the perceived head winds — in spite of the uncertainty in Washington, D.C.,"" said Daraius Irani, director of the Regional Economic Studies Institute at Towson University.

""I'd like to say that I believe this is going to be sustainable,"" said Richard Clinch, director of economic research at the University of Baltimore's Jacob France Institute. ""I'm just worried about sequestration.""

Those across-the-board federal budget cuts officially started March 1. But the real impact is still to come. Furloughs of some federal workers are scheduled to begin later this spring.

As things stand now, Maryland is about 9,000 jobs shy of pulling back to levels unseen since the beginning of 2008. Employers in Maryland cut nearly 150,000 jobs from that year through early 2010 in reaction to the nation's worst economic crunch since the Depression, according to federal statistics.

""It's been a long, slow slog to get back to where we were,"" Irani said.

But full recovery — a return to the low unemployment rates Marylanders are used to — could be years off, even with unhindered expansion. Students continued to graduate as the job base shrank, leaving more workers competing for fewer jobs.

All told, about 208,000 Marylanders without jobs were looking actively for work in February, twice as many as there were five years ago.

The problem persists nationwide.

""If the economy adds about 208,000 jobs per month, which was the average monthly rate for the best year of job creation in the 2000s, then it will take until April 2020 to close the jobs gap,"" the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project said earlier this month.

Maryland's gap — the hole that needs to be closed to return to the prerecession percentage of employed residents — is nearly 160,000 jobs, the Hamilton Project estimated.

Maryland's growth in February spread across almost all major sectors, from construction to professional and business services, according to the Labor Department's seasonally adjusted figures. But government agencies accounted for a large chunk — about 40 percent.

The 4,500-job gain in that sector — which came almost entirely at the local-government level — struck Clinch as a potential statistical hiccup, given that government shed jobs in three of the previous four months. The figures are estimates drawn from surveys and can be revised later.

""There's nothing that we have heard that would trigger such growth,"" said Andrea Mansfield, legislative director at the Maryland Association of Counties. ""Things haven't turned around that much.""

Still, the private sector gained 6,000 jobs in February, according to the Labor Department estimates.

Columbia-based BoxTone, which helps businesses manage the burgeoning mass of smartphones and tablets used for day-to-day work, is among the companies expanding.

The company, which employs 150, is adding jobs at its local headquarters and opened a second office — in California's Silicon Valley — last month. So far this year, BoxTone has hired about 20 new workers and expects to add 40 more by June.

""We have signed new partnerships, new contracts and identified new channels where we're having dramatic revenue growth,"" said Brian Reed, BoxTone's chief marketing officer and chief product officer. ""We need a team to … support that.""

It's a fast-growing market. Thirty percent of U.S. companies have some type of mobile-device management now, a figure that will probably rise to over 40 percent by the end of the year, said Phillip Redman, a mobile wireless analyst at technology research firm Gartner.

Whether the state as a whole can keep up with its recent growth pace is a topic of considerable anxiety, given sequestration cuts. Maryland has large numbers of federal contractors and workers.

""I'd like to have my pessimism proven wrong,"" Clinch said. ""However, I worry about what's going to happen.""

He's not alone. Three-quarters of Marylanders believe sequestration will be bad for the state's economy, according to a Goucher College poll conducted this month. Almost half think the cuts would affect their finances in a negative way.

Goucher surveyed 791 residents and put the margin of error at about 3.5 percentage points.

Frequent furloughs could ripple widely as federal employees cut back on spending. But the Department of Defense — which has just over 45,000 civilian workers in Maryland — said Thursday that its original furlough plan has been scaled back after the agency received more flexibility about how to cut.

Affected civilians will likely see 14 unpaid days off, rather than 22, the Pentagon said. The first are expected in June. Nondefense agencies have a variety of furlough plans, some beginning sooner.

Early indicators suggest good prospects for the state's March job growth. Thirty percent of Maryland businesses surveyed this month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said they added workers, compared with just 8 percent who cut back, an improvement over February.

But the Fed warned that employers are less optimistic about hiring in the next six months. Twenty-nine percent expect to add employees, while 23 percent anticipate cuts.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-maryland-jobs-november-20131220-story.html","Md. gains 8,900 jobs in November, Labor Dept. says","Maryland gained 8,900 jobs in November, the federal government estimated Friday — a decidedly up month in an up-and-down year held back by Washington budget cuts.

Better job growth after a difficult few months pushed the state's unemployment rate to 6.4 percent in November from October's 6.7 percent, the U.S. Department of Labor said.

Sequestration overshadowed 2013 in Maryland, which has an outsized share of federal workers and contractors, economists say.

The state downshifted from a monthly average of 3,000 new jobs in the 12 months before the spending cuts took effect in March to about 1,000 since, said Bradley Turner, an associate economist at Moody's Analytics. That includes November's big gain as well as a steep cut in September in the anxious run-up to the partial government shutdown in October.

But the budget deal approved by Congress this week should be a turning point for Maryland, Turner said. He and another economist who analyzes the state's economy expect a faster pace of job creation in 2014. And on Friday, the federal government boosted optimism about the nation's overall recovery when it said third-quarter economic growth was the fastest in almost two years.

""We're expecting employment to come back pretty quickly over the next several years,"" Turner said.

Gov. Martin O'Malley, speaking Friday at a Hanover cybersecurity firm, also characterized the new federal budget as a boon for Maryland's economy.

""We cannot underestimate the amount of good that does for business and investor confidence in this area,"" he said.

That's especially true for government contractors. The deal offers certainty about near-term spending, eases the threat of another shutdown in January and ""basically nullifies the impact of sequestration over the next two years,"" Turner said.

Cybersecurity — protecting data and networks from attacks and other threats — was a growth area even under sequestration. KEYW in Hanover, where O'Malley visited Friday, hired 170 people this year and said it has about 160 vacancies it still needs to fill.

""Now that we have a budget, we expect to hire even more people,"" said KEYW CEO Leonard E. Moodispaw.

Economists say the budget deal also helps businesses that do no work with the government. The long drag of continuing resolutions, brinkmanship and uncertain regulatory policies negatively affected the overall economy, they said.

""It's been not a good situation for businesses to be in,"" said Daraius Irani, executive director of the Regional Economic Studies Institute at Towson University. ""Everybody wants to know what kind of environment you're working in.""

Nationwide, at least, the economy was already picking up steam before the budget deal. The gross domestic product increased at a 4.1 percent annual rate in the July-through-September period, compared with 2.5 percent the previous quarter, the U.S. Department of Commerce said Friday.

""The underlying momentum in economic activity shifted up a gear in the third quarter,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York. ""The strength in domestic consumption and investment activity points to a more constructive narrative on growth than previously thought.""

In November, meanwhile, most of the country posted job gains — Maryland and 42 other states. The numbers, adjusted to try to account for normal ups and downs such as retailer hiring for holiday shopping, show expansion in more than half of Maryland's large sectors.

Professional services, a sector heavy with government contractors, added 3,100 jobs last month. That could include the return of furloughed contractors, whose jobs temporarily disappeared for purposes of the monthly tally if they weren't paid at some point during the second week of the shutdown. (The jobs of furloughed federal workers didn't drop out of the count because they received back pay, the Labor Department said.)

Construction and government each added 2,300 jobs, the Labor Department estimated. Retailers added 2,200 jobs, which with seasonally adjusted numbers means the agency saw more hiring than in recent years.

Though Maryland now has slightly more jobs than it did just before the recession, there's still a long way to go for full labor market recovery. About 200,000 Marylanders were unemployed and looking for work in November, double the number of six years earlier.

That puts a lot of people in competition for open positions. Consider the stampede for the approximately 130 jobs Maryland Live Casino in Hanover is trying to fill, ranging from dealers to food servers to operation managers.

""We've got over 20,000 applications in the queue,"" said Howard G. Weinstein, who oversees human resources for the casino as its general counsel.

But the state's job numbers are at least on the right side of the recession break-even point. The United States has nearly 1.3 million jobs still to go before it gets there.

Both Moody's Turner and Towson University's Irani expect Maryland employers to add about 40,000 jobs next year. If that comes to pass, it will almost certainly be an improvement on 2013: The state gained 28,000 jobs this year through November.

Baltimore economist Anirban Basu is forecasting less growth next year, about 25,000 jobs. He expects consolidation in education and health services, an important sector for Maryland.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-maryland-business-voice-20130224-story.html","Md. businesses hope for more influence in Annapolis","Maryland's business leaders are increasing efforts to speak with a louder, more unified voice to state officials, seeing in looming federal budget cuts the necessity — or opportunity — to focus more attention on the private sector.

The Maryland Chamber of Commerce is organizing business groups, trade organizations and employers across the state in a ""competitiveness coalition"" that aims to agree on a handful of priorities and talk about them with everyone — elected officials, candidates and the public.

Lobbying also was a theme of a business-climate summit last week in Annapolis. Almost 400 gathered to hear speakers at the event, organized by Change Maryland, a group started by a businessman who contemplated a run against Gov. Martin O'Malley in 2010.

""One thing I hear a lot is that businesses aren't included in the discussion,"" state Sen. Allan H. Kittleman, a Howard County Republican, told the crowd. ""And what a wise person once told me is, if you're not at the table, you're on the menu.""

Officials with the state Department of Business and Economic Development say they've been reaching out to companies more over the last several years and putting suggestions into practice. But the big changes some hope for, such as tax cuts and so-called ""right to work"" rules undercutting unions, would be a tall order. Those issues skew conservative, and the state has twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans.

Just as importantly, the business community doesn't have much clout in Annapolis. Its influence has waned over the decades as big corporate headquarters turned into branch offices, leaving fewer CEOs to push for policy priorities, said Richard Clinch, a University of Baltimore economist.

That drain isn't just a Maryland problem — nationwide consolidation has put more big companies in fewer cities — but it has left the state with the headquarters of only a handful of Fortune 500 companies, he noted.

""If I was going to tell businesses where to put their money, I'm not sure lobbying in Annapolis is where I'd put it,"" said Clinch, director of economic research at the university's Jacob France Institute. ""I'm not sure it's going to work.""

The looming threat of federal cuts in a state highly dependent on federal spending isn't enough to get businesses the laws they want or stop the ones they don't, he added.

""Until we're in the middle of that [pain from cuts], we're not going to do anything about it,"" Clinch predicted.

The state Chamber of Commerce isn't counting on an immediate shift. Its competitiveness coalition aims to influence candidates in the 2014 state elections, and further down the road. Three dozen groups and a handful of large employers have signed on so far to take part.

Organizers are meeting now and hope to settle on a few key objectives at a September, said Kathleen T. Snyder, the chamber's president. She said she's excited about the possibilities, and pointed out that some of the groups involved lean conservative while others lean liberal.

""It's very seldom that the business community unites behind a common goal,"" Snyder said. ""Maryland is at a crossroads with these federal budget cuts, and public policy can help us pick one road, so we have an obligation to help educate elected officials. … How can we work together to create more jobs?""

Snyder said businesses have proved they can effect change if they really try. Five years ago, businesses successfully banded together to get a just-passed ""tech tax"" on computer services overturned.

She characterized the chamber's efforts in cooperative terms, saying the state's economic development agency is open to discussions about increasing competitiveness. Change Maryland, by contrast, has positioned itself as an antagonist of O'Malley's administration, saying businesses and residents are fleeing the state because of his tax policies.

Speakers at the Change Maryland summit bemoaned the fact that the state ranks 41st on the Tax Foundation's business tax climate index.

Raquel Guillory, an O'Malley spokeswoman, defended the state's corporate income tax as ""middle of the road for the region,"" higher than the rates in Virginia, West Virginia and New York, but lower than those in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

But Baltimore economist Anirban Basu, who spoke at the summit, suggested that the state eliminate that tax entirely. ""You'd completely change the narrative about Maryland, and you'd create an excuse for people to pour private capital into the state,"" he said.

Steve Dubin, who headed Martek Biosciences Corp. in Columbia before selling the nutritional supplement maker for $1.1 billion in 2010, has heard a lot of suggestions — and gripes — about the state's business climate. That's because he's chairman of the Maryland Economic Development Commission, which has gone around the state in recent years seeking input.

He said commissioners didn't hear much about taxes, believe it or not. Regulation, particularly permitting, was top of the list. ""'Make it easy to do business in Maryland' — that's the thing we heard over and over again,"" he said.

Dubin said the state is putting suggestions into practice, including a January revamp of the new-business registration process that's billed as decreasing review time from weeks to several days.

Dominick E. Murray, the state's secretary of economic development, said small businesses' suggestions also prompted a rule review that led to more than 130 state regulations being ""either repealed, revised or streamlined"" in the last year.

His message to businesses trying to pump up the volume: ""We're listening.""

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-manufacturing-job-loss-20131117-story.html","Md. manufacturing job losses outstrip most of U.S.","The General Motors factory in Baltimore, the Solo Cup plant in Owings Mills and the steel mill at Sparrows Point all made things for decades. And all closed in the past 10 years.

It's a familiar tale for much of the country. But Maryland's manufacturing job losses — the result of cutbacks, shutdowns and technological innovations requiring fewer people — are among the nation's steepest.

The state saw a faster pace of job reductions in the sector than all but seven other states and the District of Columbia in the past six years, according to a Baltimore Sun analysis comparing the most recent Labor Department figures with the period just before the recession.

Maryland has lost 25,000 manufacturing jobs — nearly 20 percent of its base — since August 2007. It hasn't enjoyed even the partial rebound the United States as a whole saw after deep declines.

The problem isn't new. Maryland has shed manufacturing jobs since the 1970s. Since 1990, it has lost more of them than all but four states and the District of Columbia, part of a deindustrialization that hit the entire Mid-Atlantic region harder than much of the country.

Advocates say it's not too late for Maryland to rewrite this story line and rebuild its manufacturing base, perhaps by focusing on high-tech niches. They warn that people without a college education — and some with one — have been harmed by the long shrinkage.

""Manufacturing was steppingstones to middle-class America,"" said Mike Galiazzo, president of the Regional Manufacturing Institute of Maryland, a nonprofit advocacy group. ""When we lose manufacturing, that just means nobody's knocking on the door to Bethlehem Steel, they're knocking on the door to Walmart.""

As the state reliably added jobs over the decades in such fields as information technology, health care and government contracting, it was easy for state leaders to shrug off losses in manufacturing as inevitable, even acceptable. That appears to be changing: Last year the state convened a commission on manufacturing competitiveness, which is due to make recommendations next month.

Industry was once a linchpin of Maryland's economy. In 1912, The Baltimore Sun reported that Maryland had more manufacturing plants than all but 14 states. Manufacturing accounted for one-third of the jobs in Maryland just before World War II engulfed the country — and nearly half the state's jobs at the height of war production.

The losses in more recent decades are part technology-driven — machines enable one worker today to accomplish what it took several or many manufacturing workers to do years ago — and part geographic shift. Every state in the Mid-Atlantic, from New York to Virginia, saw cuts in the past quarter-century that outpaced the country as a whole.

American auto companies consolidated, favoring Midwestern and Southern locations, said Howard Wial, director of the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The region's steel mills — such as Sparrows Point — were buffeted by newer ""mini mill"" competitors in the South and Midwest and by foreign producers.

Other manufacturers moved south for lower wages and taxes, cheaper land and less regulation. And some sent production out of the country.

This happened to Mid-Atlantic states both blue and red, ones (like Virginia) that do well on business-climate rankings and even those (like Delaware) considered relatively low-tax.

Still, Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Indiana, says Maryland does itself no favors with its tax rates. In a 2013 state-by-state score card, he gave Maryland a ""D"" for both its manufacturing health and its tax climate.

""Firms vote with their feet,"" he said. ""Manufacturing is one where people can easily vote.""

While he acknowledged that the state's well-educated workforce is a plus, companies are more likely to employ labor-saving technology in higher cost, higher-educated areas. He thinks that explains part of the region's losses in recent years.

""All the productivity gains in manufacturing are designed to kill jobs,"" Hicks said.

But Wial doesn't see job loss as the final result of innovation. He thinks it would be well worth Marylanders' time to help manufacturing flourish.

""Don't assume that just because factories are more automated that that limits manufacturing job growth in the future,"" he said. ""What has usually happened in the past is that automation reduces the cost of the product and enables the market to expand.""

Wial is also a nonresident senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, which has called on the Baltimore region to increase manufacturing as part of a strategy to expand middle-class jobs. Brookings warned that low-wage fields account for a growing share of area employment.

Wial thinks Maryland can make inroads with manufacturing. The low-wage competition for manufacturing jobs that dominated the late 20th century, benefiting first the South and then countries such as China, doesn't strike him as the 21st-century fighting ground. China's wages are rising. And automation has made labor costs less significant for manufacturers.

In his view, the key to future manufacturing growth is innovation, a better battleground for both the U.S. and Maryland. He suggests that the state look to Europe's manufacturing powerhouse for ways to get in the game, rather than the lower-cost South or developing countries.

In Germany, he said, businesses, nonprofits and the government work together to strengthen the sector. There's a vibrant apprenticeship system and lenders that specialize in manufacturing.

The United States has a broken training system for technical skills and a financial system that ill serves manufacturers, especially smaller firms and startups, Wial said. An enterprising state could tackle both problems, he said, opening the door for more people to make things locally with emerging technologies such as 3-D printing, sensors and nanomaterials.

""They are going to create opportunities,"" he said.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-gavin-rossdale-bling-ring-premiere-20130605-story.html","Gavin Rossdale: What the Bling Ring did is 'pretty disgusting'","In “The Bling Ring,"" a group of starry-eyed teens define their worth by the number of designer duds in their closet.

The young protagonists of Sofia Coppola’s based-on-a-true-story film don’t actually own any of these coveted items, of course -- they steal them. Parading through the closets of stars such as Paris Hilton, Rachel Bilson and Lindsay Lohan, their eyes widen as they try out Alexander McQueen sunglasses, Chanel handbags and Christian Louboutin pumps.

“Oh, my God,” one character gasps as she comes across a chic top. “It’s Balmain.”



It’s a line uttered by actress Claire Julien, who, fittingly enough, was sporting a Balmain dress on the red carpet at the film’s Hollywood premiere Tuesday night.

“It’s pretty ironic,” 18-year-old Julien, the daughter of Oscar-winning cinematographer Wally Pfister, acknowledged. “We’re playing celebrity-obsessed kids, and here we are, kind of becoming celebrities ourselves.”

Julien’s co-star, Katie Chang, said she has already begun to notice the effects of her newfound fame.

PHOTOS: The original 'Bling Ring' -- Where are they now



Chang, 18, graduated from high school in Illinois last weekend -- but in the final weeks of 12th grade, she started to notice her friends treating her differently.

“They were acting weird and that’s why I’m really glad I graduated so soon,” said Chang, who will begin her freshman year at Columbia University in the fall. “If the movie had come out while I was still in school, I think it would have been a little crazy.”

Appearing in the film -- which hits theaters June 14 -- was also a new experience for musician Gavin Rossdale, the Bush frontman with little acting background. In the movie, Rossdale plays a seedy club promoter who helps the Bling Ringers sell off their stolen goods. (He also has a penchant for taking sexy selfies with Julien’s character.)

Rossdale said he was aware of the high-profile robberies, largely because he was a friend of Orlando Bloom, one of the Bling Ring’s targets.

“When Orlando’s home got robbed, I didn’t like that I knew someone who was getting burglarized,” said Rossdale, who attended the event with his wife, Gwen Stefani. “I felt bad for Paris. ... It’s a real heinous thing to have people in your house stealing stuff. It’s pretty disgusting.”

Though his disdain for the crime circle is clear, Rossdale says he’s spent time trying to understand what drove the real-life Southern California teens to such behavior.

“I wondered how much they felt that Paris wouldn’t mind because her life is so great and her stuff is so free and life came so easy to her,” he said, furrowing his brow. “That sense of entitlement growing up in L.A., projecting whether or not she would mind. Maybe there was something to that.”

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-maryland-jobs-august-20130920-story.html","Md.'s job base returns to pre-recession levels","Maryland's job base is finally back to the size it was half a decade ago — before the deep recession gouged a big chunk out of it.

It's a psychologically important milepost in the long slog toward recovery, one reached as the nation is still climbing out of the hole. But numbers released Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor show the state's job market remains far from normal.

About 219,000 Marylanders were out of work and looking for a job in August, 120,000 more than in February 2008, just before the effects of the Great Recession caught up with the state. That number does not account for people who have given up searching because they've had no success.

The state's unemployment rate declined slightly to 7 percent in August, more than twice the 3.3 percent it was in February 2008.

By one Washington think tank's estimate, the state would need more than 200,000 additional jobs materializing overnight to get back to pre-recession levels of employment. It's a nationwide gap that has upended the lives of millions of Americans.

""We're not done — we still have a lot more work to do,"" Gov. Martin O'Malley said in an interview. ""This is a milestone, not mission accomplished.""

Still, he celebrated the return of the state's job base to about 2.6 million positions, saying that only 15 other states have returned to their previous peaks.

West Virginia is the region's only other state on that list. Virginia has recovered 88 percent of its job losses, Pennsylvania has recovered 78 percent — the same as the nation as a whole — and Delaware gained back just half, according to Labor Department estimates.

Maryland actually crossed the 100 percent threshold in June. But that wasn't apparent until the Labor Department issued revised numbers along with its first estimates for July — when the state slipped back under again.

Government agencies and private-sector businesses equally contributed to the 9,700-job gain in August that erased the previous month's loss, according to the Labor Department estimates.

There have been lots of such fits and starts in the last several years. But overall, Maryland's economy is ""performing pretty well"" in less than ideal circumstances, said Gary Keith, M&T Bank's regional economist.

""It's dodged the sequestration bullet so far,"" he said, referring to federal budget cuts. ""We'll have to see how that plays out. We do have some risk and exposure.""

That's because a significant part of Maryland's economy is connected to federal spending — directly through federal employees, contractors and grant-funded researchers, and indirectly as those workers' purchases ripple through other sectors.

Economists say this federal effect helped buffer the state somewhat during the recession. But the bite still was substantial, eliminating 145,000 jobs over a two-year stretch.

Getting back to square one took even longer. And over the entire 51/2-year period since the recession hit, Maryland's population kept growing. New high school and college graduates joined the labor force, looking for work.

The Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project says Maryland would need 209,000 more jobs to get back to late 2007 levels of employment, when two-thirds of residents had work. Nationwide, the number is 8.3 million.

To put that in perspective, Maryland added 43,000 jobs over the last year and the nation added 2.2 million.

""The Great Recession is lingering on,"" said Michael Greenstone, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former director of the Hamilton Project. ""This matters because unemployment has really damaging effects on people's lives.""

Getting larger numbers of people back to work is the pressing issue facing states across the country, said Maryland Labor Secretary Leonard J. Howie III. So is recognizing that while some states have recovered the number of jobs lost during the recession, ""they are not the exact same jobs,"" he said.

To push job growth, Maryland's strategy includes encouraging entrepreneurship with programs such as InvestMaryland, which helps fund startup firms, and addressing gaps between the skills employers want and what job seekers have, Howie said.

For example, he pointed to the fledgling EARN Maryland program — Employment Advancement Right Now — because it is intended to get industries dealing with skills gaps to collectively decide how to fix them. Industry groups can apply for grants in October to do such planning work and later qualify for workforce-training funding .

Howie said he's certain the skills gap is part of the problem because Maryland has 86,000 job openings on its online workforce exchange, enough to fill a significant chunk of the demand for work. And he doesn't think that accounts for all the positions employers need to fill.

Just as some residents have stopped searching because they've had no luck, he said, some businesses have told him they stopped posting jobs ""because they've been recruiting for a while and have given up for the time being.""

An M&T Bank survey of businesses this summer found more optimism than pessimism in the bank's Mid-Atlantic region — largely Maryland, with a bit of Washington and Virginia. Thirty-four percent of companies surveyed expect to hire by the end of the year, compared with 7 percent expecting to cut.

The Lieber Institute for Brain Development is among those expanding. It's preparing to take over the rest of its floor in a building on the East Baltimore biotech park campus.

The institute, launched in 2010 to focus on clinical advances for developmental brain disorders such as schizophrenia, has 80 employees and plans to add about a dozen in the next few months.

It's not that the organization is bucking the trend of tightening purse strings for federal research grants, said Jean DuBose, a Lieber Institute spokeswoman. In addition to seeking such funding, it's forged partnerships with companies and receives philanthropic support from its founders.

""We are able to close the gap,"" she said.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/la-et-ms-giorgio-moroder-dj-20131031-story.html","Giorgio Moroder, the granddaddy of DJs, is back for another spin","In his penthouse condo on the toniest block of Westwood, one of the world's biggest dance music producers kicks back at his dining room table in an all-black Armani ensemble. A spread of magazine covers, featuring the producer's face, stares up at him as he talks about his many new projects — remixes for buzzed-about pop acts like Haim and a DJ gig closing out the HARD Day of the Dead festival at L.A. State Historic Park in Chinatown this weekend alongside Skrillex and Deadmau5.

His vocals were a centerpiece for a track on the year's biggest dance album, Daft Punk's ""Random Access Memories,"" and, like many of the biggest stars of the genre, he's pondering a major Las Vegas DJ residency spanning his whole career.

Giorgio Moroder, 73, is having one of the best years of his life.

PHOTOS: Unexpected musical collaborations

""I've been playing shows in New York, Sweden and Mexico, and there's nobody over 30 there, and they all know all the lyrics to the songs — you know, 'Call Me!' "" he said, quoting the hook from his 1980 hit for Blondie. ""Most of them weren't even born when these songs were released.""

The pioneering producer behind Donna Summer's hits and Oscar-winning soundtrack cuts for ""Midnight Express,"" ""Top Gun"" and ""Flashdance"" needs no introduction for pop and disco devotees. But as today's maturing EDM audiences hunt down older, analog styles — and classic disco regains its cultural cachet — Moroder's suave sound is more relevant than ever.

Now that he's finally picked up DJ'ing (with his performance and remix partner Chris Cox), he's reaping the rewards of a genre he helped forge 40 years ago — and again turns heads in every club he walks into.

The return to the spotlight started when word got out that he was collaborating with the French duo Daft Punk on the top-secret LP that would become ""Random Access Memories."" His track, ""Giorgio by Moroder,"" is one of the record's strangest: Moroder tells his musical life story in a spoken-word monologue, while a torrent of vintage synths buzz and build to an exhilarating climax.

PHOTOS: Concerts by The Times

His tale is an edited-down version of a three-hour session. While making it, Moroder had no idea his life would become a metaphor for the return of handmade, heartfelt electronic dance music.

""I didn't know what they would do with it. They just asked 'Can you come into the studio and talk about your life?' I thought they would just use pieces of it, like a sample of me saying 'G-G-Giorgio,'"" Moroder said. ""When I went into the studio, there were three different microphones set up, each from a different period, so they would sound like each time in my career. They were such perfectionists.""

And with that, the name ""Giorgio Moroder"" again became shorthand for the coolest sounds in dance music.

Although he was technically one of the world's first dance-club DJs (""In the '60s, I forget if it was Berlin or Munich, I made money going to discos and singing over tapes and records. They didn't really have discotheques in America then,"" he said) Moroder only played his first proper DJ set this May in New York. But it was such a hit, and timed so perfectly to a revival of his '70s and '80s aesthetics, that he became an instant festival headliner behind the decks.

""The man wrote 'Tony's Theme' in 'Scarface,' nothing more to say,"" said Gary Richards, the head of HARD Events who booked him to wrap up the Day of the Dead festival on Sunday, opposite Deadmau5. ""It's important for me to introduce the newer fans to this history. I feel it's part of my job to introduce the younger generation to the pioneers.""

But Moroder isn't on a nostalgia tour.

His production schedule is as busy as it has ever been, and he's working with artists at the bleeding edge of electronic pop today. Among his many irons in the fire: an edit of ""Forever,"" the hit single from L.A. electro-funk sister group Haim (""That guitar part, the chk-chk-chk, is so good I'm going to have to sample and trigger it""); a new Moroder single featuring the lissome vocals of the underground dance act Class Actress; swapping production work with his fellow Daft Punk collaborator Nile Rodgers on each of their new projects.

His most deeply felt new tracks are the two cuts from ""Love to Love You Donna,"" the new remix album of Summer singles in which he's featured alongside such Moroder-indebted acts as Chromeo, Holy Ghost and Afrojack. His edit (with Cox) of ""Love to Love You Baby"" puts Summer's incandescent moans atop a modern drum pulse and all-new bursts of synth color (Moroder found some of Summer's long-lost master recording tapes in his laundry room). ""La Dolce Vita"" uses some unreleased Summer vocal demos to conjure a '70s dance floor with a contemporary house-music dreaminess.

Moroder helped make Summer a global superstar at the vanguard of the disco movement. After her death in May, getting back into these vocal recordings was a bittersweet but loving act.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/la-et-st-goldbergs-trophy-lucky-20130924-story.html","Review: ABC may need to re-think its plans for Tuesday domination","ABC is going all in on Tuesday nights, with four new shows premiering, beginning with ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D"". Considering that show's cat's cradle of demographic attractions — Comic books! Joss Whedon! Clark Gregg!! — ABC decided it could go fairly wide in the subsequent hours, with disappointing results.

""The Goldbergs,"" a family comedy set in the 1980s, is based on creator Adam Golderg's childhood, which he obsessively documented with the family video camera. Like the required-viewing slide show, the home movie is, and I think we are all agreed on this, of limited interest to family members, much less the general public.

Limited. Interest. Even with a cast that includes ""Curb Your Enthusiasm's"" Jeff Garlin, Wendi McLendon-Covey (""Bridesmaids"") and George Segal.

FULL COVERAGE: Fall TV preview 2013

Garlin plays Murray (Dad) and mostly yells a lot; McLendon-Covey plays Beverly (Mom), who is forced by the timeline to wear crazy '80s hair, high-waisted jeans and shoulder pads. She also yells a lot.

Segal, as Pops, does not yell. Instead, he references his sex life while instructing his 11-year old grandson Adam (Sean Giambrone) on pick-up lines and groping techniques.

Much is made in the pilot of young Adam's budding interest in girls as well as middle-child Barry's (Troy Gentile) high-strung nature and love of Flavor Flav. Teenage daughter Erica (Hayley Orrantia) does little more than roll her eyes occasionally, which, alas, is the only appropriate reaction here.

For all that it springs from original material — a coda to the pilot shows some of the actual home movies, which are indeed hilarious — ""The Goldbergs"" is all style and no substance.

The '80s are a distracting era anyway, what with their relative proximity and those shoulder pads, but Goldberg only adds to the confusion. Where he may experience yelling as a fascinating form of communication, the rest of us just hear a lot of noise. Sprucing it up with subtext (what he really means is ""I love you"") or conveniently collapsing the antagonism into sentiment is a comedic exploration of absolutely nothing.

""Trophy Wife"" is another, and much better, show based on real-life experience. It's from co-creator Sarah Haskins (here working with Emily Halpern), who at a young age married a much older man with children.

PHOTOS: Hollywood Backlot moments

The title clearly wins this year's ""Cougar Town"" award, with the creators attempting to diffuse its sexist connotations by arguing that it is ""ironic."" Still, it's difficult to know what to feel about a woman who makes a show about herself and calls it ""Trophy Wife,"" even ""ironically."" Admiration? Disgust? Envy?

Certainly, most women would like to have a ""loosely based"" version of ourselves played by the lovely, long-limbed and comedically gifted Malin Akerman. Single and lovin' it, her party-girl Kate falls onto, and then for, Bradley Whitford's Pete. A year later, she's married, stepmomming and dancing a complicated minuet with Pete's two previous wives.

There's the grimly efficient doctor Diane (Marcia Gay Harden) and the spacey, granola-cruncher Jackie (Michaela Watkins), neither of whom seems to have remarried. This makes Pete the midlife lion anchoring a pride of mutually wary females who have to learn to live together. Honestly, didn't we just do this on ""Big Love""?

In many ways, ""Trophy Wife"" passes the new comedy test with flying colors. Grounded in parental reality, it's funny and promises to be funnier. The characters, though presented in very broad strokes, have lots of room for shading.

The sight of Whitford back in a full-time role evokes a near physical sense of well-being, and Harden is always a joy — even with Kate's undeniable charms, I found myself hoping that the trajectory of the series would reunite Pete and Diane. Probably not the effect Haskins and Halpern were going for.

But then it's hard to tell what ""Trophy Wife"" is about, especially if the title is ""ironic."" Is it Kate's journey to adulthood and a clever overturning of stereotypes? (I'm in.) A look at the diverse village of a modern family? (Ditto.)

PHOTOS: Celebrity portraits by The Times

A tale of improbable but true love conquering all? (Yawn.) Here's what I hope it's not about: women doing all the narrative and emotional heavy lifting while the man looks on, by turns exasperated and admiring, as his ""wives"" work it out. (Burn it to the ground.)

""Lucky 7"" raises none of these worrisome questions, or any questions at all save the baffled ""Why?""

An ensemble piece about a group of workers at an auto repair show who hit a lottery jackpot, it would have been much more promising if creators David Zabel and Jason Richman had chosen subtlety, which they did not. Instead, we have the disparate and desperate characters that always seem to fuel this sort of show (the short-lived ""Drive"" comes unfortunately to mind).","2013-09-24 10:00:00","0","48.0","17.0","3.0","0.0","27.0","0.0","59.0","21.0","0.0","87.0","4.0","17.0","0","818","87.31","70.90","13.66","84.15","16.36","21.64","78.48","43.28","8.80","3.30","0.73","0.61","0.24","1.47","0.24","5.50","8.07","12.59","5.87","4.28","5.13","1.10","11.25","5.87","2.08","2.08","0.73","3.67","7.33","5.26","1.96","0.24","0.86","0.24","8.80","2.08","0.00","2.44","1.34","10.64","2.20","1.47","0.98","3.06","2.20","2.32","4.28","1.96","0.86","0.98","2.32","0.61","0.98","0.24","0.00","7.33","3.55","1.34","2.08","0.86","0.24","1.34","8.07","0.98","11.61","1.83","5.75","4.03","1.34","2.44","0.86","0.24","0.12","0.00","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.24","0.12","27.38","5.38","6.36","0.49","0.12","0.98","0.49","1.96","4.89","3.06","3.67","0.00","3846","8.74","16.82","1191","803","40","59.53","12.2","9.9","12.42","12.7","209","10.2","20.45095890410959","495","15.94","21","0.43","0","30","8","81","1","91","61","4","1","5","122","122","0","40","1","0","35","7","50","1","0","3","17","0","19","15","23","17","18","48","7","11","0","2"
"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-legg-20130723-story.html","Legg Mason names new chairman","Legg Mason Inc. announced the appointment of Dennis M. Kass, an independent director and former CEO, as its new chairman during the annual shareholders meeting Tuesday.

Kass, 62, joined the board of the Baltimore-based money manager in April and replaces W. Allen Reed, who had held the position since September after CEO and Chairman Mark Fetting announced his resignation.

Reed told shareholders he was stepping down for ""personal family reasons"" and never intended to stay in the post for long. He will remain on Legg's board, where he has served since 2006.

CEO Joseph A. Sullivan, who permanently replaced Fetting in February, said after the meeting that he has learned from Kass in just the few months he has been on the board.

""He's a seasoned asset-management executive,"" Sullivan said. ""He's a former CEO, and as a new CEO, I can look to him for some guidance.""

The new chairman has experience in the investment world and government. Kass retired last year as chairman of Jennison Associates, an asset management company owned by Prudential Financial Inc. Kass had been CEO and chairman of Jennison from 2003 to 2011. He also worked for J.P. Morgan's investment management unit, including serving as vice chairman of J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management, according to Legg.

Kass, who is based in Florida, also spent two years as assistant secretary of labor for pension and welfare benefits under the Reagan administration in the mid-1980s.

Asked why he wanted the job, Kass responded that Legg is a great franchise.

""It has a storied history. It, like many other investment management organizations, great ones, experienced significant stress through the financial crisis and the recession,"" Kass said. ""But it is strong. It is extremely well-positioned to capitalize on its business opportunities going forward.""

Macrae Sykes, an analyst with Gabelli & Co. in Rye, N.Y., said Kass brings a ""distinguished background.

""He could bring a wealth of experience to the organization,"" the analyst said.

Legg has seen a great deal of change since its last annual meeting.

Fetting stepped down in October after less than five years at the helm under what analysts said was pressure from activist shareholder and director Nelson Peltz. Fetting had been unable to prevent investors from bailing out of Legg's mutual funds and failed to revive the company's lackluster stock.

The company continues to fight an outflow of money. Total assets under management at the end of June reached nearly $645 billion, down about $20 billion from three months earlier.

Legg's stock price, though, is up about 30 percent since Fetting's announced departure. It closed Tuesday at $34.88 a share, up 26 cents.

On Tuesday, Peltz told reporters before the annual meeting that the company is headed in the right direction.

""I am happy with the way things are going with Legg Mason,"" he said.

Sullivan also told shareholders that things ""are back on track.""

He said the company's goal is to weather all market cycles by diversifying its client base as well as its product offerings to include more equity and alternative investment options. Sullivan added that the company is trying to improve its investment performance and work as efficiently as possible.

Sullivan was asked at the meeting about the effect of rising interest rates at Legg, where 55 percent of the assets under management are in bonds, whose prices fall as rates go up.

Like other investment companies, Legg saw small investors pull some money out of bonds, but its institutional investors have stayed put, Sullivan said.

""The vast majority of our fixed-income book of business is institutional. They tend not to be pulling things in and out,"" he said. ""If anything, when a certain sector sells off and gets cheap, they are actually required to buy more and rebalance.""

Legg hasn't seen an influx of money from rebalancing yet.

He also was asked whether Legg anticipated any other impairment charges. The company suffered a loss of nearly $454 million earlier this year, after a $734 million writedown of certain assets.

Sullivan said Legg conducts an annual review in December on this issue but doesn't expect another charge.

""We are comfortable where we are right now,"" he said.

Legg plans to release its first-quarter earnings Thursday. Gabelli's Sykes anticipates the company to report earnings of 37 cents per share, compared with a loss of 7 cents a share for the corresponding quarter a year ago.

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/music/midnight-sun-blog/bs-ae-lupe-fiasco-20131211-story.html","Lupe Fiasco trudges on ... but for how long?","Last year, Lupe Fiasco found himself in the middle of a hot-button debate in hip-hop. His single at the time, ""Bitch Bad,"" explicitly confronted the culture's knotty issues with misogyny, language and gender roles. The chorus begins with the song's title, but finishes with Fiasco adding, ""'Woman' good, 'Lady' better.""

The 31-year-old Chicago rapper thought he was initiating a healthy conversation, but some felt the rapper's tone was self-righteous to the point of sabotage. (""Lupe Fiasco mansplains misogyny on counterproductive"" single, read Spin magazine's headline.)

More than a year later, Fiasco, who headlines Rams Head Live on Sunday, says he wishes he had never written the song in the first place.

""The people who hated it were the people you would think would be the ones that would, if not champion it, at least show you some respect for it,"" Fiasco said on the phone last week from his tour bus. ""I think that's the Lupe curse. No matter what I do, I'm always going to get beat up for it.""

That is why the musician born Wasalu Muhammad Jaco selected ""Old School Love"" as the lead single from his forthcoming fifth album, ""Tetsuo & Youth,"" due next year. Fiasco says the sentimental ode to simpler times is ""completely safe,"" a claim backed up by Taylor Swift buddy Ed Sheeran singing the chorus.

But he's telling a half-truth. On its surface, ""Old School Love"" is an easy-to-digest ploy to get on the radio, but in typical Fiasco fashion, it has more layers. Lyrically, he depicts an embattled Chicago filled with troubled youth: ""Chiraq summer looking so cruel / Look shorty in the eye, told me it was 'no rules.'""

Chicago won't turn around its problems with violence, he says, ""until the kids want to put their guns down and try to reconcile their problems.""

He admits he's not optimistic Chicago can improve, but he believes the solution lies in erasing the sense that residents, rich and poor, are not welcome in certain areas.

""The entire outlook of the city has to change. The borders and the neighborhoods have to come down,"" Fiasco said. ""People have to embrace and allow people to be accepted socially, culturally and physically, to be honest, in different sectors of the city.""

Still, ""Old School Love"" sounds radio-ready, and that is by design. He says ""Tetsuo & Youth"" is, overall, more aggressive lyrically, but that he wanted a pop-oriented single to build interest.

""There's still that formula of nice, soft records up top to do the business of selling the album and creating the radio buzz,"" Fiasco said. ""But then you get into the bulk of the album, and it's all down to business again.""

For longtime fans, the promise of new music is encouraging enough. Last September, after a Twitter spat with teenage Chicago rapper Chief Keef, Fiasco wrote online, ""This album will probably be my last. ... My first true love was literature so I will return to that. Lupe Fiasco ends here.""

With a tour and a new album on the way, he's clearly had a change of heart. But why?

""Because I'm contractually obligated to do six albums,"" he said bluntly before adding that friends, family and lawyer often have to keep him motivated. ""Trust me, every time it's not as simple as me waking up one morning and saying, 'OK, I just want to rap again.'""

Fiasco says that after he fulfills his contractual obligations to Atlantic Records, he could see himself being an independent artist. Labels aside, he says it's his wide-ranging fan base, regularly represented at his concerts, that keeps him going.

""You'll see a group of kids from Palestine with Palestinian flags. You'll see Wounded Warriors against the Iraq War in their fatigues there supporting,"" Fiasco said. ""You'll see the weird college kids in the back that just want to get drunk to 'Kick, Push.' Until that dies off completely, I'll still be rocking.""

"http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/music/midnight-sun-blog/bs-ae-mike-munford-20131214-story.html","Mike Munford, master of banjo, honed skills in Baltimore","The world's best banjo player of the past year lives in a log cabin about 40 miles from Baltimore.

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, 55-year-old Mike Munford sat on a couch in his living room in Glen Rock, Pa. He held his favorite banjo, a Gibson five-string, as his Labrador-mix Miki rested her head by his side. Then Munford began to play, first goofing around a bit to fill the silence, and then playing a combination of more complicated riffs he'd written. He even mixed in ""Carol of the Bells.""

With a fluid, near-hypnotic rhythm generated mostly from his thumb, index and middle fingers, Munford, a Roland Park native who still calls Baltimore ""home base,"" played it all impeccably. That's because for 40 years, Munford has dedicated his life to bluegrass music and mastering the banjo. A modest guy, Munford says he hasn't conquered the instrument, and his only aim is to improve.

""There's no limit to the amount of inspiration that's out there,"" Munford later said in his basement, surrounded by records, hand-labeled VHS recordings and framed vintage bluegrass photos. ""There's no end to working on technique or repertoire, or trying to maintain what you've learned over the years.""

Munford's decades of devotion reached a new height in the fall when the respected trade association International Bluegrass Music Association named him ""Banjo Player of the Year"" in Raleigh, N.C. It was the first time Munford had ever been nominated for any bluegrass prize, and he says the nomination ""was the honor as far as I was concerned."" But then, his name was called.

""I'm still shocked and honored for eternity,"" Munford said, still somewhat in disbelief. ""I respect these other players so much, and just to be recognized along with them — at least for this brief period because who knows what's going to happen next year — is absolutely thrilling and I don't take it lightly at all.""

Others in the industry were surprised by Munford's win, but not because he didn't deserve it. For years, those who closely followed and played bluegrass were familiar with Munford's engaging, contemporary-meets-traditional style. But for the most part, he flew under the radar nationally, especially in comparison to the other nominees.

John Lawless, editor of ""Bluegrass Today,"" covered the awards, an event with ""gigantic"" significance in the genre, according to Lawless. He said he ""jumped up and shouted"" when he heard Munford had won.

""Mike's been a musician's musician all of his life. Not the guy who gets the headlines, but the guy who's doing it, day in and day out, and teaching the next generation of pickers,"" Lawless said from Roanoke, Va., on Thursday. ""It's almost like the super underdog wins the World Series kind of thing. I was delighted.""

How does the underdog finally hoist the championship? For Munford, his journey to the peak of bluegrass excellence began at age 15, when he was a student at Boys' Latin School of Maryland. One day, a friend up the street invited Munford over to check out his new toy, a banjo. Unfamiliar with the instrument but intrigued, Munford followed, and to this day, he still vividly remembers the moment he fell in love with the banjo.

""He played 'Foggy Mountain Breakdown,'"" Munford said, recalling the album was ""Live at Kansas State"" by banjo pioneer Earl Scruggs. ""I said, 'I don't care what I do — you have to show me how to do that because that's the most amazing thing I've ever heard.""

Thus began Munford's love affair with the banjo. He says his parents, who still live in the same Roland Park house where Munford was raised, listened to classical music and his older brother liked the Beatles. But neither produced sounds that struck him like the quick notes of the banjo.

The day after he graduated from high school in 1976, Munford began working full-time at Baltimore Bluegrass, the acoustic music store located on Belair Road until it closed in 2000. He quickly realized he wasn't interested in college or ""a real job,"" so he immersed himself in all things banjo at the store: giving lessons to students and repairing instruments, all while continuously honing his own craft. Friends and family warned him that music was an uncertain route, but Munford wasn't willing to give up on his dream.

""I wasn't making a ton, and you never really do, but you make enough to get the essentials taken care of,"" said Munford, who financially supports himself fully through music. ""What I started to learn early on was you don't really need that much to survive if the thing that you're doing for a living is something you really enjoy.""

That lesson has guided him ever since. Known for years as a regional artist, Munford estimates that he has played 1,500 shows in the Baltimore-Washington area, with previous bands (Windy Ridge was the name of his first group) and sitting in with random players. He says he still loves coming to Baltimore because of the memories that rush to him.

""I identify with [Baltimore] so much,"" he said. ""Driving around the city at any time — if I go down there to visit my folks or any other reason — just about anywhere I go, I'm within a mile of some place I played.""

The banjo has led Munford to once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, too. In 2008, he shared a stage with comedian and bluegrass enthusiast Steve Martin, through their mutual friend and banjoist Tony Trischka. A year later, Munford found himself in Martin's New York City apartment, adjusting the ""Saturday Night Live"" alum's instruments on his coffee table.

""That was an incredible thrill,"" Munford, a ""huge fan going back to the '70s,"" said. ""It was no joking around. It was down to business, but he was very affable and gracious.""

Big moments like that aside, Munford enjoyed the less glamorous side of music: giving lessons and repairing instruments, along with jamming live. But in early 2009, Munford took a leap that surprised many: He became the banjo player for a serious, tour-the-world bluegrass band, Frank Solivan and Dirty Kitchen.

""Mike worked at Baltimore Bluegrass for so long before that folded up. It was the steady job that you don't want to give up to go on the road,"" Lawless said. ""Then it just worked out Frank was looking for somebody. A lot of people were like, 'Wow, Mike is actually on the road. How cool is that?'""

Solivan, a 36-year-old multi-instrumentalist who lives in Alexandria, Va., says Munford plays with a combination of power and authority but also maintains a ""tasteful touch.""","2013-12-14 20:08:00","0","37.0","6.0","3.0","0.0","25.0","0.0","36.0","16.0","0.0","83.0","4.0","15.0","0","1116","82.79","71.09","40.35","93.88","19.58","21.33","81.36","48.66","12.10","7.26","1.61","0.00","0.72","4.75","0.18","4.84","8.06","14.61","5.65","4.66","6.09","1.43","13.80","4.39","2.15","1.70","1.52","2.33","5.29","4.75","0.36","0.09","0.00","0.00","10.93","0.45","0.54","0.09","5.20","8.69","1.61","1.43","0.36","2.06","0.99","3.05","3.49","0.45","2.69","0.36","1.61","0.27","0.90","0.00","0.18","6.81","1.34","2.15","3.32","1.25","0.09","6.99","5.65","0.63","18.37","1.70","9.14","7.80","3.05","2.51","0.63","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","23.75","5.20","7.62","0.27","0.00","0.18","0.00","1.61","5.02","3.49","0.18","0.18","5078","7.46","20.157894736842106","1566","1102","58","69.11","10.6","8.3","11.08","11.1","201","7.75","16.895825771324866","543","18.68","22","0.48","0","40","12","110","0","138","73","1","2","0","183","121","0","38","0","0","71","21","63","2","2","8","30","0","21","78","26","27","23","37","3","12","0","5"
"http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-jos-bank-shareholder-pressure-20130817-story.html","Shareholders wage campaign against Jos. A. Bank Clothiers","Jos. A. Bank Clothiers faces a growing shareholder revolt as demonstrated by an institutional investor's open letter last week calling for the Hampstead-based retailer to return its growing cash reserve to owners of its stock.

BeaconLight Capital LLC, a New York-based investment manager that owns more than 1 percent of Jos. A. Bank, also urged the men's apparel chain to reorganize its board, realign management incentives and drop its strategy of pursuing acquisitions with its cash.

""Our biggest concern is that the company has progressively become more shareholder-unfriendly,"" said Ed Bosek, BeaconLight's founder, managing partner and portfolio manager, in an interview.

There's a growing wave of shareholders like BeaconLight. Disenchanted stockholders are increasingly working to change a company's structure and strategy — and succeeding, experts said.

BeaconLight's criticisms of Jos. A. Bank, outlined in a letter sent to the board and made public Tuesday, came on the heels of the chain's annual meeting in June, during which 31 percent of shareholders voted against the election of two directors. In a nonbinding vote, shareholders also narrowly rejected pay packages for top executives.

Bosek said the retailer has built up large cash reserves while failing to pay a dividend or repurchase shares.

""Over a long period, because the return on cash is zero, it destroys value,"" Bosek said. ""It would be better to give back to shareholders.""

The company did not respond to several requests for comment.

Shares of Jos. A. Bank, which jumped 13 percent to $45.33 Tuesday after the shareholder criticisms emerged, fell 7 percent Friday to close at $41, reacting to an earnings warning issued Thursday after the market closed.

In its letter, BeaconLight said it should be worth $70 per share.

Jos. A. Bank has underperformed its peers and is the cheapest stock among U.S. listed retailers, BeaconLight said. The market has penalized the company for poor use of cash and corporate governance, the investor said, noting a ""staggering"" $377 million in reserves at the end of the fiscal year. That equals about $13.50 per share or nearly a third of the company's value, BeaconLight said.

BeaconLight also objected to a board with ""no truly independent"" directors because of members' connections to the company or to the chairman, Robert Wildrick, a former CEO who oversaw company growth. The national chain now runs 612 stores.

Despite the chairman's contributions to growth, ""his past success does not entitle him to run the company as a personal fiefdom,"" said the letter. It called for the addition of independent directors without prior connections to the board or management.

BeaconLight also called on the company to use incentives to reward management for creating long-term shareholder value, to end Wildrick's consulting arrangement and to build up an investor relations department that will foster communication with shareholders.

The campaign is similar to those being waged at other public companies where shareholders have voiced opposition over compensation, strategy and use of cash, said Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.

""Shareholder activism has been highly effective of late in changing board composition and function and corporate strategy,"" he said. ""In the end, if you don't like how management is responding, they can put up a slate of their own candidates.""

Activists have increasingly become involved with larger value companies, including targets such as Apple Inc. and Hess Corp., according to SharkRepellent.net, a website that provides corporate research.

The shareholder discontent at Jos. A. Bank comes amid sharp drops in profits. The company warned Thursday that its second-quarter earnings are expected to decline to about 49 cents to 53 cents per share, compared with 83 cents per share in the second quarter of 2012. Total sales fell about 11 percent in the three-month period that ended Aug. 3.

""Customers did not respond as well to some of our highly promotional, high sales volume marketing campaigns as they did in the prior year,"" CEO R. Neal Black said in a statement.

Earnings for the first quarter, which ended May 4, slid 45 percent to $8.1 million, or 29 cents per share, from $14.8 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. First-quarter sales slipped 2.6 percent to $196 million.

In June, Black outlined a strategy to strengthen performance by moving away from the deep discount promotions as well as boosting online sales, attracting customers who wear big and tall sizes and continuing to expand full line and outlet stores.

Bosek, who said BeaconLight has been a shareholder for about three years, said Jos. A. Bank stopped communicating with shareholders entirely last year.

""The company has said it is looking for acquisitions, but they have not given any details,"" he said.

He said he hopes more shareholders unite before the company moves to make acquisitions and before the next shareholders meeting, likely in May or June.

If so, ""it's going to become clear to this board they are unelectable,"" he said. ""If others got their views to management, that would be great.""

One analyst said last week he agrees with BeaconLight's main points, though he believes the $70 per share projection is high.

""That's predicated on getting back to peak margins, and we don't see that happening for many years down the road,"" said Mark Montagna, a senior analyst with Avondale Partners, a Nashville, Tenn.-based investment firm. ""They're having to retrain the customer on the new promotions.""

If sales and earnings continue to decline, Montagna said he would expect ""you'll have more and more shareholder pressure. Eventually that shareholder pressure will probably result in change.""

It's too early to know how Crissy Field will feel in 2016, when the elevated roadway to the south disappears beneath the green slopes that will reconnect the shoreline to the Presidio's historic Main Post.

But one thing already is clear. The museum that George Lucas proposes to build alongside the new bluff is the wrong building for the site.

The problem isn't that the 65-foot-high structure would exceed Crissy Field's height limits or that the classical look preferred by Lucas doesn't relate to anything in the Presidio.

The problem is that the proposed building has no real connection to the remarkable landscape around it. It's a generic box gussied up with arches and domes, with no more depth than a street on a Hollywood lot.

The land in question is along Mason Street across from Crissy's marsh, an 8-acre site covered by a parking lot and the old post commissary, now occupied by Sports Basement.

3 development plans

A decision on its future could come as early as Tuesday.

That's when three development proposals will be reviewed privately by the board of the Presidio Trust, which manages the former Army post that now is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The board could select a favorite, put off a decision until later this year, or decide not to award the site to any of the contenders that remain in a competition that began last winter.

One finalist is Lucas, who wants to build ""the country's premier venue for understanding the connections and lineage of visual art.""

Another is a team led by local architects WRNS Studio, which proposes a sustainability institute ""taking a deep dive into the everyday things we do, eat, see and use - all to question how we might do things better to serve the common good.""

The third is the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, which envisions a ""hub that amplifies the Presidio's nature and history"" as well as a large, glassy room offering ""comfort, refreshment, information and exchange.""

Financial muscle

The Parks Conservancy has led Presidio-related volunteer and fundraising efforts for almost two decades. But Lucas has the fortune to build his museum by writing a check. He and his team also have lined up support from big wheels and big names: Dianne Feinstein to MC Hammer, Martin Scorsese to Dede Wilsey.

If the same amount of work had gone into the building design, Lucas's architectural vision might be something that even the most protective Presidio lover could embrace. Instead, it's a napkin sketch enlarged to two tall stories and 93,000 square feet.

The desire to strike a dramatic pose is as obvious as the row of arched windows that would parade along the Mason Street facade, each stony arch resting on tall sculptures of robed figures. The entrance features an even bigger arch and even taller figures, these apparently with wings. On either side of the arch is a thick corner column that rises to the roof, upon which rests a copper dome.

The architect for the museum is Urban Design Group of Dallas. One suspects the real designer is Lucas, who makes no secret of his preference for traditional materials and architecture over a more abstract, contemporary approach.

That would be fine, though classical styles bump against the Trust's desire for a building here that would have a more utilitarian quality. Guidelines can be fudged when designs excel in unexpected ways. But this is boilerplate Beaux Arts, ornamentation without imagination.

Disregard for surroundings

Compare it with the supposed inspiration, the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition and its surviving landmark, the magical Palace of Fine Arts by Bernard Maybeck.

Maybeck gave serious thought to the spell he cast. A good architect ""strives to find the spiritual meaning of things and to transmit that secret to the layman,"" he wrote at the time. The worst approach one could take was to boil down architectural style to ""a conglomeration of soulless buildings dolled up in holiday attire.""

Take away the plurals and he could be describing the Lucas museum.

Looks aside, the other flaw is the museum's disregard for its surroundings.

The long, rectangular box facing Crissy Field would turn a cold shoulder to the landscape that will spill down from the Main Post of the Presidio. The only entrance would be through the central arch, up an elaborate flight of steps - a scenographic flourish that, in turn, will require anyone in a wheelchair or pushing a stroller or using a walker to detour to the west end of the building, where a ramp would lead back to the entrance.

The one effort to relate to the setting is on the west side as well. It's a second-floor cafe with rooftop seating. Sounds good, with blockbuster views - except anyone who knows Crissy Field also knows afternoon winds from the west can be brutal for much of the year.

A much smarter and more creative approach is the Park Conservancy's proposed Presidio Exchange.

The design by local architects EHDD reuses a portion of the old commissary, then splits it in such a way that diagonal paths slide through and across the structure, including a glassed-in rooftop promenade that would extend toward the Golden Gate. Outdoor dining would be tucked out of the wind on the building's east side.

Building, landscape unite

The goal wouldn't be to erect a triumphant structure, but to fold the building and landscape together so they overlap.

Some observers would go further and say no building at all, add every square inch of green that you can.

The reality is, when Crissy Field and the Main Post are linked by the new bluff, the result will be more than 150 acres of parkland. The commissary site is the hinge, with the potential to anchor and enrich everything around it.

That's the potential. So far, George Lucas hasn't shown that he's up to the task.","2013-11-17 18:23:00","1","72.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","47.0","0.0","355.0","366.0","0.0","757.0","0.0","15.0","0","2099","98.70","58.84","12.35","46.87","25.91","22.49","69.99","40.11","3.43","0.67","0.00","0.10","0.05","0.48","0.05","2.76","12.53","14.34","4.91","1.95","5.19","0.48","7.72","4.86","2.67","0.67","3.38","1.67","1.91","1.52","0.38","0.00","0.05","0.00","3.62","0.00","0.24","0.10","0.48","5.96","1.48","0.67","1.62","1.38","0.33","1.05","3.48","3.10","0.24","0.14","1.43","0.48","0.38","0.05","0.48","3.62","0.67","1.38","0.81","0.76","0.38","1.10","4.95","1.05","13.63","1.19","9.39","2.81","1.72","4.24","0.81","1.14","0.05","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","15.05","4.05","4.86","1.43","0.19","0.00","0.00","1.24","1.33","1.29","0.38","0.29","10091","7.2","26.860759493670887","3093","2089","81","53.75","12.7","12.2","12.31","15.3","302","11.125","18.10267113451412","659","22.77","25","0.38","0","64","68","278","0","264","131","9","1","38","283","525","4","65","1","0","17","10","42","6","1","8","38","0","62","27","30","49","16","59","16","3","0","7"

Sacramento --

All sales of ammunition in California would be tracked, and only licensed dealers could sell or even give away bullets, under a bill that won initial approval at the Capitol on Tuesday.

The measure, AB48 by Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, was the first major gun control proposal to be heard at the Capitol, where a number of measures have been introduced since the mass shooting of 27 people in Newtown, Conn., in December. Two narrower gun bills also were approved Tuesday.

The hearing came on the one-year anniversary of the killing of seven people at Oikos University in Oakland.

Skinner said the proposal ""would put in place some very simple safeguards on the sale of ammunition - bullets - the very thing that makes a gun deadly.""

She said it is easier to purchase ammunition than it is to buy alcohol, cigarettes or even some cold medicines.

Objections raised

Opponents said the measure, as it stands, would make it illegal for a person to use ammunition provided by gun ranges and criminalize a parent who takes a child to a range and provides him or her with bullets.

Other measures approved by the Assembly Committee on Public Safety include further restrictions on what the state deems ""unsafe handguns"" and requirements for storage of firearms if a gun owner lives with someone who is prohibited by the state from owning a weapon.

All the bills passed on party-line votes, with Democrats in support and Republicans in opposition. Skinner's AB48 passed with a vote of 5-2.

Under that measure, new restrictions include:

-- Anyone selling or furnishing ammunition would have to be licensed by the state.

-- People purchasing ammunition would have to show identification, and the dealer would have to report that sale or transfer to the state Department of Justice. Officials there would check the purchaser against a list of people prohibited from owning guns.

-- Purchases of more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition within a five-day period would have to be reported to local law enforcement.

-- A ban on any device that could convert a magazine to high-capacity, able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammo. Large magazines that appear high-capacity, even if they aren't, also would be banned. Skinner's measure is similar to one moving through the Senate, SB53 by Sen. Kevin de León, D-Los Angeles, though that bill has yet to have a hearing.

2 more Assembly bills

The other bills approved by the committee were AB169 by Assemblyman Roger Dickinson, D-Sacramento, which would put new restrictions on handguns that don't meet certain safety requirements; and AB500 by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, which would create storage requirements if firearms are in the same home as a person prohibited from owning them. Ammiano's bill would also extend the background-check period in some situations.

Ammiano also is chairman of the committee.

Opponents of the measures included state and national gun rights and Second Amendment organizations, with representatives questioning both the logic and the constitutionality of the proposals. The Second Amendment protects the right to ""keep and bear arms.""

They said they were particularly troubled by Skinner's proposal, which has a list of deficiencies 10 pages long, one opponent said.

The most significant issue appeared to be the effect of banning the ""furnishing"" of ammunition from someone other than a licensed dealer. Opponents said that ban raised questions about recreational shooting and how youth organizations like the Boy Scouts of America could continue to educate young people about safe practices.

Defending target practice

Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez, R-Lake Elsinore (Riverside County), said she does not want to lose the ability to take her sons - one of whom is training to be a Navy SEAL - to a shooting range for practice.

""You need to know how to shoot people if you're going to be a Navy SEAL,"" she said.

Skinner said it was not her intention that the bill stop such practices and said she would make sure it does not. However, she said an important piece of the bill is ensuring that someone does not buy ammunition for people who are prohibited from having guns.

The measures are the first of about 20 bills seeking stricter gun control in California. Still awaiting hearings are proposals to ban all high-capacity magazines - specifically those purchased before the state banned them in 2000, which are currently legal - and to ban all long guns with detachable magazines.

Lawmakers have also proposed a 5-cent tax on each bullet sold.","2013-04-02 21:22:00","1","66.0","2.0","7.0","1.0","12.0","0.0","161.0","158.0","0.0","236.0","0.0","13.0","0","776","93.90","68.31","3.10","49.77","22.82","26.03","73.45","43.81","6.57","2.06","0.00","0.00","0.26","1.16","0.64","4.51","8.51","15.08","7.47","3.22","4.38","0.77","13.27","3.87","2.32","1.55","2.84","1.93","2.84","2.06","0.77","0.00","0.26","0.13","8.38","0.26","0.00","1.03","0.39","10.05","0.77","1.55","2.84","2.84","1.03","3.09","2.58","0.52","1.80","0.26","0.64","0.13","0.52","0.00","0.26","6.44","0.39","1.55","3.22","0.39","1.16","3.35","7.86","0.13","9.92","1.03","6.06","2.84","3.09","0.90","0.13","3.35","0.00","0.13","0.13","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.24","4.77","4.64","0.26","0.13","0.00","0.00","3.99","1.29","0.90","0.26","0.00","3791","8.38","24.46875","1183","760","34","48.74","13.6","12.0","13.35","14.4","175","13.25","20.170526315789473","369","22.28","16","0.42","0","19","18","77","0","98","41","5","0","16","119","92","2","63","1","0","19","3","24","0","1","1","27","0","44","24","15","22","14","21","8","5","0","3"

A judge on Monday ordered the former nursing student accused of murdering seven people at a small Oakland college to seek treatment inside a locked psychiatric hospital, where doctors will attempt to restore his mental competence so he can stand trial.

Judge Carrie Panetta ordered One Goh, 44, to be transferred from Alameda County jail to Napa State Hospital, where psychiatrists will conduct therapy sessions and administer antipsychotic medication.

Psychiatrists will deliver the first progress report to Panetta in 90 days, and then every six months until Goh is deemed capable of understanding the legal proceedings and can assist in his defense.

Goh, who pleaded not guilty to the slayings in April, was found incompetent to stand trial this month after two psychiatrists diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia.

Police said Goh has confessed to the April 2 slayings at Oikos University.

He appeared gaunt at Monday's hearing in Superior Court in Oakland. His attorney said Goh has lost 60 pounds since his arrest in April.

""He does not seem to be taking good care of himself,"" said the attorney, Assistant Public Defender David Klaus.

(02-22) 17:05 PST BERKELEY -- A man who died while struggling with Berkeley police trying to take him into custody for a psychiatric evaluation was identified Friday as 41-year-old Xavier Christopher Moore.

Moore lost consciousness after an altercation with officers at the Gaia apartment complex at 2116 Allston Way on Feb. 12, police said. The Alameda County coroner has not determined the cause of his death pending the results of toxicology tests.

Officers had been called to investigate a disturbance between roommates.

Sacramento --

Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday signed into law a new state budget for the fiscal year beginning Monday, calling it a ""momentous occasion"" for California's finances, which have been on a roller coaster for years.

""We have a balanced budget, not proposed, but actually actualized - the first time in probably a decade or more where the state's finances are in very solid shape,"" Brown said.

The plan outlines spending for $96.2 billion in the general fund - the state's main checking account, which pays for schools, colleges, health and human services, and public safety - and $49 billion in special funds and bonds.

Brown did not make significant changes to the plan the Legislature passed earlier in the month, though he did use his line-item veto authority to cut about $41 million from the spending plan. Most of that - some $30 million - was cut from a Department of Education fund for special education.

The governor and Democratic leaders of the Legislature gathered in his office at the Capitol for the bill signing, which included two other bills that will enable the state to further implement the federal Affordable Care Act. He and the legislative leaders were jovial, and among the crowd were many health care advocates.

Democrats in the Legislature had hoped for more spending during the budget process, but Brown curtailed their enthusiasm by demanding limited growth in funding for various programs. Overall state spending through the general fund will grow by less than 1 percent in the new fiscal year, according to the Department of Finance.

But Democrats did get some of what they wanted, with the creation of a tuition subsidy for students from families making less than $150,000 who attend University of California or California State University schools.

The budget also provides $143 million in new funding for mental health services to create crisis and triage positions throughout the state.

Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, had pushed for the increased mental health funding, and said it was ""the first time in state history"" that the budget had the most new money - after education spending - going toward mental health services.

Assembly Speaker John Pérez, D-Los Angeles, got his way in creating the tuition break for UC and CSU students from middle-class families. Starting in 2014, students from families that make less than $150,000 will get tuition breaks that will grow over four years to a 40 percent reduction of the overall cost.

""We're in a position to focus on long-term planning,"" Pérez said.

The health care bills that Brown signed take California another step toward leading the country in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

Health and Human Services Agency Secretary Diana Dooley attended the bill signing and said the national effort was something that ""the president made possible, but we have to make real in California.""","2013-06-27 15:01:00","1","51.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","12.0","0.0","161.0","158.0","0.0","234.0","0.0","12.0","0","504","97.95","62.46","20.57","70.57","24.00","27.38","81.35","38.49","5.36","1.98","0.00","0.60","0.00","0.99","0.40","3.37","9.52","14.29","3.97","1.59","4.37","0.40","10.91","7.54","3.17","1.19","4.17","2.78","3.17","2.78","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.75","0.60","0.00","0.00","0.99","7.54","0.20","2.38","0.40","2.38","0.00","2.78","2.98","1.59","0.99","0.40","1.59","0.20","1.39","0.00","0.00","9.13","1.39","3.57","3.57","0.99","0.40","4.96","3.97","1.79","14.48","2.38","6.94","4.96","7.74","0.79","0.60","6.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.46","4.56","5.56","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.98","1.98","0.79","0.00","1.39","2493","8.69","25.45","759","496","20","54.76","13.4","11.8","13.7","15.9","120","7.916666666666666","21.597419354838713","270","22.9","5","0.39","0","18","20","52","0","67","37","4","0","4","91","73","2","28","0","0","8","4","10","3","1","0","8","0","13","25","11","9","7","5","6","2","0","1"

Sacramento -- Gov. Jerry Brown's plan to ease rules requiring local governments to open their public records created a furor. Less noticed were budget provisions that weakened guidelines for cities and counties on everything from euthanizing animals to issuing restraining orders in domestic violence cases.

The budget that Brown signed last month suspends parts of 63 laws for local governments - intensifying a trend that began when the economy crashed and public agencies faced an urgent need to save money.

Under the California Constitution, local governments cannot be required to follow state laws unless Sacramento reimburses the cost of implementation. As a result, state lawmakers have rolled back such requirements in recent years to save reimbursement money.

That is what lawmakers had in mind last month when they backed a Brown proposal lifting the state mandate that requires cities, counties and local agencies to respond within 10 days to requests for public records.

Legislators reversed course amid a flood of public criticism. But some watchdogs worry that other changes could be just as damaging to the public interest.

Pets and police

Brown's budget eliminates requirements that police investigate identity-theft complaints and that prosecutors conduct background checks on people arrested for domestic violence. It also allows animal shelters to euthanize animals within three days instead of the previous four to six days.

It's not clear how much the state will save because of such changes. It often takes years for the state to determine which pieces of the legislation require reimbursement, and some say that gap leads to officials questioning why they should pay for something local governments have been doing.

""You could see where folks say, 'Why are we funding this?' "" said Jean Hurst, an expert on mandates for the California State Association of Counties. ""It's kind of a debacle, in my estimation.""

Backlog of bills

The state owes cities, counties and special districts nearly $1.8 billion for reimbursement costs incurred before laws were suspended, according to the Department of Finance.

In 2005, 35 laws were watered down because of the cost. This year's budget lists 63 relaxed regulations.

The debate over the Public Records Act provided a clear illustration of the problem. Hurst said lawmakers recognized when they passed the law that there would be a cost to the state, but declared it would be worth it.

Years later, no reimbursement checks have been sent, and Brown believes locals should bear the cost.

""Most of these activities are activities that local governments are doing as a matter of course, as a matter of best practices or good government,"" said H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the Department of Finance.

The question, he said, is whether the state should pay local governments for what they should be doing in the first place.

Finance officials said a classic example of a needless state-imposed requirement was the law requiring prosecutors to perform a background check on domestic-violence suspects before they are charged. Not doing so, they contend, would be professional negligence. As a result, lifting the state requirement wouldn't affect how local prosecutors do their jobs.

Animal advocates upset

Animal rights advocates don't buy that argument when it comes to easing rules requiring local shelters to hold stray pets longer before euthanizing them.

""The reason the shelters were (holding strays longer) was because it was mandated by law,"" said Nathan Winograd, executive director of the No Kill Advocacy Center in Oakland. ""But once these (laws) were suspended, the holding went back down to 72 hours and the killing started again.""

Dan Carrigg, legislative director at the League of California Cities, argues that local governments are hamstrung by rules that make it difficult to raise taxes, making it all the more important that Sacramento repay them for imposed laws.

""There comes a point where you're trying to balance local resources,"" Carrigg said, and it doesn't help when government is ""adding new conditions and requirements on top of it.""","2013-07-07 20:02:00","1","60.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","151.0","148.0","0.0","217.0","0.0","13.0","0","668","86.22","65.16","12.92","21.19","20.24","26.80","78.44","42.07","7.78","2.25","0.15","0.15","0.30","0.15","1.50","5.54","7.49","12.57","7.49","3.74","5.09","1.20","13.32","4.34","2.54","2.25","1.95","1.50","4.19","1.95","2.25","0.30","0.75","0.00","6.44","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.15","8.98","1.20","2.69","1.80","1.65","0.60","1.65","2.40","0.90","1.50","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","8.98","0.60","1.35","6.89","0.60","0.30","4.34","6.29","0.45","13.17","1.35","7.49","4.79","8.98","0.15","0.75","4.94","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.12","4.94","4.34","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.00","1.05","2.10","1.80","0.60","0.15","3447","8.08","20.606060606060606","1037","664","34","51.68","13.1","10.9","14.1","13.8","146","8.9","18.595180722891566","350","19.36","2","0.41","0","15","12","58","0","76","45","0","2","10","96","48","1","86","1","0","24","3","17","3","0","1","21","0","27","36","24","14","18","20","7","2","0","11"

Photo: None, Gwen Park Jazzie Collins was involved in many fights for social justice.

Jazzie Collins, a community organizer and well-known transgender activist who was involved in social justice causes in San Francisco, died Thursday at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in the city.

She was 54 and had deteriorating health the past few weeks, friends said, although the cause of her death is being determined. Ms. Collins also was open about being HIV-positive.

Ms. Collins was active - friends describe her as ""fiery"" and a ""passionate advocate"" - in causes that were factors in her life: tenants' rights, workers' rights, transgender rights and aging and health issues, among others.

Christina Olague, a close friend and former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, said Ms. Collins was motivated by strong feelings against injustice and unfairness.

""Empathetic is the word that comes to mind,"" she said.

Late last month, Ms. Collins was honored for her work at the Capitol in Sacramento by the California Legislative Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Caucus.

""One thing that she always had that was very appealing was dignity,"" said Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, who nominated Ms. Collins for the state recognition. ""I think she understood the dynamics of the challenges she faced personally and how they connected to the causes she was in personally.""

Ammiano said Ms. Collins ""was definitely a San Franciscan, in every sense of the word.""

Born Sept. 24, 1958, in Memphis, Ms. Collins moved to San Francisco in 1988. She became a committed activist in 2002 with development issues at the Plaza Hotel on Sixth Street, where she lived at the time.

A few years later she transitioned from male to female and worked with a wide range of community groups, along with new volunteer work in the transgender community. She was a volunteer and organizer for Senior and Disability Action and vice chair of San Francisco's LGBT Aging Policy Taskforce at the time of her death.

She also served the past five years on the Board of Directors of the San Francisco Trans March, which is part of the Gay Pride Month celebrations.

Gabriel Haaland, a friend and fellow transgender activist, said that Ms. Collins' activism blossomed as she transitioned from male to female.

""The metaphor of a butterfly is apt,"" Haaland said. ""She really emerged to become a really beautiful person who was much happier with herself, much happier with her life. (She) just really opened up in a beautiful way.""

Ms. Collins is survived by her mother, Mary Mackey, four sisters and four brothers. Plans for a memorial service are pending.","2013-07-13 16:08:00","1","52.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","158.0","0.0","233.0","0.0","12.0","0","440","93.26","87.68","5.01","76.23","18.33","25.68","73.64","41.36","7.95","5.45","0.23","0.00","0.00","5.00","0.23","2.50","7.73","13.86","5.68","2.50","4.77","0.23","10.00","5.00","1.36","1.36","2.27","2.05","3.64","3.18","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","13.41","0.68","1.14","6.14","0.91","5.68","2.05","1.36","0.00","0.00","1.14","1.36","2.95","0.68","1.59","0.23","2.73","0.00","1.59","1.14","0.23","8.41","3.41","2.73","2.73","0.23","0.00","7.50","3.18","0.23","12.50","0.68","7.05","4.55","3.18","1.14","0.23","0.00","0.00","1.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.59","7.73","7.27","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.14","3.64","0.91","0.45","0.00","2142","7.82","19.217391304347824","650","437","29","64.61","11.7","8.0","12.23","10.5","95","7.5","16.735652173913046","227","17.61","7","0.39","0","15","9","35","0","57","25","1","0","0","60","94","1","25","0","0","18","6","15","1","0","1","6","0","3","37","6","8","2","9","3","3","0","2"

Sacramento --

Transgender students in public schools can participate in school activities and use school facilities that conform to their gender identity under a bill that passed the Senate Wednesday and now heads to the desk of Gov. Jerry Brown.

The bill, AB1266 by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, had the bare majority, passing 21-9 on a partisan vote with Democrats in support.

""There should be certainty that every kid has the chance to go to school and be treated equally and fairly,"" said state Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, who presented the bill on the Senate floor. ""We know that these particular kids suffer much abuse and bullying and denigration.""

Backers of the bill have noted that current California law already prohibits schools from discriminating on the basis of gender identity, but they said many school districts in the state don't comply with that.

The Los Angeles and San Francisco school districts have had such policies in place for many years, ensuring access to restrooms, locker rooms or sports teams that align with the identity of transgender students.

Opponents raised many concerns, with state Sen. Jim Nielsen, R-Gerber (Tehama County), calling it an ""extraordinarily consequential piece of legislation"" that he said many parents and students would be reticent to accept.

He said students ""now may be subjected to some very difficult situations and their parents to even more objectionable situations. It is not, ladies and gentlemen, a simple bill. It is a landmark bill for California.""

Other Republican senators wondered about students who might take advantage of the law to participate on an opposite-sex sports team, and how the California Interscholastic Federation would handle such a situation.

The federation, which oversees high school athletics in California, has a policy that is in line with the bill for transgender students who want to play on teams that conform with their gender identity.

Shannon Minter, the legal director at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, called the bill's passage ""wonderful.""

""I think it's past time,"" said Minter, who is transgender. ""California needs to catch up with other states and our transgender students need this protection and the schools need the guidance.""","2013-07-03 16:13:00","1","49.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","12.0","0.0","161.0","158.0","0.0","234.0","0.0","12.0","0","388","92.06","75.68","3.10","49.77","19.40","26.55","73.71","40.46","8.25","2.32","0.26","0.52","0.00","0.52","1.03","5.93","7.99","12.37","5.67","2.58","4.12","0.52","11.08","2.58","0.77","1.55","0.52","2.84","2.84","2.06","0.77","0.00","0.26","0.26","8.76","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.77","7.47","1.03","1.29","1.80","1.80","0.52","1.55","2.58","0.52","1.29","0.26","0.77","0.26","0.00","0.52","0.00","9.54","1.80","1.03","6.19","0.77","0.77","3.09","7.47","0.52","9.28","1.03","6.19","2.06","7.73","1.55","0.26","2.58","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.59","5.67","6.44","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.06","3.61","1.03","0.52","0.00","1963","8.52","24.5","595","382","19","51.07","13.7","11.1","14.1","14.1","94","10.6","19.882931937172778","217","22.38","6","0.41","0","15","2","36","0","41","27","1","0","6","65","60","1","35","0","0","9","4","9","1","0","1","11","0","14","13","5","4","10","11","5","4","0","1"

Sacramento --

California's Public Records Act will remain intact, for now, after lawmakers abruptly reversed course Thursday amid criticism over a plan they approved last week to weaken the sunshine law in order to save the state money.

The action came a day after the leaders of the Senate and Assembly clashed over the question of what to do about a bill they passed, AB76. It would have lifted the state mandate that requires cities, counties and other local government groups to respond within 10 days to a request for public records and to provide specific forms of assistance to members of the public and news media who seek records.

Following intense pressure from the press and open-government advocates, Assembly Speaker John Pérez, D-Los Angeles, announced Wednesday that the Assembly would pass a bill to reinstate the mandate, which the Assembly did on Thursday with a 52-25 vote.

But Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, on Wednesday threatened to block the bill from reaching the governor's desk, saying he preferred pursuing a state constitutional amendment to resolve the problem. On Thursday, however, he suddenly changed course and said the Senate will seek to approve the bill as early as Monday.

Steinberg said he will also pursue a constitutional amendment to require cities to adhere to the Public Records Act without requiring the state to reimburse cities for some of the expenses related to complying with the act.

Long-term solution

""There needs to be both an immediate fix to ensure local entities comply with the California Public Records Act and a long-term solution so the California Public Records Act is not considered a reimbursable mandate,"" Steinberg and Pérez said in a joint statement Thursday.

The Public Records Act is an important tool often used by the press to get information as part of investigations of government activities, and any member of the public also can request information under act. Corruption and other criminal activities done by government officials in California have been exposed through the use of the act.

When the state requires local governments to take actions that have costs, those local entities can seek reimbursement from the state. Reimbursement for costs of the records act, such as the requirement for response within 10 days, is expected to begin this fall.

The Legislative Analyst's Office estimates that it could cost tens of millions of dollars a year. The other parts of the California Public Records Act, including a broader requirement that governments and agencies respond promptly to requests, were not affected by the original bill.

State Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, is crafting the constitutional amendment on the issue, and the legislative leaders said they would work closely with him.

""As the Senate advances its proposed constitutional amendment, the Assembly will work with them throughout its process to give voters the chance to make clear that good government shouldn't come with an extra price tag,"" Steinberg and Pérez said in their statement.

Brown supports amendment

Gov. Jerry Brown said in a statement Wednesday that he supports such a constitutional amendment, but on Thursday he avoided reporters who wanted to question him after he gave a speech at the National Nurses United conference in San Francisco.

Upon leaving the stage, he ducked quickly behind a curtain. His spokesman, Evan Westrup, said the governor had ""nothing to add"" about the controversy and would be making no further public appearances Thursday.

Later, Westrup said in a statement that Brown would support the Democratic leaders' actions.

Open-government advocates applauded the reversal, but said the entire controversy could have been avoided had lawmakers reached out to the public for guidance before passing the original measure in the budget.

""I really don't think they expected this big of a backlash,"" said Phillip Ung, spokesman for California Common Cause. He said he didn't question that the motivation for passing the original change was anything more than a financial decision.

""I think that because that was their main motivation and main driver they had blinders on"" over a possible public outcry, he said.","2013-06-20 20:48:00","1","59.0","2.0","7.0","1.0","17.0","0.0","190.0","186.0","0.0","350.0","0.0","14.0","0","943","97.79","75.48","9.25","47.33","30.42","28.84","75.72","39.98","5.94","2.97","0.21","0.00","0.00","1.70","1.06","2.97","10.82","14.10","4.56","2.12","3.71","0.85","9.97","5.51","2.44","0.74","2.23","1.70","2.65","1.91","0.74","0.42","0.21","0.00","9.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.70","8.27","2.23","2.12","1.59","1.27","0.42","1.59","5.62","2.33","2.55","0.74","0.74","0.00","0.74","0.00","0.00","8.38","0.53","1.38","5.73","0.64","0.74","3.92","4.35","1.06","12.30","1.70","5.41","5.20","6.26","0.21","0.11","3.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.68","4.03","5.41","0.42","0.11","0.00","0.00","1.27","1.06","0.85","0.21","0.32","4717","8.02","33.92857142857143","1455","931","33","42.85","14.7","14.3","13.58","17.5","176","11.875","20.841761546723955","395","28.86","9","0.39","0","20","20","112","0","109","60","2","0","17","141","182","2","47","1","0","26","6","19","4","0","1","33","0","39","45","14","14","9","17","3","3","0","3"

Sacramento --

As voters get more information about candidates and campaigns from the Internet, California's political watchdog agency is increasingly suspicious that some of what they are reading may be paid political speech masquerading as independent reporting or opinion.

The state's Fair Political Practices Commission is proposing a regulation that would require candidates and campaigns to publicly report payments to people who write blogs, send messages on Twitter, post on Facebook, create videos and post other online communication.

An initial proposal would have required bloggers and others to disclose in their posts that they were being paid, but the current version requires campaigns and candidates to report payments, and where content was posted, in campaign filings. The commission is set to decide whether to adopt the new rules at its meeting next month in Sacramento.

Ann Ravel, chairwoman of the commission, said she had ""no idea"" how extensive the practice may be but added that a strong initial outcry from bloggers and others leads her to think ""it's maybe more than we might believe.""

""Admittedly, some of those people might be concerned about free expression ... but I would guess that this is not a regulation that's in search of a problem. I think that it's a problem,"" Ravel said.

The issue of campaign-backed bloggers went public during the last Republican primary campaign for governor, when a consultant for candidate Steve Poizner paid a blogger to write favorable articles about Poizner - and harsh criticism of his opponent, Meg Whitman - on a San Diego blog.

When that was uncovered, the blog, Red County, blacklisted the writer.

No remedy needed?

But some bloggers, whether they are paid by campaigns or not, say the commission shouldn't create a statewide regulation that applies to all political activity at the state and local level without more evidence.

""This is a regulation in search of a problem,"" said Steven Maviglio, a Sacramento political consultant who blogs for campaigns on which he works. ""They can't produce more than a couple of instances where this has happened, because nobody does it.""

He said that if someone were trying to appear independent but were being paid by a campaign, the insular world of California politics would expose that person and he or she would lose credibility. Regulating Twitter posts, for example, would create a lot of gray area on what counts as political speech, Maviglio said.

""How would they regulate Sutter Brown?"" he said, referring to Gov. Jerry Brown's corgi, who has a Twitter account that was actively tweeting support last year for Proposition 30, a ballot measure approved by voters that raised taxes. The governor's office won't say who is operating the account.

But some campaign consultants say the practice of paying people to post blogs favorable to their issue is growing.

Paid for blog posts

Gale Kaufman, one of California's top campaign consultants for Democrats, said she has run campaigns that have paid people to post favorable blogs about issues or candidates.

""It's becoming more common to employ the use of blogs,"" Kaufman said. ""It's everything from every once in a while to an ongoing relationship with a campaign.""

She said bloggers that her firm hires for campaign work disclose that they are working on behalf of a campaign, though she doesn't know what bloggers for other campaigns do. She added that she looks for bloggers with an established reputation and following.

Kaufman said she would prefer a regulation that requires people to disclose that they are being paid, rather than have it listed later in campaign filing statements that are becoming increasingly complex.

The state's political watchdog commission requires campaigns and candidates to make five filings, including two before a primary election and two before a general election, in which information about paid Internet communication would appear. A final filing is due six months after a general election.

Some bloggers make a point of not accepting money from campaigns, but do run campaign ads on their websites. Such advertisements are regulated and reported in campaign filings.

Jon Fleischman, who runs the popular conservative FlashReport blog, said every invoice he sends to advertisers includes a bold disclaimer that their payments have no influence on the content of the site.

He said the regulation wouldn't affect him, but that he worries about someday being required to be part of the campaign reporting process.

""My biggest concern is the slippery slope they are going down"" that could discourage citizen engagement in politics, Fleischman said.

Good-government advocates who push for increased transparency said they aren't sure whether the regulation is necessary.

Phillip Ung, a policy advocate for California Common Cause, said voters want to know who funds television and radio ads, but they aren't clamoring to know the source of online communications.

""Will it benefit disclosures and honesty in campaigns? Yes, but it probably is not a priority for voters,"" he said.

Ung said his organization is aware of only ""isolated cases"" of the problem, but nothing widespread.

Public unaware?

For Ravel, the political watchdog commission's chairwoman, the proposed reporting requirements would provide answers about the extent of campaign-funded online communication and would show regulators whether they need more disclosure.

Political insiders may know it's a common practice, she said, but the public does not.

""Maybe everybody in Sacramento knows it, but other people wouldn't necessarily know,"" she said. ""I think it's an important factor for people to consider"" when they're reading an online post and ""thinking it's an individual's individual thoughts,"" Ravel said.","2013-07-13 18:56:00","1","69.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","12.0","0.0","161.0","158.0","0.0","238.0","0.0","14.0","0","938","76.83","71.76","6.35","39.08","20.84","30.06","83.80","45.42","11.19","4.69","0.43","0.11","0.00","2.56","1.60","6.50","7.36","12.05","8.74","2.24","5.44","2.03","17.70","5.01","1.92","2.45","0.75","2.03","3.41","2.03","1.28","0.21","0.11","0.32","12.58","0.00","0.00","1.39","1.17","15.57","3.62","1.92","2.67","2.77","0.96","4.48","4.16","1.17","2.88","0.11","0.21","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.11","10.55","1.39","1.49","6.72","0.64","0.64","4.69","9.91","0.96","8.53","1.49","3.73","2.45","7.78","2.77","0.00","2.24","0.00","0.00","0.43","0.00","0.32","0.11","0.00","0.00","17.70","4.80","5.86","0.11","0.00","0.43","0.00","0.75","2.99","2.77","0.00","0.00","4833","8.41","22.41860465116279","1487","935","44","49.86","13.5","11.6","14.16","14.7","220","17.666666666666668","19.931764705882355","415","20.93","4","0.44","0","35","6","84","1","106","70","6","1","19","154","72","1","80","0","0","48","9","18","2","0","1","24","1","45","42","24","22","28","39","10","10","0","6"

Homelessness. Crime. Muni.

They're typically the top responses when San Francisco residents are asked by pollsters to name their biggest gripe about city life. But in today's era of skyrocketing rents and home prices, the sheer cost of living here ranks as the No. 1 concern.

So finds a new survey fittingly titled ""The San Francisco Survey,"" conducted earlier this month and paid for by the Committee on Jobs, a moderate-to-conservative (by local standards, of course) political advocacy group with sway at City Hall.

The poll was e-mailed to a random sampling of registered city voters, 553 of whom completed it in either English or Chinese. Asked to name the most important problem facing the city, 22 percent said cost of living. Homelessness came in second at 15 percent. Crime and public transportation each garnered 6 percent.

Demonstrating that City Hall's focus doesn't always align with voters' concerns, some of the biggest issues under the dome these days - taxes, immigration and development - notched only 1 percent apiece.

When asked a slightly different question - to name the most important problem facing your family - 32 percent said cost-of-living, again the most frequent response. Economy and jobs were named by 11 percent, placing second.

Still, the vast majority of respondents said San Francisco is ""a good place to live,"" and ""the place I consider my long-term home."" Even if that does mean giving your right arm as a security deposit on your new digs. (That's a metaphor; we haven't seen that demand on Craigslist - yet.)

Ruth Bernstein of EMC Research helped conduct the poll and said she was somewhat surprised that cost-of-living was named so frequently as the top concern since other quality-of-life issues are almost always named more often in similar polls.

""But people still want to live in San Francisco,"" she said. ""They love it, and they think it's worth it.""

P.S. Good news for Mayor Ed Lee. Fifty-two percent of respondents said they have a somewhat or strongly favorable view of him.

Bad news for the Board of Supervisors: Nobody knows who they are. Only Board President David Chiu and Supervisor Scott Wiener had more people express an opinion of their job performance than say they had no opinion. (Chiu ranked 36 percent favorable and 18 percent unfavorable; Wiener ranked 31 percent favorable and 20 percent unfavorable.)

Bargain books: Call it ""the running of the bookworms.""

San Francisco's 49th annual Big Book Sale, billed as the largest event of its kind on the West Coast, opens to the public at 10 a.m. Wednesday. More than 500,000 books, CDs and DVDs will be sold for $3 or less at Fort Mason Center's Festival Pavilion through Sunday.

""It's just a wonderful treasure hunt of titles covering all subject fields,"" said Marcia Schneider, the former interim executive director of the Friends of the San Francisco Public Library, which runs the book sale. ""Right before the doors open, people are lined up all the way to the next pier.""

All proceeds go toward education programs that promote literacy for children, teens and adults.

Schneider said some people are known to bring their own price scanners and fill up shopping carts with the most valuable books to resell on eBay or even in other countries, but others are just looking for a good deal on a hidden treasure.

Mysteries are always a popular genre at the book sale, but Schneider predicted that it may be a good place this year for readers to finally get their hands on a copy of the much buzzed-about erotic romance series ""50 Shades of Grey.""

""I haven't read them, but I don't think they're particularly well-written,"" Schneider said. ""I suspect a lot of people will be shedding their copies.""

(10-01) 14:13 PDT San Francisco -- For the second night in a row, Ian Schneider and Rodney Hampton are staking out the back of a Bayview warehouse from inside a graffiti-covered van with a plastic curtain covering the driver's side window. Equipped with a low-light video camera, Red Bull energy drinks and podcasts of ""This American Life"" to pass the time, their mission is to find whoever has been abandoning piles of trash at the corner of Fitch Street and Quesada Avenue.

They're not out to catch the one person getting rid of an old mattress that no one on Craigslist would take, though city officials say that's a problem, too. The targets for these stings are hauling companies and contractors illegally dumping hazardous waste by the truckload to avoid the cost of disposing of it legally.

Just like the night before, the sun rises and Schneider and Hampton have nothing to report to the undercover police officers waiting nearby. But this is only the first week of several planned sting operations across the Bayview.

""It's like fishing,"" said Schneider, who works in community programs for the Department of Public Works. ""Sometimes you cast your line and don't catch anything, and sometimes you get a whopper.""

Illegal dumping is a problem throughout the Bay Area, and in San Francisco it costs the city $4 million a year. Last year, Public Works collected almost 20,000 tons of illegally dumped items.

'A plague out here'

The agency fielded 22,114 requests from residents to clean up illegal dumping in 2012, and the Bayview sees the worst of it.

Hampton is a Public Works legal dumping specialist who grew up in the Bayview. The stakeout Thursday night was at the location of one of Hampton's worst memories on the job - unzipping a suitcase to find a dead dog.

""It's like a plague out here, and we need to stop it immediately,"" he said.

Public Works Director Mohammed Nuru said illegal dumpers often leave behind construction materials containing asbestos, broken glass or toxic cans of paint.

""We're seeing a very regular pattern of someone dumping huge amounts of material at certain locations,"" Nuru said. ""This is a truck that pulls up on a dark street or some dead end where there's no people and offloads.""

Hotspot monitoring

Thanks to a $300,000 grant from the California Integrated Waste Management Board, the city is now monitoring 25 hotspots of illegal dumping in the Bayview. ""Hopefully, the time of the illegal act coincides with the timing of our sting,"" Nuru said.

Supervisor Malia Cohen, who represents the Bayview, said she gets complaints every day about illegal dumping. As she spoke to a reporter in her office, one of her aides answered a phone call from a Bayview resident reporting cans of paint and other garbage thrown away on Lathrop Avenue, a dead-end street.

""There are very few issues that I take on that everyone in District 10 agrees upon,"" Cohen said. ""Going after illegal dumping is one of them.""

In 2011, Cohen sponsored legislation to clarify the definition of debris and allow the city to sue illegal dumpers and recover cleanup costs. She hopes the stings will send a strong message to anyone involved in illegal dumping, which carries a fine of as much as $1,000.

""We are going after this aggressively,"" she said. ""We're watching you, and we will catch you and prosecute you.""

But finding and prosecuting illegal dumpers has been difficult. Only a handful of companies have been punished because most make sure they don't toss anything with an address that could lead back to them.

Prosecution not easy

City Attorney Dennis Herrera sued a trucking company and a roofing service in 2011 for allegedly repeatedly dumping asbestos-contaminated debris in Bayview-Hunters Point, costing the city $60,000 to remove. The case against the roofing company remains under an injunction and the trucking company was dismissed as a defendant. In August, the district attorney's office charged 61-year-old Eusebio Castillo of San Francisco with dumping 23 containers of oil and paint in the Bayview.

""They're very hard to catch; they're very sophisticated,"" Nuru said of illegal dumpers. ""They're very familiar with the area and they know what they're doing is wrong, so they do everything they can to not be identified.""

While the city waits to see if the stings work, the Department of Public Works has taken other steps to address the problem. Some of the cleanup costs have been shifted to the city's waste collector - under the new garbage contract, Recology will now respond to all reports of illegal dumping made to the city's 311 hot line, while Public Works will continue to do regular sweeps. The contract also allocates funds to hire Public Works outreach employees to educate residents and businesses about keeping San Francisco clean, including the laws about illegal dumping.

""We don't encourage neighbors to get into a fight or be confrontational, but they should take pictures if they can or notify police,"" Cohen said. ""It's about communicating the message that we will not tolerate illegal dumping.""","2013-09-30 18:16:00","1","62.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","19.0","0.0","199.0","198.0","0.0","377.0","0.0","14.0","0","1155","97.70","73.63","37.24","1.59","20.62","26.32","74.63","42.34","5.63","2.68","0.09","0.69","0.52","0.61","0.78","2.94","10.39","15.50","4.85","2.86","4.16","0.87","10.22","3.03","1.39","0.69","4.68","1.30","5.97","1.47","4.50","0.09","0.52","0.17","7.53","0.00","0.09","0.52","0.09","5.37","0.78","0.43","1.13","1.99","0.61","1.47","3.29","1.82","1.13","0.26","0.78","0.00","0.69","0.00","0.09","6.58","1.21","1.47","2.16","0.69","1.13","1.82","7.19","0.87","18.44","4.42","9.87","4.33","4.42","0.35","0.87","0.87","0.09","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.75","5.37","4.94","0.52","0.09","0.00","0.00","1.39","2.60","1.90","0.17","0.78","5390","7.42","23.03921568627451","1662","1137","54","58.52","12.3","10.3","11.55","12.5","197","7.0","17.37051890941073","490","20.84","13","0.42","0","36","51","131","1","149","70","1","3","10","167","182","1","61","0","0","38","5","37","1","1","4","34","0","37","21","41","18","28","36","4","4","0","1"

Photo: Sarah Rice, Special To The Chronicle Maya Wolpert visits SusieCakes on a TaskRabbit job in San Francisco...

When you hire one of TaskRabbit's 15,000 workers to pick up your clothes from the dry cleaner, you pay the company, and the company pays the person you hired. Does that make TaskRabbit a money transmitter that needs state licenses to move payments around?

The San Francisco company says no and that no regulators have come calling. TaskRabbit wants to settle the question, before the issue turns into a headache, by removing itself from moving money entirely.

This week it became the first client of a new service from Chicago payments company Braintree that handles all sides of a deal: collecting money from buyers, routing it to sellers (or TaskRabbits, in the company argot), and forwarding TaskRabbit its fee.

""If a third party stands in between party A and party B who are transacting with one another, then that third party can be exposed to money transfer licensing"" laws, said Bill Ready, chief executive of 200-employee Braintree.

Make payments faster

TaskRabbit already uses Braintree to collect money from buyers' credit cards, and Ready said the new product won't cost more than its normal fee, which starts at 2.9 percent plus 30 cents per transaction. TaskRabbit will now be able to send payments in one to two days instead of three to five days.

The Braintree in Chicago is one of several startups, including Stripe and Dwolla, processing payments for online and mobile transactions. More than $10 billion from 40 million consumers flows through Braintree annually, Ready says. Its clients include some of the well-known peer-to-peer marketplaces sometimes called sharing economy businesses, such as vacation rental site Airbnb and car service app Uber.

Consumer protection

Money transmitters are regulated to protect consumers from fraud and losses. Many of the venture-backed ""sharing"" marketplace startups have already tangled with regulators over whether it's legal to rent apartments as if they were hotel rooms or turn private cars into taxis.

The industry's playbook has been to plow ahead even when business models seem to break the rules. That's what PayPal did over a decade ago, before it got the necessary licenses to move money around.

States are watching peer-to-peer companies, but most aren't trying to shut them down for lack of a money transfer license, says Deborah Bortner, director of consumer services at Washington state's financial regulator.

""We also have broad authority to say, 'Gosh, that may technically meet our money transmission laws, but is this where we want to use our energy?' "" she said. ""We've tried to deal with them in a sensitive way, so we don't just go out and pull out our guns and start shooting.""

Companies like TaskRabbit use vendors to accept and make payments, so all the better if they can pick one that pre-empts a potential hassle with regulators. Braintree's new offering, called Marketplace, will also take care of the 1099 tax forms the IRS wants TaskRabbit to send to people who earn more than $600 from the site in a year.

""We're not in the 1099 processing business, nor do we want to be,"" said TaskRabbit's marketing chief, Jamie Viggiano.

If regulators ask TaskRabbit to show how it's handling payments, it's covered. Said Braintree's Ready, ""We're in a great position to make sure those issues are taken care of before they become issues.""","2013-08-16 16:34:00","1","51.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","159.0","158.0","0.0","229.0","0.0","12.0","0","579","91.38","78.66","17.41","79.33","23.16","24.87","83.59","41.62","7.94","3.45","0.00","1.73","0.69","0.17","0.86","4.49","6.04","15.89","5.53","2.94","5.70","1.21","15.37","4.66","2.76","1.55","3.97","2.07","3.63","3.28","0.35","0.17","0.00","0.17","9.50","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","8.46","0.86","1.90","1.73","2.42","0.86","2.76","2.25","0.52","1.55","0.17","1.90","1.38","0.35","0.00","0.17","10.02","2.94","2.07","3.80","1.21","0.86","3.28","11.23","1.73","13.64","3.28","5.53","5.18","10.36","1.21","0.69","8.46","0.00","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.31","4.32","5.87","0.35","0.00","0.35","0.00","1.38","2.07","3.28","0.35","0.35","2799","8.06","23.88","824","571","25","65.25","11.9","9.8","12.89","14.2","119","8.4","19.456252189141857","340","22.32","3","0.41","0","18","21","42","0","68","29","4","1","5","87","56","0","51","1","0","23","7","16","1","0","5","28","0","35","19","15","10","22","21","5","3","0","4"

Expanding the sharing economy has been a tricky business.

When just a few people rent out their spare bedrooms or charge fellow commuters for lifts to work, they're unlikely to attract scrutiny from regulators, even if they technically break the law. The more widely an activity spreads, the more attention government will pay. By last year, Airbnb listed one rental for about every six hotel rooms in New York City, and some hosts have predictably landed in trouble.

A new nonprofit wants to channel the collective voice of Airbnb hosts, RelayRides drivers, TaskRabbits, and the like. Peers hopes to spread the sharing business and protect it from regulation.

It's not representing the companies, but rather their individual users, says Executive Director Natalie Foster, who previously co-founded progressive advocacy group Rebuild the Dream and worked for Barack Obama's presidential campaign.

""Peers is an organization of, by and for the participants in the sharing economy,"" she told reporters on a conference call.

That doesn't mean the companies aren't involved. Nearly two dozen of them have signed up as ""partners"" to market Peers to their users. Foster says Peers doesn't get money from the sharing businesses, though. Funding comes from members, foundations and sympathetic individuals, but for now the group won't say who the donors are.

And while Foster says Peers will push for ""smart regulation,"" the goal is to help members organize themselves. ""We're not a lobbying organization,"" she said.

Fans of sharing services talk idealistically of how people make meaningful human connections while meeting Airbnb travelers or rideshare passengers. Sharing lets communities become more self-reliant and reduce consumption and waste, they say.

""Despite cultural and economic differences, the common motivation that people talk about for using sharing economy services is empowerment,"" said Rachel Botsman, author of ""What's Mine Is Yours: How Collaborative Consumption Is Changing the Way We Live,"" who was also on the call.

That may be true. But as exemplified by a service called EatWith, a company that helps cooks turn their homes into restaurants, sharing is a bit of a misnomer when money's changing hands and people are selling services or renting assets. Outside of the TED-talk circuit, that's called commerce.

Laws written largely for commerce involving businesses may not be appropriate for the peer-to-peer transactions in the sharing marketplaces. Squaring the new ways people do business with the old regulations is a process that will play out over the next few years, city by city.

Last week, just as Peers was making its announcement, California's Public Utilities Commission was rolling out a whole host of regulations for car- and ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber.

Keeping an arm's length from sharing-marketplace companies may make Peers members more effective advocates for their cause. The family renting out a guest room on Airbnb is a far more sympathetic voice than the company itself, which was reportedly valued at $2.5 billion in October.

Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists are rushing to be the next Airbnb for fill-in-the-blank. (Boats? Parking spaces? Dogs?) Sharing, it seems, is becoming a big business. And no one has more at stake in keeping regulation manageable than the companies that broker transactions between peers.","2013-08-03 16:11:00","1","49.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","10.0","0.0","150.0","148.0","0.0","211.0","0.0","12.0","0","545","90.87","85.22","20.07","86.29","17.58","28.07","83.67","42.20","6.06","2.94","0.18","0.55","0.18","0.37","1.65","3.12","8.62","13.21","7.52","2.57","6.06","1.47","15.78","4.95","2.57","1.65","1.28","2.57","4.22","3.85","0.37","0.00","0.18","0.00","14.50","0.18","0.92","0.37","0.18","8.81","1.65","2.20","1.10","2.20","0.37","3.12","2.02","0.00","1.65","0.37","0.73","0.18","0.18","0.00","0.37","10.28","5.50","1.10","3.49","0.37","0.37","2.57","10.09","1.83","12.48","2.20","6.61","3.30","10.83","1.47","1.65","4.77","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.90","5.14","5.87","0.18","0.00","0.55","0.00","2.02","2.20","2.39","0.37","0.18","2786","8.5","18.032258064516128","835","535","29","52.8","12.7","10.5","14.33","13.5","134","8.9","19.378691588785045","320","17.03","2","0.42","0","21","6","49","0","61","36","2","0","6","83","46","4","59","0","0","13","6","20","4","0","5","10","0","21","11","26","10","19","27","7","4","0","3"

Bay Area tech and social media companies are engaged in an arms race to see who can offer the most - and most unusual - benefits to employees.

While most Americans would be happy to get a job with health coverage, tech workers are being wooed with napping stations, unlimited vacation, free housekeeping and errand-running, yoga classes, on-site doctors and masseuses, and gourmet cafeterias.

Tech companies ""don't want to hear about health care, 401(k), life insurance. Those are commodity benefits,"" says Vincent Antonelli, a senior benefits consultant with Towers Watson.

Social Print Studio of San Francisco is a good example of the modern startup. Along with health care, but no 401(k) yet, it offers unlimited vacation, napping boxes, and a fully equipped jam room where its 20 employees and their friends can record a song or video. There is a wall of exotic taxidermy animals; employees are encouraged, but not required, to choose one that best represents their spirit.

The company, which lets customers print photos off Facebook, Instagram and other social media, once brought in classical musicians to serenade the staff. Another time, it filled a bathtub with beer. Co-founder George Sylvain calls the 6,000-square-foot office ""a creative playpen.""

Redwood City's Evernote, a maker of productivity apps that employs about 330 people, pays a service to clean employees' houses (excluding windows) and provides catered snacks and lunches, unlimited paid time off, a $1,000 vacation subsidy if an employee takes a week off work, gym membership reimbursement, and a $250-per-month electric vehicle subsidy. This is in addition to medical, dental and vision coverage, life insurance and a 401(k).

In its early days, San Francisco's Udemy, a marketplace for online courses, took the company on a working vacation or ""workation"" in Antalya, Turkey. ""We did some work but also rented a boat and went out on the Mediterranean Sea,"" says Dinesh Thiru, the San Francisco firm's vice president of marketing.

Eventbrite, also in San Francisco, offers a treadmill desk (max speed 2 miles per hour) and a kitchen stocked with a Vitamix blender, fresh fruit, almond milk, hummus, Greek yogurt, flaxseed and kombucha.

Though billed as perks, many of these benefits help the company as much as they help employees.

Vacation unlimited?

Take unlimited vacation, a startup staple in the Bay Area.

Companies are not required to offer paid vacation, but if they do, it becomes a liability. In most states, companies can require employees to take vacation within a certain period or forfeit it.

California, however, does not permit use-it-or-lose it policies; paid vacation is treated like wages. Companies can limit how many vacation hours an employee can accumulate, but when an employee departs, all accrued vacation must be paid out.

""At startups, if people have paid time off and are working a ton and the company gets acquired, that is a bunch of money that has to be paid out,"" says Brian Helmick, founder of Algentis, which handles human resources for tech companies.

But if a company offers unlimited vacation, it could really mean no vacation.

Such policies ""benefit employees in that they are not limited to what they have accrued. It benefits employers in that when employees depart there is not a big payout obligation,"" says Felicia Reid, an employment lawyer at Hirschfeld Kraemer.

This theory, however, has never been tested in California courts. Employees who were promised unlimited vacation but never took any potentially could argue they are entitled to something, says Erika Frank, general counsel with the California Chamber of Commerce.

In the Bay Area, 60 to 80 percent of startups offer unlimited vacation, Helmick says. Most companies that offer it don't know how much vacation employees actually take because they don't track it.

Automattic, the San Francisco company behind Wordpress.com, is one of the few that does. It has 209 employees in 30 countries. ""We encourage people to take at least five weeks a year,"" says Lori McLeese, the firm's human resources lead. ""Europeans take a little bit more. Americans take a little less.""

Netflix stopped tracking employee vacations in 2004. With about 2,200 employees, it is one of the largest companies that offers such a policy.

""You can take as much vacation as you like, but if you were to never show up at work, your employment won't last,"" spokesman Joris Evers says. ""It's about freedom and responsibility and treating people like adults.""

Twitter, which has about 2,300 employees, offers unlimited vacation to exempt employees only.

Most large companies don't offer open-ended unlimited vacation because it puts too much responsibility on managers to police it, Antonelli said.

Free food

Benefits consultant Towers Watson surveyed 20 large tech companies about their perks this year and found that the most popular, and most valued by employees, was free or subsidized meals.

The idea behind free food ""is to keep people at work, to have social time and to interact,"" says Leslie Caccamese, director of research and marketing with the Great Place to Work Institute, which ranks workplaces. Technology makes it possible to work from home, ""but companies realize that great ideas come when people collaborate.""

Crazy perks were common in Silicon Valley in the late 1990s but faded after the dot-com crash.

Then came Google. Flush with cash and needing hordes of people, it offered an enviable lineup of benefits that now includes gourmet food and 22 weeks of paid maternity leave plus $500 in ""baby bonding bucks"" for new parents.

As people left Google to start new companies, they brought some of those ideas with them. Competing companies had to up their ante too, Helmick says.

Evernote spokeswoman Ronda Scott says her company is not using its unique benefits to lure workers. ""It's about giving people the tools to get their jobs done and be most effective at the office,"" she says.

At Social Print Studio, the culture was a big draw for Brad Rocheleau, director of special products. At his previous job, with an environmental consulting firm in Washington, D.C., ""I was the youngest by over a decade. For me to be fully happy, I had to develop human relationships with people at work. I also wanted to work with more relevant technology.""

For now, such perks are rare outside California. ""I guarantee you there are no napping boxes at IBM,"" says Peter Cappelli, management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

Antonelli, however, says he has ""a very non-tech company with an online division in the Bay Area"" that is recruiting tech workers and ""trying to get this division up to speed"" benefits-wise. ""We are seeing it bleed into mainstream industries this way.""

Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford, says these benefits come and go.

""As soon as there is an economic downturn, all of this stuff will go away in less than a heartbeat,"" he says.","2013-10-26 15:28:00","1","77.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","45.0","0.0","348.0","354.0","0.0","730.0","0.0","15.0","0","2318","96.83","66.85","22.78","75.42","22.50","25.58","73.21","35.12","4.87","1.98","0.22","0.17","0.22","0.82","0.56","2.89","6.95","14.41","3.28","2.11","4.75","0.82","8.76","4.92","2.16","0.65","5.18","1.81","3.19","2.93","0.26","0.00","0.04","0.13","6.95","0.13","0.04","0.65","0.22","5.48","0.56","1.38","0.60","1.34","0.39","1.94","4.01","2.76","1.04","0.09","3.84","0.39","1.51","0.00","1.98","7.33","1.55","1.47","3.11","1.73","0.13","2.46","5.82","0.22","15.23","0.73","9.45","5.05","9.15","2.20","1.68","1.60","0.65","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.30","0.13","0.00","0.00","22.74","5.05","11.00","0.78","0.09","0.04","0.00","1.04","2.07","0.99","1.47","0.22","11172","7.01","28.14457831325301","3513","2289","105","57.81","13.6","10.6","12.71","13.8","332","11.625","16.521660113586723","704","22.42","19","0.35","0","70","117","179","0","281","137","5","10","11","345","500","5","162","1","0","50","22","51","7","3","7","48","0","46","45","35","37","46","90","13","3","0","6"

The flap in the business community about San Francisco Supervisor David Chiu's proposal to require more workplace flexibility provoked San Francisco Chamber of Commerce Vice President Jim Lazarus to tell The Chronicle the idea was ""beyond unbelievable."" Perhaps relevant lessons can be learned from the pioneering and very successful family-friendly policies instituted across all 10 University of California campuses. They weren't ""unbelievable."" They strengthened the university, making it the beacon that other universities now are imitating.

It is not easy to change a culture; you can't succeed without strong support from the top and fathers' buy-in - but ultimately the effort pays off in terms of job satisfaction, recruitment and retention.

The university-wide Family Friendly initiatives were launched in 2006. At the time, I was the dean of the graduate division at UC Berkeley and our research team was engaged in a major project, ""Do Babies Matter?"" to find out why women received about half of our doctoral degrees but only a quarter of our tenure-track positions.

The first round of research clearly showed that babies matter a lot, particularly in the early, childbearing career years. Those years typically correspond with the young academic's years - usually four to seven years - as an assistant professor. At the end of this trial, the university decides whether to grant tenure for life or dismissal. Married women with children were much less likely to obtain a tenure-track job, and those who did, particularly in the sciences, were less likely to obtain tenure. Babies were death to a career.

Our survey of all UC faculty revealed that faculty mothers put in an astounding 51 hours of a second shift of caregiving and housework, while still putting in a nearly identical 51 hours with their professional work. But it also revealed that UC already had in place a progressive (for its time) set of family-friendly policies, e.g., stopping the tenure clock during parental leave and using parental leave for both mothers and fathers to obtain a semester's worth of teaching relief (established in 1988), but few used these policies. In fact, only one-quarter of all eligible faculty parents even knew about all the policies. Only one-half of eligible female assistant professors took the relief from teaching and only one-third chose to extend the period of preparation toward tenure for a year for children. Almost no fathers took any of the benefits. The reasons: Among the mothers, many didn't know they existed - the department chairs did not impart this information - and for men and women alike there was a stigma attached to taking advantage of any policy that takes them away from their work.

Armed with this research, we organized a university-wide coalition of deans, chancellors and ultimately two UC presidents, Richard Atkinson and Robert Dynes, and the university Academic Senate, to enact a full slate of workplace reforms in 2006 that decisively included fathers. We promoted it as the ""competitive edge,"" that is, by taking the lead in family-friendly offerings, UC would attract the best and brightest young scholars and retain them against bids from other universities.

The UC Family-Friendly Initiatives include: paid parental leave for childbirth, (paid maternity leave for graduate students), teaching relief for both new mothers and new fathers, more child care facilities, emergency child care for both faculty and graduate students (at some campuses), dual-career hiring policies, stopping the tenure clock for childbirth, and allowing a faculty member to work part time be it for child care, elder care or other family emergencies.

Our follow-up study at UC Berkeley four years later found that these new family-friendly policies and programs were common knowledge, widely supported and widely used. Some 59 percent of new fathers have obtained teaching relief following childbirth compared with 6 percent before 2003. And the proportion of faculty women increased from 24 to 29 percent - not a sea change but a definite step in the right direction. Overall the climate has shifted radically, and there is a positive feeling about the support families are getting. Satisfied workers are not as tempted to leave for another job offer.

The new policies also seem to be paying off in recruiting. UC proudly advertises its family-friendly policies, including dual-career assistance. One of my happiest moments at UC Berkeley occurred when I was introduced to a new faculty member, who did not know of my involvement with the policies. I asked why he and his wife (a dual- career hire) chose UC Berkeley over MIT. ""Because I have heard of its great family-friendly policies, and we are thinking of starting a family soon,"" he replied.

Photo: Brant Ward, The Chronicle California schools struggle to meet federal mandates, but test...

The idea of No Child Left Behind was sound: Make sure that every child is proficient in math and English by 2014.

Yet 12 years after the federal law was passed, few schools are close to meeting that mandate.

Across California, just 14 percent of schools made it to the 2013 target under the law, which called for 89 percent of students to have grade-level skills in language arts and math, according to state results released Thursday.

Few were expected to meet 100 percent proficiency by the end of this school year, said state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson.

While most schools failed to reach the lofty federal goal, many have showed great improvement over the past several years, boosting test scores and graduation rates, which are not acknowledged under No Child Left Behind, he said.

""It is unfortunate that officials in Washington continue to enforce a program they have acknowledged is deeply flawed and that paints too many high-achieving schools with the same broad brush,"" Torlakson said in a statement. ""As an elected official, I'm obliged to comply with the law. But as a teacher, I'll continue to urge Congress and the administration to get to work, change course and replace No Child Left Behind with a workable law that fosters rather than hinders the progress California's schools are making.""

Schools receiving federal Title I funds for low-income students have been subject to sanctions for not meeting the federal targets.

Seven school districts, including San Francisco and Oakland, received waivers to the federal law, suspending many of the law's requirements and sanctions.

The information released Thursday included other measures of school success, including the Academic Performance Index, which ranks schools on a scale of 200 to 1,000 points.

The index offers a more comprehensive indication of whether a school, district, county or the state overall is improving or lagging, based primarily on standardized test scores.

Across California, the statewide API dipped slightly to 789, down two points from last year. The state's target score is 800.

In San Francisco, the API also took a two-point hit, falling to 805. Oakland dropped seven points to 721.

Torlakson noted that many schools have been hit by several years of budget cuts, even as they were starting to implement the new Common Core standards, which alters what topics are taught in schools and in which grades they are taught. The two circumstances likely had an impact on scores, he added.

""Despite the very real challenges of deep budget cuts and the ongoing effort to shift to new, more demanding academic standards, our schools persevered and students made progress,"" Torlakson said.

The state also released results from the California High School Exit Exam, showing an increasing number of students are passing the test by the end of their senior year.

Nearly 96 percent of the class of 2013 - 425,911 students - passed the exam, up half a percentage point over 2012 and a 5.1 percentage point increase since the test was first administered in 2006.

Students must pass the test to graduate from high school.

In just two years, California students, along with millions of their peers across the country, will start taking new computerized standardized tests that require them to write, think, analyze and solve problems - a dramatic departure from the fill-in-the-bubble tests in place for decades.

But schools in the state are nowhere near ready for what education officials say is an overhaul of what is taught and how kids are tested.

The move away from a testing model that relies on memory and a No. 2 pencil would cost an estimated $1 billion to implement in California, state Superintendent Tom Torlakson said Tuesday. That would include the cost to update curriculum, provide teacher training and get more computers in classrooms, and it would require changing some state laws, Torlakson said.

He outlined several recommendations to help get schools ready for the change. They include getting legislators to approve suspending 30 of the grade-level, course-specific standardized tests given to students next year to save money and give schools breathing room to prepare for a new testing system that starts in 2015.

That means, in 2014, only the tests required under federal law would remain, including math, English and science in selected grades, Torlakson suggested.

National standards

Torlakson's recommendations were made with input from a statewide task force that reviewed how to transition to the new tests, which will be based on national academic standards called the Common Core.

The Common Core outlines what children should learn in math and English at each grade level, offering for the first time a common road map for what to teach and when to teach it. Science standards are in process.

More than 40 states, including California, have adopted the new standards and are expected to administer the aligned tests.

The new standards emphasize critical thinking and problem-solving rather than memorization. They feature a wide range of reading materials that include fiction and poetry as well as nonfiction essays, articles and texts.

In 12th grade, a student might be asked to analyze hierarchical relationships in a phrase or Boolean searches based on ""Google Hacks: Tips & Tools for Smarter Searching.""

Or a sixth-grader might ""trace the line of argument in Winston Churchill's 'Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat' address to Parliament and evaluate his specific claims and opinions in the text, distinguishing which claims are supported by facts, reasons and evidence, and which are not,"" according to Common Core sample questions.

Preparing students

The curriculum and testing offer a more creative and effective way to prepare students for life beyond high school, Torlakson said.

""Multiple-choice, fill-in-the-bubble tests alone simply cannot do the job anymore, and it's time for California to move forward with assessments that measure the real-world skills our students need to be ready for a career and for college,"" Torlakson said.

The tests, developed nationally with input from teachers and testing experts, will include questions that will zero in on a student's knowledge as well as fill-in-the-blank and essay questions, graded by humans.

While essay questions might sound less standardized, graders are looking for specific writing skills.

Schools lacking computers will be able to give a written version of the test, but only for a few years, Torlakson said.

In San Francisco, the district is piloting the new curriculum. Still, it will be a challenge to be ready for the new tests in every school by 2015.

""We are already integrating the new standards and piloting the new assessments in some schools and some subject areas,"" said spokeswoman Gentle Blythe. ""However, given the resources we have, it is an enormous challenge to implement something that requires over 3,000 teachers at over 100 schools to make instructional shifts and to implement a whole new form of assessment that can be time and technology intensive.""

Adapted versions of the test are expected to be made available for English language learners, using simpler vocabulary, glossaries or translation into other languages including American Sign Language and Spanish, Torlakson said.

Using the current English-only tests, it's unclear whether students don't know English or don't know, say, fractions.

The new Common Core testing system will start with math and English in spring 2015. Other subjects, including science, would follow later.

Future of exit exam

Torlakson also recommended that the Legislature look at whether the state should eliminate the High School Exit Exam, using the new tests to verify whether students possess the minimum skills needed to graduate - which would also be a less expensive option.

Regardless, the new tests will cost more and, with essay questions, take more time, but it's worth it, Torlakson said.

""The concept is simple but powerful,"" he said. ""If our tests require students to think critically and solve problems to do well on test day, those same skills are much more likely to be taught in our classrooms day in and day out.""

And that's good for business, said David Rattray, senior vice president of Education and Workforce Development at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.

""No employer would measure their own staff based on memorizing the personnel manual or handbook,"" he said.

Khoi Senderowicz needed capital to rehab her run-down rental properties, but her credit was shot from a foreclosure during the housing downturn.

Spurned by banks for a home-equity loan, she turned to ""hard-money,"" high-interest, short-term loans secured by real estate and issued by individuals or small private companies. She borrowed $200,000 as a second mortgage against a duplex she owns in Oakland's Montclair neighborhood that has substantial equity.

""I feel like I can breathe again now,"" she said. ""I had been juggling with nothing.""

Her two-year loan came with a hefty price tag: 12 percent interest - almost triple today's rates - and four points, or $8,000.

Senderowicz and other real estate investors say paying a premium for hard money is worth it for super-quick access to funds. Hard money, despite technically being loans, helped fuel the surge in all-cash offers seen nationwide and in the Bay Area.

""We offer speed with not a lot of paperwork,"" said Glen Goldan, CEO of hard-money lender REprop Financial in Eureka. ""We don't care about your credit, but we want to know how you're going to repay us.""

It works for investors

The biggest users of hard money are individual real estate investors who emerged in force during the downturn to buy, fix and flip foreclosures. Exact numbers on hard-money loans are unknown as there's no requirement to disclose their use. Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, estimates that they're less than 1 percent of the mortgage market. The fact that the vast majority of borrowers are professionals rather than owner-occupants alleviates concerns that hard money is another form of subprime lending.

""The conventional mortgage market has blacklisted (real estate) investors as too high risk because we just came out of a credit crisis where investor loans defaulted at three times the rate of owner-occupied, so everyone's gun-shy,"" Cecala said. ""That's creating an opportunity for hard-money lenders.""

Hard money ""provided real estate investors with much-needed capital so they could purchase and remodel thousands of distressed and older homes throughout the Bay Area these past four years,"" said Mark Hanf, who runs Pacific Private Money, a Novato hard-money lender.

Josh Roofener, who runs Beyond the Horizon Construction in Oakley, said he's been using hard money to buy and rehab foreclosures.

""It's more expensive, but gets you the cash you need in the time frame you need,"" he said. ""I use hard money to make all-cash offers, which are always stronger because people with regular mortgages have to jump through a lot more hoops.""

Worth the price

Senderowicz said she doesn't feel the 12 percent interest was unreasonable.

""Credit cards charge that much interest all the time, but just dole the money out in smaller portions,"" she said. ""And because this is a home loan, I'll get a (tax) write-off on the interest; you don't get that with credit cards.""

People who borrow hard money must have more ""skin in the game"" than conventional borrowers. Usually at least 30 percent of a property's value must come out of their pocket.

Hard-money lenders, who must have a real estate license or a finance lenders' license, don't scrutinize borrowers' assets and financial histories. Still, under today's stricter lending laws, they are supposed to verify income, and, like banks, must provide borrowers with simple disclosures of loan terms and costs. Lenders also get property appraisals to document that there's enough collateral to back a loan. ""Flipper"" borrowers have to show plans for rehabbing a property and local comparable sales to support the eventual price they hope to get, Roofener said.

Many hard-money lenders are individuals who relish the chance to earn 9 percent or more on their funds - and can tolerate the associated risk. Often they go through brokers like Pacific Private Money to arrange deals. Just as with a regular mortgage, hard-money lenders can use the foreclosure process to seize real estate if borrowers default.

Pacific Private Money, in business since 2008, arranges 10 to 15 loans a month, mainly in the Bay Area, and mainly to investors, ranging from $150,000 to $500,000, Hanf said. Most are for 12 months with interest rates from 9 to 11 percent, plus three or four points paid up front.

Immediacy a big plus

Speed - closing a property sale in days - ""is the single biggest reason real estate investor-borrowers use hard money,"" Hanf said. Tarnished credit - many investors lost properties to foreclosure in the downturn - is another strong motivation.

Pacific Private Money charges 0.5 percent to service loans and pockets the points, so, for instance, a loan at 10.5 percent nets the investor a 10 percent return.

A Danville man, who asked not to be identified for financial privacy, said he turned to Pacific Private Money when a last-minute holdup with a conventional mortgage threatened purchase of a new home. His banker steered him toward hard money.

""Initially I was skeptical, but as I looked into it, I was surprised at how efficient a market it was,"" he said. ""I could move much more quickly that way, although I paid a price for it.""

His $900,000 loan came with about 9 percent interest and two points. He'll do a cash-out refinance into a conventional mortgage within months.

And when he does, he plans to take out some extra money and put it to work with Pacific Private Money, becoming a hard-money lender himself.

""It's basic supply and demand; (hard money) is meeting a market need,"" he said.","2013-10-30 15:24:00","1","67.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","31.0","0.0","265.0","270.0","0.0","541.0","0.0","15.0","0","1601","97.58","70.24","9.99","60.10","24.63","24.36","71.14","34.60","5.18","3.25","0.62","0.31","0.37","1.50","0.44","1.94","7.25","14.62","3.37","1.69","3.87","0.50","7.87","5.62","1.75","0.81","5.50","2.31","2.62","2.19","0.37","0.31","0.06","0.06","7.06","0.00","0.12","0.81","0.87","5.12","0.62","1.00","0.94","1.50","0.75","1.31","4.18","1.69","0.94","1.56","1.06","0.12","0.94","0.06","0.00","6.00","0.44","0.81","3.87","0.75","0.31","2.69","4.81","0.56","13.18","1.12","7.37","4.87","4.12","0.31","3.06","9.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.67","4.18","7.93","0.75","0.12","0.00","0.00","2.06","2.25","2.06","1.87","0.44","7715","6.9","25.936507936507937","2353","1570","67","56.18","11.9","11.2","13.12","14.7","209","12.5","16.68484076433121","479","22.63","12","0.35","0","44","101","124","0","199","140","9","4","9","254","278","1","103","1","0","49","13","21","2","0","6","41","0","41","48","30","30","42","27","3","7","0","5"

Does it pay to take a minimum-wage job?

That's the question Don Y. posed after reading my Feb. 14 column on President Obama's proposal to increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $9 by 2015. Nineteen states and some cities have already raised their minimum wage above the federal level. In California it's $8, and in San Francisco it's $10.55.

""The other day at a friend's home a few of us discussed the minimum wage,"" Don writes. ""Someone said, 'With all the freebies available to unemployed people, they would not choose to opt out of those programs and work.' Another person said they could work at that wage level and NOT lose the benefits they now enjoy. I disagreed, and lots of debate followed. Was I wrong, or can they work and retain benefits?""

The answer is yes and no.

The government provides a broad array of safety-net programs to the poor and unemployed, each with its own set of elaborate rules that rival the tax code in their complexity.

Unemployment benefits typically end when you take a full-time job, but you must have worked recently to get them and their duration is limited. In California, the maximum is 73 weeks.

Other benefits that are available only to people with minimal income and assets - such as cash welfare payments, food stamps, Medicaid/Medi-Cal, and housing and child care subsidies - begin phasing out when income increases. How fast they disappear depends on household income, family size and composition, and place of residence.

But taking a job can qualify a person for two tax credits available only to low- and middle-income working people. The earned income tax credit and child tax credit can reduce a low-wage worker's taxes below zero, resulting in a payment from the government that can more than offset payroll taxes and the loss of safety-net benefits.

Welfare reform

Before the mid-1990s, taking a minimum-wage job often would leave a person worse off after factoring in the loss of government aid and work expenses.

""One of the big criticisms of the old welfare system was that work did not pay,"" says Trent Rhorer, executive director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency.

The welfare reform act of 1996 tried to change that in various ways, such as letting states disregard a higher level of earnings before people begin to lose welfare benefits.

Other changes around the same time had an even bigger impact, such as increasing the earned income tax credit and expanding Medicaid and child care subsidies, says Elizabeth Lower-Basch, a senior policy analyst with the Center for Law and Social Policy.

Today, ""you are almost always better going from no work to work,"" she says.

How much better varies widely. In general, able-bodied adults younger than 65 with no children have little to lose from taking a low-wage job. That's because they receive few benefits (other than unemployment, if eligible).

They cannot receive the government's main welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (called CalWORKS in California). They can get food stamps (now called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap) and a small earned income tax credit. In some states, indigent single childless adults can get general assistance payments. In California, these vary by county. San Francisco has the highest - $342 a month, or $422 if the person participates in work-related activities.

Get to work

Families with children are eligible for more benefits.

In California, a family of four with two children younger than 17, no income and few assets could get $762 a month in CalWORKS (cash welfare) and $668 a month in CalFresh (food stamps), Rhorer says.

If Dad got a full-time job at California's minimum wage, he would earn $16,640 a year, or $1,387 a month. The family's welfare payment would be cut to $181 a month and its food stamps would be cut by one-third to one-half depending on its living expenses, Rhorer says. But it would still be ahead by $472 a month (assuming a 50 percent cut in food stamps).

At this income level the family also would retain eligibility for Medi-Cal (California's version of Medicaid) and free child care.

At minimum wage, Dad would not earn enough to pay federal or state income tax, but he would have $1,439 a year in payroll taxes (Social Security, Medicare and state disability) withheld from his paycheck. But when he filed his joint tax return, he could get a $7,236 refund thanks to a $5,236 earned income tax credit and $2,000 in child tax credits.

This refund would more than offset his payroll taxes and loss of benefits, leaving the family at least $11,457 ahead on an annual basis.

Going to work ""is way worth it,"" Rhorer says.

Setting an example

Lady Mineses agrees. The single mother of three teenagers worked for six years as a production manager before she ended up on CalWORKS (about $700 a month) and food stamps (about $600 a month) last year. She had one internship that paid $11 per hour and was on the verge of having her CalWORKS payment reduced before that job ended.

Now she is working in a UCSF clinic through a welfare-to-work training program offered through Jewish Vocational Services, UCSF and the city. The internship pays $15.50 per hour for 32 hours a week. It ends this week, but if she manages to stay on at that wage, she will lose all of her CalWORKS and at least some of her food stamps.

""I'm OK with that. I make more working than staying at home,"" she says. Welfare helps pay the bills, ""but you are never going to move further in your life. You are always penny-pinching.""

A bigger benefit: ""Being on welfare helps me find resources. It led me here,"" she says of her job.

Working also sets a good example for her children. ""It shows them, life isn't easy. Money shouldn't be thrown at you.""

'Twice poverty trap'

Eugene Steuerle, a fellow with the Urban Institute, says, ""Up to about minimum wage, for most families, there are very strong gains from going to work. That's mainly because of the earned income tax credit.""

But for families that are already earning minium wage, earning additional income from overtime or a second job generally comes at a higher cost in terms of higher taxes and lost benefits.

Once a family with two children hits 1.5 to two times the poverty level, the combination of higher taxes and lost benefits (from universal programs such as welfare, food stamps and Medicaid) can eat up 5o to 66 cents of each additional dollar earned.

Steuerle calls this the ""twice poverty trap.""

The complexity of antipoverty programs makes it hard for beneficiaries and policymakers to understand exactly how an increase in wages would affect a person's financial well-being. But one thing is sure: For minimum-wage workers who are receiving government benefits, an increase in the minimum wage reduces safety-net outlays. That's one point often missed in the minimum wage debate.","2013-02-25 18:57:00","1","88.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","23.0","0.0","225.0","222.0","0.0","433.0","0.0","15.0","0","1568","93.66","70.62","18.23","54.59","19.36","22.58","81.44","37.12","6.44","3.70","0.57","0.06","0.57","1.66","0.83","2.74","6.89","13.14","4.59","2.30","4.91","0.89","11.29","4.85","3.44","0.57","4.91","1.91","4.46","3.00","1.47","0.00","0.06","0.89","8.67","0.77","0.06","2.10","0.64","7.02","0.64","1.40","1.40","1.85","0.51","2.42","2.04","1.02","0.96","0.06","2.61","0.06","1.91","0.00","0.64","12.50","0.89","3.95","5.55","2.61","0.96","2.81","7.84","0.45","14.99","1.85","8.55","5.17","16.01","0.57","1.02","6.95","0.06","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.06","0.00","22.26","5.29","6.95","0.57","0.00","0.13","0.00","1.72","1.91","1.47","2.68","1.53","7469","7.09","20.93421052631579","2380","1537","84","61.36","12.2","9.2","12.59","12.0","248","13.0","15.774131424853614","555","19.13","24","0.37","0","56","74","130","0","185","118","15","4","23","280","209","6","104","1","1","54","16","41","7","0","5","30","0","51","35","37","13","32","47","7","3","0","6"

In August 2006, the California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to allow AT&T and other companies that provided local telephone service to raise prices at will.

Then-Commissioner Rachelle Chong, a Republican, credited as the driving force behind the deregulation plan, argued that growing competition from Internet phone service and cell phones would keep prices low.

""By the end of the 2010, these rate caps will no longer be necessary,"" Chong said when the new rules were being phased in. ""The market will be so competitive it will discipline prices.""

Too bad it didn't work out that way.

Since fall 2006, AT&T's price for flat-rate landline phone service has leaped 115 percent, from $10.69 per month to $23, according to information from the commission. The monthly price for measured service, which charges a fixed rate for a limited number of calls, has soared 222 percent - from $5.70 to $18.35.

Call-waiting charges popped almost 180 percent. Anonymous call rejection costs nearly quadrupled. Even flat-rate prices for the LifeLine Program basic service, discounted for California's low-income households, have risen 28 percent.

AT&T's price increases far outstripped those of its smaller landline competitors. Verizon's flat-rate service climbed only 18 percent during that period, while SureWest and Frontier increased charges by about 6 percent.

Lower rates

That gap is due in part to the fact that AT&T started with far lower rates before deregulation, which has been attributed to its efficiencies of scale compared with rivals when rates were capped in the mid-1990s. But its prices are now the highest among the four competitors for basic residential service, by anywhere from $2 to $6 per month, according to PUC data.

The commission doesn't break out total numbers of landlines by company, but AT&T and Verizon together controlled 97 percent of the total market, according to a 2009 report.

It's difficult to think of other consumer goods or services that have more than doubled in price during the last six years. U.S. median household income has actually moved in the opposite direction. It stood at $50,054 in 2011, down 8.1 percent since 2007, according to the Census Bureau.

""My belief is that AT&T is essentially harvesting,"" said Dane Jasper, chief executive of Sonic.net, a competing broadband Internet service in Santa Rosa that tosses in domestic phone service for free. ""They jack up the rate by a pretty egregious amount ... because if people leave, well, where are they going? AT&T mobile phone service in at least half the cases.

""So they're happy to have them leave or happy to have them stay,"" he said.

Legacy business

Maybe more so the former, though. AT&T has made it clear it wants to get out of the copper line business altogether, announcing plans in November to decommission the aging system as it builds out more profitable broadband and wireless services.

The company has asked the Federal Communications Commission to drop rules requiring it to support the legacy networks. Problem being: As of late 2009, about 24 percent of California households still relied solely on landlines.

AT&T spokesman Lane Kasselman stressed that the company's rates are competitive with the industry, and that it offers a variety of affordable packages, including a new monthly plan for $19.99.

""Californians have more choices than ever before in communications services, and our pricing has changed to fit the marketplace,"" he said. ""Californians have a variety of choices for telephone service including wireless and (Internet calling), but AT&T wireline service remains an affordable option with service available for less than a dollar a day - and for low-income consumers for as little a 12 cents a day.""

Chong, an appointee of former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to the commission, didn't earn a second term. But she landed on her feet, serving as vice president of government affairs in California for Comcast, another company with occasional business before regulators, until some point last year.

Chong didn't immediately respond to inquiries through Comcast, the California Emerging Technology Fund, where she serves on a panel of experts, or over Twitter.

Chong wasn't the only one predicting that the invisible hand of capitalism would keep things in check for consumers.

The free market faithful on the opinion pages of the Orange County Register and Wall Street Journal applauded the 2006 move too, with the former writing: ""Companies can charge what they want, but unless buyers are willing to pay that price, prices won't go up. Usually, competitive pressures force improvements in quality and lower prices as companies do whatever they can to lure new customers.""

The Institute for Policy Innovation, a Texas free market think tank, went further in a news release after the vote: ""Californians could be on their way to paying less for phone service as well as enjoying new services and better products.""

Wrong again

Do these deregulation zealots get tired of being wrong all the time? Or embarrassed?

Remember how the partial deregulation of California's energy markets brought rolling blackouts, soaring wholesale prices and the market manipulations of Enron? Remember how the dismantling of the Glass-Steagall Act and other banking rules delivered credit default swaps, rampant mortgage fraud and the near collapse of the global economy?

Not everyone made a wrong call on phone deregulation, of course. The consumer advocacy groups that the Orange County Register painted as Chicken Littles for predicting ""prices will go through the roof"" turned out to be spot on.

In fact, history was on their side even then. In 2006, some were strenuously pointing to Florida, where residential phone prices climbed between 30 and 90 percent after deregulation.

As much as cell phones have offered new options, some feel compelled to stick with landlines for a variety of reasons, including that they're more reliable during emergencies and often cheaper, said Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.

""The commission gave up its authority under the theory that consumers could vote with their feet and the market was competitive,"" she said. ""But in reality most consumers are stuck with AT&T and stuck with these higher prices.""","2013-01-17 22:29:00","1","71.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","15.0","0.0","175.0","174.0","0.0","321.0","0.0","15.0","0","1104","96.73","61.07","38.79","27.28","20.83","25.82","76.09","41.94","5.62","1.54","0.09","0.09","0.00","0.54","0.82","4.08","6.97","18.03","5.16","3.17","4.98","0.72","8.97","6.97","4.08","1.00","3.99","3.08","3.26","1.63","1.54","0.27","0.09","0.63","5.89","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.18","8.06","1.00","1.72","0.72","1.90","1.00","2.36","2.90","0.82","1.90","0.18","0.45","0.27","0.18","0.00","0.00","6.16","0.54","1.81","3.71","0.54","0.54","3.44","4.71","1.54","17.12","2.08","9.78","5.43","7.16","0.09","0.63","5.25","0.18","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.18","0.00","18.48","4.80","5.98","0.36","0.00","0.45","0.00","1.00","2.08","1.36","0.18","2.26","5407","8.12","22.959183673469386","1647","1078","56","60.35","12.3","9.6","13.29","13.0","241","10.5","18.66248608534323","544","21.14","33","0.42","0","28","47","91","0","158","75","11","3","11","189","138","6","84","2","0","22","9","40","3","0","6","28","0","29","38","25","23","25","21","5","1","0","7"

An analysis of Twitter's latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission reveals that the value of the Mid-Market payroll tax break that San Francisco granted the company in 2011 will run far higher than earlier estimates.

The city could forgo an additional $34 million in revenue just from stock grants that can be exercised and sold after the company's initial public offering, expected in the next few weeks, according to a rough calculation done in partnership with Jim McHale, a certified public accountant who operates namesake San Francisco firm James J. McHale, CPA.

That's on top of the $22 million estimate produced several years ago in an analysis for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, while the payroll tax issue was under debate. That prediction didn't include the larger impact of a possible stock offering, examining only the effect from employee salaries, said Fred Brousseau, principal at Harvey Rose Associates, a budget analysis firm under contract with the supervisors.

""Too much information wasn't available at the time,"" he said. ""It really would have been taking a shot in the dark.""

But Twitter's most recent SEC filing filled in some critical blanks, allowing at least a back-of-the-envelope estimate that pushes the total past $56 million. The company has 42.7 million outstanding stock options, with a weighted-average exercise price of $1.84 per share. It provided employees an additional 85.7 million shares of restricted stock units.

The city previously treated both as taxable compensation at 1.5 percent - and still would do so in some circumstances.

In November, voters approved a shift from the payroll tax to a gross receipts tax, which will be phased in beginning next year. But the city previously granted a partial exemption on payroll tax for companies that located in the Mid-Market district, a bid to keep fast-growing companies like Twitter.

The 2011 tax break let companies cap payroll taxes at the amount they were paying when they finalized the agreement for any six years in an eight-year period.

Twitter, which plans to go public on the New York Stock Exchange, has set its stock offering at between $17 and $20 per share. If all of its executives and employees unloaded their options and restricted stock units at the midpoint of $18.50, they would make $2.3 billion (after subtracting what they'd have to pay to buy some of those shares at the option price). That would add up to $34 million in lost tax revenue.

Twitter also has tens of millions of shares reserved ""to be issued under equity compensation plans.""

There are some critical caveats to these estimates. Obviously not all employees will unload all their shares at the $18.50 price, and they certainly won't all do so at the same time. Many will hold onto their shares for years, potentially beyond the remaining life (any four of the next six years) of the tax deal.

We also only know the average exercise price of those tens of millions of options. The actual prices will vary, altering the total impact.

Finally, as with any offering, the stock price could also decline after it begins trading, as Facebook's shares did. And employees generally won't be able to sell their shares for months, until the SEC lockup period ends.

But observers believe that Twitter is being conservative in the pricing of the shares. If the price climbs significantly above $18.50 per share, the impact of the tax break could rise far higher.

Rep. Steve Stockman has fired two congressional staffers after disclosures that both made prohibited contributions to his campaign.

The incident is the latest in a string of controversial episodes that have dogged Stockman's political campaigns over the past two decades.

The Clear Lake Repub­lican's campaign for Congress in Texas' 36th District has been notified of potential problems with its campaign finance filings in 2012 and 2013 approximately a dozen times, including apparently misreported donations, late or missing filings of required reports, and inaccuracies in certain filings.

Both this year and in the 1990s, his campaigns were investigated for issues relating to campaign materials made to look like newspapers. While the earlier complaints resulted in a settlement with the Federal Election Commission and a civil penalty, the most recent complaint was dismissed without enforcement action, the FEC announced Friday.

Stockman spokesman Donny Ferguson told the Chronicle Thursday that staffers Jason Posey and Thomas Dodd had been terminated. Posey had worked with Stockman since the mid-1990s, and was his 2013 campaign treasurer.

In April 2013, Posey filed a report that falsely attributed three donations totaling $7,500 to a relative, Donnie Posey, in Mississippi, and another three, also totaling $7,500, to Dodd's mother. Then last month, Posey filed an amended report disclosing that he and Dodd actually had made the contributions originally attributed to their respective relatives, FEC records show.

Congressional staffers are prohibited by federal law and House ethics rules from contributing to their own employers' campaigns.

On Oct. 16, the amended report submitted by Posey explained that the six contributions were wrongly ""attributed to family member(s) as a result of miscommunication with accounting about joint charitable donations and other family/personal funds."" Three days later, Posey reported that the contributions from him and Dodd ""have been refunded in full as the corrections may have deemed them not permissible.""

In an email, Ferguson said Posey and Dodd were fired around the same time that Posey filed the amended reports. Neither Posey nor Dodd responded to requests for comment.

In a press release Friday, Stockman said: ""Two weeks ago I found out two staffers in my congressional office made contributions not allowed under FEC rules. As soon as I found out, the contributions were refunded and corrective action taken. We obeyed the law. That's the story. Or more correctly, the lack of a story.""

Paul S. Ryan, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, D.C., reviewed the reports on the $15,000 filed by Posey as treasurer. He said that Posey's explanation of the mistakes seems hard to believe given that some of the donations involved Posey's own contributions and that Posey signed off on the FEC report attributing those contribution to his relative.

""Given these circumstances - you have the treasurer of the committee misreporting initially the source of the contributions - it seems pretty clear evidence to me that this was a … violation,"" Ryan said.

Under federal law, it's illegal to attribute contributions to ""straw donors"" - people other than the actual donors - or to knowingly file federal campaign reports with false information.

A spokesman for the FEC, Christian Hilland, said he could not comment on whether the misreported contributions or other irregularities cited in FEC letters were under investigation or whether the campaign adequately addressed those letters.

Stockman did not respond to repeated requests over the past two weeks for an interview about his personal and campaign finances. In his press release, Stockman called this article an ""ambush story"" that will ""misrepresent a recent error made by staffers and make personal attacks against me.""

Stockman served a two-year stint in Congress from 1995-97 and returned to Congress this year after winning a runoff election for a newly created seat in the 36th District, which crosses nine counties and runs from southeast Harris County, through Baytown to Beaumont, and beyond to the Louisiana state line.

When Stockman ran for Congress in 2012, he mass-mailed voters on stationery adorned with the dome of the U.S. Capitol.

One piece dated July 27, 2012 said: ""Dear Patriot, I'm the most conservative Congressman in Texas. I'm Congressman Steve Stockman.""

Stockman was not a congressman at that time. He'd been out of office for nearly 15 years.

A Michigan native who says he became a born-again Christian after a period of homelessness, Stockman has frequently courted publicity via Facebook and Twitter in his current term.

He's championed his support for curbing federal enforcement in states that have legalized marijuana and invited flamboyant anti-Obama and pro-gun rocker Ted Nugent to accompany him to the State of the Union address.

Questions about Stockman's campaign-finance practices stretch back to 1990, when his campaign received $82,138 in printing and consulting services from Pol-Serv, a political organization affiliated with an Ohio direct-marketing company called the Suarez Corp., according to a letter from the company that is part of the documents in a related FEC investigation from the 1990s.

Pol-Serv had advertised nationwide for candidates to run against a Democratic incumbent congressman in Texas. A Suarez Corp. official noted to the FEC in 1992 that the Stockman campaign was ""unable to effect any meaningful reduction in its debts."" The FEC subsequently investigated a complaint filed by the Harris County Democratic Party that alleged the long-unpaid debt had become an illegal corporate campaign contribution.

Stockman's campaign claimed it owed only about $44,226, and the FEC dropped the matter after the campaign stated it would repay the debt.

It's unclear in subsequent campaign reports whether it did so.

Agreed to pay penalty

Back in the 1990s, Stockman used his house in Friendswood as his campaign headquarters. At that time, a pro-Stockman newspaper called the Southeast Texas Times and a side business run by Stockman's campaign manager, Chris Cupit, and Posey, were a focus of a FEC investigation.

In a June 1998 conciliation agreement with the FEC, the Stockman campaign admitted it violated election laws:

1 By failing to report expenses for producing the Southeast Texas Times and another similar publication as in-kind contributions to the campaign;

1 By failing to correctly label the ""newspapers"" as campaign materials;

1 And by not reporting details on how the $470,000 paid to Political Won Stop, a consulting firm run by Posey and Cupit, was spent.

The Stockman campaign committee agreed to pay a $40,000 civil penalty.

In its 2012 campaign, Stockman's campaign distributed a series of ""newspapers"" that were both mailed and hand- delivered to about 400,000 voters in the 36th congressional district.

On Friday, the FEC disclosed that it had investigated a 2012 complaint that alleged those mailings weren't properly disclosed as campaign publications.

Some had small stamped labels indicating that they were mailed out by ""Friends of Congressman Steve Stockman."" Others were stamped only with the Stockman campaign's post office box.

Holly Takach, who worked as treasurer for her husband Stephen Takach, Stockman's runoff opponent and a Baytown financial consultant, complained to the FEC in 2012 that the Stockman campaign failed to adequately disclose the ""newspapers"" as campaign publications, according to records that the FEC released on its website.

In April 2013, the FEC's general counsel recommended that the commission find ""reason to believe"" that the Stockman campaign and Ferguson, who served as Stockman's 2012 treasurer prior to Posey, violated campaign disclosure rules by failing to properly label two ""news­papers"" called Southeast Texas Courier and Times Free Press as campaign advertising. The general counsel recommended the commission take further action.

However, in September, the board refused to adopt the recommendation on a party-line vote of three Republicans against and two Democrats for, and the file was closed.

Another news­paper distributed by the campaign, called the Texas Republican News, was adorned with a red Republican elephant and billed as ""Fair and Balanced - the most trusted political news in Texas,"" FEC records show.

Copies of four newspapers reviewed by the Houston Chronicle contain unsigned articles, photos and headlines on newsprint that either praise Stockman or slam an opponent. Several articles claimed that Stockman's Republican opponents and their supporters were the subject of ongoing state or federal investigations.

Larry Noble, a former FEC official who participated in investigating Stockman's campaign in the 1990s and is now director of the nonprofit Americans for Campaign Reform, thinks the FEC is a broken agency.

""Right now the FEC is going through a phase where it's basically dysfunctional,"" referring to sharp political divisions on the commission. ""I think it's an ineffective agency and it has to be rethought and reconstituted.""

Familiar complaints

In 2012 and 2013, Stockman used Ferguson and Posey as campaign treasurers. Both were legally responsible for filing accurate financial reports to the FEC and for overseeing campaign bank accounts.

Both men also have worked for Stockman as paid political consultants, campaign workers and congressional employees.

Posey became his current campaign treasurer in January 2013, and subsequently amended nearly all of the 2012 campaign filings.

For much of 2012, Stockman's campaign treasurer was Ferguson, another longtime Stockman associate and his current congressional spokesman. While he served as Stockman's treasurer, Ferguson simultaneously worked for the campaign as a paid political consultant, which is allowed under FEC rules.

From 2010 through 2012, Ferguson, a Beaumont native and unsuccessful candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates, also served as executive director and treasurer of a nonprofit called the American Tradition Partnership and of a related PAC, both based in Colorado.

The ATP has been the subject of complaints filed with the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, involving publication of allegedly improperly labeled political fliers used to support candidates it favored, Montana records show.

At least twice, the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices found the organization violated ""Montana's campaign practices laws.""

In the latest decision, issued Oct. 16, the commissioner found that the organization had violated Montana ""campaign practice laws"" by providing illegal corporate contributions through ""attack letters"" it published during a 2010 campaign. Ferguson worked at ATP in 2010 but it's unclear from the decision whether he was involved in the conduct at issue.

In an email, Ferguson said that the Montana investigations are politically motivated. ""Montana is the only state in the country that allows a political appointee of the governor to single-handedly issue rulings on political campaign matters. The state has already paid out damages to one conservative group falsely smeared by the Office of Political Practices,"" he said.

The Stockman campaign and its employees' recent attacks on opponents through fliers and newspapers had a familiar ring to Richard Ellison, a Kerrville-based attorney who sued Stockman and others for producing inflammatory fliers that were alleged to have defamed Rep. John Culberson, R-Houston.

In 2000, Stockman was working as a political consultant when Culberson sued him, his client and another political group for libel. The lawsuit filed by Ellison alleged Stockman used day laborers to pass out fliers on car windshields that falsely accused Culberson of being a disbarred attorney and tax evader.

Stockman never responded to the lawsuit, and the claims against him were ultimately dropped.

A Harris County judge approved a temporary injunction against two other defendants in the lawsuit to stop distribution of the fliers, finding that Culberson ""has demonstrated that [those two] defendants … conspired to defame him (Culberson) with these false accusations."" Eventually, the case against those two defendants was settled when a political group supporting Culberson's opponent agreed to publicly apologize.

There was no financial penalty for any of those involved in producing the fliers. Federal campaign records show Stockman and his company were paid $250,000 for consulting work and expenses for his work in that congressional campaign, though it's unclear from the record whether his work related to those fliers.

In response to an FEC inquiry, based on a complaint that Ellison filed, Stockman and his client denied that they were involved in distributing the fliers.

The FEC closed the case in 2001, finding that the matter was ""less significant relative to other matters pending before the Commission.""","2013-11-03 09:39:00","0","103.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","25.0","0.0","227.0","225.0","0.0","435.0","0.0","15.0","0","2388","97.05","65.16","16.34","25.77","22.32","32.20","72.03","40.08","6.53","2.22","0.34","0.04","0.04","1.55","0.25","4.31","9.13","15.08","4.23","2.14","4.77","0.59","8.63","4.06","2.26","0.75","4.65","1.76","3.14","1.51","1.51","0.00","0.34","0.34","6.78","0.21","0.13","0.08","1.59","6.53","1.76","1.47","0.21","1.17","0.42","2.05","2.14","1.21","0.59","0.34","0.46","0.21","0.21","0.04","0.00","10.05","1.05","1.51","7.37","0.17","0.75","5.40","3.10","0.29","12.73","0.75","7.41","4.56","8.08","0.29","0.25","2.47","0.08","0.00","0.08","0.00","0.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.83","4.94","5.36","0.38","0.08","0.00","0.00","1.34","2.35","1.51","0.34","0.54","12389","7.93","25.229166666666668","3790","2345","104","48.64","14.2","12.1","15.03","15.8","472","8.6","19.051172707889126","804","22.55","48","0.4","0","75","120","251","0","323","155","4","3","4","323","359","7","162","0","0","46","28","68","2","3","8","63","0","37","159","43","95","24","31","17","5","0","6"

Rep. Steve Stockman's re-election campaign sent a flurry of amended campaign finance reports to the Federal Election Commission Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, FEC records show. Among the reports were two more changes to the description of three controversial donations made by the campaign treasurer himself, Jason Posey.

Originally, the campaign attributed the donations to Posey's relative. Then, last month, Posey amended the campaign's report to say he had given the total of $7,500 himself. At the time of the donation, Posey served as ""director of special projects"" in Stockman's congressional office.

Federal campaign finance laws and House ethics rules prohibit staffers from contributing to the campaigns of the members of Congress for whom they work.

Stockman announced on Nov. 1 that he had caught the ""error"" and had taken ""corrective action,"" including refunding the donations. Stockman's spokesman also told the Chronicle that day that Posey and another staffer who had also given $7,500 to the campaign, Thomas Dodd, had been ""terminated."" Dodd's three contributions were also initially attributed to a relative, his mother.

Tuesday afternoon, Posey filed an amendment attributing his donations to a previously unreported entity, ""Posey International."" Then, at 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, Posey amended the filing yet again, once again listing himself as the donor.

He referred to Posey International as his employer in the reports, despite the fact he worked for Stockman's congressional office at the time of the donations. He listed his position with the entity as ""owner.""

The address given for Posey International in the first Tuesday filing matches Posey's own Alexandria address provided on other filings.

Stockman's campaign sent 11 new reports to the FEC between 3:30 p.m. Tuesday and 12:14 a.m. Wednesday, making changes to all of the reports he previously filed this year. Other changes in the 11 amended reports include added memos stating the $15,000 donated from Dodd and Posey was refunded in full.

Despite apparently having been dismissed from Stockman's House staff, Posey is still listed as the campaign's treasurer on all the amended filings. The latest filings bear Posey's electronic signature.

Had Posey been replaced as treasurer when he was fired from Stockman's congressional office, the campaign would have had ten days to report the change to the FEC, according to FEC rules. The campaign has submitted no such report.

Stockman has not responded to multiple requests for comment about Posey's status with the campaign and other aspects of his campaign finances. Posey did not respond to questions about Posey International emailed to him on Wednesday.

If the job of Oakland police chief were a popularity contest, Sean Whent probably wouldn't stand much of a chance against the 32 other applicants for the job.

The interim chief used to work in internal affairs, never a popular position among the rank and file, who generally don't like their supposed brothers-in-arms looking over their shoulders. He isn't much of a political player either, at least in terms of slapping backs and shaking hands.

But Whent, appointed initially as a placeholder, is at least making a small case for himself as the top cop.

Overall, crime is just about where it was a year ago, but the 85 homicides committed in Oakland so far this year represent a 25 percent decrease compared with 2012. That, he said, is a ""positive sign"" that should be considered by Oakland Mayor Jean Quan when she decides among the mass of candidates who met last Friday's deadline to apply for the job.

""It's a good start,"" Whent said. ""As we wind down the year, I think they're (crime statistics) better than they were six months ago.""

It will undoubtedly be a tough sell in a city with one of the nation's highest robbery rates, rampant car theft and a reputation for street violence. There have been more than 2,300 assaults this year.

In fact, a strong argument could be made that the Oakland Police Department has hit an all-time low point.

The trouble began with a U.S. District Court order to appoint a federal overseer with authority over all administrative, organizational and policy changes. By late April, Thomas Frazier, the court-appointed compliance director, began to act on that authority. He forced out former Police Chief Howard Jordan, who retired for medical reasons a week later, and rescinded the promotion of the city's proposed replacement.

City officials then did an about-face, naming Whent, a little-known deputy chief who ran the department's internal affairs division, on an interim basis.

Torrent of robberies

Nobody can argue that Whent hasn't worked hard, focusing first on slowing the torrent of street robberies. In September alone, Oakland police reported 487 robberies, an average of more than 15 a day. In November, there were 314 robberies, a 24 percent decline.

The department restructuring, which divided the city into three area commands, and Operation Ceasefire have also begun to pay dividends, he said.

Since October 2012 - when city officials held their first crime counseling sessions under Operation Ceasefire - police have made contact with 112 known and suspected offenders. In addition to scheduled meetings, program officials have approached at-risk folk in juvenile detention facilities, county jails and hospital emergency rooms, said Reygan Harmon, the project manager.

From those meetings, 56 people have accepted help with things like job training, housing, enrolling in GED classes and addressing motor vehicle violations. Operation Ceasefire is far from foolproof. An additional 23 people who were contacted and declined to participate have since been arrested for crimes - about half of them serious felony offenses, according to city records.

Whent said his crime reduction teams in East Oakland have provided police with vital information used to help predict the likelihood of retaliatory shootings and violent encounters between street groups.

""Those groups have shown us that many of the guys who are shooting each other at night - their day job is robbing people,"" Whent said.

The interim chief nevertheless has his work cut out for him in hyper-political Oakland.

""I don't think any police chief can afford not to be political,"" said Sgt. Barry Donelan, president of the Oakland Police Officers Association, who doesn't appear to be a fan.

Whent's work in internal affairs ""is absolutely a factor in his popularity with the troops, but he displays no affinity for"" fellow officers, Donelan said. ""His challenge is internal: winning hearts and minds of the officers. And he absolutely has not done that.""

Mayor's goals

Oakland Mayor Jean Quan, who is campaigning for a second term, has not given any sign that she might favor Whent. Her priority is to reduce crime and improve the public's confidence in the city's crime-fighting capabilities.

Quan, who appointed Jordan in 2012, complained that all the turmoil essentially took away her opportunity to conduct a national search. She won't get full rein this time, either. As a practical matter, Frazier, the city's compliance director, still has the final say.

""I want somebody who can bring down crime, lead the troops and thirdly, somebody who also knows how to put in the essence of community policing,"" the mayor said.

Whent may not be Quan's hand-picked choice, but if he continues making headway on crime, the mayor's office will have some explaining to do if someone else is chosen for the job.","2013-12-12 18:30:00","1","62.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","153.0","148.0","0.0","218.0","0.0","13.0","0","804","90.08","69.50","24.79","23.81","20.62","26.24","79.60","42.54","8.08","3.61","0.37","0.25","0.00","2.24","0.75","4.48","8.33","13.18","7.34","2.61","4.23","1.74","12.81","4.98","2.49","1.99","2.74","2.61","4.48","2.11","2.24","0.37","1.00","0.25","9.83","0.12","0.37","0.62","1.99","10.57","1.74","2.36","0.87","2.24","1.37","2.86","2.24","0.50","1.37","0.37","1.49","0.75","0.75","0.00","0.00","11.44","1.62","2.61","7.21","1.37","0.62","5.10","7.21","0.87","15.05","1.12","8.46","5.47","7.21","0.12","0.25","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","19.15","5.10","7.34","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.74","1.99","2.61","0.25","0.00","3918","8.42","21.153846153846153","1213","793","40","59.84","12.9","9.8","12.82","12.9","191","12.625","19.554300126103406","446","20.15","6","0.42","0","21","18","81","0","97","59","2","3","9","152","69","0","63","1","0","23","9","31","1","0","5","15","0","26","39","19","21","20","22","2","11","0","4"

In May, Square hired the former U.S. chief trade negotiator, a move that signaled the payment company's growing international ambitions.

Demetrios Marantis is helping the business navigate the complex maze of regulations covering financial services as it expands in Canada and Japan, and looks for opportunities beyond.

But he's also overseeing policy and government relations issues domestically. That includes here in San Francisco, where Square just moved into a sleek and expansive new headquarters a few blocks from City Hall.

Part of that task appears to be underscoring Square's contributions to San Francisco, particularly as antitechie tensions reach a fever pitch.

The ostentatious displays of wealth, skyrocketing rents and gentrification accompanying the industry's boom have left a bad taste in the mouths of many residents. Last month's initial public offering of Twitter - which, like Square, was co-founded by Jack Dorsey - sparked a protest in front of the company's Market Street headquarters designed to highlight the affordability crisis in the city.

Square, which itself could go public as early as next year, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report, no doubt hopes to avoid a similar scene at its new offices a block away.

Marantis says the company has taken note of the brewing backlash and wants to emphasize its commitment to San Francisco and the Mid-Market neighborhood.

Square, which provides credit card readers for mobile devices along with other digital payment tools, has facilitated $1 billion in transactions in San Francisco to date, the company revealed to The Chronicle. More than 100,000 individuals and companies in the city now accept payments with Square, and 95 percent of those are small businesses.

In addition, the company started an employee street-cleaning program that has removed 3,500 pounds of trash since January. It also recently launched a program to encourage more girls and women to move into computer science, hosting classes at its headquarters twice a week.

Marantis discussed these and other issues in an interview that has been edited for space and clarity.

Q: Why did you decide to come to Square from the Obama administration?

A: As acting U.S. trade representative, I tried to help businesses thrive by expanding exports. So coming to Square was a natural fit for me. It works to help small businesses thrive by providing them with solutions to start, run and grow their businesses.

The big lure was that Square is about helping the little guy succeed, and that's important to me.

Q: The credit business is famously complicated and heavily regulated. Can you talk about the challenges you're seeing navigating the process from one country to the next?

A: We operate largely in a regulated space, and I give Square a lot of credit for thinking about the need to have a policy and government relations practice early in its growth, rather than waiting until the inevitable problem comes up before it thought about these issues.

Each country is very different and presents a different series of challenges and opportunities. We face a variety of issues in terms of regulation, in terms of getting licenses and in terms of ensuring compliance with various legal requirements.

As Square looks forward and thinks about its growth, we hope a lot of it takes place overseas.

Q: How much of the regulatory work you're doing - and what sorts - involve the city of San Francisco?

A: There's no major regulatory issue here. But I'm very proud to have the opportunity to host the supervisors and other government representatives in our new space to show our commitment to this part of San Francisco - and to tell the story we can tell about how much Square has facilitated commerce in San Francisco.

We've really crossed a major threshold recently. We have facilitated $1 billion worth of transactions in San Francisco, and over 100,000 merchants and individuals here can now accept payments with Square.

There's a huge commitment from (Square Chief Executive) Jack (Dorsey) on down to this neighborhood. We have this neat program called Clean Streets where employees every Friday go out and clean the streets in the neighborhood.

We want to give back to the community, to be part of the neighborhood, and to experience both the challenges and opportunities of where we're located.

Q: I'm always a little bit dubious about economic impact numbers. When you say $1 billion, it's not like that manifested out of the sky. I think it probably shifted from one place to another; different retailers are now getting it. So what's the real benefit of $1 billion being processed through Square?

A: The direct answer to that is: So many small businesses before the advent of Square were unable to accept credit card payments because of the complexities associated with different fees charged by different cards, and the complexity of pricing and hidden fees.

Three-quarters of the 4 million-plus merchants in the U.S. are new to credit card acceptance. So the fact they're now able to accept credit cards means they're able to accept more transactions, means they're able to grow their businesses faster, means they're able to hire more people.

Q: Given that the topic here is Square's impact on S.F., is the company concerned about the tech backlash? Certainly with Twitter's IPO, there were concerns and complaints about gentrification and shifting culture. Is this something you're concerned about - and something you're trying to counter to some degree?

A: It is a concern, and that's why we as a company are so committed to giving back to the community.

But what's interesting about Square as a company is we are significantly increasing business in San Francisco. The billion dollars that we've processed - that's real for merchants. That makes the contributions Square provides the local community even more acute.

By virtue of the fact that we're committed to San Francisco and by virtue of the type of business we're in, Square really does in a concrete and significant way contribute to the growth of San Francisco's economy.","2013-11-30 18:01:00","1","70.0","20.0","7.0","0.0","15.0","0.0","175.0","174.0","0.0","322.0","0.0","15.0","0","1149","93.64","74.88","32.50","71.52","22.10","26.20","82.25","43.95","7.22","2.96","0.61","1.39","0.61","0.09","0.26","4.26","8.18","16.45","5.92","4.53","5.83","0.26","10.97","6.96","2.96","1.22","3.05","2.18","3.83","3.05","0.61","0.26","0.09","0.00","7.05","0.00","0.52","0.17","0.17","6.96","1.91","0.96","0.70","1.22","1.04","1.48","4.00","3.57","0.26","0.00","1.13","0.52","0.52","0.00","0.09","9.83","2.61","2.26","4.18","0.96","0.52","1.83","9.23","0.35","15.06","1.74","9.49","4.35","9.23","0.26","0.61","4.00","0.00","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.54","4.70","4.79","1.22","0.09","0.52","0.00","1.39","0.00","2.96","0.35","0.52","5660","7.6","23.72","1773","1138","56","50.87","13.5","11.2","12.88","13.2","213","17.0","17.60681898066784","481","20.02","24","0.45","0","44","32","107","0","147","93","4","0","3","176","139","2","77","0","0","44","9","47","2","0","1","45","0","33","27","25","23","38","48","7","3","0","7"

Photo: Patrick Semansky, Associated Press A sign stands outside the National Security Administration (NSA)...

Leading technology companies have presented a unified front in calling for restrictions on U.S. government surveillance, as ongoing spying revelations undermine trust in their products around the globe.

Bombshell stories throughout the summer in the Guardian, the Washington Post and other publications, based on leaks from former security contractor Edward Snowden, uncovered broad and varied digital surveillance programs by the National Security Agency and others. Many sucked up communications and user data handled by major tech companies through legal requests or secret taps on their networks.

The latest disclosure arrived on Monday with news that U.S. and British spy agencies had infiltrated popular online games like World of Warcraft and Second Life. They created their own characters ""to snoop and to try to recruit informers,"" the New York Times reported, citing confidential documents provided by Snowden.

In an open letter to Congress and President Obama published as full-page ads in several major newspapers Monday, the eight prominent tech companies stated: ""This summer's revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government surveillance practices worldwide. The balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual - rights that are enshrined in our Constitution.""

It added: ""We urge the U.S. to take the lead and make reforms that ensure that government surveillance efforts are clearly restricted by law, proportionate to the risks, transparent and subject to independent oversight.""

Powerful teammates

The move by AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Yahoo and Twitter underscores the enormous toll that these disclosures could take on their bottom lines. Foreign citizens who lack privacy protections under U.S. law may choose to forgo the products of these companies, and some nations are moving to block or sidestep American Internet services altogether. Forrester analyst James Staten argued the cost to cloud services alone could reach as high as $180 billion, ""or a 25 percent hit to overall IT service provider revenues"" over the next three years.

The question is whether the combined lobbying strength of some of the biggest and most influential companies in the United States can rein in government spy tactics in a way that public opinion and legislators have failed to do to date.

At a new website, ReformGovernmentSurveillance.com, the companies called for the adoption of a series of specific principles and changes, including codifying ""sensible limitations"" on government's ability to force online companies to turn over user data; stronger checks and balances on the ability of intelligence agencies to demand information, including review by an independent court that hears from critics; allowing companies to disclose ""the number and nature of government demands"" for user information; and creating an international framework governing requests for user data, cutting across the patchwork of often conflicting national rules.

In addition, the companies argued that governments shouldn't restrict access to information outside national borders or require companies to locate their infrastructure or operations locally. That appeared to be a specific reaction to countries such as Germany, where some have called for keeping domestic Internet traffic and data within national boundaries.

Few restrictions

The Snowden leaks have highlighted that the U.S. government has few legal restrictions on monitoring the communications of foreigners and even fewer compunctions about doing so. That apparently includes listening in on European leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Brazil responded to these realizations by announcing plans to sidestep the United States altogether, through construction of a direct, undersea fiber-optic connection between South America and Europe.

Meanwhile, it seems there are many other shoes to drop, as reportedly only 1 percent of Snowden's leaks have been revealed so far.

Companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo were required in many instances to hand over user data when presented with proper legal requests, although the court review process has been widely criticized. But it's clear the NSA was also tapping into networks without disclosure, infiltrating communications links between data centers operated by Yahoo and Google. Some businesses took steps to prevent future government surveillance through this route by encrypting information that passes between data centers.

""The security of users' data is critical, which is why we've invested so much in encryption and fight for transparency around government requests for information,"" Larry Page, chief executive of Google, said in a statement. ""This is undermined by the apparent wholesale collection of data, in secret and without independent oversight, by many governments around the world. It's time for reform and we urge the U.S. government to lead the way.""

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer hit a similar note.

""Recent revelations about government surveillance activities have shaken the trust of our users, and it is time for the United States government to act to restore the confidence of citizens around the world,"" she said in a statement.

Global worries

There's a grave fear in tech circles that these national movements to cut off foreign online services will lead to the balkanization of the Internet, undermining its promise as an open global platform for communications and commerce - a valid fear. But to be clear, the announcement on Monday is as much about money as it is high-minded ideals. On any other day of the week, these companies are hardly privacy champions, particularly Facebook and Google.

It's not so much that an organization is deriving useful information from the bulk collection and analysis of their data - they do that themselves every day for the purpose of targeting ads. The issue is that another organization is doing it and scaring away users in the process.

""The government's comment was, 'Oh, don't worry, basically we're not spying on any Americans,' "" said Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, earlier this year at a TechCrunch conference. ""Oh, wonderful, that's ... really going to inspire confidence in American Internet companies.""

Indeed.

I have no doubt that the technology giants that signed the open letter Monday truly want these changes in place - they would surely reduce the number of government requests for data and simplify the job of complying with those demands. But part of this is just good public relations, a way to distance themselves from the NSA in the minds of consumers. And far broader reforms than what they're proposing are still necessary, as are stronger privacy rules aimed at the private sector.

Regardless of the motives, here's the good news: the eight deep-pocketed companies speaking out for changes are harder for the government to ignore than the civil liberties groups that were calling for digital surveillance restrictions long before Snowden's leaks began.","2013-12-09 16:16:00","1","62.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","161.0","158.0","0.0","236.0","0.0","14.0","0","1110","96.12","67.05","30.43","38.59","27.07","32.34","76.04","42.16","6.22","1.71","0.09","0.54","0.00","0.09","0.99","4.50","7.93","16.76","5.14","3.06","5.41","0.63","8.74","5.50","2.70","0.63","0.81","2.43","4.14","2.43","1.71","0.72","0.54","0.27","6.58","0.00","0.09","0.09","0.00","10.36","2.61","2.07","0.81","2.16","1.53","1.89","1.26","0.45","0.54","0.27","0.45","0.18","0.27","0.00","0.00","10.54","1.71","2.25","5.95","0.81","1.17","2.07","5.86","0.45","14.23","1.53","9.91","2.70","7.84","0.63","0.09","0.54","0.00","0.09","0.45","0.09","0.09","0.09","0.18","0.00","15.77","5.41","5.05","0.36","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.72","1.98","1.71","0.18","0.09","5938","9.06","28.325","1837","1105","48","39.67","15.1","13.4","15.38","16.4","300","7.583333333333334","22.059728506787334","559","25.65","23","0.41","0","42","8","112","0","150","93","3","2","6","165","114","4","131","0","0","20","9","40","1","1","4","36","0","40","29","32","25","28","23","8","2","0","3"

The debate over San Francisco's affordability crisis has, in too many ways, devolved into a bitter backlash against ""techies."" This week we saw protesters blocking a Google bus in the Mission District and last week the industry's workers were treated to more mean-spirited graffiti in the neighborhood.

This column has stressed in the past that aiming a rambling set of resentments at a single class of workers is no substitute for public policy changes that address the underlying issues (no matter how intent some entrepreneurs seem on making themselves look obnoxious, entitled and aloof).

San Francisco wasn't affordable before the tech boom and it won't be affordable after it ends. Indeed, many American cities are becoming more expensive and less diverse, after long-running suburban flight patterns shifted into reverse years ago.

As I wrote in June: ""Short of some radical plan that allots housing units by skill type or bans tech companies, our only option for solving the part of this problem that we can is to make housing more affordable. We can do that in three basic ways: Build more, set aside a greater portion as affordable and protect the existing stock.""

Smart development

San Francisco can and should do all three - any strong city needs affordable homes for its families, teachers, police officers and grocery store clerks. But a report that urban planning organization SPUR will release Thursday underscores a critical supplementary approach - tackling affordability on a regional basis by getting other cities to develop in smarter ways.

The report specifically offers a roadmap for San Jose - a city that was largely laid out in the car-centric postwar era - to create more walkable, sustainable and livable neighborhoods. But the broader message is applicable for cities throughout the Bay Area - and particularly up and down Highway 101.

""Silicon Valley, the most dynamic and innovative economic engine in the world, is not creating great urban places,"" the report states. ""Having grown around the automobile, the valley consists largely of low-slung office parks, surface parking and suburban tract homes. But tastes and values are moving away from strictly suburban lifestyles.""

'Demanding urbanism'

""Today's top firms and top talent are increasingly demanding engaging places, diverse experiences and convenient amenities,"" it adds. ""Simply put, they are demanding urbanism.""

Walkable neighborhoods are built to accommodate people, with public transit, sidewalks, parks and a blend of art museums, bars, bookstores, concert venues, grocery stores and restaurants. Additional houses and a more urban texture could help make San Jose more attractive to the young tech workers (and other types) who at the moment overwhelmingly want to settle in San Francisco, regardless of where their employers are, SPUR argues.

To the degree that workers are drawn to other cities, it relieves the housing and pricing pressures now disproportionately squeezing San Francisco.

The example of Oakland, the third major population center of the Bay Area, is instructive. Its walkable, mixed-use, transit-oriented - and yes, hip - neighborhoods like Rockridge, Temescal and Uptown are absorbing a considerable portion of the San Francisco overflow. That's why rents are rising there, too. (Full disclosure: I'm a Rockridge renter myself.)

Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of SPUR, said San Francisco can do additional things to improve affordability within its borders. That includes boosting the minimum wage, as Mayor Ed Lee is calling for, and making Muni an efficient and affordable transit option for more residents.

And there should be (and are) debates under way on other technology issues that touch on affordability and fairness in the city, further exploring questions like: How much should private buses pay for using Muni stops? Should sharing-economy companies operate under different rules than their traditional rivals? Do successful tech companies deserve tax breaks, or owe more to the community in exchange for them? And do tenants need stronger legal protections amid the growing financial incentives to evict longtime renters?

But, as the SPUR report underlines, San Francisco isn't operating in a vacuum.

""I think it's really important to acknowledge that not all of the solution can come from within San Francisco,"" Metcalf said. ""We need the cities of the Bay Area to be working together on this.""

He is the first to admit that transforming planning mind-sets, much less complete neighborhoods and cities, takes a long time. This is not a quick fix for the current affordability crisis. But then again, no such silver bullet seems to exist.

""We created our current affordability problem over many decades of decisions,"" he said. ""And it will take a long time to dig our way out of the problem.""","2013-12-12 04:01:00","1","56.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","161.0","158.0","0.0","233.0","0.0","13.0","0","784","90.00","58.57","30.01","39.45","20.10","29.21","76.79","40.18","6.63","2.42","0.51","1.02","0.00","0.26","0.64","4.21","7.27","12.37","6.51","2.30","5.61","1.15","10.71","6.76","3.83","0.64","0.89","3.19","3.83","2.30","1.53","0.38","0.64","0.26","5.36","0.13","0.64","0.00","0.26","9.44","1.66","2.17","1.66","1.53","0.77","2.55","1.66","0.38","0.64","0.26","1.15","0.13","0.38","0.00","0.64","10.08","2.68","2.68","3.83","0.89","1.15","1.66","7.78","1.02","15.05","1.66","9.82","3.57","5.36","1.02","2.55","2.81","0.13","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","19.01","4.72","6.25","0.64","0.00","0.51","0.00","1.91","2.55","1.40","1.02","0.00","4040","8.84","20.86842105263158","1249","776","39","51.28","13.4","11.1","14.33","14.2","207","10.4","20.630103092783504","446","19.76","7","0.41","0","37","4","73","0","81","87","6","0","12","120","69","0","78","0","0","20","8","29","8","1","2","18","1","26","13","31","8","25","26","5","1","0","3"

Modesto -- - State regulators have all but taken over an assisted-living facility in Modesto owned by the same people who abandoned 19 residents at a Castro Valley care home.

Officials with the state Department of Social Services Community Care Licensing Division descended upon the Sundial Palms Assisted Living & Memory Care center in Modesto in what department spokesman Michael Weston called a ""highly unusual"" arrangement made in the wake of the Castro Valley scandal.

The state now monitors the facility 24 hours a day and forced the owner, Herminigilda ""Hilda"" Manuel, to hire a Sacramento consultant last week to serve as executive director until the facility is sold to a new owner this month.

Weston said the plan was a response to the Castro Valley incident, where the owners, managers and paid staff members of Valley Springs Manor walked away, stranding 19 residents for some eight days amid a closure order by the state.

In that case, state regulators did little more than document the chaos as management and paid staff members left, leaving behind two unpaid workers - a janitor and a cook who were untrained in caring for the elderly - to take care of the residents.

State steps up

In Modesto, the state is taking a much more active role.

On Wednesday, the sprawling, faded-yellow facility was a hub of activity. There was a new chef, a housekeeping staffer and more caregivers for the 64 residents. Someone was scrubbing the carpets. There was even a nurse who - for the first time, according to residents - was making rounds.

Residential care homes are not required to have medical staff, including nurses, on hand, but residents are supposed to visit the doctor at least once a year. That apparently wasn't happening until last week.

Also new was the visitor check-in. Under former management, visitors could wander in. Now staff members in hospital scrubs bustle in the lobby, insisting that visiting family members fill out a sign-in sheet.

Unlike in Castro Valley, the state never ordered the Modesto facility to close, Weston said, but regulators are in the process of revoking Manuel's license to operate any care facilities and are worried that staffers might strand residents in Modesto the way they did in Castro Valley.

""On paper, I am (the owner's) consultant, but I am working with the state,"" said Evelyn Mendez, the executive director installed by the state late last week.

Mendez and the nurse have focused on retraining staff members, updating medical records and checking in with patients.

""A number of them had maybe not seen a physician in a year,"" Mendez said.

The hospital visits have been a bit complicated, Mendez said, because the wheelchair lift in the facility's bus is broken. Mendez has hired a contractor to transport residents.

No longer hungry

Mary Mosqueda, 88, has lived at the facility for a little more than a year and said she has already noticed a change.

Before last week, most breakfasts consisted of a single piece of bacon, an egg, tea and, on a good day, juice, Mosqueda said.

""The food was terrible - I would bring her food every time I came to visit,"" Mary Hernandez, Mosqueda's niece, said when she visited Wednesday.

That day's breakfast included eggs, mashed potatoes and fruit. For the first time since she'd been there, Mosqueda wasn't hungry at the end of the meal, she said.

""I told them, 'Don't give me so much food, you're just going to throw it away,' "" Mosqueda griped as Hernandez took her out for a haircut.

Hernandez said she was horrified, but not surprised, that Manuel had walked away from the Castro Valley care home.

""That's why I keep checking on my aunt to make sure that doesn't happen"" here, Hernandez said.

Mendez said her assignment is to keep the facility open until a new owner is in place. A deal is pending and could close this month, Mendez said.

""We're redoing the menu and upgrading the food quality,"" Mendez said. ""We're trying to make the changes to put things right.""

'Happy she is at home'

For Robert Law, the changes came too late.

His 88-year-old mother, who grew up in San Francisco, suffers from Alzheimer's, has trouble walking and is blind. Marian Law lived at Sundial Palms for eight years until Sunday, when he moved her to his Patterson (Stanislaus County) home after receiving a call from the facility.

He was told he needed to take his mother to a doctor that day. The call was the last straw. He decided to bring her to his home.

""We would go in and shower my mother two to three times a week and were making sure she was eating right and that sort of thing,"" Law said. ""There was staff there, but they were so busy they didn't do that for her.""

Now Law, 67, and his wife, Joyce, 60, are doing those things at their home.

In a nearby room, Joyce was feeding Marian a sliced apple and a bit of bread. Marian was in a good mood and the two bantered a bit about medicine, the weather and an upcoming visit by great-grandchildren.

""I am just happy that she is at home,"" Law said. ""I have a calmness about it.""","2013-11-06 17:37:00","1","72.0","1.0","7.0","1.0","31.0","0.0","277.0","270.0","0.0","539.0","0.0","14.0","0","1892","97.67","71.95","34.80","64.84","17.52","20.08","74.31","42.18","5.55","3.49","0.58","0.16","0.05","2.06","0.63","2.06","9.57","16.23","6.77","2.59","2.85","0.58","13.64","4.18","3.22","0.58","4.33","1.64","2.64","2.33","0.26","0.05","0.00","0.11","7.61","1.16","0.00","2.33","0.69","4.18","1.16","1.00","0.37","0.53","0.26","0.85","2.75","1.53","1.00","0.11","3.44","0.48","1.90","0.00","1.06","8.67","0.79","0.58","6.13","1.16","0.05","6.92","5.97","0.21","18.50","1.90","9.04","7.66","4.81","0.11","2.17","0.16","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.03","6.61","7.61","0.58","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.00","1.37","1.06","0.63","0.16","8701","6.1","25.13157894736842","2736","1883","99","60.65","12.0","9.5","10.97","11.0","181","10.1","13.444928305894848","478","21.93","10","0.43","0","29","78","188","0","265","76","8","2","5","247","399","7","88","0","0","44","26","44","10","0","23","33","0","31","89","43","68","33","44","4","5","0","4"

Rep. Steve Stockman's congressional campaign has returned $15,000 in donations from two donors who actually did not make the contributions, according to a memo the Stockman election campaign sent to the Federal Election Commission.

An unsigned Stockman campaign memo dated Oct. 19, 2013, states that donations originally identified as coming from relatives of members of Stockman's congressional staff were ""erroneously reported"" and blamed ""miscommunication with accounting about joint charitable donations and other family/personal funds.""

Stockman, a Friends­wood Republican, initially reported in April that the $15,000 came from family members of two congressional staffers working for him. In that original report, the campaign attributed the donations to the mother of Thomas Dodd, a special assistant for Stockman, and to a relative of Jason Posey, Stockman's director of special projects and the campaign's treasurer. Each gave $7,500 on Feb. 21, 2013, according to the now-retracted April quarterly report.

The donations were given in six increments of $2,500, totaling $15,000. By splitting up the donations into those amounts and reporting that the first donation was for the primary election, the second donation was for the runoff and the third was for the general election, the campaign apparently was aiming to stay within the legal limit on contributions from individuals. That limit is $2,600 per person, per election.

Raises legal questions

The identities of the named donors, however, were wrong, the campaign now says, and that the funds actually came from the two staffers themselves, though that source of funding raises other legal questions because the law bars congressional staffers from giving money to the election campaigns of the politicians they work for.

Congressional records show that Stockman has been paying Posey at an annual rate of $58,664 and Dodd at the annual rate of $49,288.

Posey has served as Stockman's campaign treasurer since January 2013, election commission records show. Dodd worked on Stockman's campaign.

The refunds were first reported by the Sunlight Foundation.

Jane Dodd, the original named donor, denied on Oct. 14 giving $7,500 to the Stockman campaign. Donnie Posey, the other originally named donor, could not be reached for comment.

""I never sent any money or knew anything about that at all. ... I didn't do this,"" Jane Dodd told the Chronicle. After the disclosures, she said, her son ""called me ... and said I didn't do anything wrong.""

Donny Ferguson, Stockman's communication director, didn't respond to requests for comment from Dodd and Posey. Stockman has not responded to the Houston Chronicle's written request for an interview, delivered on Oct. 16.

Stockman's campaign has had three different people file reports as campaign treasurers in 2012 and 2013 - including Ferguson and Posey, commission records show.

Repeated requests

The commission has repeatedly requested that the campaign provide additional information about the identities of contributors who gave more than $1,000 and asked the campaign to clarify why it appeared that other contributors gave more than the legal limits, records from 2012 and 2013 show.

"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/California-Democrats-brace-for-low-2014-turnout-5029168.php","California Democrats brace for low 2014 turnout","California Democrats brace for low 2014 turnout Democrats worry base won't be motivated in '14

Just because California Democrats hold every statewide office and a supermajority in the Legislature doesn't mean they're not worried about 2014.

Some Democratic insiders fret that, essentially, life may be too good for the party right now. Their lurking fear: Without a high-profile presidential election or a big-name Republican challenger lined up yet against Gov. Jerry Brown, Democratic voters won't be interested enough to cast ballots in November. If that happens, the GOP could pick off a few seats in the Legislature, wrecking the Democrats' two-thirds majority and damaging Brown's ability to move his agenda.

Adding to Democratic insiders' anxiety is that social and religious conservatives are close to qualifying a ballot measure to overturn a new law that grants rights to transgender students. That could boost GOP turnout. And if the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature health care law, continues to stumble, that could bring a few more Republicans to the polls.

While the rest of California may not tune in to the election until weeks before residents cast ballots, the political class thinks about this kind of stuff now - a year before election day - because this is the time when campaigns are formed, major donors are solicited and ballot measures are circulated.

'Concern out there'

""Definitely I think there's a concern out there,"" said Ben Tulchin, a Democratic pollster in San Francisco who takes regular surveys on statewide and national issues. ""In a low-turnout election, those factors could be enough to shift the balance.""

Turnout among registered voters in California has averaged 73 percent in the past seven presidential elections, going back to 1988. Turnout during the past seven gubernatorial contests - all in nonpresidential years - has averaged 57 percent, according to the secretary of state's office.

""This year is definitely going to offer some turnout challenges to Democrats,"" said Kevin Spillane, a veteran Republican consultant who is not affiliated with any statewide candidates for next year. ""Their voters are not necessarily motivated.""

This month, Democrats got a preview of their 2014 nightmare as they nearly fumbled away a safe Assembly seat and suffered a setback in the San Diego mayor's race, both in low-turnout elections.

In the 45th Assembly District special election race in the San Fernando Valley, well-funded Democrat Matt Dababneh defeated Republican Susan Shelley by just 329 votes. Democrats hold a 2-to-1 advantage in registered voters in the district, but turnout was a mere 10 percent.

San Diego race

And in a special primary election to replace San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, a Democrat who resigned in the wake of sexual harassment allegations, Republican Kevin Faulconer finished first, ahead of three Democratic rivals. He'll take on Democrat David Alvarez in the runoff.

Voter turnout in the primary was 30 percent - much lower than the 50 percent that election officials predicted.

John Burton, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said it was too early to be worried about next year's turnout, and that ""special elections are not like regular elections.""

""The only people who are concerned with low turnout are political reporters and pollsters and some candidates,"" Burton said. ""Nobody else is. Call me on Oct. 15 and we can talk about turnout.""

Steve Maviglio, a veteran Democratic strategist in Sacramento, has heard concerns about low turnout but doesn't share them.

Even if Republicans were able to focus on a few low-turnout legislative and congressional districts next year, California Democrats - backed by public-sector labor organizations - can counter those attacks, Maviglio said.

""Republicans just don't have the ground troops,"" he said.

And he doubts the ballot measure to repeal the transgender-student rights law, even if it does qualify for the ballot, will bring out additional conservative voters.

""I've seen that movie before,"" Maviglio said. ""It doesn't move many additional voters.""

Still, earlier this year, some Democratic strategists were concerned enough about turnout that they talked about putting together a November 2014 ballot measure to raise the state's minimum wage - an idea designed to boost turnout among the Democratic base.

Instead, the Legislature and Brown joined to pass a law to raise the minimum wage to $10 an hour by 2016 from the current $8.

""They (the Legislature) took the deal they had in hand,"" Tulchin said. ""Minimum wage could have increased turnout.""

Wild card

There is a wild card heading into next year: a proposed ballot initiative to curb public employee pension costs that is co-sponsored by San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed.

If it qualifies for the ballot, it could boost election interest among conservatives. However, it could also energize Democrat-friendly labor unions concerned about an existential threat to one of their key benefits.

That's what happened last year on Proposition 32, which would have prohibited unions from using payroll-deducted funds for political purposes. Unions ramped up their political activity and contributed the bulk of the $75 million spent to defeat the initiative, according to Maplight, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes the effect of money on politics.

Union campaign

Unions would probably mount a similar effort if Reed's proposal made it to the ballot, as labor officials estimate there are 4.5 million voters who would either be personally affected by the measure or live in the same household as someone who would be.

""It would heighten the intensity among union voters to come out and vote,"" said Jim Araby, executive director of the 160,000-member United Food and Commercial Workers Western States Council, ""because they'll want to protect the benefits that they've earned.""","2013-12-02 17:58:00","1","68.0","0.0","7.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","153.0","148.0","0.0","220.0","0.0","14.0","0","938","91.26","57.20","12.05","24.08","21.81","29.32","69.72","40.72","6.29","2.03","0.32","0.11","0.00","0.32","1.28","4.26","8.32","12.79","6.93","3.84","4.16","1.39","11.51","4.69","1.49","0.96","3.30","2.35","5.01","2.24","2.35","0.75","0.32","0.96","5.76","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.43","7.57","0.96","1.49","2.03","2.13","0.53","2.35","1.60","0.32","1.17","0.11","0.75","0.21","0.32","0.11","0.11","9.38","1.81","2.03","4.37","1.07","0.75","3.52","6.93","1.28","12.69","1.49","6.72","4.58","5.54","0.32","0.21","1.28","0.11","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.00","18.76","4.58","5.33","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.45","2.99","2.67","0.21","0.32","4774","8.34","22.857142857142858","1436","923","44","50.16","13.3","11.5","14.21","14.6","214","11.9","19.674106175514627","477","20.83","4","0.39","0","22","32","95","0","103","79","2","0","17","151","98","12","60","0","0","23","5","42","1","0","7","31","0","41","39","11","22","26","23","7","7","0","1"

"http://www.mcall.com/business/topworkplaces/mc-patt-white-top-workplaces-20130304-story.html","Prudential Patt, White puts personal touch into real estate","When Roberta Gaines first started with Prudential Patt, White Real Estate 26 years ago, they had a small office in Allentown and a handful of sales agents.

Today, the company has 265 people in five offices and handles more than $500 million in annual real estate transactions in five counties. But Gaines said it still feels like she works for a small, family business.

The second-generation owners, twin brothers Doug and Don Patt, keep in touch with all of their employees and the large group routinely gets together for company potluck picnics, award dinners and other functions.

""No matter how large we get, you always get the feeling that this is a family company,"" she said. ""When I win an award, I get a call or an email from the owners and they remember your birthday.""

The personal touch, as well as investments in technology and adaptations that helped agents succeed in difficult times, made Prudential Patt, White the best workplace among midsize employers in the Lehigh Valley, according to a survey conducted by WorkplaceDynamics on behalf of The Morning Call.

The housing market is emerging from one of the most challenging periods many real estate professionals have experienced in their careers. Consider fewer than 5,000 homes sold in Lehigh and Northampton counties in 2011, the fewest in at least a decade.

In such a climate, it may seem odd to find a real estate agency topping a best places to work list. Thanks to low interest rates, affordable prices and a slowly recovering job market, the housing market is starting to improve.

Employees at Prudential Patt, White said they feel respected and appreciated, even when the market took a turn. The average sales agent has 12 years of experience, and many have been with the company for decades.

""We are a believer that we are as good as our people,"" said Brad Patt, the company's senior vice president who represents the third generation of the family business. ""In order to keep the agents motivated through the challenges we faced in the down market, we talked about real facts about the market and acknowledged that we were in this together and for the long term.""

Beyond the personal touch, the company has technology and marketing tools agents can use. They include up-to-date housing market information so agents can determine the best prices and research competing homes.

The company has also embraced smartphone technology to appeal to today's tech-savvy shoppers.

A prospective homebuyer can send a text message to Prudential Patt, White from their phone when they see a house they like. Global-positioning technology detects the location of the home shopper and sends photos and details about the home to their phone. The system simultaneously alerts the sales agent of interest in the listing. Virtual tours and slide shows are also available to help shoppers with their searches and sellers to market their properties.

""We really want to deliver an ease-of-use technology for the consumer, which is what the consumer wants today and we want the agent to have a system that is automated,"" Brad Patt said.

Investments in technology impressed Mick Seislove, who has been an agent with the company for 13 years.

""I'm sure the profits weren't that great the last couple of years, but they didn't take the tools away from us,"" Seislove said. ""When it was getting tough, we knew we had to step it up. They rolled out some new programs for a high-tech environment. This is an old family business, but they keep up with technology. That was during tough times, they were still investing. A lot of companies didn't do that during tough times.""

Another adaptation to the difficult market was the creation of a short-sales department. Short sales, where the lender agrees to allow a home to be sold for less than what the seller owes on the property, are notoriously difficult and time-consuming. Rather than negotiating with just the buyer and seller, agents have to negotiate with the seller's lender, which often takes weeks or months to respond to offers.

Short sales are an important service to provide since it can keep distressed sellers out of foreclosure proceedings. By creating a specialized department, the company is able to meet its customers' needs without wasting the time of its agents.

But for some employees, the best part about work is the friendly atmosphere. Office administrator Donna Remaly, who has been with the company for 26 years, said she enjoys having caring and supportive co-workers who act as a team. The workplace environment is established by the owners, she said.

""We all get along and we work as a team,"" Remaly said. ""Our principals are very helpful and caring and they are very family-oriented.""

"http://www.mcall.com/business/la-et-st-critics-notebook-cbs-20130806-story.html","CBS, Time Warner Cable dispute is unseemly","CBS, the TV network, and Time Warner, the cable company, are at loggerheads over money. The former, describing itself as ""the most-watched television network with the most popular content in the world,"" would like the latter to pay more than it currently does to carry its shows; the latter thinks the former has set the price too high.

The most visible, or rather invisible, result of the dispute is this: If you live in Los Angeles, New York or Dallas (or one of the other five markets with a station owned by the mothership CBS Corp.) and get your TV through Time Warner, you will have noticed that CBS is missing. (Independently owned stations affiliated with CBS are not affected.) In L.A., at least, Time Warner has tracked other content into the analog and digital channels the network usually occupies (with an occasional news crawl directing the disgruntled viewer to a Time Warner-friendly website).

Showtime, which it also owns, and where ""Dexter"" is in its last season, and the local KCAL, have also gone dark.

PHOTOS: Cable versus broadcast ratings

It all seems tiresome and unseemly to me: ""A plague on both their houses"" is the phrase that pops to mind.

Press releases to the contrary, neither party occupies any sort of moral high ground; they are just a couple of warring corporations, dinosaurs with their teeth in each other's necks, too evenly matched to do one another lasting harm but trampling the underbrush while they tangle.

Both parties are large and privileged entities that have been allowed to control a great portion of the cultural landscape without giving back all that much. (CBS does not own that spectrum it acts like it owns; you do.) Still, much of their dispute is taking place in public, in counteroffensive news releases and open letters, each side attempting to create sympathy for itself and to put pressure on its opponent.

Time Warner calls CBS' behavior ""abhorrent"" and ""beyond the pale,"" and offers to carry the network as a premium channel, like HBO. CBS, telling the world its ratings have been little affected by the blackout, calls the proposal ""a sham, a public relations vehicle designed to distract from the fact that Time Warner Cable is not negotiating in good faith.""

Though it is conceivable that they will never come to an agreement, it is more likely that they will, in some way allowing each side to be able to claim a measure of victory. Possibly your cable bill will be a little higher.

We tend to think of television — which we are born with and grow up watching and, unless we are very clever, can hardly avoid — as an inalienable human right, like liberty and cheap gas. Some will be angry at being so denied. But August is as slow as things ever get on television, and most viewers will find solutions according to their actual desire to find a solution.

September, when the new shows come on, will be a different story. But it's hard to believe that CBS would withhold them from the two cities most responsible for their existence.

New shows aside, this won't even be an issue for me until the return of ""The Good Wife,"" the only CBS show I actively follow (though I certainly respect others). Of course, I am also in a position, professionally, to see whatever I need to see — until this piece is published, anyway.

But we all have options.

You could, for one thing, switch to satellite television, which would not guarantee a future free from such disputes, but would get you through this one. You can keep up with ""Under the Dome"" on Amazon — CBS, while barring Time Warner customers from viewing episodes on its own site, provides an Amazon link — free, if you're a Prime subscriber, and for the price of a cup of coffee if you're not.

For ""Dexter,"" you could be patient and wait for the DVDs to arrive. For sports, you could go to a sports bar. You could buy an antenna for your television and watch CBS over the air, the way Grandma used to.

Or you could just watch that much less television and see how that feels.

"http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/la-fg-wn-syria-us-chemical-weapons-20130821-story.html","White House seeks U.N. probe of alleged Syria chemical weapons attack","WASHINGTON -- The White House is asking a team of United Nations inspectors to investigate allegations that hundreds of civilians were killed in a chemical weapons attack in Syria on Wednesday.

In a statement, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the United States is “deeply concerned” by reports of the deadly attack outside the Syrian capital, Damascus, and is working to gather information.

“The United States strongly condemns any and all use of chemical weapons. Those responsible for the use of chemical weapons must be held accountable,” Earnest said.

Activists accused the Syrian government of firing rockets with poisonous gas on homes early Wednesday, killing civilians in their sleep. Images posted online showed bodies wrapped in white sheets lined up on the ground. Women and children appeared to be among the dead. The images on the Web could not be independently verified.

The official Syrian news agency called the reports “untrue.”

A team of U.N. inspectors is already in Syria to investigate previous charges of chemical weapons use in the more than 2-year-old civil war between the government of President Bashar Assad and opposition forces. However, before it could investigate the latest allegations, the U.N. would likely have to take some official action to expand the team's role.

The U.N. inspectors are charged with documenting and confirming allegations of attacks, not determining responsibility.

The White House said Wednesday it believed the U.N. team was prepared to investigate the latest claim “and that is consistent with its purpose and mandate.”

“For the U.N.’s efforts to be credible, they must have immediate access to witnesses and affected individuals, and have the ability to examine and collect physical evidence without any interference or manipulation from the Syrian government,” Earnest said. “If the Syrian government has nothing to hide and is truly committed to an impartial and credible investigation of chemical weapons use in Syria, it will facilitate the U.N. team’s immediate and unfettered access to this site.”

Earnest said the White House had called on the U.N. Security Council to review the allegations.

“The United States urges all Syrian parties, including the government and opposition, to provide immediate access to any and all sites of importance to the investigation and to ensure security for the U.N. investigative team,” Earnest said.

"http://www.mcall.com/news/local/obamacare/mc-obamacare-insurance-costs-lower-than-expected-20130718-story.html","Obama admin: Obamacare insurance costs lower than expected","WASHINGTON - Hoping to gain the high ground in an escalating war of words over Obamacare, the U.S. administration on Thursday forecast sharply lower than expected insurance costs for consumers and small businesses in new online state healthcare exchanges.

A report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said data from 10 states and the District of Columbia shows preliminary 2014 premiums on the lowest-cost mid-range “silver” plans in those marketplaces to be 18 percent lower on average than earlier administration and congressional estimates.

Rates for businesses with fewer than 50 employees that purchase small-group coverage through exchanges could also be 18 percent lower than what the same plans would cost without President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare reform law, based on data from six states, HHS said.

The report was released in conjunction with a speech by Obama on how healthcare reform is already benefiting consumers. It represents the administration's latest bid to counter Republican allegations that consumers and businesses will see sharply higher costs from the exchanges than the individual insurance plans already on the market.

The new exchanges are slated to begin enrolling as many as 7 million uninsured Americans for 2014 on Oct. 1 in federally subsidized health plans ranging in quality from platinum, with the highest premiums, to bronze, with the lowest.

“Today's report shows that the Affordable Care Act is working to increase transparency and competition among health insurance plans and drive premiums down,” Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement accompanying the report.

The actual rates consumers see could be lower than current estimates, the HHS report concluded, saying that rate reviews and negotiations under way in the District of Columbia, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have already reduced prospective costs announced in the spring.

But it was not clear whether the lower rates contained in the report would be reflected nationwide. The report's authors cautioned that some states could see costs closer to earlier projections.

The exchanges represent the centerpiece of Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and their success could depend on the cost of so-called silver plans, which are expected to attract the largest number of enrollees.

The events come a day after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives called in a symbolic vote for a delay of the reform law's individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health coverage in 2014 or pay a penalty. The House measure is expected to go nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

A leading insurance group, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, issued a statement late on Wednesday saying that such a delay, if enacted without other insurance market changes, would lead to skyrocketing costs for consumers.

The HHS report said prospective premiums in the 10 states studied appear to be affordable for younger adults, including men, whose participation is vital to the success of the exchanges and healthcare reform overall. Younger healthy people who tend to be cheaper to insure are needed to compensate for older and sicker consumers who are expected to enroll in droves.

In Los Angeles, which has the largest number of uninsured people in the country, HHS said the lowest-cost silver plan for a 25-year-old individual will cost $174 per month without subsidies and $34 per month for an individual whose income is $17,235. A catastrophic plan, which mainly covers major medical costs, will cost $117 per month for an individual.

The 10 states examined in the HHS report are California, Colorado, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.","2013-07-18 11:57:00","0","20.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","43.0","21.0","0.0","72.0","4.0","14.0","0","603","98.49","55.93","24.79","20.73","30.15","28.52","76.29","38.64","3.32","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.17","3.15","9.45","15.59","5.14","1.33","4.31","0.83","9.62","7.96","5.31","1.82","3.15","1.49","2.99","1.33","1.66","0.00","0.17","1.33","4.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.17","8.13","0.83","1.33","2.32","1.49","0.50","2.49","3.32","1.66","1.33","0.33","1.49","0.00","1.33","0.17","0.00","8.46","0.66","2.49","5.47","0.50","0.33","2.65","5.47","2.99","15.92","1.16","9.95","4.81","7.63","0.00","0.33","7.13","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.60","3.98","5.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.49","0.66","1.00","0.33","0.66","3116","8.99","32.1578947368421","949","594","22","44.07","14.6","13.8","14.51","17.6","151","12.125","22.96835016835017","294","29.16","14","0.36","0","19","19","57","1","86","38","13","7","10","87","73","5","60","1","0","2","1","15","1","0","1","17","0","26","15","9","16","11","11","4","3","2","1"
"http://www.mcall.com/news/local/watchdog/mc-medical-academy-watchdog-20130909-story.html","September 2013: Charter school a medical muddle, former employees contend","During its inaugural year, a Catasauqua charter school offered TV shows, unruliness and a discipline-free environment, but little in the way of the health-care-related education it promised, former employees contend in an anonymous letter to Catasauqua school officials.

The Sept. 15 letter, signed ""Former Employees of the Medical Academy Charter High School,"" paints a confused picture of the place Catasauqua Area School District threatened to shut down eight months ago amid concerns it was not living up to its promise to provide a medical-related curriculum.

The letter, addressed to the Catasauqua Area School Board and Superintendent Robert Spengler, said teachers -- most of whom had little health-care-related training -- received little guidance about how to incorporate medicine into their lessons in the last school year.

""The staff received no professional development to create courses infused with medicine,"" said the letter, obtained by The Morning Call through a Right to Know request to the school district.

Dr. Craig Haytmanek, Medical Academy's co-founder, dismissed the letter as ""the ramblings of a disgruntled employee.""

He and Medical Academy Principal Joanna Hughes declined to address all the letter's claims because the writers did not identify themselves.

""If this individual comes forward, I would be more than willing to go through the letter line by line and address each point,"" Haytmanek said.

The author should be ""prepared to discuss the reasons"" about ""why he or she was relieved of employment,"" he added.

He and Hughes said the school has incorporated health-care initiatives into every class and that its curriculum is improving. It has its share of discipline problems like every public high school but administers severe consequences for misbehavior, they said.

""This school is orderly,"" Hughes said.

It's not clear if the Catasauqua board intends to act on the letter. Board President Penny Hahn did not return a call for comment.

Spengler said Tuesday the letter should prompt an investigation.

""Communication of this caliber or level will require the school district to investigate all aspects of the Medical Academy Charter School,"" he said then.

Two days later, he said the board is hamstrung to pursue the matter since it's not clear who is making the claims.

""To date, we have not been able to find any individuals to substantiate the allegations and speak on the record,"" Spengler said. ""MACS leadership may respond to the issue if they deem appropriate at one of our upcoming board meetings.""

Spengler said about 10 parents also have contacted him and complained about Medical Academy Charter School's sparse medical curriculum, discipline problems and minimal academic rigor.

He said the district will monitor the charter as required and will provide a mid-year status report to the School Board.

The Catasauqua Area School Board approved Medical Academy's charter in 2012 and the school opened to ninth- and 10th-graders last fall in a building on Howerton Road. In January, about 150 students were enrolled. This school year, Medical Academy added 11th grade and currently has 224 students enrolled, Haytmanek said.

Most of those attending are from Allentown, and the Allentown School District -- which is required to turn over to charters the state aid it receives for those students -- was paying nearly $1 million to Medical Academy last year.

In January, a Morning Call investigation found that the school hadn't implemented the health-care curriculum it had promised and that it had no partnerships with medical facilities as organizers suggested in the school's charter application. In March, the school survived a threat to its charter when the Catasauqua School Board said it was satisfied with the way Medical Academy had addressed concerns about its curriculum.

Haytmanek, an ears, nose and throat doctor and former president of the Bethlehem Area School Board, said Friday that Medical Academy has made connections with Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Hospital and Manor Care nursing home and that it is in negotiations with Sacred Heart Hospital.

Haytmanek noted the school has gone through staff changes since it opened and that four employees were let go at the end of the last school year, most of them first-year teachers.

""We want really top-notch people,"" he said.

Eleven of the 18 staff members who started at the school in 2012 are no longer employed there, according to the letter. Some elected not to return, others were asked but opted not to come back for the 2013-14 school year.

Hughes said some employees left after obtaining better paying work or better opportunities.

The letter says every staffer ""who spoke up about the problems ... was invited not to return.""

Four teachers were asked not to come back, Hughes said, because ""they weren't living up to our standards.""

Last week, Allentown resident Joseph Konrath elected to remove his daughter, Megan, a 10th-grader and member of the school's inaugural class, from the Medical Academy Charter School. Konrath said it was the culmination of a lot of small issues that ""turned a meatball into meatloaf.""

There wasn't much about health care in the curriculum, Konrath said. Megan had taken a course on careers where they talked about the patient's bill of rights. The school took a trip to the Da Vinci Center.

While Konrath acknowledged the school's imperfections, he said he was willing to let Megan return this year.

""She felt fairly comfortable there,"" Konrath said.

Megan had been an outstanding student at her previous school, but introverted. She'd survived leukemia and hoped to one day become a pediatric oncologist.

After a summer of struggling to get answers from the school, and a shaky start to the new year, Konrath decided to enroll Megan in a new school. Also, the main thing he liked about the school -- the teachers who reached his daughter -- was gone.

""This year is the same as last year, maybe even regressed a little bit,"" he said.

The bottom line, he said, was that his daughter told him, ""I'm not happy there this year.""

'Scrubs' and 'Patch Adams'

Despite its name and its charter, Medical Academy Charter School was offering the same curriculum as other public schools, the letter said.

While it offered a health care and careers exploration class in 2012-13 that was supposed to introduce students to jobs in the medical industry, few of the lesson plans were implemented as written, its writers contend.

""It was well known that several of the teachers showed episodes of the television show 'Scrubs' or movies like 'Patch Adams' to their students instead,"" they wrote.","2013-09-09 00:00:00","0","77.0","3.0","0.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","30.0","15.0","0.0","80.0","4.0","15.0","0","1082","92.00","76.73","15.01","51.73","20.81","26.62","83.83","42.33","8.13","3.42","0.18","0.37","0.00","2.03","0.83","4.71","9.33","12.66","5.73","2.59","4.81","1.57","12.75","3.97","2.31","0.92","1.94","1.85","3.60","2.40","1.02","0.46","0.18","0.00","11.46","0.37","0.18","0.65","1.66","8.69","1.57","1.29","1.20","2.03","0.92","2.77","3.51","0.65","2.68","0.09","3.51","0.37","2.96","0.00","0.18","7.49","0.92","1.57","3.97","1.20","0.65","8.04","4.34","0.74","13.49","1.76","6.38","5.91","10.54","0.28","0.37","0.74","0.09","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.09","0.00","18.67","5.08","5.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.68","3.33","2.13","0.00","0.09","5349","7.72","21.94","1575","1066","51","58.72","12.1","10.3","13.34","13.9","206","18.166666666666668","18.08983114446529","473","20.12","4","0.42","0","34","20","121","0","107","66","2","3","7","181","133","0","64","1","0","43","17","31","2","0","5","41","0","38","94","12","30","10","21","3","5","0","4"
"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-hugh-jackman-prisoners-awards-race-20130831-story.html","Did the long-delayed 'Prisoners' just enter the awards race?","It's been a long road to the big screen for Aaron Guzikowski's script ""Prisoners,"" which landed on the ""Black List"" of the best unproduced screenplays of the year, back in 2009.

After seeing a slew of leading men (such as Mark Wahlberg and Leonardo DiCaprio) enter and exit its cast over the years, the film finally made its debut at the Telluride Film Festival on Friday to overwhelmingly positive reviews. The response suggests that the 2-1/2 hour thriller about two Pennsylvania families' search for their missing daughters could be another contender in an awards race that, if you believe the festival hype, will be extra crowded this year.

Starring Hugh Jackman as one of the fathers searching for his daughter, ""Prisoners"" features a star-studded cast that includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and Paul Dano.

The R-rated drama directed by Canadian Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies"") is drawing comparisons to other high-end genre fare such as David Fincher's ""Seven"" and Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" -- rare Hollywood products these days.

According to Variety's Scott Foudas, the film features ""career-best performances"" from Jackman and Gyllenhaal, who plays the cop assigned to the case.

The Oscar-nominated Villeneuve is also partnered with Gyllenhaal on the film ""Enemies,"" which will debut at the Toronto International Festival next week. With ""Prisoners,"" the director has been praised for his precision, control and ability to create ""unrelenting tight tension,"" according to Indiewire's Rodrigo Perez.

The critic adds, ""Villeneuve continues to prove his deeply confident footing in modern day cinema, bringing intelligence and muscular and mannered nuance to a somber and extremely tense studio drama that doesn’t deign to ever spell things out.""

PHOTOS: Hollywood backlot moments

It seems the biggest challenge ""Prisoners"" will have is luring in audiences interested in seeing ""every parent's nightmare"" played out on the big screen in what appears to be an exhausting ride. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film ""doesn't flinch from graphic moments of violence and terror.""

Produced by Alcon Entertainment and scheduled to be released by Warner Bros. on Sept. 20, ""Prisoners"" will likely need to first succeed at the box office before it can be considered a true player.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-august-osage-county-toronto-oscars-20130909-story.html","TIFF 2013: 'August: Osage County' and reflexive Oscar voting","TORONTO -- ""August: Osage County"" might be the first movie to win more Oscar nominations than rave reviews.

The movie, Tracy Letts' adaptation of his Tony Award-winning play of family dysfunction and warfare, premiered Monday at the Toronto International Film Festival, earning an ovation from the audience (once the house lights were turned on to spotlight the cast members in attendance).

Social media immediately lit up with Oscar buzz, which will happen when you have 17-time Oscar nominee Meryl Streep playing Violet, a pill-popping, cancer-stricken monster of a mother. The moment she stumbles on screen, face pale, hair shorn, voice slurred, you can picture academy members reflexively writing her name on their Oscar ballots. This is Acting.

The story focuses on Violet's family -- adult daughters Barbara (Julia Roberts), Karen (Juliette Lewis) and Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) -- who return to their stifling Oklahoma home (no wind sweeping over the plains here) with their own families on the occasion of a family crisis. Said home is suffocating with many rooms, each with a skeleton in its closet. Letts has trimmed his play, whittling it down to a two-hour running time, but the Weston family's issues -- suicide, alcoholism, drug addiction, incest, pedophilia, bitterness, an overfondness for Eric Clapton's ""Lay Down Sally"" -- remain present.

Critics have already laid into director John Wells' ""respectful to a fault"" handling of the material (you can read a sampling here, here and here) and you get the feeling that this might just be the warmup for a full-on critical take-down when the movie opens on Christmas.

Would such a drubbing matter to Oscar voters? Probably not. Wells should have probably reigned in the performances of his acting ensemble, but members of the actors branch love them some scenery-chewing. (See Pacino, Al.) If the Screen Actors Guild gave its ensemble award for decibel readings, ""August: Osage County"" would easily win with its wall-to-wall screaming and Big Character Moments.

And, of course, the academy can't get enough of Streep. You think they're not going to nominate her, even if, when she dons a wig and sunglasses, she looks like she's still grieving over Todd Haynes not asking her to play ""Blonde on Blonde""-era Bob Dylan in ""I'm Not There."" Now she'll likely be competing with the actress who did win the part. The thing is: ""August: Osage County"" didn't change anything. It's still Cate Blanchett's year.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/chi-metal-gear-rising-revengence-goes-in-different-direction-but-action-stays-20130306-story.html","Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance goes in different direction, but action stays","Following months of hype and a major showing at last year’s E3 show, it was safe to say that ""Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance,"" out last month for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, had two obvious roadblocks to overcome.

First, making the despised Raiden the centerpiece in a new ongoing series and, of course, the inherent challenge of updating a popular series into the new video game age.

To be certain, every old school game franchise, from Mario and Luigi to Ninja Gaiden, has an enormous challenge of moving from 2D side-scrolling to a fully-realized 3D world.

Outside of Ninja Gaiden, the entire ninja genre has experienced a lull since its 8- and 16-bit glory days. Its prospects were even murkier with the departure of Metal Gear mainstay, Solid Snake for whiny acrobat, Raiden. In gamers' minds, it was like replacing Clint Eastwood with Justin Bieber.

But the game makers at Kojima Productions, and its leader, Hideo Kojima,have successfully updated the series with some new tricks, though we're hopeful the kinks will be worked out by the next sequel. This latest version which pits men versus metal monsters incorporates fighting game mechanics into the series known for creating the stealth genre.

Revengeance also forcibly incorporated in old Metal Gear elements, such as annoyingly-long conversations through the codec, intruder alerts triggered when being spotted by enemies and VR missions. They even brought back those silly cardboard boxes for Raiden to hide from enemies in.

But Revengeance isn't about hiding. It's about tearing them apart. That said, Metal Gear purists will likely hate the new game, which largely departs from the stealth world, though they could be won over with its face-paced action and mind-blowing gore. Revengeance will leave your TV screen a dark shade of crimson.

Revengeance is set in the near future, where cyborg technology has exploded and soldiers-of-fortune around the world are getting robotic enhancements.

Raiden, first introduced in 2001’s Metal Gear: Sons of Liberty, starts the game as a sword-wielding cyborg security consultant working for a benevolent Democratic leader in Africa. The leader is killed for cartoonish reasons, leading Raiden on a quest filled with moral questions and dismembered cyborgs.

To increase Raiden's appeal, the game designers toughened him, turning him from a prettyboy more suitable as a Final Fantasy hero to a single-minded killer.

Revengeance's main strength is its kinetic, free-flowing movement that allows Raiden, using a mix of strong and weak attacks ala fighting games, to unleash an arsenal of weapon-based attacks that will leave your enemies in chunks like a butcher's freezer.

Because Revengeance is modeled more like a run-and-run fighter, the key to success is quickly mastering your fighting combos and defensive skills.

I squared off against a cyborg wolf (as one does) at least 25 times until I learned to effectively use Raiden's block, which doesn't have its own button and isn't listed in the gamer's manual.

Revengeance's fighting style shares more than a passing resemblence to Tecmo's ""Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge,"" an overlooked gem released on the Wii U last November. It will see action on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 in April.

Like Revengeance, Razor's Edge allows its hero the ability to dodge missiles using bullet time and easily bounce from enemy-to-enemy, allowing you to attack several people at once.

The camera angles can be infuriating, though not more so than using secondary weapons. Trying to shoot down an enemy helicopter or throwing a grenade using the bumper buttons is nothing if not awkward.

The good news is that Revengeance is a test of whether the glorious game series can survive major changes. If it can survive the main games and a host of cheap VR spinoffs, it can survive Raiden.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/la-et-ct-aereo-supreme-court-20131011-story.html","Broadcasters take Aereo to Supreme Court","The nation's biggest television companies including ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are asking the Supreme Court to shut down Aereo Inc., a startup distribution service that they view as a threat to their business.

Launched in 2012 and available in a handful of markets including New York City, Aereo transmits the signals of local broadcast stations to consumers via the Internet. Aereo charges its subscribers between $8 and $12 a month for the service, which includes a small antenna to receive the signals and access to a cloud-based digital video recorder that can hold up to 40 hours of programming.

Because Aereo is not paying the owners of the television stations whose signals it is transmitting, broadcasters are crying foul and claiming copyright theft.

The Supreme Court filing is seeking to overturn a 2-1 decision made earlier this year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, which found that Aereo's transmissions and recordings of broadcast content are not ""public performances"" of copyrighted material. In addition, the court said the broadcasters ""have not demonstrated that they are likely to prevail on the merits on this claim in their copyright infringement action.""

There's no guarantee the high court will hear the case. If not, broadcasters would likely continue the fight in the lower courts and then try to take another swing with the Supreme Court.

In the Friday filing to the Supreme Court, the broadcasters said the Second Circuit decision ""threatens to upend"" the television industry"" by ""blessing a business model that retransmits 'live TV' to paying customers without obtaining any authorization or paying a penny to copyright owners.""

Consumers have always had the ability to purchase an antenna to receive over-the-air television signals. However, broadcasters say in their filing that Congress -- in crafting copyright law -- ""has been mindful of the potential for third parties to exploit this arrangement by profiting off of the 'retransmission' of broadcast programming -- i.e., by capturing these free broadcasts and retransmitting them to the public for a fee, without the approval of or compensation to those responsible for making these broadcasts available to the public.""

An Aereo spokeswoman said in a statement that the company would respond to the filing in ""due course.""

In its ruling, the Second Circuit said since Aereo subscribers are getting an individual transmission streamed from a digital copy of a broadcaster's programming, it was a private performance.

The broadcasters counter that this is a technological loophole.

""Congress did not want liability to turn on the technical details of a transmission service and did not want the statute rendered obsolete by changes in the technology used to communicate performances to the public,"" the broadcasters said.

Besides the big four broadcast networks, others going after Aereo include Univision, PBS and Los Angeles Times parent Tribune Co., which owns TV stations.

Broadcasters fear that if successful, Aereo could undermine the economics of their business model. Specifically, there are worries that not only will consumers embrace Aereo, but that distributors such as cable and satellite companies will use it or a similar service to avoid paying broadcasters. Broadcasters count on those distribution fees for programming and if Aereo's service catches on, they fear it could severely limit their ability to create and acquire high quality content.

Some broadcasters, including Fox, have even threatened to abandon broadcast television in favor of cable if Aereo and similar services were found to be legal.

Aereo, which won't disclose how many subscribers it has, argues that its service is no different than a pair of rabbit ears on a roof. Its backers include media mogul Barry Diller, who used to run Fox. Earlier this year, Diller said he expected Aereo could eventually have 20 million to 30 million subscribers. He added that the efforts to fight the technology was akin to putting ""your hand in front of a train.""

New York is not the only place broadcasters have taken on Aereo. In Boston, a group of TV station owners including Hearst Corp. filed suit to stop Aereo from launching there. However, earlier this week the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts rejected a request for a temporary restraining order. Broadcasters are also going after Aereo in Utah as well, where the service recently launched.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/la-et-cm-smokey-joes-cafe-mike-stoller-20130928-story.html","For Mike Stoller, 'Smokey Joe's Cafe' has come home","This post has been updated. See note below for details.

As a rule, composers of musicals are happy about any productions anywhere of their work.

But Mike Stoller, the surviving half of the fabled songwriting team of Leiber and Stoller, is particularly excited about the Pasadena Playhouse's impending revival of ""Smokey Joe's Café,"" the jukebox musical built around more than three dozen of the signature hits he and longtime partner Jerry Leiber cranked out in the 1950s and 1960s.

First, there's the hometown aspect: The Pasadena Playhouse production, which opened this week, is just a few miles away from where they met in 1950, when Stoller was student at L.A. City College and Leiber was in his senior year at Fairfax High School. Their friendship evolved into an astoundingly successful creative partnership that continued for 61 years, until Leiber's death in 2011.

In addition, there's Stoller's personal affection for the Pasadena Playhouse, a theater he and his wife, pianist-harpist Corky Hale Stoller, grew so fond of that they plunked down a cool $1-million donation. By putting up the money as a challenge grant, it yielded the $2 million that was key to pulling it out of its financial straits.

""This production of 'Smokey Joe's Café' and our interest in the theater are mutually exclusive,"" said Stoller, 80. ""We are hoping 'Smokey Joe's Café' will have long runs in lots of places, and we're also hoping that the Pasadena Playhouse, which is a wonderful theater that started so long ago, is also going to have a long, long run — hopefully a permanent run, because they do great work.""

""Smokey Joe's Café"" might be considered the godfather of the jukebox pop musical, a compendium of hit songs that Leiber and Stoller wrote for Elvis Presley, the Drifters, the Coasters, Ben E. King, Big Mama Thornton and numerous other early rock and R&B stars. Among those classics that earned the pair a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: ""Hound Dog,"" ""Jailhouse Rock,"" ""Yakety Yak,"" ""Charlie Brown,"" ""Kansas City,"" ""There Goes My Baby,"" ""Stand By Me.""

After getting off the ground in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, ""Smokey Joe's Café"" opened on Broadway in 1995 and ran for more than five years, tallying more than 2,000 performances and becoming the most successful musical revue in Broadway history. It has since played extensively in London and in smaller productions across the U.S.

The Leiber and Stoller songs are the alpha and omega of ""Smokey Joe's Café,"" which dispenses with any attempt at linking the songs through dramatic narrative.

CHEAT SHEET: Fall arts preview

Having come away dissatisfied from at least three earlier attempts to weave songs from their extensive catalog into a theatrical show, Stoller said he called Broadway producer Jack Viertel, with whom he and Leiber had been throwing around ideas about a ballet musical, and said, ""Listen, let's get rid of the book — let's just do the songs and forget the book. And they agreed.

""Another aspect is that so many of the songs are little stories in and unto themselves,"" he said. ""So they won't fit into larger stories, because they are stories, separate, individual stories. I guess that was why it worked.""

The Pasadena Playhouse production is directed and choreographed by Jeffrey Polk, who has a track record with Leiber and Stoller's show.

""Jeffrey did this a few years ago on a very limited engagement in North Hollywood at the El Portal,"" Stoller said. ""It was sensational. They would have extended it, but all the actors had taken other roles in other things prior to that. So it's great to be able to see his work again.""

After the long run of hits — many of which Leiber and Stoller also produced, as the first people to be credited on a record label for production — slowed in the late-1960s with the onslaught of the British Invasion and the expansion of rock's thematic scope after Bob Dylan arrived, Leiber and Stoller turned their attention from music about the ups and downs of teenage life to more mature subjects. Most successful was their song ""Is That All There Is?"" for Peggy Lee in 1969.

Stoller wrote another musical, ""The People in the Picture,"" which ran on Broadway in 2011 and generated a lead actress Tony Award nomination for its star, Donna Murphy.

""We still have high hopes for other productions, yeah,"" Stoller said.

It was a very different process, however, collaborating with Artie Butler and Iris Rainer Dart on ""People in the Picture"" than his 61-year partnership with Leiber, both of whom were Jewish kids who grew up on the East Coast loving African American music, which they often tapped in their compositions.

These days, it's theater that speaks most directly to Stoller. ""I'd like to write another musical with a book. I like that challenge very much. I find it very interesting and exciting to work like that. Also, I'm a bit distant from contemporary hip-hop and rap. It's a generational thing, so I don't think that I'd be competitive, if you will, with a lot of young people who write and live and breathe in that medium.""

Does he keep current on what's working, or not working, in the world of pop music, a world in which he played a dominant role half a century ago?

""No, I haven't found myself doing any criticism,"" he said. ""Once in a while I wind up hearing things I like by chance. I'm not tuned to the radio all day, but once in a while I'll hear something I admire, and that's about it.""","2013-09-27 15:45:00","0","37.0","8.0","0.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","49.0","21.0","0.0","84.0","4.0","15.0","0","950","84.64","67.83","35.94","77.97","22.62","20.95","80.32","48.11","11.68","5.26","1.68","0.63","0.11","1.26","1.58","6.42","8.00","14.95","6.63","3.89","6.32","0.63","12.84","5.05","2.53","1.68","2.53","2.74","3.79","3.26","0.42","0.00","0.32","0.00","8.21","0.42","0.32","0.21","1.47","7.05","0.84","1.68","0.63","2.11","0.53","2.00","4.32","0.95","3.26","0.11","1.16","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.63","6.74","1.47","2.63","2.21","1.26","0.11","4.53","7.16","1.05","16.21","2.21","9.47","4.53","4.32","4.63","0.11","0.53","0.11","0.11","0.42","0.00","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.00","22.11","4.53","7.47","0.42","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.53","5.16","3.47","0.00","0.32","4293","7.4","23.902439024390244","1277","946","43","74.53","11.4","8.3","10.73","12.3","160","8.3","17.565327695560253","480","21.22","23","0.48","0","39","20","94","0","134","83","7","2","4","110","142","4","45","2","0","47","12","36","0","2","6","12","0","19","52","18","17","30","19","11","6","0","3"
"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/la-et-cm-theater-review-tracers-20131021-story.html","Review: Insights about war are signaled by 'Tracers'","What started out 33 years ago as a cathartic purge of Vietnam combat trauma demonstrates artistic staying power and relevance in the hard-hitting revival of “Tracers” at the AMVETS Post II Building in Culver City.

Depicting the fates of infantry soldiers from basic training through deployment in Vietnam to the difficult reentry difficulties they face on their long way home, “Tracers” is as much a visceral experience as a dramatic presentation.

Director-author John DiFusco developed the play in collaboration with seven fellow Vietnam War veterans, who originally performed in it as the characters they each created.

PHOTOS: Best in theater for 2012

In this co-production from the United States Veterans’ Artists Alliance and Rogue Machine Theatre, a well-cast new ensemble of armed service veterans infuses the roles with the raw intensity of personal experience, even as these performers illuminate enduring truths from the conflict of a past generation.

Steeped in graphic specificity, Di Fusco’s take-no-prisoners staging portrays the alienation, drug abuse and tenuous grip on sanity that take their toll on young men thrust into harrowing circumstances for which they’re tragically unprepared.

There is more redundancy in the characters and their stories than strictly needed to get the messages across, but the pacing and momentum never flag. Potentially confusing dual endings show the war-fighters’ two possible paths to returning home, neither of which is easy.

PHOTOS: LA Opera through the years

Along with the challenges they face, however, they also learn discipline and forge a unique camaraderie celebrated in the percussive rock finale. By design, “Tracers” is neither pro- nor antiwar; rather than pushing us to judgment, the piece asks for understanding — which is just as important for educating those who never served in Vietnam and honoring those who did.

“Tracers,” USVAA Theater in the AMVETS Post II Building, 10858 Culver Blvd., Culver City. 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 6 p.m. Sundays. Ends Nov. 9. $30. (855) 585-5185 or www.roguemachinetheatre.com. Running time: 2 hours, 30 minutes.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/la-et-cm-mat-gleason-art-club-20131208-story.html","Contrarian Mat Gleason joins L.A.'s establishment art club, kind of","Mat Gleason, in a black Smiths T-shirt and black jeans, a point-and-shoot camera swinging from his neck, surveys the chaos inside his Chinatown art gallery, Coagula Curatorial. Hammers pound, a buzz saw whines and two workmen weld metal braces onto a baby-crib spring that will eventually become part of a speak-easy bar top.

""Cool, right?"" he says as a Mark Dutcher painting from Coagula's most recent show comes off the wall and a new installation by artist Kim Dingle goes up.

Sawdust floats through the air as Dingle, a past Whitney Biennial participant who has pieces in the permanent collection of Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art and has had work exhibited at the Smithsonian, carefully unpacks wooden crates of wine bottles that she's painted with the naughty-girl characters she's known for.

CRITICS' PICKS: What to watch, where to go, what to eat

This is Dingle's first solo show in Los Angeles in six years. She's kept busy running her Eagle Rock vegetarian restaurant Fatty's and showing at her New York gallery, Sperone Westwater. Her former Los Angeles gallery was the venerated Blum & Poe, and she had a 2007 exhibition at Culver City's Kim Light, but she went with Gleason's Coagula Curatorial when she came up with the installation idea she calls ""Wine Bar for Children at Mr. Ling's Market.""

""Mat's gallery, it's edgy, you're free,"" Dingle says, wiping her brow of dust. ""This is what it must've been like in the artists' scene in the late '60s, early '70s in New York, the early days of conceptual art; no pressure, just do what you want. Mat's really is an artist's gallerist.""

This is not a sentiment shared by everyone in the art world.

Gleason is best known as a divisive, outsider voice who used his irreverent art zine-turned-website, the 21-year-old Coagula, to tear down what he sees as an insular, pretension-heavy art scene. Coagula's mix of often-scathing reviews and no-holds-barred art world gossip earned Gleason a reputation as a trouble-making, rude contrarian.

So it's interesting that, with the 2012 opening of Coagula Curatorial, the iconoclastic publisher now finds himself on the other side of the art-gallery fence, promoting artists instead of critiquing them.

The Dutcher show, which debuted in September, received positive reviews (""lovely,"" said The Times' Christopher Knight of the paintings), and Gleason sold all but one of the works. He even bought a full-page color ad in ArtForum's December issue to promote his gallery. One might say Gleason, 49, his spiky hot-pink hair now benignly salt and pepper, has become part of the art establishment he's made a career out of flaming.

""I'm mainstream art world now, there's just no way around it,"" he laughs over lunch at his favorite Chinatown restaurant, Chego. ""I used to crash the parties and get kicked out; now I get invited and don't go!""

But Gleason doesn't want anyone to think he's gone soft.

PHOTOS: Google Doodles of 2013

""The brand of Coagula is still truth telling, which is still real scary in the art world,"" he insists. ""People don't want the real price [of art] revealed or anyone to know their process. It's a cesspool of secrets; I still want to be an aesthetic truth teller — if I show an artist, I believe in them.""

Gleason's so-called truth telling in art writing, however, has repeatedly gotten him into hot water.

At Coagula's height in the late 1990s, when the newsprint bimonthly reached about 80 pages, it ran intentionally shocking covers. On the occasion of Barbara Kruger's 1999 MOCA retrospective, the cover read ""Kruger: You Can't Teach an Old Dog to Stop Making Bad Art."" Another cover, ""Matthew Barney's Rubble,"" trashed the artist's five-film ""Cremaster Cycle."" Such print plays led many to dismiss Gleason.

""There's a place for real criticism, including criticism that really tackles when and why something doesn't work,"" says artist and interim Art Center chair of undergraduate fine art, Tom Knechtel. ""But Coagula, back then, really published negative things about people and their personal lives, and that's not acceptable. It made me stop looking at it early on.""

Others found the publication inspiring.

""Mat had as many enemies as friends; it wasn't a magazine the entire L.A. art world embraced,"" says Tulsa Kinney, editor of the bimonthly art magazine Artillery. The year Kinney spent guest-editing Coagula in 2001 prompted her to start her own publication. ""I loved the magazine. I thought it was hilarious and funny, and he's real smart with a silver tongue.""

""Look,"" says Gleason, over his rice bowl at Chego. ""I started Coagula to push at power in the art world, because so much of it is the illusion of power. I'm not afraid to be honest, but there's no desire to hurt people.""

Press him on those coverlines and Gleason adds, ""Coagula has never gone any meaner than the average editorial cartoon. To me, it's satire. The art world is just shockingly thin skinned.""

Love him, hate him or ignore him, Gleason has achieved longevity with the Coagula brand by remaining ever-pliable in a shifting media landscape. Having switched from print to online in 2009, he now only occasionally publishes special hard-copy editions of Coagula. The limited run of about 4,000 print copies is often planned for distribution at big art world events, such as this year's PULSE Contemporary Art Fair in New York and, like the Coagula website, seems mainly to promote the artists Gleason represents at his gallery or serve as a megaphone for his signature rants.

ART: Can you guess the high price?

In the most recent print edition, Gleason recounted a Facebook argument he had with ArtForum writer David Rimanelli. Ever eager to get in the last word, Gleason reprinted on Coagula's cover a screen shot of a vitriolic private email that Gleason says Rimanelli sent to him on Facebook.

"http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/mc-obamacare-pennsylvania-exchange-20130720-story.html","Feds have much to do before insurance marketplace is ready","Some call it an ""exchange."" The federal government prefers the term ""marketplace.""

But whatever you call it, an online site for people to shop for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is scheduled to be up and running Oct. 1. Like a bargain travel website, the exchange will offer shoppers a choice of plans and levels of coverage from different insurance carriers. For low- to middle-income earners, subsidies will be available to make the premium affordable.

Put simply, the exchange will be a way for working- and middle-class people to buy coverage if they don't already get it from an employer or Medicaid. It will be mandatory for the 1.3 million currently uninsured Pennsylvanians. Those who don't enroll will be fined — $95 the first year and nearly $700 in 2016.

With little more than two months before the exchanges open, technical and logistical challenges abound, leaving some to wonder if they will be ready to go by the deadline.

While insurance shoppers in New York, Massachusetts and some other states are already mulling over premiums, Pennsylvanians will remain in the dark about the costs until the program is unveiled in October. The state is among 27 that decided not to create their own systems but to rely on the federal government to set them up.

Joanne Grossi, the regional Health and Human Services Department director, said consumers need not panic. They'll have 10 weeks, until Dec. 15, to choose a plan if they want coverage to start on Jan. 1, 2014. They'll have six months, until March 31, 2014, before enrollment closes. And enrollment will reopen on Oct. 15, 2014.

For insurance and government officials, the pressure is on. For the exchange to work, a number of things have to happen in the next 10 weeks:

•A critical mass of insurance companies need to offer coverage to make the marketplace competitive. The Obama administration isn't saying how many companies are enough, just that the exchange promotes more choices through better competition.

•A host of government and business computer systems have to be able to talk to each other. The government is still testing a ""hub"" that is supposed to direct a consumer's application for insurance to a number of agencies including the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and others to verify the applicant's status and information.

• A mix of government leaders, insurers, agency workers and volunteers need to educate as many of the 26 million Americans — including about 900,000 Pennsylvanians — who are required to buy insurance and qualify for help. Those seeking insurance will need to know about options and penalties for not signing up.

Behind the scenes, a political power play has Obamacare opponents pledging to continue efforts to derail the law. Last week two votes were taken in the House of Representatives to suspend the requirement to buy insurance. The votes are essentially symbolic, since House members know the Democrat-controlled Senate will not take them up.

The federal government is striving to make the process seamless. It has set up a 24-hour ""health insurance marketplace"" help line. It also is hiring navigators who will provide information on choices and encouraging human service agencies to hold programs in libraries, community centers, hospitals and other places where consumers can get one-on-one help to pick a plan.

MIT economics professor Jon Gruber advised the government on the writing of the Affordable Care Act as well as its forerunner, the Massachusetts health insurance law signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney. He predicts most people using the system will be satisfied, but that problems are inevitable.

Glitches are most likely to occur in the subsidy program, he said, which is what happened when the government implemented Medicare Part D, the program covering seniors' prescription drugs, nearly 10 years ago. When that program rolled out, seniors experienced widespread trouble with computer glitches and improper denial of benefits. With that experience in mind, Gruber said he expects it will take a year to work out the kinks in the exchanges.

If consumers have an unpleasant buying experience because they don't understand the process or encounter glitches, they may back out and not try again, said Jennifer Tolbert, director of state health reform at Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit focused on health care. That would be problematic since the more consumers in the marketplace, the more successful it will be.

A little help

Depending on their income level, some shoppers will qualify for benefits to subsidize the cost of insurance. Obamacare provides two types of subsidies: a tax credit to lower the cost of the monthly premium payment, and a cost-sharing program to help pay for out-of-pocket charges such as deductibles.

To be eligible for subsidized coverage, a consumer's income has to be between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, $11,490 to $45,960 for a single person in 2013. The closer to 100 percent of the poverty level, the greater the subsidy.

The subsidies also will cause confusion because of another part of the health care law involving Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor, the disabled and children.

The Affordable Care Act was written anticipating that each state would expand its Medicaid program, with the help of federal money, for individuals and families with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that states could not be required to expand Medicaid.","2013-07-20 21:12:00","0","63.0","4.0","3.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","52.0","21.0","0.0","82.0","4.0","16.0","0","921","96.54","59.43","13.32","47.89","19.60","28.45","82.52","44.63","5.21","1.63","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.33","1.19","3.58","9.99","15.96","7.06","2.28","5.32","1.09","12.16","3.37","2.28","1.09","4.23","2.28","3.58","2.39","1.19","0.22","0.11","0.22","5.86","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.33","8.25","1.41","1.63","1.74","2.39","0.11","2.50","0.98","0.11","0.54","0.00","1.74","0.00","1.74","0.00","0.00","9.34","1.41","2.17","5.54","1.09","0.54","1.52","8.25","2.71","12.49","0.76","7.27","4.45","9.88","0.98","0.43","6.84","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.00","15.42","5.32","5.75","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.41","0.87","1.09","0.00","0.76","4532","8.35","21.674418604651162","1416","911","45","50.97","13.4","11.2","12.76","13.1","214","6.083333333333333","19.47626783754116","445","19.81","8","0.44","0","29","38","100","0","105","57","5","1","22","158","68","5","77","0","0","21","4","25","1","1","7","43","0","64","14","20","12","25","17","5","4","0","4"
"http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/sns-dallas-to-mark-jfk-assassination-with-wide-array-of-events-20131121-story.html","Dallas to mark JFK assassination with wide array of events","DALLAS — The city is preparing to mark the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination with events designed to celebrate his legacy and show how far Dallas, and the country, have come since that fall day in 1963.

In addition to a city-sponsored ceremony at Dealy Plaza on Friday, there will be concerts, panel discussions with eyewitnesses, public art installations and a day of service.

After the assassination, Dallas was denounced as ""the city of hate."" On the eve of the anniversary, the Dallas nonprofit group 29 Pieces has attempted to dispel that reputation by placing thousands of works of art throughout the city exploring the theme of love.

On Thursday, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra will perform the first of four concerts with two works tied to the assassination: ""Murder of a Great Chief of State,"" composed by Darius Milhaud in the weeks after Kennedy's slaying, and Conrad Tao's ""The World Is Very Different Now,"" commissioned for this year's anniversary.

Also on Thursday, Dallas-area residents will participate in a day of volunteering in memory of Kennedy, who created the Peace Corps and memorably urged Americans, ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.""

As part of the day of service, officials and student volunteers in University Park, a Dallas suburb, plan to hold a ceremony at a park in Kennedy’s honor, planting a tree and rose bushes in memory of Jacqueline Kennedy.

Tanner Houghton, 18, a senior at Highland Park High School, is scheduled to speak at the event.

""I'm going to be speaking about the incredible legacy of service that John F. Kennedy lived,"" said Houghton, an Eagle Scout and student body president at his school, which requires students to perform 50 hours of community service to graduate.

Houghton was born in 1995. His father, Steve, was born in 1963 — two weeks before Kennedy was killed. Steve Houghton's mother told him how she was nursing him while watching television at their home in Utah when Kennedy was assassinated.

Houghton sees Kennedy's emphasis on service as ""a wonderful challenge to all of us that is perhaps more poignant today than ever before.""

Dallas volunteers will also help sort food for distribution at the North Texas Food Bank, a nonprofit group that provides 175,000 meals daily.

""While President Kennedy left us physically 50 years ago, his spirit still motivates us every day in immeasurable ways. There are children all over town this week who will be participating even though they were not alive when President Kennedy was in office,"" Colleen Townsely Brinkmann, the food bank's chief philanthropy officer, told the Los Angeles Times.

The Sixth Floor Museum in the former school book depository overlooking the spot where Kennedy was shot has hosted panel discussions with curators and eyewitnesses leading up to Friday’s anniversary.

A panel of eyewitnesses on Wednesday included a former Dallas Times Herald photographer who captured the iconic image of Jack Ruby shooting assassin Lee Harvey Oswald; a former Dallas police officer; the chief surgery resident at Parkland Hospital who treated Kennedy; and Eugene Boone, a former Dallas sheriff’s deputy who found Oswald’s rifle in the book depository.

Boone, 75, who lives in Abilene, Texas, spoke with The Times about what he saw that day.

""Almost from the beginning there seems to be overtones of a conspiracy,"" Boone said of the assassination.

But Boone, who testified before the Warren Commission, said he stood by its findings that Oswald acted alone. He doesn’t put much stock in books detailing conspiracy theories.

""Most of them should be located in the fiction section of your local library,"" he said.

There are many who disagree.

As of this month, 61% of Americans believe others beside Oswald were involved in Kennedy's slaying, according to a Gallup poll.

Each year, conspiracy theorists in a group called JFK Lancer gather in Dallas to discuss the latest research, hear from speakers and stage a small memorial ceremony in Dealey Plaza.

This year, organizers are expecting about 400 people to attend the convention, which starts Thursday at the Adolphus Hotel downtown, according to the group’s president, Debra Conway.

Dealey Plaza will be closed early Friday for the official ceremony, which will include the unveiling of a monument to Kennedy, musical performances and readings from Kennedy’s speeches by historian David McCullough. Bells will toll across the city, to be followed by a moment of silence marking the time when Kennedy was shot.

The 5,000 tickets to the event were distributed through a lottery, and most JFK Lancer members did not receive tickets, Conway told The Times.

But she said her group received assurances from city officials that members would be able to enter the plaza after the official ceremony to stage their own observance.

""If we do anything, it will be a little singing and a few short speeches — something very traditional,"" Conway said.

The Texas Theatre, where Oswald was arrested, is scheduled to screen the Kennedy documentary ""Rush to Judgment"" on Thursday, followed Friday by the movie Oswald sneaked into, ""War Is Hell,"" and the Oliver Stone film ""JFK.""

The latter screening will be preceded by a re-creation of Warren Commission interviews with two theater employees and the man who saw Oswald enter the theater. A special preview before the film will include archival footage of then-Texas Gov. John Connally sharing his account of the assassination. Connally was wounded in the attack.

Near the theater, at the spot in Oak Cliff where Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit was shot by Oswald, the Dallas Police Assn. plans to stage a candlelight vigil at 6 p.m. Friday. Marie Tippit, 85, of Dallas, the officer’s widow, is expected to attend.","2013-11-21 10:00:00","0","42.0","2.0","0.0","0.0","27.0","0.0","45.0","21.0","0.0","85.0","4.0","17.0","0","955","96.79","78.39","27.33","31.11","22.21","25.34","75.39","41.99","6.28","2.93","0.10","0.42","0.52","1.47","0.42","3.35","9.21","15.39","6.18","2.72","3.56","0.42","11.10","3.56","2.20","2.41","2.41","1.88","1.99","1.15","0.84","0.00","0.63","0.10","8.59","0.31","0.00","0.42","1.36","4.50","0.94","0.73","0.52","1.15","0.52","1.05","3.25","1.26","1.99","0.00","1.68","0.42","0.73","0.00","0.42","6.49","1.88","1.36","3.56","0.10","0.00","4.61","5.45","1.88","17.28","1.57","8.06","7.85","5.13","2.51","0.31","0.63","0.21","1.47","0.10","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.38","4.71","7.12","0.10","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.42","2.72","1.78","0.00","0.10","4662","8.55","23.70731707317073","1412","950","42","57.0","12.7","10.9","12.83","14.1","228","13.125","20.64","479","21.59","10","0.42","0","18","20","96","0","125","44","0","2","15","157","168","3","49","0","0","19","12","24","1","0","1","26","0","38","47","21","28","11","18","6","12","0","8"
"http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/sns-us-looks-to-bypass-karzai-on-afghanistan-security-deal-20131126-story.html","U.S. looks to bypass Karzai on Afghanistan security deal","WASHINGTON — U.S. officials seeking to resolve a tense standoff with Afghan President Hamid Karzai were exploring on Tuesday whether they could bypass him and get other senior officials to sign a security deal authorizing American troops to remain in the country after 2014.

A day after Karzai abruptly said he would not sign unless Washington agreed to additional conditions, the Obama administration was pushing for Foreign Minister Zarar Ahmad Osmani or another official to endorse the agreement on behalf of the government in Kabul, several U.S. officials said.

The Pentagon has been saying for months that it needs the security pact in place by the end of the year to give planners time to draft deployment schedules and secure funding for post-2014 operations.

Without a signed agreement, U.S. officials, say they will begin planning a complete withdrawal of the remaining 47,000 American troops next year. That means Afghanistan could be left to face a still potent Taliban insurgency without substantial foreign military assistance.

Susan Rice, Obama's national security advisor, told Afghanistan’s Tolo television station that it was not possible for the United States to postpone signing the deal until the spring, as Karzai has called for. She brushed aside Karzai’s call for the release of all Afghans held at the naval prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and other demands.

“We’ve concluded the negotiations of the agreement,"" Rice said at the end of a three-day visit to Kabul.

“We’re getting the text ready, and we’ll sign it at a high level,” an apparent acknowledgment that someone other than Karzai could sign for the Afghans.

But U.S. officials concede that the notion of bypassing Karzai poses enormous difficulties and is probably not a viable solution to the standoff unless Karzai himself accepts the idea.

“The heads of state wouldn't have to sign the document, but they would have to delegate that authority,” said a senior U.S. official in Kabul familiar with the discussions. “So I don't think it's clear here if it could be put into effect without [Karzai’s] approval.""

"http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/sns-lat-irs-proposes-new-curbs-on-campaigning-by-taxexempt-groups-20131126-story.html","IRS proposes new curbs on campaigning by tax-exempt groups","WASHINGTON — In a long-anticipated move to restrict the flood of secret money in campaigns, the IRS for the first time proposed rules to rein in the political activities of tax-exempt groups that have emerged as heavyweight players in American elections.

Tuesday's proposal, which faces a long and likely arduous path before becoming final, could dramatically reshape the campaign landscape.

Since the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, nonprofit groups organized under section 501(c)4 of the tax code have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into television commercials to back candidates and political causes — without revealing their donors.

The groups include conservative organizations, such as Americans for Prosperity backed by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, as well as liberal ones, such as Organizing for Action, which started out as President Obama's campaign operation.

Nonprofit groups and trade organizations reported spending $309 million in the 2012 election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, but much of their spending remains in the dark.

Such groups also have funneled millions into California elections, prompting an investigation and fines this year for some conservative groups that had concealed the sources of their money in ways that violated state rules.

As the influence of these groups has grown, advocates of campaign finance reform, along with many Democrats in Congress, have pushed the Internal Revenue Service to limit their activities.

""Unfortunately, groups on both ends of the political spectrum have tried to take advantage of the ambiguity in the law,"" said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.).

Paul Ryan, senior counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for tougher campaign finance rules, called the IRS proposal ""a good sign coming from an agency that has done little or nothing"" to regulate spending by nonprofits in politics.

Although the rules would apply to liberal and conservative groups alike, the announcement drew attacks from conservatives and Republicans in Congress, who said the proposed rules would be an abuse of power.

""This smacks of the administration trying to shut down potential critics,"" said Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which, like the Senate Finance Committee, has jurisdiction over the IRS.

The process of writing new rules to cover these influential groups touches on sensitive issues of free speech and the proper role of government in regulating political spending, adding to the complexity of the effort.

""This is protected 1st Amendment activity, and it seems to me, unless you have it strictly limited, it's unconstitutional,"" said Cleta Mitchell, an attorney who represents conservative groups before the IRS.

The 501(c)4 organizations are defined by the IRS code as promoting ""the common good and general welfare."" They are permitted to engage in some campaign-related activity, as long as politics is not their ""primary purpose.""

But the IRS has never spelled out exactly what that means.

The vague language set the stage for the agency's overzealous scrutiny of tea party and progressive groups, which came to light this year. IRS agents sent some groups long lists of intrusive questions to determine whether their main purpose was politics.

The proposed new rules wouldn't ban political activity, but would attempt to draw a clearer line between activities that are political and those that promote the general welfare.

The IRS has not proposed a new standard for how it would decide whether politics or social welfare is a group's primary purpose. The agency is soliciting comments on whether it should do that.

""This proposed guidance is a first critical step toward creating clear-cut definitions of political activity,"" Mark J. Mazur, Treasury assistant secretary for tax policy, said in a statement. ""We are committed to getting this right before issuing final guidelines that may affect a broad group of organizations.""

Some of the IRS proposals reflect Federal Election Commission rules. Any communications that ""expressly advocate"" for a candidate would count as politics, including all references to candidates of a political party.

Any communication that even mentions a candidate would also be considered political activity if it fell within 60 days of a general election, or 30 days of a primary. That rule, however, would leave groups free to spend money without restriction on ads during the summers of election years so long as they do not promote a candidate.

Unlike the FEC's rules, the IRS limits would also cover state and local races.

"http://www.mcall.com/sports/bal-analyzing-marylands-8381-win-over-duke-20130217-story.html","Analyzing Maryland's 83-81 win over Duke","Welcome back to Morning Shootaround, a regular feature this season the day after Maryland basketball games. While we can’t bring you into the Terps’ locker room after games – reporters haven’t been allowed in there since the last couple of years under Gary Williams – we will recap what was said in the press conference afterward by Maryland coach Mark Turgeon and his players. We will give some of our own insight into what transpired on the court during the previous day’s game and what the Terps will be working on at practice looking ahead to their next game.

Maryland 83, No. 2 Duke 81 @ Comcast Center Saturday

Have you recovered yet? Sorry for the late post, but I kept waiting all night for the Maryland students to show up at the bonfire school officials set up to save Route 1 from a repeat of three years ago, the last time the Terps beat Duke.

I have to admit, unlike my Sun colleague Jeff Barker, I didn’t see this one coming. It’s not that I didn’t believe the Terps were capable of beating Duke. I thought Maryland had a better chance last month at Cameron Indoor Stadium than in College Park.

Not to be too cynical, but what I kept thinking as I watched Mark Turgeon’s biggest win at Maryland unfold was this: where has this been the past month? It was not some perfectly executed clinic given a season-high 26 turnovers, including a career-tying eight by the guy who essentially won the game, freshman Seth Allen. But the Terps showed the kind of heart that has been missing for a long time.

The victory helped revive the interests of the Maryland fans who had fallen off Turgeon’s happy little bandwagon after the loss to Virginia last Sunday, to keep the next four weeks relevant as long as the Terps don’t slip against teams they should beat -- even on the road. And it will take some pressure off Turgeon, even going into next season, about getting that first signature win.

“I told them before the game, ‘We don’t have to be extraordinary, we just have to play to our level,’” Turgeon said. “And we weren’t extraordinary all the time. But we played to our level and we continued to compete. For our young team, it’s one thing to play Duke close, it’s another thing to beat ‘em.”

3-POINT SHOTS

That “four-letter” word

Turgeon was asked after the game whether the win puts the Terps back into NCAA tournament picture.

“I’m not going to mention the four-letter word because we’re so far from it,’ Turgeon said. “We have four of our last six on the road. If we can be committed to being good teammates, being a good team, that’s all I want. ... None of that other stuff matters. ... We’re going to enjoy tonight. We have a Boston College team Tuesday that ‘s pretty good and we’re going to have to play better against them than we did at home.”

Depending on whose in-season bracket you’ve been following, Turgeon might be right. Or the Terps, given the fact that they now can claim something few have done (a victory over a top-two team) might have put themselves back on the bubble.

ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi had listed Maryland among the first four teams looking in from the outside, but said in an interview that North Carolina and Kentucky, given their 0-4 records against Top 25 teams and the Wildcats losing freshman center Nerlens Noel for the season, were in trouble.

Aside from the road games at Boston College, Georgia Tech and Wake Forest that would be disastrous to lose, Maryland’s March 6 home game against the Tar Heels as well as its regular-season finale at Virginia on March 10 loom large.

One thing that Saturday night’s win guarantees for the Terps: the NIT. That might be considered a bit heartless, but whatever happens from here on out, barring a complete meltdown by Maryland, Turgeon can say with tangible proof that his program is on track.

Len reemerges

Ever since he put up 23 points, 12 rebounds and four blocked shots in the season opener against Noel and then-No. 3 Kentucky, we’ve been waiting for a similar performance from Len. It came Saturday night.

While Len’s numbers weren’t quite that good against Duke – 19 points, nine rebounds and three blocked shots – he finally looked again like the player who many projected early this season to be a lottery pick and possibly the No. 1 player taken.

With Noel’s status now clouded by his impending ACL surgery, Len’s beatdown on Duke’s Mason Plumlee (4 points, 3 rebounds, 0 blocks) certainly did a lot to help the 7-footer’s draft status. A number of scouts, including Zydrunas Ilgauskas of the Cleveland Cavaliers, were in attendance.","2013-02-17 13:35:00","0","37.0","8.0","3.0","0.0","28.0","0.0","59.0","21.0","0.0","93.0","4.0","18.0","0","808","86.47","72.37","63.97","60.97","21.26","19.43","80.82","47.77","11.14","5.82","1.36","2.60","0.37","0.62","0.87","5.32","8.04","14.60","8.17","2.48","3.96","1.98","14.60","4.08","2.35","1.36","4.58","1.61","4.08","2.97","1.11","0.12","0.25","0.62","9.90","0.00","0.25","0.00","1.49","8.42","0.74","0.74","0.50","1.98","1.36","3.59","1.73","0.99","0.62","0.12","0.87","0.37","0.25","0.25","0.00","11.39","5.07","4.21","3.71","2.10","0.50","5.82","6.44","1.98","18.56","1.61","8.17","8.79","3.09","2.85","0.37","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.12","0.00","17.95","5.20","4.70","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","1.61","1.49","3.84","0.50","0.12","3587","7.4","23.25","1074","802","38","75.44","9.9","8.0","9.98","11.3","138","16.166666666666668","17.32279301745636","404","21.22","17","0.47","0","20","35","77","0","98","51","2","1","13","120","103","1","31","1","0","44","12","37","0","0","5","23","0","33","36","24","21","21","11","7","7","1","1"

"http://www.mcall.com/sports/bs-sp-ravens-john-harbaugh-critical-1001-20130930-story.html","Day after loss to Buffalo, John Harbaugh doesn't hold back","Ravens coach John Harbaugh wasn't willing to second guess the decision Sunday to abandon the run game nor was he in the mood to protect some of the team's under-performing players.

Given ample time to digest Sunday's mistake-filled 23-20 road loss to the Buffalo Bills, a candid Harbaugh called the offensive line ""disappointing,"" challenged drops-prone tight end Ed Dickson to ""go catch the ball,"" and defended the play-calling.

Quarterback Joe Flacco dropped back to pass on 31 straight plays at one point and the Ravens' ran the ball a franchise-low nine times, including only twice in the second half, for just 24 yards. As Flacco endured one of the most difficult days of his career, running backs Ray Rice and Bernard Pierce were reduced to mere spectators.

""I just felt like we weren't running the ball well enough to win the game running the ball,"" Harbaugh said. ""Looking back on it, I feel the same way, and after watching the tape, I feel we did exactly the right thing to try to win that game, so no second-guessing myself on that. That was my decision and that's the way we went with it.""

The strategy nearly worked as the Ravens rallied back from a 13-point halftime deficit and twice had the ball in Bills' territory late in the fourth quarter with a chance to either tie the game or go ahead. However, Flacco's career-high fifth interception with 57 seconds to play ended the threat and dropped the Ravens to 2-2 and into a three-way tie with the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns for first place in the AFC North. The Ravens play the Miami Dolphins Sunday.

Both Harbaugh and Flacco took turns late Sunday afternoon shouldering the blame for the loss. A day later, though, Harbaugh expanded on what is ailing the offense through four games and most of the discussion centered on the offensive line.

He called the pass-blocking ""unacceptable"" Sunday when Flacco was sacked four times and took 12 quarterback hits. The run blocking has been a problem as the Ravens are 28th in the NFL in rushing yards per game (64.0) and 30th in yards per rushing attempt (2.6).

""I think the whole O-line is disappointing right now,"" Harbaugh said. ""We've got to run block better, we've got to pass block better. We felt like we were making strides, especially with pass blocking. But we really didn't do as good of a job in this game. We had too many mental mistakes — too many things that are basic protection rules that we understand and we should know.

""We've got to make decisions scheme-wise about what's best for our guys to do. We've got to come off the ball in the run game a lot better than we're doing and we've got to be more physical with the inside part of our pass protection and give Joe more depth to the pocket and keep Joe more clean. Joe does not need to be under the pressure he's under.""

The only two differences between the current offensive line and the one that played so well during the Ravens' Super Bowl run is Gino Gradkowski is starting at center in place of the retired Matt Birk and run game coordinator Juan Castillo has taken the lead role over Andy Moeller in coaching the group.

""The issue is what it always is: We've just got to get better. We've got to go to work and improve the things we can improve, make good decisions on what we choose to do and how we choose to scheme it,"" Harbaugh said. ""Yes, we can game-plan better. We can set formations up better to put our guys in a position. Our running backs can do a better job of running to the right spot and trusting the offensive line. It has nothing to do with style or technique or anything like that.

""It's the same offense. We still run the same plays. We still have the same philosophy. There are always a few wrinkles. That's why I brought Juan in, because I was excited about things I knew he was going to bring to the table and bring to our program. Those things are part of what we're doing.""

As for Gradkowski, Harbaugh said that he was pleased with how the second-year center has held up physically but acknowledged that there has been an adjustment with the departure of Birk.

""It's the difference between Gino and Matt with the [line] calls and we're feeling that in there right now,"" Harbaugh said. ""Gino is a really smart guy, but Matt had been at it for a lot of years. So, that's something that we're working through.""

Harbaugh said that a couple of Flacco's interceptions were impacted by the Bills' pass rush. He also pointed out that two of them came on tipped balls. On the final one, Flacco tried to fit the ball in to tight end Dallas Clark while safety Da'Norris Searcy was draped all over him. The ball deflected into the air and intercepted by Kiko Alonso.

Flacco's second pick hit Dickson right in the hands and then landed into the lap of former Raven Jim Leonhard. It was unofficially the sixth drop of the season for Dickson, who has had a major problem holding onto the ball since his 54-catch 2011 season.","2013-09-30 22:55:00","0","25.0","3.0","3.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","55.0","21.0","0.0","79.0","4.0","15.0","0","908","89.02","77.63","45.13","41.71","20.18","15.42","83.15","48.68","10.02","5.62","0.99","3.52","0.00","0.99","0.11","4.41","10.02","14.54","7.60","3.85","5.62","0.77","16.63","5.29","3.52","1.10","4.19","2.09","5.95","3.30","2.42","0.22","0.88","0.66","8.04","0.00","0.33","0.00","1.32","7.93","1.98","1.10","0.66","1.65","0.66","2.20","1.76","0.22","0.66","0.88","0.66","0.22","0.33","0.00","0.22","12.00","4.85","2.97","2.09","2.75","1.32","6.72","8.70","0.44","16.74","4.30","8.04","4.74","1.54","3.63","0.11","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.55","0.00","0.22","0.11","0.22","0.00","16.63","4.96","2.97","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.87","2.64","3.41","0.44","0.22","3888","6.9","20.8","1170","891","46","77.16","9.7","7.3","9.23","9.8","130","16.166666666666668","15.596139169472503","411","18.31","11","0.48","0","34","26","98","0","107","55","6","2","5","135","86","2","32","0","0","53","9","38","4","1","5","35","0","43","58","28","14","26","18","3","6","0","4"
"http://www.mcall.com/sports/bs-sp-terps-duke-sidebar-seth-allen-0217-20130216-story.html","Despite turnovers, Seth Allen points Terps to win over Duke","During halftime of Saturday night's game against No. 2 Duke at Comcast Center, Maryland freshman point guard Seth Allen gave himself a little pep talk.

Not only had his Duke counterpart, sophomore Quinn Cook, scored 11 points, but Allen was scoreless. Allen had taken just one shot and had not done much to help the Terps take a one-point halftime lead.

""The first half, I was just really trying to defend as much as I could, get guys into it [the offense], I didn't really shoot that much the first half,"" said Allen, who started at point guard for only the second time in the Terps' last seven games. ""The second half, I was more aggressiive, I just attacked a little more.""

If sophomore center Alex Len's 19 points and nine rebounds helped Maryland take as much as a 10-point lead in the second half, Allen's 16 second-half points enabled the Terps to beat the Blue Devils, 83-81.

Allen's two free throws off a drive with 2.8 seconds left provided the winning points.

""Seth made a good run at the end pressuring them,"" said sophomore guard Nick Faust (City), who started the previous three games at point guard. ""He's a great driver and he went right by them or got fouled.""

Unlike some of his other wildly erratic performances this season, Allen overcame a team-high eight turnovers — tying a season-high — to give Maryland the offensive boost it needed when foul trouble put Len and sophomore swingman Dez Wells on the bench. Wells fouled out with 38 seconds to go.

""He made a lot of plays late, and he is hard to keep in front of you,"" second-year coach Mark Turgeon said of Allen, whose second-half defense on Cook (2 of 7 after going 4 of 9 in the first half) was nearly negated by a 40-footer at the buzzer that hit the back of the rim.

Turgeon had a simple message for his point guard about his turnovers.

""He said, 'just keep playing through 'em, that's a big test to your maturity, doing the next play,' "" Allen said. ""I just tried to have amnesia and keep playing the next play every time.""

Asked about his turnovers, Allen said: ""I don't know what was going on. I just wanted to make a play so much, I was trying to explode to the basket. My shoe fell off, I was slipping, there were times on outlet passes when I was just fumbling [the ball]. I just got to be more focused [late in the game].""

Allen was focused at the foul line. His final two free throws gave him 7 of 8 for the game after a week when he and the rest of his teammates took 500 free throws each. Allen said he hit ""427, or something like that.""

""I just comfortable in my routine and knock them down,"" Allen said about his free-throw shooting in the game.

He might have to get comfortable in his role as a point guard again.

It's something that Turgeon has waffled about all season because he thought those responsibilties put too much pressure on Allen and took away from his natural role as a scorer.

It seems likely that Allen will be the point guard for the rest of the season — or at least Tuesday night at Boston College.

Turgeon, who suspended junior point guard Pe'Shon Howard for Saturday's game — and possibly longer — for breaking unspecified team rules, was proud of a player who showed off his athleticism and fearlessness on Saturday night against Duke.

""The kid grew up tonight,"" Turgeon said.

"http://www.mcall.com/sports/olympics/la-sp-ioc-thomas-bach-20130911-story.html","Germany's Thomas Bach elected IOC president","BUENOS AIRES — Thomas Bach was doing media interviews Tuesday when Dmitry Chernyshenko, head of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic organizing committee, interrupted to hand Bach a cellphone. On the line was Russian President Vladimir Putin, the first head of state to speak with Bach after the German had been elected the ninth president of the International Olympic Committee.

""We did not discuss the law,"" Bach said, laughing, after his brief conversation with Putin.

But how the IOC deals with all the issues related to ""the law,"" Russia's recent anti-gay legislation, is a serious challenge Bach immediately faces after becoming the eighth white European man in the IOC presidency.

The IOC has been slow to recognize the level of concern the Russian law has caused in many western nations. It also has not formulated a plan for dealing with any Sochi Olympian who chooses to make or wear a show of support for Russia's LGBT community or gay rights that could be viewed as a violation of the Olympic charter.

Chernyshenko asked the IOC on Sunday to help end the controversy over the law and to ""stop this campaign and speculation.""

Bach, a 59-year-old attorney and 1976 Olympic fencing champion, said this was not the time to discuss the details of how the IOC will handle such incidents, but he clearly sees the need to let athletes and their national Olympic committees know in advance what to expect.

""We will follow our values and the Olympic charter to make sure the Olympic Games and the participants in the Olympic Games can compete and participate without discrimination,"" Bach said. ""We have the clear assurances of the highest authorities in Russia, and we trust those assurances.

""The policy of the IOC in more detail will be worked out and communicated with the national Olympic Committee and the athletes.""

The Olympic charter prohibits discrimination on the basis of ""race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise."" Rule 50 of the charter also bans demonstrations and ""political, religious or racial propaganda"" in Olympic sites or venues. Among potential penalties for violating the charter is being sent home from the Olympics.

The U.S. Olympic Committee is waiting for IOC guidance on the matter, although its chairman, Larry Probst, said Tuesday he may discuss the issue at an upcoming meeting with Bach.

""With regard to any demonstration or protest, that's going to be an IOC call,"" said Probst, elected as an IOC member Tuesday.

Anita DeFrantz, who won a place on the IOC executive board, said sending someone home for a gesture like wearing a rainbow pin ""sounds like it's going too far.""

IOC spokesman Mark Adams said athletes will not be prohibited from answering questions about gay rights at a news conference.

The vaguely worded Russian law prohibits ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations"" and calls for penalties that include arrest, fine and deportation.

""It's a disgusting law, but when you are there, you are there as a guest,"" IOC member Dick Pound of Canada said. ""If I were the IOC, I would say, `You know the rule, there is to be nothing. If you violate it, you risk being disciplined.'''

Pound said even a small pin could be seen as a violation. The Swedish Olympic Committee agreed when it warned its 2014 Olympians not to follow the example of the two Swedish women track and field athletes who showed their support for gay rights with rainbow fingernails at last month's World Championships in Moscow. The international and Swedish track federations told the athletes not to have the rainbow nails while competing.

""The IOC has very clear rules on what you can do and not do,"" said IOC executive board member Gunilla Lindberg of Sweden. ""For me, nail polish is such a stupid thing to react on.''

IOC member Prince Albert of Monaco said he would not send an athlete home for a small gesture and agreed that Rule 50 is ""a little strict.""

""There has to be a rule at some point,"" Prince Albert said. ""It's never going to be an easy issue. We have to find the best solution.""

To two of the losing candidates in Tuesday's presidential election, Richard Carrion of Puerto Rico and Ching-Kuo Wu of Chinese Taipei, it is imperative the IOC tell all potential Olympic host cities they cannot have laws like Russia's that, in Wu's words, ""contradict the Olympic charter.""

That message could apply to an American city wanting to host the 2024 Summer Games.

The fact that DeFrantz and Probst won elections Tuesday confirms that U.S. Olympic officials are succeeding in their quest to improve relations with the IOC.

A recent squabble over revenue sharing — which may have doomed bids by New York and Chicago — has been settled.

"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/la-ol-iran-news-human-rights-20130918-story.html","Iran frees prominent dissidents: What the tea leaves say","There was big news out of Iran on Wednesday: It freed heroic human rights activist Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer whose crime was defending dissidents. She had been serving a six-year sentence, down from 11 years. But almost everything Iran does is part of a bigger story. The release of Sotoudeh and almost a dozen other political prisoners (mostly female) can be read four ways.

First, it may be a hopeful hint that Iran understands the costs, both at home and in the world’s eyes, of its egregious crackdowns in recent years. New President Hassan Rouhani had pledged to ease rigid restrictions on both political and social life during the campaign this spring. This is the first follow-through.

Second, and more cynically, the releases come on the eve of Rouhani’s debut speech at the United Nations next week. In the past, Iran has released prisoners on the eve of trips abroad by top officials. But this is the most significant.

Third, Iran also still has many, many political prisoners, most notably former presidential candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who have been under house arrest since shortly after the disputed 2009 presidential election. The Guardian newspaper estimated recently that Iran had about 800 political prisoners or prisoners of conscience. Iran must do far more to be taken seriously on human rights issues.

And finally, there is a U.S. angle. President Obama cited Sotoudeh in his March 2011 message to the Iranian people on their Nowruz new year’s celebrations. He said:

“For nearly two years, there has been a campaign of intimidation and abuse. Young and old, men and women, rich and poor -- the Iranian people have been persecuted. Hundreds of prisoners of conscience are in jail. The innocent have gone missing. Journalists have been silenced. Women tortured. Children sentenced to death. The world has watched these unjust actions with alarm. We have seen Nasrin Sotoudeh jailed for defending human rights.... These choices do not demonstrate strength, they show fear. For it is telling when a government is so afraid of its own citizens.”

Obama and Rouhani will both speak to the world body on Tuesday. There is much talk about whether the U.N. opening will produce a chance handshake or, perhaps more likely, what in diplo-speak is called a meet-and-greet between U.S. and Iranian foreign ministers.

So, I wonder, is this move a signal? Does this set the stage for something else, something bigger? In light of all that looms ahead between the United States and Iran, you have to hope.

Maybe Carly Rae Jepsen should give her number to a pitching coach.

The pop music star had the honor of throwing out the first pitch before Sunday’s contest between the Houston Astros and host Tampa Bay Rays. Unfortunately, it went down as arguably one of the worst displays in ceremonial pitching history.

Not only did Jepsen fail to get the ball to home plate, she completely missed the home plate circle. Her late release sent the ball nose-diving into the grass halfway between the mound and the plate.

Oh well, baseball isn’t Jepsen’s day job, and at least she could laugh about it. Of course, she might want to work on her technique a little more before agreeing to throw a pitch in front of thousands of fans (or perhaps just hundreds based on how empty Tropicana Field was on Sunday).

Still, you don’t need to be a baseball player to make a spectacular ceremonial pitch.

The commander-in-chief made his sixth visit to “The Tonight Show” on Tuesday, his first since being reelected last November

In a wide-ranging conversation, Obama and host Jay Leno discussed a variety of subjects, including healthcare, the economy, the death of the Trayvon Martin, the National Security Agency’s surveillance program, his “bromance” with John McCain and tensions with Russia.

That left little time for the usual late-night small talk, though Leno did squeeze in a few barbs about the president’s graying hair and his professed love for broccoli.

PHOTOS: Celebrities by The Times

First on the docket was the global terror warning issued over the weekend. Leno asked whether the warning, as some have suggested, was an overreaction following the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, last year.

Obama refuted that possibility but said “the first thing I think about when we wake up and the last thing I think about when I go to bed is making sure that I’m doing everything I can to keep Americans safe.”

The subject provided an easy segue into a discussion of the NSA’s massive data-gathering program, leaked to the media earlier this year by Edward Snowden. The president defended the program, saying “this intelligence-gathering that we do is a critical component of counterterrorism,” but expressed sympathy with those who are concerned about government overreach — in fact, he said he was wary of the program himself when he came into office, and added “additional safeguards” to ensure that civil liberties were being protected.

“We should be skeptical about the potential encroachments on privacy,” Obama said, though he asserted that “none of the revelations show that government has abused these powers.”

As for the tense relations with the Russian government, which granted Snowden a year of asylum, Obama said, “There are times when they slip back into Cold War thinking and a Cold War mentality.”

He also expressed disapproval of severe anti-gay measures recently enacted in that country. “I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays and lesbians and transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them,” he said.

The president did not, however, expect Russia’s human-rights record to be an issue during the Winter Olympics in Sochi: “I think Putin and Russia have a big stake in making sure the Olympics work, and I think they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics, we wouldn’t tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently.”

Less tense, at least at the moment, is Obama’s relationship with onetime rival McCain, who’s been an important ally in the fight for immigration reform.

“That's how a classic romantic-comedy goes. Initially you're not getting along and then you keep on bumping into each other,” he joked, praising McCain’s willingness to “go against the grain of his own party.”

Leno also inquired about another former Obama adversary, Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose recent lunch with the president fueled the already-rampant speculation about her 2016 campaign plans. “By the end of my first term, we had become genuinely close,” he said. Asked whether she was “measuring the drapes in the Oval Office,” Obama fired back, “Keep in mind she’s been there before. She doesn’t have to measure them.”

After Obama explained some of the changes that will take place once key parts of his healthcare plan go into effect Oct. 1, Leno turned to the subject of Trayvon Martin, expressing admiration for the president’s recent remarks about the verdict and the larger issues of racial discrimination. \

CRITICS' PICKS: What to see, do and eat

“What I wanted to try to explain was why this was a particularly sensitive topic for African American families, because a lot of people who have sons know the experience they had of being followed, being viewed suspiciously,” he said.

“We all know that young African American men disproportionally have an involvement in criminal activities and violence, for a lot of reasons,” the president continued, citing factors such as poverty, failing schools and blighted communities.

“That’s no excuse, but what we also believe in is everybody should be treated fairly and the system should work for everyone. So what I’m trying to do is just make sure that we have a conversation and that we’re all asking ourselves are there some things that we can do to better foster understanding and to make sure that we don’t have laws in place that encourage the kind of violent encounter that we saw there that resulted in tragedy,” he said.

It said, ""Dedicated to our friend Kevin Cordasco."" But Cordasco wasn't a crew or cast member, he was a teenage fan of the show who died of cancer in March.

According to the Los Angeles Daily News, the 16-year-old Cordasco battled a rare form of cancer for seven years and became captivated by star Bryan Cranston's character, Walter White, whose own cancer diagnosis prompts him to refashion his life as an increasingly powerful drug lord.

Through a family connection in the entertainment industry, Cordasco was able to meet Cranston, series creator Vince Gilligan and several other members of the cast. He'd even been invited to visit the Albuquerque, N.M., set, but had to decline because of his poor health.

PHOTOS: Backstage at 'Breaking Bad'

One of the most fascinating aspects of Cordasco's relationship to the series was that he had reportedly been offered a copy of the script for the show's final episode. It was gift he could have so long as he signed something that guaranteed he wouldn't discuss the contents of the script with anyone else. However, Cordasco turned down the offer, preferring to see the final episode instead of reading it, and unsure if he could keep the conclusion to himself.

Sadly, Cordasco died before he had a chance to watch the final episode. According to the story, the dedication was requested by Gilligan himself. It's only the fourth time the series has dedicated an episode to someone.

The soldiers clashed in a three-day battle that would paint its streets and pastoral farmlands crimson in the bloodiest encounter of the Civil War.

Today, the town of 8,000 braces for another invasion of as many as 70,000 Americans on July 1, 2 and 3 and a predicted 200,000 during the 150th observance of the Battle of Gettysburg June 28 to July 7. Officials and residents are working hard to be ready for the onslaught.

A sampling of the blow-your-hat-off experiences for Civil War fans brave enough to advance on Gettysburg during this special time: climbing the cupola where Gen. John Buford plotted his strategy while monitoring Confederates advancing on the town, seeing the official casting of President Abraham Lincoln's face, viewing 3,550 luminaria on soldiers' graves, joining thousands of visitors in a walk-the-battlefield special observance of Pickett's Charge, and watching two major re-enactments involving 10,000 men.

Major events include:

•A commemorative ceremony on June 30 called ""Gettysburg: New Birth of Freedom.""

•The openings of a ""Treasures of the Civil War"" exhibit, the Spangler Farm Civil War Field Hospital site and the new Seminary Ridge Museum.

•The Blue-Gray Alliance Re-enactment June 29 and 30 at the Bushey Farm, and the 150th Anniversary Gettysburg National Civil War Battle Re-enactment July 4-7 at the Redding Farm.

In addition, there are many smaller, more personal events that will bring the battle and its aftermath into focus. These include the Songs and Stories of a Civil War Hospital, in Gettysburg's Christ Church June 29 and July 6, and Confederates Take the Shriver House, on July 6.

So anyone considering a visit needs an organized battle plan. Map out your plan of attack, using two handbooks.

The first, the 72-page Gettysburg 150th Anniversary Commemorative Events Guide, details programming by the Gettysburg National Military Park and its partner organization, the Gettysburg Foundation. It will be available at the Visitor Center and other locations in the park.

The second, from the Gettysburg Convention & Visitors Bureau, will be all-inclusive, covering town and county events including the two major re-enactments, a new downtown Gettysburg Independence Day parade and Cashtown's three-day observance of Lee's Approach to Gettysburg. It also will cover satellite parking, shuttle routes for the 10-day observance, restroom locations and places to eat.

The printed version will be available at the Convention & Visitors Bureau office and its tourist information tents in town and at satellite parking locations. Although printing isn't scheduled until mid-June, you can download a complete, calendar-style listing of all the 200-plus events for the 10-day observance at http://www.gettysburgcivilwar150.com. Click on ""events.""

Reading the guides' information will serve as a printed version of reveille. It's your wake-up call to the challenges to be faced when deciding which events to attend.

""Don't arrive without a room, if you intend to stay overnight,"" says Carl Whitehill, Gettysburg Convention & Visitors bureau spokesman.

Most hotels in Gettysburg already are booked. ""The best way to connect with available hotels is to call us at 800-337-5015,"" Whitehall says. ""We're keeping a list, so visitors won't have to make so many calls."" He reported some vacancies in Adams County in early May, but many visitors will wind up in York, Dauphin and Cumberland counties, or even in nearby Maryland.

Day-trippers shouldn't have any worries, Whitehill says. Approach Gettysburg (about 2 hours and 125 miles away) via routes 15 or 30 and you'll encounter electronic signs directing you to satellite parking lots. ""Leave your car behind and take free transportation into Gettysburg,"" Whitehill advises. ""At the in-town depot, you can board trolleys for most of the commemoration's key observances.""

You will need your car, however, if you're planning to attend one of the major re-enactments staged on the Bushey or Redding farms. Ample parking will be available on designated farm fields.

Could potential visitors become overwhelmed by so many things to do during the 150th commemoration? ""I can't say I've worried about that,"" says Cindy Small, spokeswoman for the Gettysburg Foundation, which stages events in conjunction with the national military park.

""We have focused on providing all of the information we could about all of our events, so individuals and families can customize their experience, based on their interests,"" Small says. ""If they use our guide to do their homework, they'll know what they want to do when they arrive.""

Besides daily park events for the 10-day observance, the guide also provides maps of park traffic patterns and shuttle routes that will change daily July 1-4, and information about the park's Visitor Center and other special locations including The George Spangler House, Rupp House and David Wills House.

""We put pressure on ourselves to make this year very special,"" says Katie Lawhon, spokeswoman for the national military park. ""We've added many new ranger programs so there will be plenty for everyone to do."" The expanded programming means visitors will spread out to many sites on the 5,000-acre battlefield.

The huge re-enactments are expected to be the biggest draws, Whitehill says.

Here are more details on some of the other events:

Ceremony: Make plans to attend the ""Gettysburg: A New Birth of Freedom"" ceremony, which starts 7:30 p.m. June 30. Highlights: country music star Trace Adkins singing the national anthem, keynote speech by Civil War historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, and a Voices of History reading of eyewitness accounts by soldiers and citizens swept into the battle.

Presented in a natural amphitheater on the battlefield, the dramatic setting includes views of Widow Leister's Farmhouse and Barn, which served as Gen. George Meade's headquarters, and Big and Little Roundtop. The evening's finale invites visitors to join a procession from the amphitheater to the Soldiers National Cemetery to see thousands of luminaries commemorating the Union soldiers who lost their lives in the battle.","2013-05-11 18:18:00","0","52.0","24.0","0.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","40.0","21.0","0.0","84.0","4.0","16.0","0","1023","95.27","71.79","33.68","11.76","21.31","27.37","70.97","39.10","5.96","3.23","0.20","0.88","1.17","0.20","0.78","2.74","8.60","13.98","5.08","2.15","5.87","0.59","10.26","3.91","1.08","0.98","5.57","2.25","3.71","1.27","2.35","0.39","1.76","0.29","6.16","0.20","0.10","0.00","0.29","6.35","0.88","1.47","1.17","1.47","0.59","1.66","2.74","0.78","1.66","0.10","0.68","0.29","0.29","0.00","0.10","7.62","1.66","1.47","4.01","0.98","0.00","0.98","6.94","2.35","17.11","2.05","9.97","5.18","1.96","0.88","0.88","0.29","0.39","0.88","0.10","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.11","4.89","6.45","0.78","0.00","0.10","0.00","2.93","2.74","2.35","0.20","0.68","5030","8.25","23.11111111111111","1520","978","47","50.36","13.2","11.4","14.1","14.5","222","11.625","19.399754601226995","494","20.82","5","0.4","1","39","54","96","1","117","74","2","5","18","127","179","1","83","2","0","23","16","18","1","0","2","26","0","43","18","27","8","26","18","7","4","0","3"
"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/mc-seminary-ridge-museum-gettysburg-20130504-story.html","Gettysburg's Seminary Ridge Museum adds new dimensions to Civil War story","Thundering cannon fire and staccato rifle shots, mingled with the shrieks and cries of advancing and wounded soldiers, shattered the peaceful grounds of the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863.

Gettysburg's new Seminary Ridge Museum and its gripping Civil War content now occupies the seminary building that became engulfed in the first day's fighting.

The grand opening is July 1 — exactly 150 years after the bloodiest three-day battle of the Civil War erupted not far from its doors. It is a key event in the 10-day, 150th Gettysburg Commemoration that is expected to draw thousands of visitors to the town and its National Military Park and Visitor Center.

Previously called Schmucker Hall, the museum's building was a hilltop landmark before the Civil War began and could be seen for miles. From the top of its famous cupola (you've seen it if you watched the movie ""Gettysburg"") to its ground-floor orientation film, the new museum is a fitting flagship attraction for the battle's 150th observance.

It also offers an extreme Civil War experience — visitors can climb the steep, narrow and winding stairs to the cupola. Those limber enough and lucky enough to secure timed tickets for the cupola climb will stand where Union Gen. John Buford watched the Confederate advance on the town and plotted his strategy.

A preview of the museum revealed an extraordinary place that uses ordinary people — soldiers and citizens — to tell the stories of tumultuous times. Their recollections and writings, printed on museum walls and heard in recordings that play in the hallways, can be heartwarming, horrifying or haunting.

""The museum building is our biggest artifact. Based on the roles it played in the battle, it told us the stories we should tell,"" says Barbara Franco, museum executive director.

But it whispers, too. ""After hours, when the voices are turned off in the exhibits, I hear plenty of creaks and other noises. I believe the building still contains the energy of people who have passed through it,"" Franco says.

Even the museum's walls and floors have talked. During renovations to the brick, Federal-style building constructed on Seminary Ridge in 1832, work crews discovered an envelope of letters to a Civil War soldier beneath the floorboards, a sarsaparilla bottle and old shoes in its walls.

The museum focuses on the pivotal first day of the Battle of Gettysburg on McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge on the fourth floor; Schmucker Hall's use as a field hospital for 600 soldiers on the third floor and the moral, civic and spiritual debates shaping the era on the second floor.

The first floor contains an orientation film, museum shop, ticket counter and restrooms. The museum's main entrance is accessed from the Spring Street parking lot at the rear of the building.

Although you'll find some of this information at other Gettysburg locations, the new museum isn't competing with other attractions. ""Our stories are not as well-covered by the National Military Museum and other locations. They're also unique because of our perspective that keeps the building in focus,"" Franco says.

Besides the introductory video, additional short videos set the tone for each of the three other floors' themes.

The second floor explores slavery, Biblical arguments for and against slavery, Adams County's population of free blacks and the Underground Railroad, and also includes some mind-stretching, touch-screen exercises giving visitors a taste of problems Americans faced.

Take Samuel Simon Schmucker, founder of the seminary and an outspoken abolitionist. What was he to do when he inherited slaves that belonged to his second wife's family? Among other problems presented: How could a Quaker help the Northern cause without fighting? Should a young black resident of Gettysburg join the Army and fight or should he flee?

Noted Civil War artist Dale Gallon created 10 oil paintings to help tell the museum's story on the battle's first day, from the ""Rebels are in Cashtown"" (showing the panic in downtown Gettysburg when residents realized trouble was headed their way) and ""Buford's Boys"" (Union soldiers fighting on McPherson's Ridge) to the ""Withdrawal of the 151st Pennsylvania"" (after holding off several Confederate advances, the men retreated and re-formed on Cemetery Hill) and ""Days End, July 1"" (with Confederates in possession of the seminary and its surrounding property).

Additional room-size displays, with life-like, full-size figures, graphically convey the pain and suffering endured by soldiers waiting for treatment and recovering with the help of nurses and orderlies. There's also a riveting scene of a doctor with a raised saw preparing to amputate a soldier's leg. ""Blood"" is smeared on floors and walls and forms pools beside soldiers' wounds.

Lt. Col. George F. McFarland is shown in his bed, recovering from bullet wounds to both legs and the amputation of one leg. His wife and children are gathered at his bedside. But McFarland didn't make it to the field hospital on his own. As Union troops gave up the hilltop position, McFarland writes, ""One of my boys carried me in the north end of the Theological Seminary, while the Confederates came in the South End.""

Even then, he wasn't totally out of danger. On July 3, he narrowly averted death when an artillery shell penetrated the wall of his room and passed directly over his head. The 151st Pennsylvania officer was the last patient to leave the hospital on Sept. 16.

Franco says the museum has the names of nearly 400 of the 600 soldiers cared for in Schmucker Hall.

Dozens of first-person accounts from civilians and soldiers set the new Seminary Ridge Museum apart from other Gettysburg experiences, which include Visitor Center tours, battlefield walks and trips to Soldiers National Cemetery where Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address.

Its content personalizes the war. Suddenly, you ""know"" soldiers whose blood was shed on the battlefields and understand the challenges faced by civilians during and after the fighting ended.

You meet Sarah Broadhead, a Gettysburg resident whose diary records an encounter with a soldier whose wounded leg had not been treated and was ""crawling with worms."" Her writings also reveal another disturbing discovery at the foot of the seminary's basement stairway, five days after the battle had ended.","2013-05-04 17:44:00","0","44.0","20.0","0.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","36.0","20.0","0.0","84.0","4.0","16.0","0","1038","96.34","69.52","37.41","7.78","20.35","27.17","78.81","42.20","6.65","2.99","0.39","0.48","0.48","1.45","0.19","3.66","10.98","13.39","4.05","2.12","6.26","0.67","9.06","2.99","1.25","1.25","2.89","0.77","4.43","1.45","2.99","0.19","2.12","0.19","7.32","0.29","0.00","0.29","1.64","6.07","1.54","0.77","0.96","0.77","0.29","2.12","3.08","1.35","0.96","0.39","2.41","0.87","1.45","0.00","0.10","8.86","1.93","1.83","4.62","0.58","0.67","3.56","4.72","0.48","17.44","1.73","10.40","5.30","0.67","3.08","0.96","0.39","1.45","0.96","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.00","16.47","4.62","4.62","0.10","0.10","0.29","0.00","1.16","2.31","2.31","0.96","0.00","5168","8.43","23.043478260869566","1592","1030","47","57.71","13.5","10.7","13.05","14.2","242","11.375","20.158058252427185","533","20.57","4","0.42","0","47","22","121","0","121","68","3","2","8","168","129","3","91","0","0","24","24","29","0","0","3","17","0","19","46","22","23","21","30","7","2","3","6"
"http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/redeye-mud-review-20130423-column.html","'Mud' review: Take dirt, add tears","*** (out of four)

“Mud,” a backwoods tale of Southern justice and broken hearts, takes place in a world where spitting on your hands and shaking constitutes as solid a deal as any. That binds a contract between Mud (Matthew McConaughey) and 14-year-old Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), who with his pal Ellis (Tye Sheridan of “The Tree of Life”) has been routinely sneaking off in their little boat to deliver goods to Mud on the island where he’s hiding out.

Mud says he's waiting to reunite with his girlfriend, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Ellis, whose parents (Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson) are on the outs, particularly takes to Mud's determined chivalry. After all, Ellis doesn't hesitate to punch a guy he believes is doing a woman wrong, a philosophy Mud shares. Their bond drives “Mud,” which is a lower-key effort than writer-director Jeff Nichols' “Take Shelter,” whose star Michael Shannon appears this time as Neckbone's mildly sleazy uncle.

Nichols captures a great sense of place and numerous rewarding exchanges, including Mud explaining why he doesn't mind being called a hobo or homeless—but don't you dare call him a bum. The director gets fantastic work from Sheridan and McConaughey, who brings truth to the kind of charismatic, potentially untrustworthy fellow that turns up frequently on screen. Each romantic relationship in “Mud” seems one-dimensional and doomed to fail, so there's less emotional engagement than detached observation of one tragic matter of the heart after another.

A few too many plot developments pile up at the end of “Mud,” but it's a film whose focus and friendship makes for a consistently engaging two hours. If nothing else, it's a story about how at one point or another love makes liars of us all, either to others or ourselves.

"http://www.mcall.com/business/mc-outlook-mcglade-20130311-story.html","John E. McGlade, Chairman, president and CEO of Air Products","Air Products has been a member of the Lehigh Valley community for nearly 70 years. During that time we have seen many changes in our area, as well as in our company, where we have grown both here and globally.

We believe one of the key strengths our company has, and continues to be, is our people. We employ more than 3,500 talented people in the greater Lehigh Valley. We are fortunate that this area has many excellent pathways from which to recruit people locally. Equally significant, the attractive quality of life in the area represents an important factor in the decision of potential employees we recruit from other states and countries.

The strengths of the Lehigh Valley range from its exceptional educational school systems, bolstered by the presence of some of the most prestigious universities and colleges offering top-tier engineering and liberal arts educational programs, to the historical significance of Bethlehem as one of the United States' oldest cities.

There are abundant and growing opportunities to enjoy arts and cultural programs and many area festivals, combined with professional sporting events throughout the year. We have one of the best and most expansive park systems in the country. The Lehigh Valley's location makes it a short trip to New York or Philadelphia, in addition to more distant destinations from Lehigh Valley International Airport.

These tangible items are all enhanced by several other important attributes. Residents of the Lehigh Valley take great pride in our communities, have a known reputation for a good work ethic, and have a willingness to get involved. The area benefits from the strength and value added by some 1,800 nonprofit organizations. The region's quality of life is augmented by the availability of high quality health care. There is a general niceness of the people in our communities supported by diversity of choice in faith and worship. Many have found the area pleasant and affordable, and once here, often stay a lifetime.

Another benefit for companies locating here is a technically skilled labor force. One of the challenges facing businesses around the country is the shortage of workers with the right technical skills. This issue, in our view, is so important that we believe the United States needs a national technical skills agenda to make sure we consistently have the right kind of skilled workers available for the jobs of today and tomorrow.

SkillsUSA is a national organization that is a partnership of students, teachers and industry working together to ensure America has a skilled workforce. The Lehigh Valley has a local SkillsUSA Council, which consists of all the area's technical schools and annually serves more than 6,000 career and technical education students. These students are prepared for the rapidly changing skills demanded in the workplace. Beyond career-focused education, these students learn valuable teamwork, leadership, communication and other skills termed 21st-century employability skills. We have been fortunate enough to see these programs in action and meet these very capable students. Employers here are lucky to have this council and this developing talent in our midst.

When a company asks for advice about choosing to locate in the Lehigh Valley, reflection on the words of our founder Leonard Pool, the man who brought Air Products to this area and what he declared as ""Air Products' Objectives,"" is appropriate. These objectives include:

•To make available to customers a combination of price, quality and service through friendly and trustworthy people that will make our company the best in the industry from which to buy.

•To establish wages, working conditions, benefits, opportunity and personal recognition that will make our company the best in our industry at which to work.

•To demonstrate that Air Products is a good neighbor and citizen by our active support of good government, education, health programs and other good work that benefits the entire community in which we operate.

These objectives are as relevant today as the day Leonard delivered them to Air Products' employees. We believe the quality of our people and their focus on these goals has a lot to do with the value and culture of the Lehigh Valley. We would also add that they provide a tremendous guide for success to anyone choosing this area to locate a business, live and work.","2013-03-11 00:00:00","0","18.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","28.0","15.0","0.0","69.0","4.0","14.0","0","714","93.61","89.35","14.17","99.00","22.31","30.11","84.59","45.10","9.66","4.34","0.00","3.78","0.00","0.14","0.42","5.32","9.10","14.71","5.32","2.38","5.60","0.00","8.96","5.04","2.80","1.26","1.68","2.94","6.44","6.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.66","0.00","0.42","0.00","0.28","7.14","1.68","2.10","0.28","1.68","0.56","0.98","0.42","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.84","0.00","0.84","0.00","0.00","15.55","5.46","4.76","4.34","2.94","0.14","1.26","8.68","0.84","12.32","1.26","8.68","2.52","11.90","0.84","0.28","0.98","0.28","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","11.20","4.48","4.62","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.42","0.28","0.84","0.00","0.42","3599","8.61","22.4375","1121","709","32","48.94","14.2","11.9","13.0","14.2","174","6.75","20.69664315937941","338","20.19","0","0.46","0","31","11","85","0","85","69","3","4","3","116","40","8","64","1","0","17","16","22","1","2","0","23","0","21","5","10","17","25","24","9","2","0","2"
"http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/la-fg-wn-mexico-michoacan-state-dead-20131108-story.html","Outspoken mayor from Mexico's Michoacan state found dead","MEXICO CITY — Ygnacio Lopez Mendoza was one of the few mayors from Mexico’s troubled state of Michoacan who openly sounded the alarm about the narco thugs whose extortion demands were targeting even small local governments like his.

“The insecurity … is something that everybody in the world knows, but no one talks about,” Lopez, who represented the rural municipality of Santa Ana Maya, told reporters in February. “Why? Because we have to deal with organized crime, we have to pay them.”

The Mexican government heard his complaints, promising to send more resources to the area after Lopez staged a hunger strike in Mexico City, the capital, last month. But others were listening too.

On Friday, the director of the Assn. of Local Authorities of Mexico said in a radio interview that Lopez had been abducted, tortured and killed. Lopez's body was discovered Thursday in his truck in the neighboring state of Guanajuato.

That state’s prosecutors would not confirm Friday that Lopez was slain, saying only that he died of “asphyxia secondary to neck trauma.” If his death becomes classified as a homicide, it will join a long list of similar cases in Mexico: In total, 47 mayors have been killed in the last eight years of drug-war violence, according to Ricardo Baptista, the director of the Local Authorities group.

But Lopez’s death also occurred at a time when the nation is wondering whether Michoacan, a key agricultural state just a few hours west of Mexico City, has been all but overrun by drug cartels. One group in particular, the Caballeros Templarios, or Knights Templar, has been fighting with a rival group over drug routes, shaking down businesses large and small, and violently clashing with peasant “self-defense” groups that have risen up in a number of rural pueblos.

There may be no security challenge more pressing for the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto than Michoacan, which has spiraled out of control as other parts of Mexico, including swaths of the U.S. border region, have seen some reductions in violence. In May, Peña Nieto sent a wave of troops to pacify a number of Michoacan hot spots. On Monday — about a week after attacks at nine electric plants in the state — he sent in troops and federal police to the busy Michoacan port of Lazaro Cardenas, where the Knights are said to extract much of their wealth by controlling the drug trade and running a vast extortion racket.

Local governments are regularly caught in the crossfire in Michoacan — and sometimes they are complicit. In 2009, the government of former President Felipe Calderon arrested 35 mayors, prosecutors and other officials who were accused of taking cartel bribes; but the case fell apart, and all 35 were eventually released from custody. More recently, some mayors allied with the cartels have fled their towns after the rise of the vigilante groups.

After a tour of Michoacan’s violence-scarred Tierra Caliente region in June, the Times reported that the Knights were controlling the lumber and livestock markets and extracting payments from homeowners, lime pickers, tortilla sellers — and from local governments.

Lopez had objected to the 10% cut that Knights demanded his government pay. “I would say that all of the mayors of Michoacan have this problem,” he said in October.

Baptista said Friday that such issues are common in a number of other Mexican states as well.

“It’s a very difficult situation,” he said.

Baptista said his contention that the mayor was abducted, tortured and killed was based on conversations he had with Lopez’s family, who had been told about his death by Guanajuato prosecutors.

"https://www.chron.com/neighborhood/katy/sports/article/TRACK-Carl-Lewis-joins-Houston-Cougars-coaching-9471912.php","TRACK: Carl Lewis joins Houston Cougars coaching staff","TRACK: Carl Lewis joins Houston Cougars coaching staff

Olympian and Cougar great Carl Lewis has joined the University of Houston’s track and field program as a volunteer coach announced head coach Leroy Burrell Thursday.

“Carl had indicated to me last spring that he was planning on moving back to Houston,” Burrell said. “That was an excellent opportunity for us to really sit down and give him a more active role with the program.""

Houston Track and Field also announced throws coach Will Blackburn has been promoted to Associate Head Coach.

“Will is one of the main cogs in everything we do here,” Burrell said. “He serves as our recruiting coordinator and organizes our officials and our travel on top of his coaching duties with the throws. It was a great opportunity for us to name him to that position so he would have more authority in our business operations.”

Lewis joins a staff of eight former Houston track and field alumni and will work with the sprinters and jumpers.

“When you think of track and field, several athletes come to mind, one being Carl Lewis.” Burrell said. “To have that type of name recognition and excellence associated with the program only enhances the training environment, credibility with our athletes and marketability with our recruits.”

For the past 14 years, Lewis has been back and forth from Philadelphia to Houston to be a part of the program. He is excited to join the staff and believes in coach Burrell’s philosophy. Lewis also brings a quality to the staff that is unlike any other.

“Leroy set up a great program and I have a different perspective. I haven’t seen a lot of the kids everyday so I can look at them objectively. With the emotional side, I can give them a different perspective on how to prepare for competition. I know how to win in a lot of these events. Adding another eye and ear to one of the best technical programs in the nation is great for me and I hope is good for them.”

Lewis is proud to return to his alma mater, a place that he believes helped him succeed. He hopes to bring that same quality to the future of Houston track and field.

“I tell people all the time that if I didn’t go here, you wouldn’t know me,” Lewis said. “I was a kid who was very good in high school, one of the best recruits from New Jersey, but there’s no way I would have progressed without the University of Houston, the coaching staff, Coach Tellez and all of them, but then not only that, Coach Yeoman, Coach Lewis, Coach Williams, Athletic Director Harry Fouke and the Cullen family.

It was a village for me to be successful, and that’s what the University of Houston is all about. We’re not pretentious in the sense that we are this or that. We’re the University of Houston, always being told we’re less but always doing more.”

Lewis is known as one of the greatest athletes in the world winning 10 Olympic medals, nine of those gold, and 10 world championship medals. He still holds the school records for the indoor 55-meter dash (6.07) and both indoor and outdoor long jump records 8.56m (28’-1”) and 8.62m (28’-3.5”). A six-time All-American, Lewis won six national championships and nine individual conference championships during his two seasons at Houston.

Lewis came to Houston to run for head coach Tom Tellez in 1979. A year later, he appeared on the national scene when he qualified for the United States team for the 1980 Olympics in the long jump and 4x100 relay team. Since then, he competed in four Olympic Games as a member of team USA.

He held the world record in the men’s 100-meter dash in 1991, until Burrell broke the record in 1994. The two were also a part of the US 4x100 relay team that broke the world record during the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.","2013-09-12 15:09:00","1","87.0","2.0","14.0","0.0","50.0","0.0","221.0","194.0","15.0","233.0","0.0","23.0","0","675","84.87","73.31","14.56","85.40","19.85","17.78","79.85","48.30","11.11","7.56","2.07","2.07","0.30","2.52","0.59","3.56","8.59","14.07","6.52","2.96","7.11","1.04","12.74","4.44","2.52","0.89","4.74","2.52","4.30","3.85","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.30","9.19","0.15","0.00","0.00","2.67","6.67","1.48","0.44","0.89","1.19","1.19","2.22","1.48","0.59","0.74","0.00","0.89","0.74","0.15","0.00","0.00","12.15","3.85","4.00","5.33","2.67","0.00","4.15","7.70","1.33","12.30","1.93","6.52","4.15","6.67","3.56","0.15","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.85","5.04","4.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.89","2.96","1.93","0.89","0.00","2948","6.79","23.655172413793103","893","665","36","78.08","10.4","7.0","9.63","9.7","94","10.2","15.054135338345866","317","20.86","15","0.48","0","31","36","72","0","80","36","2","3","5","96","77","4","28","1","1","43","9","21","3","0","2","22","0","20","26","9","11","16","23","2","2","0","4"

As Halloween approaches, many will wonder how to spend their night of celebratory fright, but upon driving through Splendora, along US 59, the flashing lights of an ambulance and the sound of joyously terrified screams will point many in the right direction.

Containment Zone, which recently opened for business, may look like any other house of fears from the outside, but on the inside, it’s full of all the things nightmares are made of; but all in good fun, of course.

“We do want to scare people, but we want to do it in a way that’s fun,” said Brian Mladenka, who is one of the owners of the entertainment venue. “We are very family-oriented and we definitely want to do this for the kids.”

Mladenka, along with friend and business partner Thomas Siry, opened Containment Zone after being involved with the haunted houses used in various holiday programs benefitting Splendora Youth Football for the past seven years.

Upon realizing the need for more space, the pair, along with help from their families, were able to give their creativity a new home.

“We want them to walk in and have fun but we want them to run out,” said Siry, jokingly.

As the children and families enter the venue, they are able to take pictures while waiting in line. Upon leaving, they are able to stop at the Containment Zone’s shop of horrors, where they can buy various novelty items, including stickers that were designed by Mladenka.

“When you walk through the different tents and see the looks on the kid’s faces; and you know that they are having fun; there’s really not a better feeling than that,” said Mladenka.

Along with wife Ladonna, they are able to create their very own special effects and makeup for the dedicated actors and characters in their creation. They even have devoted a portion of the experience to an interactive range, where visitors can shoot “zombies” with paintball guns, as the actors run waywardly behind a fence.

A framed picture of all the workers, who are mostly volunteers, is placed on the counter near the end of the theatrical journey.

“We really all are like a family,” said Mladenka. “We just want to come out here and have fun and help other people do the same.”

The owners have recently teamed up with Splendora’s Project Graduation coordinators in an effort to collaborate and be a positive influence on the surrounding community.

“The money will always just be a bonus,” said Mladenka. “Our main focus will always be to have fun and to help the community.”

Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Ron Hickman and Asst. Chief Tim Cannon recently returned from the prestigious Chief Executive Officer Training Seminar, held just outside of the nation’s capital at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) located in Alexandria, Va. After receiving an invitation to attend the specifically designed training seminar for Law Enforcement Executives and 911 Emergency Center managers, Hickman and Cannon attended the program March 17-18 as guests of the NCMEC.

Hickman and Cannon joined 50 other chiefs, sheriffs, constables and 911 Emergency managers who were also selected and invited to attend the 141st session of the CEO course, and both are now one of more than 5,000 who have completed this training.

The Missing and Exploited Children Seminar for Chief Executives was designed to provide attendees with a better understanding of the issue of missing and sexually exploited children - and how to specifically deal with the situation of a child who’s been reported missing, when time is critical.

“This has been one of the most valuable experiences for me in my (42) years as a law enforcement officer,” said Hickman. “To have been selected in itself was an honor, but to be able to bring this knowledge home and put it into practice, is a plus for the citizens of Harris County, Texas. Our connection with NCMEC also extends through our Cybercrime unit where we receive Cyber Tips regarding endangered children and Child pornography cases.”

Created in 1997 and funded by the United States Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquency (OJJDP), the CEO training discusses the needed steps in implementing best practices for call takers, responding officers, investigators and command staff.

Once candidates are selected to attend, all travel and lodging expenses during training are covered by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through a grant by OJJDP.","2013-03-21 05:21:00","0","75.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","53.0","0.0","251.0","231.0","10.0","360.0","0.0","25.0","0","394","96.72","71.18","13.81","25.77","39.40","34.77","69.54","36.04","3.55","1.27","0.51","0.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.28","6.09","15.48","3.81","2.54","6.35","0.00","8.12","3.05","2.28","1.52","6.35","1.02","3.05","1.52","1.52","0.00","0.25","1.27","6.09","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","3.55","0.51","0.51","0.25","0.25","1.27","0.76","1.52","1.02","0.25","0.00","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.51","0.00","12.44","1.02","1.78","9.14","0.76","0.76","3.55","5.33","0.00","12.94","3.55","6.85","3.05","7.11","0.25","0.76","0.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.10","3.55","5.58","1.27","0.76","0.00","0.00","1.78","1.02","2.54","2.54","4.06","2014","9.81","49.375","645","381","12","30.74","17.2","16.9","16.26","21.2","111","11.25","26.373543307086614","224","39.0","11","0.36","0","18","25","29","0","51","12","2","1","0","49","93","2","22","0","0","4","3","8","0","1","0","9","0","9","9","9","19","7","7","0","3","0","3"

“We do want to scare people, but we want to do it in a way that’s fun,” said Brian Mladenka, who is one of the owners of the entertainment venue. “We are very family-oriented and we definitely want to do this for the kids.”

Mladenka, along with friend and business partner Thomas Siry, opened Containment Zone after being involved with the haunted houses used in various holiday programs benefitting Splendora Youth Football for the past seven years.

Upon realizing the need for more space, the pair, along with help from their families, were able to give their creativity a new home.

“We want them to walk in and have fun but we want them to run out,” said Siry, jokingly.

As the children and families enter the venue, they are able to take pictures while waiting in line. Upon leaving, they are able to stop at the Containment Zone’s shop of horrors, where they can buy various novelty items, including stickers that were designed by Mladenka.

“When you walk through the different tents and see the looks on the kid’s faces; and you know that they are having fun; there’s really not a better feeling than that,” said Mladenka.

Along with wife Ladonna, they are able to create their very own special effects and makeup for the dedicated actors and characters in their creation. They even have devoted a portion of the experience to an interactive range, where visitors can shoot “zombies” with paintball guns, as the actors run waywardly behind a fence.

A framed picture of all the workers, who are mostly volunteers, is placed on the counter near the end of the theatrical journey.

“We really all are like a family,” said Mladenka. “We just want to come out here and have fun and help other people do the same.”

The owners have recently teamed up with Splendora’s Project Graduation coordinators in an effort to collaborate and be a positive influence on the surrounding community.

“The money will always just be a bonus,” said Mladenka. “Our main focus will always be to have fun and to help the community.”

After several months of negotiations, Montgomery County commissioners approved a step plan that provides pay raises for deputies with the Sheriff and Constables’ offices.

Initially approved during the 2013-14 budget hearings in the summer, the revamped step plan provides 5 percent increases for deputies, sergeants and lieutenants. But who would fund the raises was the prime question.

Of the $1.2 million necessary, approximately $950,000 will come from the Sheriff’s budget. The remaining $250,000 is to come from several sources, such as unused grant match funds from 2013, all constable offices and attrition.

To phase in the plan, no participant will be allowed to receive an increase greater than 10 percent in a year.

Gage praised Precinct 3 Commissioner James Noack for his diligence during talks to see the program reach a successful conclusion.

It’s a great opportunity,” Noack said. “It is important our law enforcement has the salaries needed to maintain a strong force.”

In other county business:

Runway testing: The proposed extension of Lone Star Executive Airport’s main runway has to be substantially complete by June 10, 2014, Airport Manager Scott Smith said at Commissioners Court Monday.

The Federal Aviation Administration will conduct a test of the airport’s instrumental flight rules on that date. Closure of Airport Road, initially set for August, is now scheduled to take place in October, Smith said.

The runway will increase in length from 6,000 feet to 7,500 feet, which officials say will attract more aviation business.

Catfish parking: Commissioners approved a request from The Friends of Conroe Inc. for use of the county’s two downtown parking garages Oct. 10-13 during the Conroe Cajun Catfish Festival.

Garage entrances are located on Simonton Street and Main Street at West Phillips.

All county vehicles are to exit the Main Street garage by 5 p.m. Oct. 11, while all vehicles exit the garage on Simonton Street by 4 p.m. Oct. 11.

Commissioners also established road closures in downtown Conroe during the festival. Closures include Simonton from Frazier to Pacific; Main Street from Davis to Pacific; Metcalf from Pacific to Frazier; Thompson from Davis to Frazier; and San Jacinto from Davis to Metcalf.

Use of the courthouse square begins at 3 p.m. Oct. 10 and continues through midnight Oct. 13.

Return to sender: With its list of projects completed, the Montgomery County Office of Emergency Management returned $369,767 of a 2011 Urban Area Security Initiative grant. Montgomery County OEM was left with the additional funds after spending $1.85 million to construct a radio tower along FM 1097, said Nick Kelly, OEM deputy coordinator.

Recognition: Sgt. John Nichols, of the Sheriff’s Office, was named Employee of the Month for September. Tonnie Whitney, of the District Attorney’s Office, was recognized as the Employee of the Month in August.","2013-09-17 05:38:00","1","83.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","52.0","0.0","230.0","210.0","10.0","308.0","0.0","25.0","0","497","99.00","63.39","25.79","80.47","15.06","29.58","65.79","32.80","2.01","0.40","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.20","0.00","1.61","8.05","16.30","4.02","0.80","2.21","0.20","7.85","2.82","1.41","0.40","8.05","2.01","3.42","3.22","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.20","4.02","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.20","4.63","1.01","1.21","0.40","0.40","1.21","0.60","2.01","0.80","1.21","0.00","0.40","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.04","0.40","1.61","3.42","0.80","0.20","2.41","5.03","1.61","16.10","2.01","8.45","6.04","5.23","1.41","0.80","2.41","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","18.51","7.24","5.43","1.01","0.80","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.60","1.61","0.00","1.41","2476","8.49","22.0","742","487","29","62.88","11.7","8.7","13.45","12.2","124","10.6","18.904804928131416","279","18.96","5","0.34","0","7","42","44","0","65","22","2","0","6","68","121","1","34","0","0","2","3","6","0","0","0","17","0","17","17","3","9","6","11","2","1","0","0"

RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. (AP) — The man charged with killing a Transportation Security Administration officer and wounding two other agents and a civilian during a shooting rampage at Los Angeles International Airport made his first court appearance Wednesday, still showing signs of the gunshot wounds suffered when he was arrested.

Paul Ciancia hadn’t been seen in public since the Nov. 1 attack that created chaos at one of the nation’s busiest airports and affected air travel around the country.

The 23-year-old spoke in whispers and showed no emotion during the 10-minute hearing in the West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, about 45 miles east of Los Angeles. He’s being housed at the facility in federal custody.

U.S. Magistrate Judge David Bristow asked the diminutive, slender Ciancia if he understood the charges against him.

“Yes,” responded Ciancia, who was shackled at his hands and feet and had a bandage on his neck and bruises on the left side of his face.

His lawyers didn’t comment on his injuries.

Airport police responding to the rampage shot Ciancia four times, including once in the mouth. He was hospitalized for more than two weeks before being placed in federal custody.

The unemployed motorcycle mechanic did not enter a plea Wednesday to a murder charge that carries a possible death penalty if he’s convicted.

Bristow determined Ciancia was a flight risk and posed a danger to the community, and ordered him to remain behind bars. The next hearing is scheduled for Dec. 18, but it could be waived if a grand jury indicts Ciancia.

Investigators said Ciancia walked into LAX’s Terminal 3, pulled a semi-automatic rifle out of a duffel bag and fired at TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez. An autopsy showed Hernandez, 39, was shot a dozen times.Ciancia then fired on two other uniformed TSA employees and an airline passenger, who all were wounded, as he moved through the security checkpoint to the passenger gate area, authorities said. None of the three suffered life-threatening injuries.Airport police shot Ciancia as panicked travelers either hid or fled.Investigators have said Ciancia had a vendetta against the federal government and targeted TSA officers. His attorneys, who are both deputy federal public defenders, declined to discuss the case after the hearing.","2013-12-04 15:43:00","1","80.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","45.0","0.0","232.0","221.0","0.0","315.0","0.0","24.0","0","511","96.91","60.81","26.44","6.31","19.65","31.90","70.84","36.79","4.89","3.33","0.39","0.00","0.00","2.94","0.00","1.57","9.20","12.92","4.50","1.17","4.89","0.98","9.59","2.74","1.96","0.78","5.68","1.37","4.70","1.37","3.13","0.59","1.57","0.39","6.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.13","5.28","0.78","0.98","0.78","1.37","0.20","2.54","4.70","2.94","1.57","0.20","3.52","1.37","2.35","0.00","0.20","7.24","0.20","0.98","4.50","0.00","1.96","6.46","2.15","0.20","17.22","2.35","9.59","5.68","3.52","0.59","0.20","0.59","0.00","1.76","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","14.09","6.65","3.72","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.98","0.39","1.17","0.39","0.39","2532","8.07","24.666666666666668","806","504","28","53.21","12.8","10.3","12.64","12.1","113","8.9","18.16825396825397","274","22.62","17","0.37","0","19","25","50","0","58","32","2","0","1","74","101","2","31","0","0","11","7","7","1","0","0","10","0","4","43","10","15","3","6","2","3","0","1"

To the editor:

I listened to President Obama’s speech on “gun control.” After talking for a long time, he said nothing. He gave nothing solid about what to do or how to do it. He did sign 23 executive orders about this.

In case you forgot, executive orders do not need Congress or Senate approval. They bypass them and go right to law.

So now we have to wait for Congress and the Senate to try to do away with these things. I hope they do.

I did notice he kept playing the child card. He kept bringing up he was doing it for the kids’ safety. Good idea, but there are other ways to do that. He is going to spend $500 million on this.

My question is where is it coming from? We had to raise the debt limit to pay our bills, so do we raise it again to pay for this? He wants a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. OK, but what about many mags of 10 rounds and just reload. As far as assault weapons go, what about shotguns? Five rounds of #4 or OO buck shot can do as much damage as an assault weapon. What about cars? According to one article I read, more people are killed by autos than guns. Do we ban them? How about DWI drunk drivers kill many people but still they can drive and do it over and over again, how about stopping that. He wants more cops on the street; again, who pays? Background checks, great idea but again who pays? He said no man or government has the right to take away the freedom of another; what is he trying to do? He said 900 people killed in last month by gun violence, but what kinds? Who killed whom and how, what kind of weapon was used?

He left a lot of questions unanswered for me. Just once I would like him to tell us just what he is going to do, how it will be done, what it will cost and who is going to pay for it. These are things each and everyone of us need to know. So once again, he is keeping his word to the Russian that once he is re-elected he can do what he want and no one can stop him. I hope that level heads in Congress and the Senate take over and stop his lordship from running us more into the ground.

Coaches committed to the students

To the editor:

The coaching industry is a very fulfilling carrier, it is also a brutal one. The hours of work put in are tremendous. It is a seven-day-a-week job and takes the support of special family members in order to survive.

From year to year, you do not know if you have a job or where it will be. A coach can be one of the single-most influential teachers at the school. They are there for the kids in the class room and they are there when a child is pushing through a personal barrier on the practice field. These aren’t NFL coaches and the players aren’t grown men and women.

During the season that did not go as planned, I have heard and seen ugliness. I catch myself getting caught up and have to remind myself what it is all about. Yes, winning is important; however, growing into respectable, intelligent young man or woman is what matters. Much can be learned from losing as well: the fight to come back, the vision to see what needs to be changed and the mental toughness to go again.

I have been around several of the coaches at Conroe over the years and truly believe it is all about the kids and every experience was on a professional level. With all this said, we need to thank the coaches if you see them out and about and we need to support the new ones coming in. … Sic’em, Tigers!

When will they ever learn?

To the editor:

The following comes from the New American Standard Open Bible intro to the Book of Amos: “There are many systems of philosophy and political life which try to base law and all human relationships on the nature of man. Man makes him the measure of all things. All such systems such as Communism, or humanism, or Socialism, are all doomed for one fatal flaw: They do not recognize the sinful, self-centered nature of man. They ignore God and deify man. Amos saw clearly, seven centuries before Christ, what some men have been unable to see today.”

We see today this form of thinking in place in our government and are already experiencing the evil and destruction coming from self-centered leaders. It reminds me of the following words in the song “Where Have all the Flowers Gone” by Pete Seeger: “When will they ever learn, when will they ever learn.”

Harris County Attorney Vince Ryan has reached an agreement with the property owners and the owners of two Brays Oaks convenience stores to help fight crime that occurs around those businesses.

I & A Food Mart, located at 6060 West Bellfort, and the Albury Food Mart, at 11129 Albury, were sued by Ryan, who accused them of habitually harboring criminal and gang activity. The agreement reached this week will require the convenience stores to schedule random daily security patrols, random drug testing for employees and random drug dog sweeps of the stores.

The stores must also post a photo array of the seven Bloods and Crips gang members accused of selling drugs in the area. A court order forbids those gang members entering the “Brays Oaks Safety Zone,” a 0.7 square mile area in southwest Houston where the stores are located. The Safety Zone also includes Eleanor Tinsley Elementary School and Albury Head Start Day Care Center. If any of these seven gang members are found in the Safety Zone, they can be arrested and, if found guilty, put in jail for up to one year and fined $4,000.

The case against the individual members of the Bloods and the Crips accused of selling illegal narcotics in the Safety Zone is set for trial on May 28 before 164th District Court Judge Alexandra Smoots-Hogan.

The “Brays Oaks Safety Area” is referred to in the local community as “New Jack City” in reference to a 1991 movie that features a neighborhood taken over by a gang selling drugs.

The Albury Food Mart is the site of a retaliatory homicide related to the shooting of well-known Houston rap artist Trae tha Truth. The rapper was shot outside a Southwest Houston club following a concert; three others were killed. In July 2012, a gang member scheduled to testify in court against the shooter of Trae tha Truth was murdered in the Albury Food Mart parking lot. Another gang member has been charged with the concert shootings.","2013-05-09 06:39:00","1","72.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","49.0","0.0","219.0","194.0","10.0","230.0","0.0","24.0","0","348","98.85","71.72","23.51","58.39","26.77","21.84","72.70","37.36","3.45","0.86","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.57","2.59","11.21","13.79","4.89","1.15","4.02","0.00","8.33","2.87","0.57","0.57","3.74","0.86","5.17","3.45","1.72","0.29","1.15","0.00","7.47","0.00","2.59","0.00","0.00","5.46","1.44","0.00","0.86","2.30","0.86","1.44","1.44","0.57","0.86","0.00","2.59","0.29","1.15","0.00","1.15","10.06","5.17","0.00","3.16","0.29","1.72","2.30","3.74","0.57","14.37","0.86","10.06","2.87","2.30","1.72","0.57","2.87","0.00","0.57","0.57","0.00","0.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.34","3.74","3.45","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.57","1.72","0.00","0.00","0.57","1632","8.06","26.923076923076923","487","346","14","63.32","11.1","10.6","11.2","13.8","70","16.333333333333332","19.97248554913295","197","23.69","3","0.35","0","9","15","43","0","41","15","0","0","3","49","75","2","24","0","0","3","0","4","0","0","1","8","0","8","10","6","18","3","9","2","1","0","1"

Statement on DOJ Announcement Regarding Texas Voter ID Law

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Sen. Ted Cruz today released the following statement regarding Attorney General Eric Holder’s announcement that the Department of Justice will seek to require Texas to get permission before making voting law changes:

Attorney General Holder's recent announcement is just the latest example of his politicization of the Department of Justice. Holder's refusal to accept the judgment of the U.S. Supreme Court regarding preclearance continues the Department's longstanding pattern of refusing to follow the law.

Likewise, Holder continues to attack voter ID laws, even though the Supreme Court has concluded that voter ID laws are supported by multiple interests that are ""unquestionably relevant to the State's interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process.""","2013-07-25 10:06:00","1","65.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","49.0","0.0","219.0","194.0","10.0","228.0","0.0","24.0","0","135","98.36","47.04","10.08","88.52","27.00","40.74","69.63","36.30","5.19","2.96","2.22","0.00","0.00","0.74","0.00","2.22","8.89","15.56","5.93","2.22","1.48","0.00","10.37","5.93","2.22","0.00","0.00","0.74","5.19","4.44","0.74","0.00","0.74","0.00","2.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.74","5.93","2.96","1.48","0.00","0.00","0.74","0.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.85","0.00","0.00","10.37","0.74","0.74","0.74","6.67","0.74","8.15","2.22","1.48","4.44","8.89","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.56","5.93","2.22","1.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.74","1.48","3.70","0.00","0.00","772","10.5","47.0","238","134","5","27.35","18.2","16.1","17.7","20.1","47","6.7","26.74985074626866","87","35.0","9","0.34","0","1","0","12","0","15","6","0","1","1","21","43","0","4","0","0","0","1","3","0","0","0","6","0","6","4","7","2","2","5","1","0","0","0"

“Of the four wars in my lifetime none came about because the United States was too strong.” -- Ronald Reagan

The American armed forces are in a death spiral. The potential danger far exceeds the health insurance debacle occurring in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. The Department of Defense is as susceptible to the effects of onerous, ideologically driven policies as the economy and the health system. The implications of the DoD’s death spiral are possibly even more devastating.

President Obama’s administration seems to be at war with its military leadership. In the past five years, Obama has sacked more senior officers than all other presidents combined. It wasn’t until the last 60 years that the United States was considered a top military power. Today, the American military is on the verge of becoming weaker than it was in 1939 when Hitler started his European rampage and Japan pushed its aggression into Asia.

The U.S. military’s descent into second-rate status already surpasses the “hollow force” of President Jimmy Carter’s era. After eight years of military cuts overseen by President Clinton, whose concept of defense had more to do with lawyers and juries than military strength, President George W. Bush found himself in the unfortunate position of having to respond to the worst attack on U.S. soil since Pearl Harbor. The initially superb response was then driven into a fantasyland of nation building in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In Oct. 2001, had the U.S. kept to the original plan, American forces would have left Afghanistan before the end of the year with al Qaeda crushed and Osama bin Laden captured or killed. One problem was not clearly identifying the enemy as al Qaeda and the nations or groups that supported them. Another problem was not deploying enough force to find, fix, and annihilate al Qaeda. As is well known, the “War on Terror” devolved into a long struggle during which the terrorists morphed into a worldwide network posing a global threat to American interests. Over time, the will of the American public weakened validating Gen. George C. Marshall’s contention that, “A democracy cannot fight a Seven Years War.”

The lack of a clearly defined strategic objective resulted in the move into Iraq. After a quick march to Baghdad the war could have ended with “mission accomplished” and a U.S. exit. Instead, the decision was made to remake Afghanistan and Iraq into bourgeois democracies; these were doomed objectives, given that neither society possessed a viable middle class, history of democratic politics, or a mindset inclined to accept fundamental human freedom and liberty. Forgetting that Afghanistan had long ago earned the reputation of being “the place where empires go to die,” the U.S. found itself in two wars simultaneously, fighting enemies adept at asymmetric strategies and who were determined to destroy infidel invaders.

While American commanders eventually concocted fairly effective operational strategies in Afghanistan and Iraq, in neither case did U.S. forces benefit from clear strategic goals or useful operational milestones. Salient lessons from Vietnam were forgotten: A strategy focused on “not losing,” rather than pursuing victory, results in defeat and small tactical victories cannot overcome a weak strategy. Meanwhile, a legion of lawyers, backed by policy wonks, looked over our commanders’ shoulders as they tried to figure out ways to defeat a tough collection of international enemies from the mountains of Afghanistan to the streets of Benghazi. Moreover, because President Barack Obama has been unwilling to make the critical financial investment needed to keep the U.S. a top military power, the American defense establishment entered its current death spiral.

The Army is smaller than it was in 1950, when North Korea invaded South Korea. The Navy has half the combat vessels it had 15 years ago. American combat aircraft—Air Force and Navy—are rusting on the runways. The American nuclear arsenal, last updated in the early 1990s, ages while Russia modernizes its arsenal and China expands its global reach. Combat tested junior and mid-level officers and non-commissioned officers, vital to the future leadership of our armed forces, are opting for more promising careers elsewhere. Senior officers courageous enough to resist the inanity of politically correct polices are retiring—if they haven’t been forced out already.

The military weakness admired by the extreme left invites aggression from terrorists and possible hegemons in Teheran, Beijing, and Moscow. The potential costs of weakness are far greater than the expense of being strong.

June 24, 2013

AUSTIN — The following is a statement from University of Texas at Austin President Bill Powers regarding today’s Supreme Court ruling in the case of Fisher versus University of Texas. The ruling relates to the use of ethnicity as one factor in determining college admissions.

“We’re encouraged by the Supreme Court’s ruling in this case.

We will continue to defend the University’s admission policy on remand in the lower court under the strict standards that the Court first articulated in the Bakke case, reaffirmed in the Grutter case, and laid out again today. We believe the University’s policy fully satisfies those standards.

We remain committed to assembling a student body at The University of Texas at Austin that provides the educational benefits of diversity on campus while respecting the rights of all students and acting within the constitutional framework established by the Court.

Today's ruling will have no impact on admissions decisions we have already made or any immediate impact on our holistic admissions policies.""

President Bill Powers, Admissions Director and Vice Provost Kedra Ishop, and Vice President for Diversity and Community Engagement Greg Vincent will have a press conference at 2 p.m. today in the Main Building on the University of Texas at Austin campus in Room 212.","2013-06-24 06:27:00","1","74.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","49.0","0.0","219.0","194.0","10.0","229.0","0.0","24.0","0","223","99.00","76.35","41.63","75.67","24.78","27.35","73.09","41.70","4.48","2.69","0.00","2.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.79","9.87","19.28","3.14","1.35","3.59","0.45","6.28","1.79","0.90","0.00","2.69","0.90","4.48","3.59","0.90","0.00","0.00","0.45","5.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.83","2.24","1.35","0.00","0.90","0.90","0.90","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.45","0.45","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.90","3.59","0.45","8.97","0.45","0.45","1.35","5.83","1.35","16.59","0.45","11.21","4.93","10.31","0.00","0.45","0.90","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.31","4.48","2.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.90","2.69","0.00","0.00","1147","9.26","28.625","366","223","9","46.3","15.3","13.0","13.81","16.0","62","13.375","23.04107623318386","126","23.88","1","0.42","0","6","5","27","0","37","7","1","0","3","34","54","0","10","0","0","5","1","4","0","0","1","4","0","4","4","7","4","5","5","1","0","0","0"

AUSTIN - The Texas Public Policy Foundation, one of America's premier state-level free-market research institutes, issued the following statement from president and CEO Brooke Rollins, on the ""fiscal cliff"" deal passed last night by the United States Congress:

""Congress' New Year's Day actions should leave all Texans dismayed over their federal government's budgetary affairs. With this deal on the ‘fiscal cliff,' the American people get $1 in cuts for every $41 in revenue. Washington, D.C.'s, spending remains as out-of-control and unsustainable as ever.

""The contrast between the profligacy of Washington, D.C., and the responsible stewardship of Austin, Texas, could not be more stark: in D.C., they fritter away our future with a credit card billed directly to you. In Texas, we build our future with sober responsibility and a commitment to principle.

""If there's any lesson to be had from this bad D.C. deal, it's this: our solutions aren't to be found there, but right here, in our states and communities just as intended by the 10th Amendment - powers are reserved to the states or to the people.""

Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Carl Lewis joins Houston Track and Field staff 1 / 1 Back to Gallery

Olympian and Cougar great Carl Lewis has joined the University of Houston’s track and field program as a volunteer coach announced head coach Leroy Burrell Thursday.

“Carl had indicated to me last spring that he was planning on moving back to Houston,” Burrell said. “That was an excellent opportunity for us to really sit down and give him a more active role with the program.”

Houston Track and Field also announced throws coach Will Blackburn has been promoted to Associate Head Coach.

“Will is one of the main cogs in everything we do here,” Burrell said. “He serves as our recruiting coordinator and organizes our officials and our travel on top of his coaching duties with the throws. It was a great opportunity for us to name him to that position so he would have more authority in our business operations.”

Lewis joins a staff of eight former Houston track and field alumni and will work with the sprinters and jumpers.

“When you think of track and field, several athletes come to mind, one being Carl Lewis.” Burrell said. “To have that type of name recognition and excellence associated with the program only enhances the training environment, credibility with our athletes and marketability with our recruits.”

For the past 14 years, Lewis has been back and forth from Philadelphia to Houston to be a part of the program. He is excited to join the staff and believes in coach Burrell’s philosophy. Lewis also brings a quality to the staff that is unlike any other.

“Leroy set up a great program and I have a different perspective. I haven’t seen a lot of the kids everyday so I can look at them objectively. With the emotional side, I can give them a different perspective on how to prepare for competition. I know how to win in a lot of these events. Adding another eye and ear to one of the best technical programs in the nation is great for me and I hope is good for them.”

Lewis is proud to return to his alma mater, a place that he believes helped him succeed. He hopes to bring that same quality to the future of Houston track and field.

“I tell people all the time that if I didn’t go here, you wouldn’t know me,” Lewis said. “I was a kid who was very good in high school, one of the best recruits from New Jersey, but there’s no way I would have progressed without the University of Houston, the coaching staff, Coach Tellez and all of them, but then not only that, Coach Yeoman, Coach Lewis, Coach Williams, Athletic Director Harry Fouke and the Cullen family.

It was a village for me to be successful, and that’s what the University of Houston is all about. We’re not pretentious in the sense that we are this or that. We’re the University of Houston, always being told we’re less but always doing more.”

Lewis is known as one of the greatest athletes in the world winning 10 Olympic medals, nine of those gold, and 10 world championship medals. He still holds the school records for the indoor 55-meter dash (6.07) and both indoor and outdoor long jump records 8.56m (28’-1”) and 8.62m (28’-3.5”). A six-time All-American, Lewis won six national championships and nine individual conference championships during his two seasons at Houston.

Lewis came to Houston to run for head coach Tom Tellez in 1979. A year later, he appeared on the national scene when he qualified for the United States team for the 1980 Olympics in the long jump and 4x100 relay team. Since then, he competed in four Olympic Games as a member of team USA.

He held the world record in the men’s 100-meter dash in 1991, until Burrell broke the record in 1994. The two were also a part of the US 4x100 relay team that broke the world record during the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.","2013-09-13 04:40:00","1","76.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","228.0","208.0","10.0","302.0","0.0","25.0","0","698","85.20","72.62","13.82","84.08","20.53","17.34","78.65","47.56","10.74","7.31","2.01","2.01","0.29","2.44","0.57","3.44","8.31","14.04","6.30","3.01","7.16","1.00","12.32","4.30","2.44","0.86","5.44","2.44","4.15","3.72","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.29","8.88","0.14","0.00","0.00","2.58","6.45","1.43","0.43","0.86","1.15","1.15","2.15","1.72","0.86","0.72","0.00","0.86","0.72","0.14","0.00","0.00","11.89","3.87","3.87","5.16","2.58","0.00","4.01","7.45","1.29","12.18","1.86","6.59","4.15","6.59","3.30","0.14","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.47","4.87","3.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.86","2.87","1.86","0.86","0.29","3025","6.79","25.321428571428573","920","688","36","77.47","10.4","7.2","9.4","9.8","96","13.125","15.221395348837213","320","21.75","14","0.47","0","33","42","72","0","82","36","2","3","5","97","87","5","28","1","1","43","9","21","3","0","2","23","0","20","26","8","11","16","24","2","2","0","4"

Harris County Attorney Vince Ryan has reached an agreement with the property owners and the owners of two Brays Oaks convenience stores to help fight crime that occurs around those businesses.

I & A Food Mart, located at 6060 West Bellfort, and the Albury Food Mart, at 11129 Albury, were sued by Ryan, who accused them of habitually harboring criminal and gang activity. The agreement reached this week will require the convenience stores to schedule random daily security patrols, random drug testing for employees and random drug dog sweeps of the stores.

The stores must also post a photo array of the seven Bloods and Crips gang members accused of selling drugs in the area. A court order forbids those gang members entering the “Brays Oaks Safety Zone,” a 0.7 square mile area in southwest Houston where the stores are located. The Safety Zone also includes Eleanor Tinsley Elementary School and Albury Head Start Day Care Center. If any of these seven gang members are found in the Safety Zone, they can be arrested and, if found guilty, put in jail for up to one year and fined $4,000.

The case against the individual members of the Bloods and the Crips accused of selling illegal narcotics in the Safety Zone is set for trial on May 28 before 164th District Court Judge Alexandra Smoots-Hogan.

The “Brays Oaks Safety Area” is referred to in the local community as “New Jack City” in reference to a 1991 movie that features a neighborhood taken over by a gang selling drugs.

The Albury Food Mart is the site of a retaliatory homicide related to the shooting of well-known Houston rap artist Trae tha Truth. The rapper was shot outside a Southwest Houston club following a concert; three others were killed. In July 2012, a gang member scheduled to testify in court against the shooter of Trae tha Truth was murdered in the Albury Food Mart parking lot. Another gang member has been charged with the concert shootings.","2013-05-09 06:39:00","1","72.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","49.0","0.0","219.0","194.0","10.0","230.0","0.0","24.0","0","348","98.85","71.72","23.51","58.39","26.77","21.84","72.70","37.36","3.45","0.86","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.57","2.59","11.21","13.79","4.89","1.15","4.02","0.00","8.33","2.87","0.57","0.57","3.74","0.86","5.17","3.45","1.72","0.29","1.15","0.00","7.47","0.00","2.59","0.00","0.00","5.46","1.44","0.00","0.86","2.30","0.86","1.44","1.44","0.57","0.86","0.00","2.59","0.29","1.15","0.00","1.15","10.06","5.17","0.00","3.16","0.29","1.72","2.30","3.74","0.57","14.37","0.86","10.06","2.87","2.30","1.72","0.57","2.87","0.00","0.57","0.57","0.00","0.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.34","3.74","3.45","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.57","1.72","0.00","0.00","0.57","1632","8.06","26.923076923076923","487","346","14","63.32","11.1","10.6","11.2","13.8","70","16.333333333333332","19.97248554913295","197","23.69","3","0.35","0","9","15","43","0","41","15","0","0","3","49","75","2","24","0","0","3","0","4","0","0","1","8","0","8","10","6","18","3","9","2","1","0","1"

LAKE JACKSON — A record-setting year was achieved by TDECU Real Estate in 2012. The agency lead the Brazoria County multiple listing service (MLS) market in total transactions sold, volume sold and market share. It also boasts the largest number of top producers at any one agency serving southern Brazoria County.

Propelled by this momentum, TDECU Real Estate announced plans to open two additional offices in 2013, one in Baytown to serve residents and members of Baytown and Pasadena and the other in Missouri City in the acclaimed Sienna Plantation master-planned community. TDECU Real Estate currently operates offices in Lake Jackson and Victoria.

In 2012, TDECU Real Estate experienced a record year for transactions closed, closing 464 in all markets, and finishing with a sold volume of $62,626,951, representing a 299% increase over 2011. In Brazoria County’s MLS area, the agency achieved #1 status in transactions closed (377), the #1 position in sold volume ($48,149,176) and #1 in market share. TDECU Real Estate agent Tammie Bell also secured the #1spot for closed transactions with a total of 131. She was followed by Shayne McGehee, who ranked #5 with 64 closed transactions, and Ryan Birdsong, who ranked #8 with 56 transactions closed. The additional team members of TDECU Real Estate, Ruth Ann Few, Sherrie Steves, Janice Jones Martin, Kathy McMullen and Ed Birdsong ranked in the top 20 percent, averaging 47 transactions closed per agent versus the board average of 11 per agent.

“TDECU Real Estate agents are hardworking, knowledgeable, and conduct business using our REAL service standards. Their dedication and commitment guarantees that our clients save time and money while receiving outstanding service; wherever, whenever and however they want it,” said Ed Birdsong, President of TDECU Real Estate.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/04/03/high-rise-hassles-in-the-heart-of-suburbia/","High-rise hassles in the heart of suburbia","The two hotel projects being built on the outskirts of Williamsville are dividing the community.

Some say the projects are just what the Main Street corridor needs to continue developing into a thriving suburban center.

Others think they’re monstrosities that will destroy what makes the Williamsville area special.

“We really need to think about the future, and we need to think about opportunity,” said Janice Schlau, a Williamsville native who owns the village’s Prosit Restaurant on Main. She said she talks with customers from all over the world and revels in their willingness to stay in Amherst and pour money into the local economy.

Mary Kinder, a 30-year Amherst resident, sees it differently.

“If you take away the feel of a village and you change it, you’re looking like downtown, and that’s not why people are here,” she said. “If you start putting downtown buildings in an area that’s quaint, you don’t have that anymore. I had a good friend say to me, ‘This is progress,’ but I’m not so sure.”

The debate over the Hyatt Place project – a hotel that the town recently approved – and Carl Paladino’s hotel-and-retail project nearing completion about a half- mile away on Main has been fierce.

At the intersection of Main and South Forest Road, Paladino’s Ellicott Development is nearing completion of a $35 million, six-story building that will feature retail and restaurant space, 33 luxury apartments, interior parking and a 120-room Wyndham Garden Hotel and Suites.

About a half-mile west on Main is where the Town of Amherst has given approval for Iskalo’s six-story, 137-room Hyatt Place to go up behind the Lord Amherst Hotel, just west of the Youngmann Highway interchange.

For Kinder and many other residents, opposition to towering buildings near the village was born after they watched cranes raise the steel frame of Paladino’s project that is being built right up to the sidewalk’s edge. It looks like it will dwarf every building around it.

“Everybody, I talked to – everybody – said, ‘My God, look what’s going up. How did that get passed?’ ” she said.

But Williamsville Mayor Brian Kulpa, a licensed architect with training in urban design, lauded Paladino’s project, saying its combination of hotel, apartments and retail marks the first mixed-use project of its kind around the village and an important key to Williamsville’s future.

Local patronage of Main Street businesses is not enough to keep the commercial corridor strong, he said.

He also pointed out that he lives half a block behind the village’s four-story Hampton Inn on Main (also a Paladino project built in 2002). “I don’t see hotel patrons looking down into my backyard,” he said. “What I see is a ton of people leaving the Hampton Inn and going to the village taverns and shops.”

While the village may be in a suburban community, he said, it’s still an urban environment. “We’re not so different than an Elmwood. We’re not so different from a Hertel,” he said, referring to thriving city commercial districts that are both surrounded by residential neighborhoods. “[The village is] growing from the outside in, and it’s growing from the inside out.”

But he also said projects like Paladino’s and Iskalo’s drive home the necessity of strong, enforceable design standards, which the Town of Amherst has yet to complete.

“Ultimately, do I think the Hyatt is the world’s greatest design? Maybe not,” he said. “Do I think Paladino’s project is going to win everybody over there to its side? No. However, there’s a lot of really, really good elements there.”

Paladino model praised

James Dentinger, president of McGuire Development, praised Paladino’s mixed-use model. Both he and Kulpa said the design, while imposing, will offer village residents a better walking experience with ground-floor retail and a mix of upper-floor housing.

“My sense is the Ellicott Development project will blend more once it’s complete,” he said.

It’s still too big, responded Michael Joseph, owner of Amherst-based Clover Management, which built and renovated a variety of projects all over the region before focusing on senior housing projects during the last 12 years.

“Listen, [Paladino’s] building will be beautiful. No one doubts that,” he said. “The problem most people have is the sheer size of the project relative to everything around it.”

That’s not the fault of the developer, he said. That’s the fault of the town for not doing a better job of creating a comprehensive plan with zoning classifications that articulate, in much greater detail, how it wants its community to grow.

“You don’t want to leave it to developers to decide what the world is going to look like,” he cautioned.

In the case of the new Iskalo and Paladino buildings, the question is not a matter of land use, said Robert Shibley, founder of the Urban Design Project and dean of the University at Buffalo School of Architecture and Planning. In both cases, these buildings were slated for construction on property already designated for general business use. “The issue is not ‘whether or not’ but how?” he said.

Hyatt heights vary

On the Hyatt Place project, Shibley said he disagreed with the idea of justifying a cookie-cutter, six-story hotel design overlooking the backyards of a residential neighborhood with half-a-million-dollar homes just because that happens to be the Hyatt Place prototype.

“The issue they’re concerned about is: What’s their relationship to this development?” Shibley said of the neighbors, “and if it’s not designed well, they’ve got a complaint.”

In regard to the Hyatt Place prototype, most hotels operating under this flag are six stories tall. But that’s not an inflexible model.

Hyatt Place hotels near Albany and on Long Island are five stories tall, with 120 and 100 rooms, respectively. One near South Bend, Ind., is only four stories and holds 121 rooms.

David Hart, head of Hart Hotels, one of the largest hotel operators in the region, is also no fan of the new competition on Main.

People don’t come to a region because of a hotel, and giving tax breaks to new hotels is “crazy,” he said.

But he also acknowledged the economic risks and realities that developers face when it comes to the design of major projects like these. While it’s possible to lop off an entire hotel floor from a design standpoint, he said, it may be impossible to justify financially.

“The fight is not about whether it’s the right thing to do ... but is this the only thing that makes economic sense for the developer?” he said.

If the town provided developers with better direction, design guidance and restrictions from the start, developers are less likely to put forth projects that offend so many, Joseph said.

The town has created a new committee to do just that. Their recommendations are expected before the end of the year.

“I think the town is probably right at looking at the process and some of the codes in terms of these kinds of projects,” Dentinger said, “but they need to bring the developers to the table and make sure everybody’s on the same page about what the town wants to see going forward.”

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/01/as-paladino-joins-board-school-battle-lines-are-drawn/","As Paladino joins board, school battle lines are drawn","It’s official: Developer and former gubernatorial nominee Carl P. Paladino is a member of the Buffalo Board of Education. He won’t be one of the board officers, but he doesn’t need a title to stir things up.

He’s continuing his pledge to try to get rid of Superintendent Pamela C. Brown and challenged the nominees for president and vice president of the board at Monday’s reorganization meeting.

The board ultimately named at-large board member Barbara A. Seals Nevergold as the new board president. She said her first order of business as president is to improve the board’s “cohesiveness” and build stronger relationships among the members.

Asked whether she believes she’ll get along with Paladino, she said, “I can work with him. I can work with many people.”

Paladino, who represents the Park District, joins the board with incoming members Theresa Harris-Tigg, representing the East District, and James M. Sampson, representing the West District.

Nevergold said she hopes that the media’s fixation with Paladino won’t overshadow positive news coming out of the school district.

Improving communication with the public and encouraging more transparency is a key priority, Nevergold said. She added that she hopes to launch some community listening tours and wants to combat “the perception of being secretive” – a reputation that has dogged the district for years.

Nevergold, a longtime educator, was first appointed to the board in December 2011 as the at-large member to replace Christopher L. Jacobs when he was elected Erie County clerk.

She said Monday that she does not support removing Brown as superintendent and does not accept the idea that most Buffalo public schools are failing. The district has a strategic plan to improve student academics, she said.

“This is not the time to turn around and undo what we’re trying to do,” she said.

Though it was rapidly apparent that Nevergold had the votes to win the president’s position Monday, Paladino decided to keep things interesting by nominating board member Sharon Belton Cottman as president, much to her surprise.

Cottman’s dislike for Paladino is well-known. When he was elected to the seat in May, she said Paladino and the other two incoming board members should receive mandated School Board member training before they took their seats in July.

When told that Paladino and the other new members couldn’t receive that training before they’d been officially sworn in, Cottman had suggested that Paladino “get some remedial training in advance.”

Cottman declined his nomination Monday and said later that she would not allow him to make her the butt of his jokes. That didn’t stop Paladino, who said he believes in competition.

“I picked Sharon because I think she has a unique talent for rolling her eyes,” he said.

New board member Harris-Tigg nominated herself as vice president for student achievement and won the seat with eight votes. Cottman abstained.

The board was split on who to name the board’s vice president for executive affairs. Cottman nominated North District board member Jason M. McCarthy, while Paladino nominated newcomer Sampson.

McCarthy won the seat in a 6-3 vote, with board members Paladino, John B. Licata and Harris-Tigg voting against.

While the Board of Education’s reorganization meeting took center stage Monday, it wasn’t the only news to come out of the school district.

Many school district observers have been awaiting the superintendent’s announcement regarding the reorganization of the district’s central office staff, which was touted as a way to “streamline” the administration and save the district money while providing superior support to schools.

At a Monday morning news conference, Brown presented 25 slides, including nine flow charts with no comparative information, no names, and no summary on how the multitude of personnel changes affect the district’s bottom line. Although the flow charts are color-coded, no legend was provided at the press conference to help anyone piece together what the personnel changes meant.

Brown said her reorganization changes, including eliminating some vacant positions, so far have saved the district $1 million. She also said 30 positions have been eliminated through retirements, attrition and also roughly a dozen layoffs. It wasn’t clear whether that’s a result of Brown’s reorganization or general cuts to the 2013-14 budget.

Though Brown had described the reorganization as a way to “reduce excessive high/mid level management positions,” interim Deputy Superintendent Mary Guinn said the central office is expected to see a net increase of five positions.

Some positions are being consolidated as part of the reoganization, but it’s unclear how this affects the district’s total number of central office administrators. Attempts by The Buffalo News to further clarify this information after Monday’s board meeting were unsuccessful.

Brown is apparently eliminating a chief of staff position but adding an “executive assistant to the superintendent.” She’s also apparently replacing the district’s main lawyer, expanding the finance and registration offices, and changing a number of other job titles.

The human resources director is now “chief of talent management.” The district’s three community superintendents – central office administrators who directly supervise the district’s 50-plus schools – have each been renamed “chief of school leadership.”

To provide better support for the schools, Brown said she added a fourth chief position so that each of the four school leadership chiefs will supervise fewer schools and be able to provide better school support than they can now.

Brown was expected to name a new, permanent deputy superintendent as part of her reorganization but said Monday that a national search for a permanent deputy is continuing. Brown is also looking for a new chief of public relations, but that position currently remains vacant, as well.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/10/city-and-county-take-smooth-route-to-fixing-bumpy-road/","City and county take smooth route to fixing bumpy road","Not within recent memory have the east and westbound lanes of Kenmore Avenue been simultaneously in pristine shape. But now Erie County and the City of Buffalo are pursuing a smooth path to fixing the bumpy route, which is shared by the two municipalities.

It is called taking a collaborative approach to repairing a shared asset. Officials from the city and county Wednesday met, symbolically, midway along Kenmore Avenue, at St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute, to explain the innovation.

“We’re here to emphasize today what can happen when people work together,” said County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz, who was joined by Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown and County Legislator Lynn Marinelli, in whose legislative district Kenmore Avenue lies.

The eastbound lane of Kenmore Avenue is owned by the city, while the westbound lane belongs to the county. Historically, both municipalities have taken responsibility for repairing their respective sides of the road, and not often – if ever – at the same time. So at any given time, one side of the road is smooth, while the other is a mass of cracks and potholes with manhole covers that are not flush with the asphalt surface.

That will no longer be the case once all the work is completed in 2015.

“The bumpy surface that you see now will be smooth for the more than 16,000 vehicles that travel down Kenmore Avenue every single day,” Brown said.

Under the terms of an inter-municipal agreement, starting in September, Erie County will begin road resurfacing of both the county and city sides of Kenmore Avenue from Fairfield Avenue to Colvin Boulevard, a distance of just over a mile. About a year from now, city crews will perform the same work on a mile-long section of the road between Colvin Boulevard and Elmwood Avenue. Then, in the summer of 2015, both the city and the county together will, with funds from the federal government, pursue the rehabilitation of just under a mile of Kenmore Avenue from Fairfield Avenue to Main Street.

“It’s a little more than three miles of roadway that we’re going to be addressing, but we’re doing what hasn’t been done in many years,” Poloncarz said.

According to Marinelli, it has been more than a decade since any major resurfacing work has been done on either side of the street.

“When I was first elected and took office in 1997, it was then-County Executive (Dennis) Gorski and then-Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello who did repairs to a portion of Kenmore Avenue,” Marinelli said.

The city plans to spend about $500,000 for its share of the resurfacing project, while the county will commit about $557,000 to the two-year project, which also will include the lowering of the railroad track grade between Fairfield Avenu@e and Main Street. The entire project, including federal funds, will cost about $5 million.

“It’s this kind of collaboration that’s transforming Buffalo and Western New York,” said Brown.

“The only way we’re going to accomplish many of the things that we want to do in the city and the county government is by working together through partnerships,” added Poloncarz.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/07/katelin-shaffer-and-corey-coleman-wed-in-island-park/","Katelin Shaffer and Corey Coleman wed in Island Park","Katelin Shaffer and Corey Coleman, partners in music, became partners in life June 22 when they married in Island Park, Williamsville.

The two professional musicians perform their original “bluesy Americana” music around their home in Atlanta as the duo “Kate and Corey,” both singing and playing acoustic guitars. But for their wedding and reception in the park pavilion following the ceremony, at which the Rev. Kevin M. Mason officiated, the couple left the music to their friends in the Niagara Falls band High Horse.

“They asked us beforehand, ‘Do you want to play?’ and we said, ‘Thanks, but we think we’ll pass today,’ ” said Kate Coleman.

Chuck DeRose of High Horse played “beautiful” acoustic music during the ceremony, she said.

Kate Coleman is the daughter of William Shaffer and Michele Shaffer of Cheektowaga. A graduate of Maryvale High School, she earned a bachelor’s degree in public relations and dance from SUNY Buffalo State.

Corey Coleman is the son of Patti Marie Woods of Austintown, Ohio, and Stephen and Stacey Coleman of Westbrook, Conn., and a graduate of Carthage Senior High School. He is also, his new wife said, “an amazing lead guitarist.”

The Colemans have recently purchased a banjo and a mandolin and plan to work those instruments into their repertoire. They plan to tour the Southeast in the fall.

Before moving to Atlanta in September, the duo performed locally, including in the Niagara Falls Hard Rock Cafe and Buffalo’s Sportsmen’s Tavern, as well as at VIP receptions at Darien Lake for Rascal Flatts and Brad Paisley.

The couple, not surprisingly, met through the world of local music. In late 2009, a local promoter brought Shaffer to a studio in Tonawanda where Coleman was practicing with a band. “Corey is very direct, so he just said to me, ‘I think you are wonderful, I think we should go out,’ ” she said. “We went on a couple of dates, then decided we weren’t in the right place to be seeing anybody right them.” The two mostly lost touch.

A year later, Shaffer went to hear the band 90 West playing at a bar in Niagara Falls. “Corey was their lead guitarist,” she said. “He took off his guitar, came up to me and said, ‘I think we need to go on another date and give this another shot.’ ” They agreed to go to dinner the next night and, she said, “we’ve been together ever since.”

After a visit to Cranberry Lake, near Carthage, the couple has returned home to Atlanta.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/10/buffalo-psychiatric-center-to-expand-under-state-consolidation-plan/","Buffalo Psychiatric Center to expand under state consolidation plan","Buffalo Psychiatric Center will grow while other psychiatric centers in the state will close or change under a consolidation plan unveiled Wednesday by the state Office of Mental Health.

Inpatient services now offered at the Children’s Psychiatric Center in West Seneca and at the state psychiatric centers in Rochester and Elmira will be merged into the historic Buffalo facility at Forest and Elmwood avenues, starting in July 2014.

The Buffalo center’s inpatient psychiatric beds, now at 185, will grow to 208, said Benjamin Rosen, a spokesman for the state Office of Mental Health.

Rochester, meanwhile, will become home to a forensics center that would house psychiatric patients coming out of state prisons or patients held under court order. It will grow to 155 beds in the state’s 2015-16 fiscal year and could house some patients that would otherwise be in Buffalo.

Families who currently rely on Buffalo Psychiatric Center for inpatient services and for the outpatient treatment it offers at sites in and around the city were concerned that the facility would be closed and merged with Rochester Psychiatric Center. They were relieved as the first details of the makeover became public Wednesday afternoon.

“I am glad it is staying,’’ said Marcy Rose, president of the local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, which advocates for families and helps them navigate the fragmented mental health system. “It is positive for us. It will definitely help our families who will not have to travel all the way to Rochester.’’

Moving 41 beds from the Children’s Psychiatric Center in West Seneca to the buildings under the looming H.H. Richardson-designed towers at Buffalo Psychiatric Center was another matter, however.

“I guess I have mixed feelings. I would want to know more,’’ said Jenny Laney, director of the Child and Family Support Program run by the Mental Health Association of Erie County. The staff in West Seneca are experts at what they do, she said, and children can wait weeks or months for a bed.

“My question would be, what kind of community support will be out there to serve families?’’ she said.

The Office of Mental Health will allow patients to choose a psychiatric center anywhere in the state without regard to where they live. The state officials also said they expect their consolidation will work without laying off employees.

Even though New York in the 20th century followed the national trend to close large mental institutions, it still runs more psychiatric centers – 24 – than any other state.

The consolidation unveiled Wednesday rearranges them into 15 regional “centers of excellence”; three forensics centers in Rochester, Marcy and Manhattan; and two research centers in Manhattan and in Hudson Valley’s Orangeburg.

At the same time, the state intends to greatly expand community treatment options with hubs for those services in a number of population centers. In the western region – which extends from Lake Erie to Tompkins County, with some 3 million people – Rochester, Buffalo and Elmira would be considered hubs, but services are expected to continue in the counties that have them now.

The Office of Mental Health indicated that the energy created by the University at Buffalo Medical School and by the many other colleges here helped sway the selection of Buffalo as the site of the “Great Lakes Child and Adult Regional Center of Excellence.”

States the plan: “It will be a training site for psychiatric residents, psychology doctoral interns, pharmacy doctoral interns, and will provide advanced training and research opportunities for a wide variety of mental health and related professions.’’

The consolidation would not affect the makeover and restoration of the Richardson towers into a boutique hotel and other uses. Those historic buildings have not been used by the psychiatric center for decades.

Members of the National Alliance on Mental Illness chapter here, other patient advocates and Psychiatric Center employees had pressed state leaders to keep the Buffalo center open. They presented acting Mental Health Commissioner Kristin M. Woodlock a petition signed by hundreds of people, and they argued in Buffalo’s favor when she visited the center in April during the statewide “listening tour’’ that preceded release of the consolidation plan.

Rosen said the Office of Mental Health can consolidate psychiatric centers without State Legislature approval but must give lawmakers a year’s notice. That notice was delivered Wednesday.

The consolidation will take three years, and each center of excellence will be guided by a committee of up to 15 people led by an Office of Mental Health senior executive and the county commissioner of mental health. Many people within the mental health system agree that it has been a bumpy road since states started closing large institutions, partly so patients could live in the community and have a say in their treatment, but also so states could avoid the crushing costs of running psychiatric centers.

But as psychiatric centers closed in the last century, the number of mentally ill people in jails and prisons rose. D.J. Jaffe, who runs a think tank on the mental health system in New York City, agrees that jails today double as psychiatric centers and that states need to offer more psychiatric beds, not fewer.

“Closing psychiatric facilities is a really bad idea,” Jaffe said. “New York State is short 4,300 beds for people with serious mental illness, and that assumes we have perfect community services, and we don’t. The largest psychiatric facility in New York is Riker’s Island, and when they close these centers, they will probably have to make that one bigger.”

But the Office of Mental Health says New York can’t continue to run so many large centers.

“New York State spends one-fifth of its overall mental health budget” – $1.3 billion – “to maintain and operate the system’s outsized psychiatric hospital system, which has three times the number of state-run hospitals compared to the next largest state-operated inpatient system,” the Office of Mental Health said in the document released Wednesday.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/10/bua-one-act-festival-includes-a-knockout-selection-of-short-plays/","BUA one-act festival includes a knockout selection of short plays","Last summer, when local playwrights Donna Hoke and Matthew Crehan Higgins launched the inaugural version of Buffalo United Artists’ short-play festival, they received some 200 submissions. For its second version, now playing in the BUA Theatre, that number shot up to 300.

It must have been grueling work to cull through so many submissions, but the results are nothing short of extraordinary. The plays on stage, each of which has some gay or lesbian subject matter and happily hews to tried-and-true formulas, pack surprising emotional range, humor and sensitivity into 10 compact packages.

The evening begins with a gem called “Partners” by EM Lewis of Santa Monica, Calif., and directed by Victoria Perez. It’s a vignette featuring a female police officer (Caitlin Baeumler Coleman) who wants to introduce her gruff work partner (Kevin Craig) to her skeptical life partner (Jessica K. Rasp). Things go less smoothly than hoped, but more hilariously than expected.

Next up is the beautiful “Clink,” by New York City-based playwright Bo List and directed by Marc Sacco. It’s a look into a certain booty call situation between a “straight” man played by Kurt Erb and his lovelorn hookup, brought to believable life by Kevin Craig. The interplay between these two gifted actors is utterly credible.

“Wingman,” by Eli Effinger Weintraub of Minneapolis and directed by Rasp, gives us Alisse Sikes as a frumpy young woman trying to recover from a breakup. Coleman is her overbearing mother, given to passing out business cards to any woman who wanders past the bar. It’s a fine little comedy, schmaltzy in the best possible sense of the word.

Candace Perry’s overwritten “Twenty Years,” directed by Higgins, is a surprisingly involved drama featuring two couples (Craig and Sacco, Sikes and Coleman) tentatively courting one another for a co-parenting arrangement. The performances, much more than the writing, make this piece tick.

Higgins and Hoke teamed up to write “Kissing 101,” a clever vignette directed by Sacco in which a perennially bad kisser (Perez) takes lessons from self-styled kissing expert played charmingly by Erb.

In “Are You Married?” by Joan Lipkin of St. Louis, things turn serious for a minute as Sikes’ character launches into a tortured interior monologue over a seemingly routine medical treatment that becomes far more complicated because of her sexuality.

Lisa Ludwig directs Denver-based playwright Josh Hartwell’s “A Different Client,” a bizarre piece featuring Erb as an escort and Craig as his temporary employer who wants Erb to use his talents to strange and somewhat unsettling ends.

It wraps up with Michael Trottier’s riotously funny and eventually very dark play “The New American Sweethearts,” directed by LaValley. Sacco and Erb play a pair of actors and roommates trying to make it in Hollywood. When the straight roommate lands a job playing a flamboyantly gay character on a hit TV series, the other hitches his wagon to that particularly odd star and rides it to somewhere totally unexpected.

This collection of plays is one of the best I’ve seen on a Buffalo stage in recent years. No matter your tastes in theater, it’s sure to offer up something you’ll enjoy.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/11/lancaster-police-issue-alert-about-phone-scam-on-bounced-checks/","Lancaster police issue alert about phone scam on bounced checks","If someone calls you and says you’re in trouble for a bounced check, don’t believe it.

Lancaster police have issued a warning on their Facebook page about a telephone scam reported recently by several residents.

Someone identifying himself as a federal law enforcement officer has been calling people and telling them they’re in legal trouble because of a bounced check. Potential victims are being told they face arrest and jail time if the matter isn’t resolved immediately, police said.

The caller often has information about which bank the victim uses, police said, lending an air of apparent authenticity to the call.

Victims are directed to go to a local drugstore and buy a MoneyPak Green Dot card – a reloadable debit card – for the amount of money in question and call back.

Once the scammer has the number off the card, it can be cashed immediately, police explained.

Capt. William J. Karn Jr. of the Lancaster police said that there have been two victims of the scam so far and that both of them were senior citizens. Both incidents occurred Friday.

“A lot of these scams are directed at elderly people,” Karn said.

One of the victims reported losing more than $200 to the scam, and the other lost $164.

There are no suspects yet, but the same phone number was used in both cases.

Karn said a federal agency is assisting in the investigation. Karn said that his department has dealt with scams before but that he has never seen one like this.

“This is kind of a new one,” he said.

People who have received similar phone calls are asked to call Lancaster police at 683-2800.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/27/dreams-become-a-reality-at-white-linen-tea-house/","Dreams become a reality at White Linen Tea House","WHEATFIELD – Linda L. Kloch says she didn’t have much while growing up in the Love Canal area of Niagara Falls, but she sees herself as a woman with a vision, able to see what others have may have dismissed.

She did it once before when she bought and rehabilitated the Country Cottage restaurant in Pendleton nearly 30 years ago, but in the late 1990s she took on another ambitious project.

Each day she drove by a falling-down and dilapidated barn on Shawnee Road, a site others would have made plans to demolish. But Kloch, an avid antiques collector, saw more.

“My friends thought I was nuts,” Kloch said. “But I love to create things.”

Her reclamation of the property began in a building that had once been a corn crib, selling antiques and homemade candles. Her success with the candles, Forever Candles, led to the development of Shawnee Village, 6610 Shawnee Road, a cornucopia of shops on the property she owns. The complex now includes the independently operated Shawnee Country Barn and Antiques co-op; Patricia’s White Linen Mercantile Antiques; and Asti’s Antique Jewelry, as well as Kloch’s restaurant and residence – the White Linen Tea House.

Step inside to see collected antiques throughout the downstairs and sit down to homemade scones, lemon bars and brownies. There is a Sunday buffet; full afternoon tea service with racks of finger sandwiches, dessert and fruit; cold and hot sandwiches; and, of course, tea – more than 40 varieties, as well as coffee. Food is available for takeout. There also are flavored oils, homemade jewelry and antiques. Beer and wine also are available.

When people come, they even receive a little instruction on brewing a perfect cup of tea.

How did you get started?

The corn crib – the front little building – was my first. Now it’s Asti’s.

You must have a love of antiques.

Oh, I do. I knew I wanted to do antiques, and I thought this is just a perfect little place to do that. I wanted to share them with people. That’s why I wanted to open this.

Is this your first restaurant?

I picked up the Country Cottage in 1987. When I saw it, I was a hairdresser. I was going to pick up my mother on my day off. I picked her up once a week to do her hair, and took this road that I didn’t normally take. It happened to be the Country Cottage road. All of sudden I see this building, empty, for sale, and it said price reduced. I was a hairdresser, I owned my own shop in Cambria, and I absolutely loved doing hair, but I always had the vision that someday I wanted to have a little restaurant. When I saw that little place, I had the vision of it already in action.

Had you worked in the food industry?

Yes, my mother had a restaurant in North Tonawanda. She owned Lou’s Restaurant on Webster Street. It’s still there.

What was the Country Cottage like when you found it?

It was a mess. There was a motorcycle parked inside the building. I lived there and took the whole roof off and built it up two levels. I wanted to do a bed-and-breakfast there, but I didn’t ask the town. I ended up selling it before that happened.

But you moved on to this place on Shawnee Road. What made you say you wanted to do something different?

I purchased the barns knowing I wanted to do antiques, and I thought this is the perfect place to do it.

You showed me some pictures. It was pretty run-down.

Everything was run-down. The whole property was run-down.

What was your vision?

I can see things as if they are in action. I had a vision when I was working in the corn crib that I wanted to have a co-op over there in the larger barn. I knew that someday I wanted to do a tea house. I still want to do a bed-and-breakfast here. I saw a community and village in action. I saw people having things. It was too much for me alone.

An antique co-op is an unusual thing.

At one time I worked at Antique World, and I loved how they had all the people around there. I love people. We have 90 dealers in the big barn. There are three buildings, but they are owned privately. I am the landlord.

You also sold candles. How did that start?

It was absolutely out of the blue. I was bored. I had purchased thousands and thousands of antique bottles and started making lotions and candles. I started my candle business, Forever Candles, in the little corn crib. The candle-making business allowed me to fix all of my barns. That’s how much my candles made. I owe a lot to my candles.

I started to do shows, and then I went to the Outlet Mall and then had a permanent home at the Boulevard Mall. We just sold Forever Candles a week ago.

Your friends said you’re crazy, opening up a restaurant in an area where there are more cows and fields than shopping. What did you tell them?

They already thought I was crazy when I opened up the Country Cottage and saw there what I was doing and how much work was done. And they helped me, so they saw it all the way from its worst to the best. I am surrounded by wonderful people, dear friends. I call them my angels. But, honestly, they thought I was crazy. You couldn’t even get into the buildings.

When did you open the White Linen Tea House?

I opened it up with my two daughters 10 years ago. Where does the time go? They have both moved away now.

Why a tea house?

I had nothing as a kid. If we didn’t need it, we didn’t get it, but my cousins played a big part in my life. My aunts and my uncles used to have us over on Sundays, in our Sunday best after church, and there would be coffee and tea on fine china and pastries. I was just a little girl, but I wished I could have this. I never had it, but my mother always gave me little tea sets, and I had a lot of tea parties.

So this is like coming to your house, like family, right?

In the back of my mind, that’s what I was thinking. I have all my nice stuff. I tell all my servers whatever you do make sure that you treat them so special, like they just left their grandmother’s or aunt’s or uncle’s house.

...

The White Linen Tea House is open for lunches daily from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. Closed Wednesdays.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/16/in-focus-sarah-fonzi-sculptor/","In Focus: Sarah Fonzi, sculptor","It’s not often that you find bicycle builders, sculptors, craft beer brewers, furniture makers and other artisans plying their skills under one roof.

The Foundry bills itself as an artisans’ incubator, learning community and oasis for do-it-yourselfers.

The building at 298 Northampton St. near Jefferson Avenue was once a laundry. The artisans who have set up shop there are raising money in hopes of buying the property.

Sarah Fonzi is a sculptor whose metalwork shop is in The Foundry. She talked with The Buffalo News’ Brian Meyer about efforts to expand the facility. Here is a summary of some issues in an interview that is part of the weekly “In Focus” series. Watch the full interview above.

Meyer: Tell us about how The Foundry began.

Fonzi: The Foundry really started out of necessity. There was a small group of people looking for a space to start their business. They decided to come together to work out of this building here. We started building out walls and inviting other crafts people and artists to join them.

Meyer: Talk about the variety of folks who are here.

Fonzi: A lot of people that are here right now are creating things that are built ... There are also people who are making natural body products, brewing beer, refinishing furniture, woodworkers, metalworkers. I’m a sculptor. We have coffee roasters. We soon will have a paper mill. We have an electronics group, Buffalo Lab. There’s a lot of diversity.

Meyer: A lot of those folks were doing it from their kitchen tables and their basements and their garages.

Fonzi: Yeah, a lot of people had to move out of their previous space because they were driving their family crazy, or they were getting glass dust all over their kitchen. I was working out of a space that I could have potentially burned down. We all needed to move out of our previous spaces and start our business in a more appropriate facility.

Meyer: The Foundry has a D.I.Y component – do it yourself. Tell us about some of the workshops and other hands-on type of things.

Fonzi: There are always classes and workshops available. We invite the community to come in and get your hands dirty and learn a new skill or trade. Rusted Grain (a wood shop) has lots of workshops on the weekends and in the evenings. They have an Adirondack chair workshop coming up. There’s also Azariah’s Innocence that’s doing a (soap and cosmetics) workshop. The beer brewer is going to be doing a workshop. There’s going to be a terrarium-building workshop.

Meyer: One Saturday a month, The Foundry is open to the public.

Fonzi: True. We have an open house (the second Saturday of each month) that has live music, food, dancing, vendors, people doing demonstrations of skills. We have glassblowers, woodworkers and people just hanging out, working on their trade and inviting people to come in and ask them questions.

Meyer: The artisans are paying some type of rent, but does that cover all the costs?

Fonzi: Right now, it is. We’re all kind of working together to make this place work. We were very successful in an Indiegogo campaign, which raised $30,000 (to help) purchase the building and start to build out the rest of the facility. Right now, we’re at about 50 percent occupancy, and we have about another 20,000 square feet of building that needs to be renovated so that more artists and businesses can move in. We have a waiting list. So people are ready and willing to be members of this place. We just need to keep pushing forward.","2013-07-16 19:36:26","0","26.0","24.0","32.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","131.0","158.0","0.0","82.0","0.0","31.0","4","609","78.70","89.98","19.91","40.54","12.96","20.36","82.59","50.74","11.82","6.73","0.66","2.96","0.49","0.16","2.46","5.09","8.70","13.46","9.52","5.09","4.93","0.16","16.91","2.46","0.66","0.99","1.64","3.61","1.31","0.99","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.49","0.49","0.00","0.16","0.00","6.90","0.82","1.15","0.82","2.46","0.99","1.31","1.15","0.49","0.16","0.49","1.97","0.66","0.16","0.00","1.15","8.54","4.76","1.97","1.48","0.66","0.00","2.63","12.64","0.99","14.12","2.13","8.21","4.11","5.09","3.12","1.64","2.46","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","18.72","8.21","4.11","1.97","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.66","0.33","1.81","1.31","0.16","2751","6.92","13.456521739130435","841","603","47","75.4","9.3","5.9","9.67","7.6","101","5.25","13.81983416252073","293","12.67","8","0.52","0","23","7","63","0","63","23","1","0","3","86","47","0","59","1","0","35","12","29","1","0","6","18","0","27","17","29","6","28","17","6","3","1","1"

The outage was first reported at about 2 p.m. Company spokesman Dick Marion said the problem has been corrected and service was being restored systematically, with everyone expected to be back online by 4:30 p.m. He said NYSEG is investigating what caused the failure, but has not yet attributed it to higher demand because of the heat.

During this current heat wave, Buffalo residents are encouraged to take advantage of air-conditioned senior centers at 337 Summer St., from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and 2057 Genesee St., 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., as well as the CRUCIAL center, 230 Moselle St., 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.

The Town of Evans will open two fire halls from noon to 8 p.m. for the rest of the week for residents seeking relief from the heat and humidity.

People can bring their own refreshments and relax and cool off in the Lake Erie Beach Fire Hall, 9483 Lake Shore Road, Angola, and the Evans Center Fire Hall Station No. 1, 8298 Erie Road, Angola.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/17/lockport-due-for-flood-relief-as-state-promises-2-million-to-niagara-county/","Lockport due for flood relief as state promises $2 million to Niagara County","LOCKPORT – Although federal officials said no to helping Lockport homeowners and businesses damaged in the June 28 flash flood, the state said yes Wednesday.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that Niagara County will receive $2 million in reimbursement for flood damage, part of $16 million statewide. All the remaining money will be divided among four Mohawk Valley counties hard hit by flooding.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency rejected requests for aid to New York homeowners Monday.

“Today the state is stepping up to cover what the federal government did not: nearly $16 million in individual assistance for the people whose homes and property were damaged and destroyed,” Cuomo said.

“Thankfully, Gov. Cuomo has been with us every step of the way, and worked swiftly to organize state aid for the many individuals who are not covered under FEMA’s allocation,” Mayor Michael W. Tucker said in a news release. “I applaud the governor’s leadership for our community, and look forward to the rebuilding process.”

Lockport is believed to have had about 600 homes whose basements needed to be pumped out, and several businesses were hurt, including the Widewaters Drive-In.

FEMA did approve about $800,000 in reimbursements for the cost of repairing Lockport municipal property, including several streets that were washed out and damage to wastewater-treatment plant.

The New York State Flood Recovery Program offers grants of up to $31,900 for homeowners and up to $50,000 for small businesses and farms. The state requires documentation of all uninsured losses.

But if documentation is presented, eligible losses include appliances, heating and water systems, wells, septic systems, electrical damage, fuel tanks, drywall, insulation, foundations, floors, doors, windows and siding.

Detailed information is available by calling 1-888-769-7243 or by visiting www.nyshcr.org/Programs/NYS-Flood.

Tucker had advised city residents to file notices of claim against the city to document their losses in case of a FEMA reimbursement. So far, 54 homeowners have done so, along with one Town of Lockport resident whose car was flooded.

Corporation Counsel John J. Ottaviano said Wednesday that was a bad idea, even though the city’s insurer won’t pay the claims. “Your premium for insurance next year will go through the roof,” he warned the Common Council. “It’s based on claims paid and claims made.”

“Then it’s not worth the paper it’s printed on,” retorted Alderman Patrick W. Schrader, D-4th Ward. “It’s got to be on record somewhere.”

Alderman John Lombardi III, R-1st Ward, said some private insurers have told policyholders that they must file a claim against the city to obtain payment under their company’s policy.

Council President Anne E. McCaffrey, R-2nd Ward, said the city has ended its post-flood period of collecting all garbage put at the curb with no regard to bulk trash rules and fees.

“People are still putting stuff out. There’s no more waived period,” she said. “There’s a handful of houses the mayor knows about that should have been picked up and weren’t. Other than those six houses, if they’re putting stuff out today, it won’t be picked up.”

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/26/a-country-twang-obscures-shakespeare-in-delaware-parks-measure-for-measure/","A country twang obscures Shakespeare in Delaware Park’s ‘Measure for Measure’","William Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure,” written in 1604 but never published in his lifetime, usually falls in his “dark comedies” category (along with “Troilus and Cressida” and “All’s Well That Ends Well”), but mostly it’s called a “problem play.” Maligned for centuries for its ridiculous plot, one that pursues distasteful topics – although sex, church and state can get your attention – it then tosses them off in a hasty and contrived conclusion. Most theater companies are content to leave the work on the shelf.

But not Saul Elkin’s Shakespeare in Delaware Park. “Measure” has just opened a several-week run, the second and last play of its 38th season. Brian Cavanagh directs a willing cast, all eager to make sense out of this circuitous tale of justice, mercy and forgiveness mixed with what theater historians call “sexual unease.” The story – the original version – is this: The Duke of Vienna is dismayed with the behavior of his townsfolk. Crime is rampant. Whores and pimps rule the streets. The place is in moral decay. The Duke, dismissing his own lax leadership in all this, takes a break and leaves his post in the hands of his Puritanical deputy, Angelo.

Mistake. Iron-fisted Angelo – a guy who would “scarce confess that his blood flows” – enforces some long-neglected laws. One of them is sure to cause havoc: an anti-fornication statute. Any hanky-panky before marriage was to be punishable by death.

Young Claudio gets pretty Juliet “in trouble” and thus he’s arrested, jailed and sentenced to die in a blink. Angelo, in colorful terms, cites that Claudio has been “groping for trout, in a peculiar river.” The lad’s sister, Isabella, novice nun, is recruited to plea to Angelo for Claudio’s life. Angelo says he’ll change his mind only if Isabella sleeps with him and this causes multiplots to unfold including the old Elizabethan “bed trick,” Angelo duped, comeuppance achieved, marriages all-around, happy endings of a sort, peace restored.

The Duke, by the way, never really left town. Disguising himself as a monk, he watched goings-on from the shadows (a busybody, Lucio, called him “The Duke of Dark Corners”). And it is he who is behind all the deal-making, recognizing hypocrisy gone amok, chuckling and charading and watching people squirm at their plights. It’s no wonder that The Duke has been reviled by “Measure” audiences.

Well, all of this has been transferred by director Cavanagh to the gun-totin,’ g-droppin’ town of Vienna, Texas, with its saloon, livery stable and general store. The Duke is now The Sheriff. The story is the same, though punctuated with sagebrush philosophy and “Blazing Saddles” humor, and there are country songs, too. Loner Angelo, for example, explains himself on “My Rifle, My Pony and Me.” Isabella, distraught, warbles “Don’t Fence Me In.” These are inspired Cavanagh moments. “Measure” could use more of them. The cast does its best with all of this: Matt Witten is Duke/Sheriff; Ray Boucher provides much fun as streetwise Pompey; Susan Drozd is lovely Isabella; Patrick Moltane, a conflicted Angelo. Plus Steve Petersen, Brian Zybala, Sheila Connors, Todd Fuller, Larry Smith, Geoff Pictor, Diane Curley and Zak Ward, excellent as conniver Lucio.

Director Cavanagh has said that “Measure for Measure” “doesn’t have a lot to it.” Not true. A sarcastic, maybe bitter Shakespeare has a lot to say about some serious topics and there are some beautiful passages. You’ll have to listen carefully to hear them amid drawl and twang. The play always needs to be tweaked, updated and adapted. But not damaged.

Norrie Epstein, a Bard researcher, once wrote that “With the possible exception of Jesus, Shakespeare has caused more foolishness and brilliance than any other human being.” Unfortunately, this cowpoke “Measure for Measure” is top-heavy on the former.","2013-07-26 17:17:35","0","18.0","24.0","32.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","131.0","158.0","0.0","68.0","0.0","31.0","4","632","86.25","66.54","8.64","28.40","15.80","23.58","74.05","42.72","8.54","4.11","0.63","0.00","0.32","2.37","0.79","4.43","7.12","12.82","6.80","3.01","5.54","1.27","11.08","4.27","2.06","0.47","0.79","3.01","7.59","3.80","3.64","0.95","0.79","0.32","8.39","0.47","0.16","0.16","3.80","10.13","1.74","1.27","0.95","2.53","1.74","2.37","2.53","0.95","0.95","0.32","1.27","0.63","0.16","0.47","0.00","4.11","0.63","0.95","1.58","1.27","0.47","2.06","8.70","0.47","11.39","2.06","5.70","3.32","2.22","1.27","0.16","0.16","1.27","0.32","0.63","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.47","0.00","27.69","6.33","9.02","0.47","0.47","0.00","0.00","1.74","6.65","2.22","0.63","0.16","3024","8.52","19.515151515151516","917","626","39","63.59","10.8","8.4","12.24","10.8","162","8.9","18.79143769968051","396","17.97","1","0.44","0","27","4","61","0","73","49","2","2","3","107","103","1","24","3","0","18","14","22","0","0","1","14","0","17","14","8","19","10","42","1","3","0","0"

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/09/30/canonization-for-john-xxiii-and-john-paul-ii-now-set-for-april/","Canonization for John XXIII and John Paul II now set for April","LONDON – The pope who tried to modernize the Catholic Church and the one who directed its moral force against godless communism will be officially declared saints next April, the Vatican announced Monday.

John XXIII and John Paul II are to be canonized together in an unusual double bill that could see not just one but two of their successors attend the April 27, 2014, ceremony. It would be an unprecedented event uniting a pair of dead pontiffs with a pair of living ones, the reigning Pope Francis and the retired Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.

Francis decided in July that the names of John XXIII and John Paul II would be “inscribed in the book of saints” at the same time, a clear signal of his personal admiration for and identification with their pontificates.

John XXIII convened the historic Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, which instituted such reforms as Masses in the vernacular, instead of Latin, to bring the church and the gospel closer to contemporary believers. Many of those changes remain controversial, but in a lengthy, recently published interview, Francis lauded Vatican II for reviving the faith and described its modernizing work as “absolutely irreversible.”

“Vatican II produced a renewal movement that simply comes from the same gospel. Its fruits are enormous,” the pope said.

The Polish John Paul II, the first non-Italian to lead the church in more than 400 years, was beloved by Catholics the world over for his warm, personal style and his unbending opposition to Soviet communism. Many see a similarity between his populist touch and that of Francis, who wades into crowds and embraces followers with equal enthusiasm.

The December date originally set for the double canonization was pushed back to April in part to make it easier for Poles to travel to the Vatican for the ceremony after the spring thaw. When John Paul was beatified in April 2011, a milestone on the road to sainthood, more than a million pilgrims descended on Rome to celebrate.

Unusual circumstances surround the canonization of both men. It has been centuries since anyone was declared a saint after death as quickly as John Paul II. When he died in 2005, mourners in St. Peter’s Square chanted, “Sainthood now!”

As for John XXIII, who died in 1963, Francis ditched the usual requirement that a second miracle be attributed to his posthumous intervention.

As a mark of his respect, Francis prayed at both men’s tombs on the anniversary this year of John Paul II’s death. Also, next April’s ceremony falls on Divine Mercy Sunday, a feast day that was created by John Paul.

Whether Benedict XVI, who stepped down from the papacy in February, will attend is not yet clear.

A proposal to implement a new downtown parking system with pay-and-display machines was rejected by a 3-2 vote of the City Council tonight. (I wrote about the proposal here.)

The Council also unanimously approved more than $1 million in purchases of new equipment for the Department of Public Works and Parks.

The proposed purchases include about $555,000 in snow removal equipment, including a tandem dump truck with a plow, a payloader, a single-axle dump truck and two pickup trucks.

The approval also covers $194,000 for a street sweeper, a hybrid SUV, as well as $118,000 in equipment to maintain Hyde Park Golf Course, one vehicle for Hyde Park maintenance and a bucket truck for the city’s forestry department.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/09/30/two-marine-generals-fired-for-afghan-security-lapses/","Two Marine generals fired for Afghan security lapses","WASHINGTON – The commandant of the Marine Corps on Monday took the extraordinary step of firing two generals for not adequately protecting a giant base in southern Afghanistan that Taliban fighters stormed last year, resulting in the deaths of two Marines and the destruction of a half a dozen U.S. fighter jets.

It is the first time since the Vietnam War that a general, let alone two, has been sacked for negligence after a successful enemy attack. But the assault also was unprecedented: Fifteen insurgents entered a NATO airfield and destroyed almost an entire squadron of Marine AV-8B Harrier jets, the largest single loss of allied materiel in the almost 12-year Afghan war.

The commandant, Gen. James Amos, said the two generals did not deploy enough troops to guard the base and take other measures to prepare for a ground attack by the Taliban. The two generals – Maj. Gen. Charles Gurganus, the top Marine commander in southern Afghanistan at the time, and Maj. Gen. Gregg Sturdevant, the senior Marine aviation officer in the area – “failed to exercise the level of judgment expected of commanders of their rank,” Amos said.

“It was unrealistic to think that a determined enemy would not be able to penetrate the perimeter fence,” Amos said.

The incident brings into stark relief the unique challenges of waging war in Afghanistan. The withdrawal of thousands of U.S. troops over the past two years has forced commanders to triage, sometimes leading them to thin out defenses. The U.S. military also has been forced to rely on other nations’ troops, who often are not as well trained or equipped, to safeguard American personnel and supplies.

The attack occurred at Camp Bastion, a British-run NATO air base in Helmand province that adjoins Camp Leatherneck, a vast U.S. facility that serves as the NATO headquarters for southwestern Afghanistan. Because Leatherneck does not have a runway, the Marines use Bastion as their principal air hub in the country. Several hundred Marines live and work on the British side, and dozens of U.S. helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are parked there.

The British are responsible for guarding Bastion, which is ringed by a chain-link fence, triple coils of razor wire and watchtowers from which sentries can scan the horizon for any potential attackers. British commanders had assigned the task of manning the towers to troops from Tonga, which has sent 55 soldiers to Afghanistan.

On the night of the attack, the Tongans left unmanned the nearest watchtower to the point of the Taliban breach, according to an investigation by the U.S. Central Command.

Other aspects of the U.S.-British security plan were “sub-optimal,” the investigation found, with no single officer in charge of security for both Bastion and Leatherneck. The security arrangement created command-and-control relationships “contrary to the war-fighting principles of simplicity,” Amos wrote in a memo accepting the investigation.

Despite the overall troop reduction, several officers stationed at Leatherneck at the time said that many Marines with idle time could have been assigned to guard duty.

Gurganus and Sturdevant will be allowed to retire, but Amos said it will be up to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to determine their final rank.The last two-star general believed to be fired for combat incompetence was Army Maj. Gen. James Baldwin, who was relieved of command in 1971 following a North Vietnamese attack on a U.S. outpost that killed 30 soldiers.","2013-09-30 20:41:56","0","21.0","24.0","32.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","131.0","158.0","0.0","68.0","0.0","31.0","4","573","98.77","51.40","19.69","4.51","22.04","28.10","73.12","41.01","3.84","0.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.70","3.14","11.69","14.83","5.58","1.22","3.66","1.05","9.08","3.14","1.40","0.87","3.49","1.57","6.28","2.09","4.19","0.00","3.32","0.52","3.49","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.00","6.98","1.22","1.75","0.52","1.40","0.17","2.09","1.75","0.17","0.87","0.70","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.00","12.57","1.22","2.97","7.68","0.70","1.57","4.19","4.36","1.05","13.09","1.22","8.38","3.49","3.49","0.17","0.00","0.52","0.00","1.05","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","16.23","7.50","5.06","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.92","1.40","0.17","0.00","0.00","2815","8.52","30.57894736842105","845","564","29","60.24","12.6","9.7","12.88","12.8","140","16.0","19.689078014184396","305","27.05","22","0.4","0","15","12","70","0","71","47","0","2","5","93","82","3","37","0","0","4","3","17","0","0","1","19","0","22","27","11","18","3","11","5","2","0","0"

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/10/07/gas-prices-may-rise-this-winter/","Gas prices may rise this winter","Expect to pay more this winter when the furnace kicks on.

Coming off last winter’s benevolent bills – when heating costs fell to their lowest level in a decade – National Fuel Gas Co. is predicting that consumers will pay almost 22 percent more this year.

But even with that big increase – the actual amount consumers will pay depends on how cold this winter turns out to be – heating costs still will remain relatively low by local standards.

National Fuel said Monday it expects the average heating bill in the Buffalo Niagara region to jump by about $128 from the beginning of November through the end of March to about $714, compared with the 10-year low of $586 last year, when consumers benefitted from steadily declining natural gas prices and warmer temperatures that meant consumers used less natural gas to heat their homes.

Since then, however, natural gas commodity prices have inched higher, and the Amherst-based energy company based its forecast on the assumption that consumers will use more gas than they did during each of the past two winters as more normal winter temperatures are predicted.

While heating bills for winter are expected to be more than last year, they’re still a far cry from heating costs that routinely topped $1,000 from 2005 to 2009. Natural gas commodity prices are about 40 percent lower today than they were in January 2010.

However, those prices currently are about 7 percent higher than they were a year ago and about 17 percent above the winter low set in mid-January.

If those projections hold true, it would be the fifth straight winter of relatively low heating bills in the Buffalo Niagara region. Heating costs during each of the last four winters have been running about 40 percent lower than they were during the winter of 2005-06, when heat bills averaged a record $1,124.

Karen Merkel, a National Fuel spokeswoman, noted the weather has such a strong influence on gas prices that forecasting heating costs can be difficult. Last winter, for instance, National Fuel predicted that heating bills would rise by an average of almost 7 percent, only to see them fall by nearly 5 percent to a 10-year low.

“It all hinges on the winter and what the weather does,” she said. “We’ve been fortunate the last two winters with the weather.”

Gas prices have been lowered by the robust supplies from the boom in production from the Marcellus Shale and elsewhere in the country.

“With so much production just to the south in Pennsylvania and so much capacity to move it from there to here, we have a very favorable supply situation,” said Gary Marchiori, the president of EnergyMark, a Williamsville-based energy services firm.

Heading into the winter, natural gas inventories are slightly above the five-year average for this time of year, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Those robust supplies will help keep upward pressure off natural gas commodity prices, according to analysts from the Natural Gas Supply Association, an industry group.

The commodity price of natural gas stood at $3.63 per 1,000 cubic feet on Monday. National Fuel’s gas costs differ because the utility buys some of its gas in advance and stores it underground until it’s needed, and it buys some of it through advance-purchase contracts or purchases on the spot market, Merkel said.

The commodity price is important because it accounts for 42 percent of the total price that National Fuel’s residential customers pay. Operating costs associated with delivering the gas to customers, taxes, the company’s profits and interest make up the rest.

National Fuel, like all utilities in the state, does not make a profit on the natural gas that it sells its customers. The utility makes its money on the rates, negotiated through the state Public Service Commission, to deliver gas to homes and businesses.

It also helps that Western New Yorkers have steadily reduced the amount of natural gas they use to heat their homes, through more efficient furnaces and water heaters, and programmable thermostats. National Fuel’s average residential customer now uses about 45 percent less gas per year than in 1973.

About 86 percent of the households in Buffalo Niagara heat with natural gas, the U.S. Census Bureau says, while 7 percent heat with electricity and 3 percent with fuel oil.

That’s a big financial boost for Western New Yorkers, since heating with natural gas costs about 70 percent less than heating oil and almost a third less than electricity, according to nationwide data from the Energy Information Administration.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/10/22/nll-players-agree-to-seven-year-deal/","NLL, players agree to seven-year deal","The National Lacrosse League has completed a deal with the Professional Lacrosse Players’ Association on a collective bargaining agreement.

The seven-year contract goes into effect immediately, and either side can opt out of the deal after five years. Compromises by both sides were made in order to put the league in a better financial situation.

Some of the highlights of the agreement include:

• The active roster for each team has been reduced from 23 players to 20; 18 players can dress for each game.

• A luxury tax will be imposed on teams that spent more than $400,000 on salaries, bonuses and promotional considerations in a given year. The rate starts at 25 percent and goes up in steps from there.

• The qualifying age for unrestricted free agency has dropped from 32 to 30. In addition, any player older than 34 has the right to reject designation as a “franchise player,” which would force him to remain with the same team.

“We laid out the direction we needed to make changes. The players listened,” NLL Commissioner George Daniel said. “Everyone wants to cut a bigger piece of the pie, but the pie needs to get bigger.”

“We did do a financial analysis of all of the teams, and we brought that information to the table,” said Peter Schmitz, the President of the Professional Lacrosse Players’ Association. “We agreed to curb expenses as best we could without diminishing the product. … The recognition of the situation from both sides was a solid approach and led to much better negotiations.”

The change in the free agency rules means that such players as Billy Dee Smith and Chad Culp of the Buffalo Bandits have become unrestricted free agents. Both are 31. All teams now can begin signing players on their rosters.

The NLL also can go ahead with some previously announced actions now that the new CBA is in effect. The schedule will go from 16 to 18 games, and the season will begin on Dec. 28. The Minnesota Swarm has moved from the West to the East. Six of the nine teams — three from each division — will qualify for the playoffs, down from eight.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/02/04/bargaining-chip-seen-in-non-indian-casino-plan/","Bargaining chip seen in non-Indian casino plan","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo may have plans for a new, non-Indian casino in Niagara Falls, but the city isn’t preparing to double down just yet.

Community leaders said Sunday that they would certainly welcome another gambling hall to their tourist community, but they view Cuomo’s plan as more of a bargaining chip than a reality at this point.

The thinking is that if Cuomo threatens to allow a competitor to the Seneca Niagara Casino, the Senecas will be more likely to pay the more than $500 million in casino proceeds owed to the state.

“Of course, he’s using it as a bargaining chip,” said Niagara Falls Block Club President Roger L. Spurback. “I would do the same thing.”

But it also provides Niagara Falls with a Plan B if the Senecas either win the arbitration or simply refuse to pay.

“The discussion of the possibility of a non-Seneca casino in Niagara Falls serves two objectives,” said Mayor Paul A. Dyster. “It creates additional leverage to resolve the dispute with the Senecas, and at the same time, it provides an option if the dispute isn’t resolved.”

Other observers said privately that the strategy is essentially a win-win situation for Cuomo and the state.

Either the plan for a non-Indian casino forces the Senecas’ hand or it gives the city a new revenue generator as it struggles to survive without $60 million in slot machine proceeds withheld by the Senecas.

It could also push a billionaire landowner with close ties to Cuomo to finally develop his blighted properties in downtown Niagara Falls.

Those options are all possibilities, officials said, but at the moment, the focus is on resolving the current casino dispute with the Senecas.

No city or state leaders contacted by The Buffalo News suggested that plans for a new casino would render the current dispute meaningless.

“Discussion about what happens in the future, to our way of thinking, doesn’t change what is owed or what has taken place already,” Dyster cautioned.

“The key for us is to resolve the dispute so we can get paid, but at the same time, if the Senecas continue to refuse to pay and the dispute isn’t resolved, it’s important that we move forward with other options.

“I don’t see how the Governor’s Office could not look at this.”

And a second casino is certainly an alternative, said State Sen. George D. Maziarz, R-Newfane.

“I think the governor is as exhausted as everyone else is with the nonpayment by the Senecas, and I think he’s exploring all the options,” said Maziarz, who counts the Senecas among his major campaign contributors. “I think he’s doing the right thing.”

Spurback, who has criticized Cuomo in the past, also believes that the governor’s plan will ultimately help the city. But he believes that Cuomo’s motivations center on the state allowing “racinos” and other gambling devices, which drove the Senecas to withhold the money.

Spurback believes that it would benefit Cuomo to get the Senecas to agree to a settlement before the current arbitration ends because the state is the party that violated the deal.

“When arbitration ends … New York State will lose that,” Spurback said. What the governor is doing, he added, “is putting his cards on the table before arbitration to get the Senecas to the table.”

Another theory is that, despite the recent plans for a new casino and the apparent frustration at the pace of negotiations by the state, both sides are relatively close to an agreement.

Cuomo’s aggressive stance on the issue could actually compel hard-liners in the Seneca government to move closer to the moderates, who have been pushing for a deal.

A spokeswoman for Seneca President Barry E. Snyder Sr. declined to comment on the casino plan.

Spurback’s organization and other groups in the community proposed a similar non-Indian casino plan late last year. They sent copies of the proposal to Cuomo and a representative of Howard P. Milstein, the Manhattan billionaire who owns more than 140 acres of prime, undeveloped downtown land.

Building a new casino in the Falls could push Milstein to develop the blighted expanse that sits at the entrance to the city, which many say is the prime area for a new casino.

But it also would raise questions about Cuomo’s relationship with Milstein, a major campaign donor to Cuomo who he appointed in 2011 to lead the state Thruway Authority.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/02/04/super-bowl-notebook-graham-makes-an-impact-on-big-stage/","Super Bowl notebook: Graham makes an impact on big stage","NEW ORLEANS — The San Francisco 49ers had three plays to move the ball five yards and win the Super Bowl.

Twice, they tried to beat Baltimore Ravens cornerback Corey Graham. Twice, the 49ers failed.

Graham, a Turner-Carroll alum, helped Baltimore lock down the Super Bowl XLVII victory Sunday night by denying San Francisco receiver Michael Crabtree inside the two-minute warning and helping the Ravens win, 34-31.

On second and third down, Colin Kaepernick threw to Crabtree on the right side of the field — once in the end zone and once in the flat — but Graham didn’t buckle.

“The pressure’s on down there,” Ravens defensive coordinator Dean Pees said. “I mean, you’re not going to get any help in those situations, and to play a guy like Crabtree down there, my hat’s off to him. It’s a great job.”

Pees said he called for run pressure on all three of those plays from the 5-yard line. Kaepernick is a threat to run, and Frank Gore rushed for 1,214 yards and eight touchdowns in the regular season.

But the Niners ran LaMichael James up the middle for a 2-yard gain on first down and then threw three times to Crabtree, who was covered by Graham on the first two.

“It’s like a blur,” Graham said. “I can’t tell you exactly what they did. “But when it comes down to it, we get paid to cover. You’ve got to go out there and cover your guy and not be the guy that gives up a touchdown.”

On second down, Graham and Crabtree jostled for position in the end zone, and Kaepernick’s pass sailed. On third down, Kaepernick went to the sideline, but Graham and Jimmy Smith were there to break up the pass.

On fourth down, Kaepernick tried Crabtree again. The ball was overthrown. Niners coach Jim Harbaugh complained that Smith held him.

“I’m thinking about making a play to help us win the game,” Graham said. “I don’t look at it like ‘Don’t give up this touchdown.’ I look at it as, ‘Make this play to win.’

“We knew it was going to come down to making a play at the end. We knew we had to clamp down and find a way to get it done. Guys stepped up. Guys made plays when they mattered.”

Graham, a special-teams Pro Bowler who didn’t become a starter until Lardarius Webb went down with a knee injury, closed out a fantastic postseason with six tackles and two pass breakups.

Graham also made a tackle on James, allowing outside linebacker Courtney Upshaw to force a fumble the Ravens recovered and converted into a touchdown.

“Corey’s just done a great job for us all year,” Pees said. “This is a guy that’s filled in for [Webb] early in the season, played consistent. I can’t say enough about him.”

...

Niners quarterback Kaepernick made only seven regular-season starts, third-fewest for any Super Bowl starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler started only four games when he led the New York Giants past the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV. Future Bills quarterback Vince Ferragamo started five games for the Los Angeles Rams before losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XIV.

...

Sunday’s matchup was only the second time in Super Bowl history that both teams lost in the conference championship the season before. The only other time it happened was Super Bowl XXX between the Dallas Cowboys and Steelers.

The Giants beat the 49ers last season for the NFC championship, and the New England Patriots defeated the Ravens for the AFC title,

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/01/board-members-trade-barbs-over-proposed-amherst-hyatt/","Board members trade barbs over proposed Amherst Hyatt","Debate over the proposed Hyatt Place hotel dominated the Amherst Town Board on Monday, with board members, residents and the developer all exchanging verbal blows as the controversial project moved ahead.

Just hours after Iskalo Development accused Supervisor Barry A. Weinstein and his challenger, Council Member Mark A. Manna, of turning the $15 million hotel into a political football, both lawmakers took political pot shots at each other during a heated exchange.

Democrat Manna demanded a resignation of the two top Zoning Board officials who green-lighted the hotel, pointing out they both happened to be high-ranking members of the town Republican Party appointed by Weinstein.

Weinstein, not to be outdone, then told Manna that Carl Balmas, the embattled Zoning Board official and Republican Party head, had already submitted his resignation.

“But I’m not going to let you take credit for it,” Weinstein said.

That exchange perhaps illustrated the point of Iskalo Executive Vice President David Chiazza, who in his letter to the Town Board wrote that “Wimbledon is not the only tennis match being played these days as the candidates for Town Supervisor have also been exchanging volleys.”

Chiazza went on to say that both candidates – who are now pushing against the six-story hotel being built near Interstate 290 – initially supported the project.

“Of course, this all changed once the project became political,” Chiazza wrote.

Politics aside, the project has been rolling ahead in recent days as bulldozers began clearing land for the hotel’s foundation.

But that could change with the announcement Monday by attorney Richard Berger that his clients – the homeowners challenging the project – will go to court in the coming days to seek an injunction to stop construction.

It’s also unclear whether the town’s new legal challenge to the project – announced Friday and approved by the board Monday – could pose a new hurdle to the hotly contested project.

Residents – who turned out in large numbers and in their customary red outfits – are supportive of the new legal challenge announced by Weinstein but say it will have “zero effect” absent more aggressive measures.

Manna, meanwhile, sought to put more blame on Weinstein for not coming out sooner against the Hyatt project and another six-story hotel on Main Street.

“If this wasn’t an election year, these residents would be staring at a six-story hotel, like the residents on Main Street,” Manna said.

Weinstein countered that Manna could have stopped the Hyatt project by urging his fellow Democrats to vote against tax breaks when it came before the Amherst Industrial Development Agency, as Weinstein did.

The debate came to a bizarre end when Weinstein referenced two anonymous Internet commenters who said they stood behind Manna when he supported the Main Street hotel.

“You really are desperate now, aren’t you?” Manna asked Weinstein. “Two anonymous bloggers on the Internet?”

“I am really desperate,” Weinstein said, adding later that he was drawn into the political debate by Manna.

June B. Walker, a pioneer as a woman in the construction business, died Wednesday after a brief bout with pancreatic cancer. She was 93 and lived in Canterbury Woods retirement community, Amherst.

A native of Buffalo, the former June Seufert graduated from the Buffalo Seminary and from business college.

She worked briefly in banking prior to marrying Stuart A. Walker of Buffalo in 1941.She raised three sons while serving as an active school and community volunteer and member of Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church and the Graduates Association of the Buffalo Seminary. In her retirement, she was an active member of the Twentieth-Century Club.

When her husband founded a construction company in the 1960s, she joined him as vice president, making her a pioneering female contractor at the time, as she worked side by side with her husband in developing the company, known as Stuart A. Walker and Associates. She and her husband closed the business when they retired in 1985.

In her youth, Mrs. Walker was an accomplished violinist, winning competitions in both Canada and the United States. She was also an avid bowler, winning numerous trophies, and maintained a lifelong physical fitness regimen into her 90s.

Her husband died in 1999, and her youngest son, Timothy L., died in 1992.

Survivors include two sons, David S. and George W.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/01/market-analysis-shows-assets-of-hamburg/","Market analysis shows assets of Hamburg","As Hamburg village officials decide how to build on the successful redevelopment of Main and Buffalo streets, they will be considering a market analysis to identify areas for economic growth.

Assets in the village include a populace that is wealthier than its neighbors, well-educated and with substantial disposable income, according to the new study.

But the village is nearly built out, so the focus should be on the redevelopment of underutilized land, according to the market analysis of the village by Peter J. Smith & Co., a municipal planning firm. Members of the firm discussed the results Monday night with the Village Board.

The report analyzed industrial, residential, commercial and retail markets. It found:

• The village has virtually no industrial sites available.

• There is nearly full occupancy in retail areas, except where owners are asking well above market rates.

• Spending patterns show there is a market for higher-end products and boutiques.

• There are few large noncommercial buildings available, and there should be more diversity in housing options.

The median income in the village is $63,000, compared with $59,000 in the Town of Hamburg, said Dan Leonard of Peter J. Smith. But because there are not enough retail offerings in the village, there is a “leakage” of about $15 million, meaning that village residents spend $15 million outside the village.

Eve Holberg, also of the planning firm, said there are four areas the village should concentrate on: the industrial West End, on and around Evans Street; Lake Street; Eighteen Mile Creek near South Buffalo Street; and the village gateway off the Thruway on Camp Road.

“It’s nothing that we have not thought of before,” Trustee Paul Gaughan said.

The market analysis is the first step in implementing the new comprehensive plan, but it needs to be taken to the next level, the planners said.

“There is a lot of potential for growth,” Leonard said. “It’s not going to naturally happen, because we don’t have the space for it.”

“This cannot sit on the back shelf,” Mayor Thomas J. Moses Sr. said of the report.

"http://buffalonews.com/2013/07/03/pro-prospects-top-all-wny-baseball-team/","Pro prospects top All-WNY baseball team","The glow of being a high school graduate lasted about one day for Mark Armstrong and Jonah Heim.

Both quickly left one stage for another and are now professional baseball players with their respective big league teams.

Armstrong was taken in the third round by the Cincinnati Reds while Heim was a fourth-rounder by the Baltimore Orioles. They have something else in common as both were named to the 42nd All-Western New York team, chosen by local coaches.

Armstrong, whose right arm carried Clarence to the New York State Class AA finals, was named the WNY Player of the Year. He’s currently working out with other Reds rookies at their extended spring training facility in Goodyear, Ariz.

“Just being on top, playing for a state championship, this was one of the most memorable seasons I’ve ever played,” Armstrong said. “Getting drafted while I was with the guys is one tremendous feeling I’ll never forget.”

Heim, a switch-hitting catcher for Amherst, flew in late June to Sarasota, Fla., where he will play for the Orioles rookie team in the Gulf Coast League.

Conley batted .542 from the left side and homered in his last at-bat as an Eagle. He was lauded by his coach, Bob Kowal, for being the most unselfish player he’s coached in 27 years. His 18 career home runs are a school record and his 133 hits are second all-time at Lake Shore.

Fredonia wins state title

Having two players taken in baseball’s amateur draft was one of many highlights this spring. Section VI had four teams reach the state final four, three advance to the title games and one, Fredonia, bring home a title. The Hillbillies also won the title in 2006.

Fredonia was able to seal the deal by beating Clinton of Section III, 7-0. They are represented on All-WNY by senior outfielder Nick Hart. Fredonia’s final 25-2 mark included a school record 17-game winning streak.

“They had one goal and that was to win a state title,” said coach Vince Gullo, who returned seven starters. “They started talking about it just after we got beat in the Far West Regionals last year. This group of seniors was dedicated, they were super athletes and they accepted all the underclassmen on the team as family.”

Clarence (Class AA) and Williamsville South (Class A) were eliminated in state championship games while Pine Valley lost in the Class D state semifinals. The Panthers have won six out of the last seven sectional titles.

South right-hander Damian Powers was the ECIC III Player of the Year with a no-hitter against Hamburg. He allowed just three earned runs in 28 playoff innings. Opponents hit .178 against him.

St. Joe’s landed two All-WNY picks after winning back-to-back Georgetown Cups. Baldinelli is a slick infielder who is taking his glove to St. Bonaventure. He had a game-saving play defensively in a 1-0 win over St. Francis in the playoff semifinals. Baldinelli was 65 of 66 in stolen bases in his career.

Junior outfielder Philip Wells was the Monsignor Martin Association’s Offensive Player of the Year, batting .463. The Marauders swept rival Canisius, 2-0, in their best-of-three series to win the title at Coca-Cola Field.

Clarence (large schools) and Fredonia (small) were champions of the WNY Coaches polls.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/12/citadels-ken-griffin-would-break-up-big-banks.html","Citadel's Ken Griffin would break up big banks","Ken Griffin, one of America's best-known hedge fund investors, has a radical idea: Break up big banks, and restore competition and transparency to the financial services industry.

The head of Citadel Capital came out swinging at his own industry in a rare public interview at The New York Times' DealBook Conference on Tuesday.

America's banks have become not just too big to fail, but too big to manage, Griffin told Andrew Ross Sorkin. The first wave of the wand would be to separate securities trading businesses from banking businesses, reducing the kind of systemic risk that led to the financial crisis.

""They got it right in the Great Depression,"" he said. The Glass-Steagall Act ""actually makes a tremendous amount of sense. It is not appropriate for the securities trading industry in our country to [receive] the taxpayer support implicit in the FDIC-insured companies.""

This is not likely to be a popular position with his peers. But, Griffin said, ""watching the populist anger toward all the financial services over the last couple of years makes me wonder why more people that sit closer to where I sit don't want to put themselves outside of the taxpayer support position they are in today.""

The rich were getting richer, the poor poorer and the unemployment numbers were stagnant.

Even though the country had added 2 million jobs, many states, especially in the South, continued to suffer. Mississippi's median household income, which is the amount of money earned by the household that falls exactly in the middle of the pack of all the other households, was nearly half that of the richest.

Childhood poverty is a big problem for states that are among the poorest. Many have a child poverty rate around 25 percent.

Even more grim is that in 2012, 46.5 million U.S. citizens lived below the poverty line, slightly more than in 2011. That's 15 percent of the country.

The stock market is climbing and corporate profits have bounced back. Not to mention that last year, 2 million jobs were added, but through all of this the income of the average U.S. household has not fluctuated much, according to recently released data from the Census Bureau.

Only four U.S. states showed an increase in median annual household income from 2011 to 2012. Median household income is the amount of money earned by the household that falls exactly in the middle of pack.

The middle is a tough place to be, however, as the top 1 percent economically have recovered from the recession, but other income groups have not. According to the Census Bureau, those in bottom 80 percent of income distribution are generally making less than they had before the recession hit.

On a whole, some states have fared better than the rest, often helped by lower levels of poverty, lower unemployment and a highly educated workforce.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/26/eu-threatens-to-halt-terrorist-fund-tracking-deal-with-us.html","EU threatens to halt terrorist fund tracking deal with US","Anger continues to spread across Brussels over allegations that the United States has been spying on European Union citizens.

The latest public attack came on Tuesday when EU lawmakers called for the suspension of a controversial financial data sharing agreement between the European Union (EU) and the U.S. aimed at tracking terrorists' funds, after revelations that the U.S. tapped international bank transfer information of citizens in the 28-nation bloc.

European politicians were angered at the explosive reports revealed in German newspaper Spiegel, showing that the U.S. authorities are monitoring personal money transfer information, including bank and credit card transactions, raising further tension with Washington

The reports were written from documents provided by former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden

""For me the agreement is effectively dead...it is null and void,"" said Dutch Member of Parliament (MEP) Sophie in' t Veld at the European Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee on Tuesday.

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told MEPs that she has asked America to clarify its position regarding the allegations, but had not received a satisfactory reply.

""I'm not satisfied with what we have gotten so far,"" Malmstrom said.

""There have been very severe allegations in the press,"" said Malmstrom adding, ""If these allegations are true, they constitute a breach of the agreement and a breach of the agreement can certainly lead to a suspension.""

The agreement, known as the terror finance tracking program (TFTP) was agreed in 2010, and requires EU authorities to transfer data to the U.S. Treasury from the Brussels-based system which collates global financial transaction data under the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).

A suspension of the TFTP can occur if there is a breach of the agreement. While experts are unsure if the EU will actually rescind the policy, they agree that there will be a big change in the relationship between the 28-member bloc and the U.S.

""I don't see this ending up in a suspension but the conflict will be used to review some of the old agreements between the EU and U.S. and reduce the asymmetry between the continents,"" Roderick Parkes, head of the EU institute at the Polish Institute of International Affairs.

""The U.S. are getting more data than we are and under laxer conditions. It has never been a fair deal.""

The EU and U.S. are currently negotiating a trade deal, but the tensions between Washington and Brussels have sparked fears that the agreement could be halted.

Parkes said the so called Transatlantic Trade & Investment Partnership (TTIP) is an example of how the EU and U.S. are trying to increase political cooperation, but the spying scandal threatens the future of the deal.

""The allegations fly in the face of what we are trying to do in the bigger geopolitical picture. The ramifications could be very big for the issue of how we increase cross-Atlantic trade and in the EU between countries that have a hard-headed attitude towards cooperating with the U.S.""

According to the European Commission, the TFTP is a tool for allowing ""scrutiny that could prove instrumental in tracking transactions between terrorist cells"".

Outrage from MEPs over the issue has been welcomed by some experts who feel that a review of the agreement is key to creating a global data protection framework.

""I think this is a very good position because we need to clear the situation and understand to what extent the sharing of information is beneficial against the fight against terrorism and whether it is legal,"" Paolo Balboni, scientific director at the European Privacy Association think tank said.

""It is not good to have this sort of compromised relationship with the U.S., because what I hope is that we are not only going to create good privacy legislation for Europe, but I am hoping we create rules that are well coordinated with privacy legislation across the world.""

Rob Wainwright, head of Europol told MEPs that the agency could not ""confirm or deny"" the spying allegations.

Four U.S. senators announced a draft bill on Wednesday that looks to rein in the U.S. surveillance program, including prohibiting the NSA's collection of phone records and preventing the tapping of Internet communications.","2013-09-26 10:08:37","0","36.0","20.0","1.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","241.0","284.0","0.0","133.0","12.0","27.0","3","743","95.74","61.66","10.05","66.53","37.15","28.13","75.77","45.76","6.46","2.42","0.81","1.21","0.00","0.13","0.27","4.04","11.71","13.59","7.54","2.02","4.71","0.94","12.92","3.23","1.75","1.35","0.54","1.08","6.86","4.44","2.29","1.21","1.08","0.00","6.06","0.00","0.13","0.13","0.00","8.48","1.88","1.75","1.48","1.62","0.67","2.56","2.29","0.94","0.81","0.54","0.54","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.69","3.23","1.08","4.44","0.81","0.67","3.36","7.27","1.08","9.69","1.62","6.19","2.02","5.79","0.27","0.13","2.42","0.00","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.13","0.00","18.44","6.59","3.23","0.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.67","2.96","1.35","2.69","0.13","3711","8.81","38.0","1163","737","32","48.13","14.4","12.3","13.76","15.0","188","7.5","21.403527815468113","364","32.1","55","0.46","0","22","4","93","0","95","44","3","1","9","98","125","2","42","0","0","20","2","18","3","0","1","17","0","23","19","28","22","29","24","5","5","0","3"

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/08/26/Least-tax-friendly-states-for-retirees.html?slide=0","Least tax-friendly states for retirees","Forget what you know about withdrawal rates. The key to making your nest egg last is to spend less money than you earn.



Due to state tax law differences, however, you'll soon learn that where you live during retirement largely dictates what you spend.

Some states, such as Minnesota and Vermont, impose a hefty tax on retirement income, while California's top income tax rate is a budget busting 13.3 percent. Others, including New Jersey, have the highest property tax rate in the nation, while 14 states tax Social Security benefits either in part or in full. They are: Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia. (Not all, though, made our list of least tax friendly states for retirees.)

Also, the sheer size of the aging baby boomer population has encouraged most states to consider more tax-favorable legislation for seniors, said Kathleen Thies, state tax analyst for CCH tax services firm in Riverwoods, Ill. And some relief programs have already been enacted.



But due to their combination of taxes on ordinary income, pensions, real estate, inherited property and estates, the following 10 states can best be described as hostile territory for retirees.

The list was culled with data collected from CCH, the Tax Foundation, state revenue departments, retirementliving.com and the Federation of Tax Administrators. (Property tax rates, compiled by the Tax Foundation using Census Bureau data, are through calendar year 2011 and reflect the mean property tax as a percentage of mean home value.)

And because tax laws impact retirees differently, depending on their financial circumstances, we did not attempt to rank each state in terms of tax friendliness—or lack thereof. The states are instead presented in alphabetical order.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/08/29/Syria-conflict:-The-hardware-the-military-will-use-to-strike.html","Syria conflict: The hardware the military will use to strike","With the looming threat of a military intervention in Syria, investors are focusing more intensely on defense related stocks. Given the expectations of a quick, tactical strike, the most attention is being paid to those companies who specialize in longer-range weapons and ordnance, like the cruise missile.

Cruise missiles have been used by the U.S. military in every major campaign going back to Operation Desert Storm in 1991. One name has become synonymous with the weapon: Raytheon's Tomahawk.

U.S. Navy documents suggest that each Tomahawk would cost about $1.6 million. (The Navy orders about 196 of the missiles a year).

Raytheon shares have performed well so far in 2013, having gained nearly 30%. That handily beats the 15% return of the S&P 500 during that same time span. That strong move to the upside is one of the big reasons why earlier this week, analysts at Stifel Nicolaus downgraded the stock to ""hold"" on valuation.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch Analyst Ron Epstein said this week that Raytheon was particularly sensitive to Syria headlines — even though the Tomahawk only accounts of 1% of its total sales,investors may play near-term thematic trades given the ongoing situation.

The run-up in valuation isn't unique to Raytheon, though. Other companies in the industry have also performed well. General Dynamics has narrowly outperformed the broader S&P 500, up 16%. Their Electric Boat unit makes a variety of attack submarines.

Then, there's United Technologies, whose Sikorsky Aircraft unit makes Blackhawk helicopters. Those shares have risen by 19% this year. Shares of Boeing and Lockheed Martin are both up over 30% during that same time frame.

The question then becomes whether many of these stocks have already had their near term upside priced in, or if there could be more upside momentum depending on the catalyst.

Japan's lost decade served as the breeding ground for the development of ""the mother of all carry trades"" in the yen.



These trades are seen as ""no-brainers"": borrow money in a currency where interest rates are low and invest the money in a currency or a country where interest rates are higher.

But when these currency flows unwind they can create some spectacular blow-ups and investment losses, such as the collapse of the U.S. hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/04/i-can-keep-my-health-care-plan-not-truecommentary.html","I can keep my health-care plan? Not true!","And yet the White House web page still states in the first paragraph: ""For those Americans who already have health insurance, the only changes you will see under the law are new benefits, better protections from insurance-company abuses, and more value for every dollar you spend on health care. If you like your plan you can keep it and you don't have to change a thing due to the health-care law."" That is NOT TRUE! The Oct. 13 Detroit Free Press front page said Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan sent 140,000 cancellations like mine. Other insurers and states are as well. Millions of Americans are losing their health insurance.



When I spoke to Blue Cross Blue Shield and used their website, I discovered no plan gives me coverage that's as good. And they are almost double the cost or more. Blue Cross Blue Shield has wanted to drop my current plan as not profitable, but the State of Michigan forced them to keep it. Now the ACA just gave them the way to drop it. None of their new plans have no deductible. The lowest maximum annual deductible/copay cost is $5,100 vs my $1,000. They cost $575 and above. Blue Cross Blue Shield will now make double the money on me and probably the other 140,000 Michiganders who are losing their plans. The ACA is a gift to insurers and their lobbyists who helped write the ACA.



So my monthly premium will go up over $250, or $3,000 annually, and my maximum annual deductible/copay cost will go up over $4,000. I could be paying up to $7,000 more per year.



(Read more: Your insurance is canceled because of Obamacare—Now what?)



I did try to see the details on plans on the Healthcare.gov website the first week of October and found there was no way to do that without creating an account, applying, and getting a response. I note that in mid-October, after media complaints, the site has added a button ""SEE PLANS NOW,"" but this is worthless as it only gives the plan name, color and premium amount. It does not give any details such as the most important deductible and co-pay amounts. There is no way to compare plans.



I tried the Healthcare.gov site again the second week of October and was able to set up an account. But when I tried to apply, it would not take my income numbers. So I called the 800 phone number and was told they would escalate my request and someone would call me back in 48 hours. Four-and-a-half days later I did get that callback. The lady said I would not be able to apply on their website, but she would be able to do it. I gave her my data over the phone and she said my application was accepted, but there was no response from the system. She said I would get an emailed reply, but if that did not happen by the first week of November to call back.

I did receive an email stating that I had messages and to log in to Healthcare.gov. When I do that no message notice appears, and the site wants me to start the over. I called the 800 number on Nov. 2. They said that since no message notice appeared they would escalate the request and have someone call me back within 48 hours. (They should say business-day hours as they do not count the weekend.) I expect that call on Tuesday.

(Read more: White House knew millions would have their policies canceled)



I expect to be eligible for a subsidy. I hope to be able to see all of the plans available to me in Michigan, either through Healthcare.gov or outside of it. I do not know how to see what non-Healthcare.gov plans are open to me. I want to do a cost/benefit analysis of all plans. My gut tells me that with a subsidy, my premium cost may be slightly less than my current one, and if I do not have any medical issues I will save a little. But if I have issues, the deductible and co-pays will quickly cost me thousands of dollars. I will go on Medicare in September 2015, so I hope my health holds until then.

The Healthcare.gov website debacle is well known. Eventually that will be fixed. Perhaps not in time for those whose plans end to enroll by the Dec. 15 deadline. But the ACA has more problems than that: Increased costs and less coverage for us responsible Americans already buying our own insurance. It seems possible that not enough healthy people will enroll and the ACA may collapse as insurers raise premiums to stay in business. I wish this could be rewritten, but given the extreme political polarization, that will not happen. It's sad that this poor rollout and supporters refusal to admit that good policies are being canceled will probably eliminate any possibility of going to the preferred single-payer system.



If I had a message for the president, it would be:

Mr. President,

Why can't I keep my current good plan I've had for over 10 years without a subsidy?

A number of provisions of the Affordable Care Act, many of which have already gone into effect, are directly aimed at reducing the growth of health-care spending, which accounts for nearly one-fifth of the overall U.S. economy.

However, even as it tries to hold down the inflation rate of health care, the ACA will cost the federal government an estimated $1.36 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

One of the ACA's cost-cutting tools is financially penalizing hospitals by reducing government Medicare reimbursements to them if they have an excess number of patients who are released from the hospital and then readmitted within a month for heart attacks, heart failure and and pneumonia.

Another is requiring health insurers who spend less than 80 percent of the premiums they receive from customers on health benefits for them to reimburse some money to those customers. Insurers of large companies have to spend at least 85 percent of the premiums they receive on benefits or pay refunds.

(Read more: Medicare and Medicaid: CNBC Explains)



In 2018, there will be a 40 percent excise tax slapped on health insurance plans whose premiums exceed $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. This tax on so-called Cadillac plans is designed to tamp down overuse of medical care by people with those plans.

The law also encourages hospitals, primary care physicians and other medical providers to join forces in so-called Accountable Care Organizations, whose goal is to coordinate care for their patients and, if they meet certain quality targets such as keeping those people healthy and out of the hospital, get paid more by Medicare.

Obamacare also created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is empowered to recommend reductions in Medicare spending, in years in which Medicare per capita costs exceed specific targets including overall medical prices. Those reductions will take effect unless Congress comes up with another reduction that saves the same amount.

Obamacare's provision that insurers' policies cover things such as preventative care for customers is also geared to reducing overall long-term costs. The theory is that people who can obtain preventative care, and actually do with, will be less likely to suffer chronic health conditions that could end up costing much more.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/07/obama-personally-apologizes-for-americans-losing-health-coverage.html","Obama personally apologizes for Americans losing health coverage","Obama's comments come 10 days after NBC News' Lisa Myers reported that the administration has known since the summer of 2010 that millions of Americans could lose their insurance under the law. Obama has made repeated assurances that ""if you like your health plan, you will be able to keep your health plan"" with Obamacare.

Consumers who buy insurance on their own — about 5 percent of the population — are at risk of being forced off their current policies because their plans have changed and don't meet the new standards of the Affordable Care Act.

Obama's statement has been called into question as millions of Americans have gotten cancellation notices, effectively forcing them to enroll in a new plan either with their current insurer or through the government exchanges, in many cases at a higher rate.

Guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services dating back to July 2010 estimated that ""40 to 67 percent"" of the 14 million consumers in that marketplace could lose their policies due to turnover in the individual insurance market, NBC found. That part of the law does not impact the 80 percent of Americans who receive their health insurance through employers or through Medicare or Medicaid.

After the initial NBC News report, the administration insisted that the president did not mislead Americans, arguing that the law could not have accounted for insurers altering existing plans after passage of the law.

Yet earlier this week, Obama tweaked his promise, acknowledging that plans that have been substantially changed since passage of the law would no longer be ""grandfathered"" into acceptance under the ACA.","2013-11-07 17:49:01","0","38.0","24.0","1.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","236.0","284.0","0.0","157.0","33.0","29.0","3","277","94.14","73.02","29.04","31.95","34.62","27.44","82.31","45.85","9.39","4.69","0.00","0.00","1.44","0.36","2.89","4.69","7.94","16.25","7.58","1.08","2.89","1.81","13.72","4.33","3.25","0.72","4.33","2.53","3.97","2.17","1.81","0.36","0.72","0.72","9.39","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.72","10.83","2.89","3.25","1.81","1.81","0.72","2.89","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.17","0.00","2.17","0.00","0.00","10.83","0.72","3.25","5.78","0.72","1.08","3.97","7.94","2.53","14.08","1.44","5.78","7.58","7.58","0.00","0.00","4.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.47","2.89","2.89","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.17","1.44","0.72","0.00","1382","9.05","35.0","416","279","8","44.51","15.4","15.7","12.95","20.1","65","16.666666666666668","25.27899641577061","166","30.38","4","0.44","0","6","10","24","0","49","13","1","0","5","42","26","5","17","0","0","3","10","9","2","0","1","5","0","12","6","7","12","7","5","1","2","0","0"
"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/30/ticktock-obamacare-deadlines-you-need-to-know.html","Ticktock: Obamacare deadlines you need to know","The Affordable Care Act is supposed to help give millions of Americans options for affordable, comprehensive health insurance—but it will be up to those people to take advantage of those options.

The ACA, popularly known as Obamacare, has a number of deadlines that individuals and employers need to keep in mind for years to come to avoid missing out on the insurance options available to them or being financially penalized for failing to comply with the health-care reform law.



Obamacare requires nearly all Americans to have some form of health insurance—either from their employer, Medicare, Medicaid or individually purchased coverage—by 2014 or face a tax penalty, which will grow in amount in future years. Government-run health exchanges, or marketplaces, are being set up in each state to offer insurance coverage to people who lack health insurance or who are looking for more affordable coverage than what they have now.



The first big date in 2013 is Oct. 1, when the health exchanges open for business, and individuals can start comparing premium prices for the insurance plans being offered. The options on state exchanges can be found by going to www.healthcare.gov, which is also where you can learn whether your income qualifies you for government subsidies to offset the cost of insurance.

Oct. 1 is also the start of a six-month open enrollment on the exchanges, the period when people can choose the insurance plan they want and get covered for 2014.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/07/s-tapped-out-as-holidays-approach.html","US consumers tapped out as holidays approach","American shoppers have a way of rallying when the holidays roll around. But years after the Great Recession, consumers' budgets remain badly squeezed by flat wages, higher payroll taxes and a weak job market.

""It's been a tough year for consumers overall,"" said Target Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan. ""They started the year with the payroll tax increase, and lower and middle-income consumers bore the brunt of that. They were already stressed. The economy has improved slowly over time, but it's been a choppy recovery for sure.""

Choppy indeed. With the economy growing at just 2.2 percent since the recession ended in June 2009, there aren't enough good-paying jobs for the millions of Americans out of work or looking for more hours.

Much of the growth in new jobs is in relatively low-wage, low-skilled industries such as retailing and restaurants. Even with the growth in those sectors, there aren't enough jobs to go around—and won't be until overall growth picks up.

""The improvement in the employment and improvement in labor markets has been slower than I'd like to see,"" said Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. ""We need to see growth much closer to 3 percent than 2 percent if we want to get to full employment in a reasonable time period.""

(Read more: US consumer sentiment unexpectedly falls in November)

Though the latest read on GDP showed the economy expanding by 2.8 percent in the third quarter, that isn't likely to cheer up Fed officials much. Too much of the growth came from a build-up in inventories—goods sitting in warehouses and on store shelves that consumers aren't buying.

Final sales rose just 2.0 percent, and overall spending inched up just 1.5 percent, the smallest gain in two years, according to Band of America Merrill Lynch economists Ethan Harris and Joshua Dennerlein.

""In other words, the economy remains stuck in the mud,"" they wrote in a research note Thursday.

American households apparently caught a break in September,based on the latest reports on jobs and income. The government reported that 204,000 new jobs were created in September—and personal income rose by 0.5 percent, after similar gains in August.

But the extra income didn't free up consumers wallets.The data also showed that—adjusted for inflation—consumer spending inched up just 0.1 percent in September after rising 0.2 percent in August.

While housing prices have slowly recovered in many parts of the country, mortgage applications remain sluggish, especially for younger first-time home buyers. That weakness spills over into sales of a number of related categories of goods and services—from new appliances to homeowners insurance.



Other industries feeling profit pressure are tightening payrolls. That includes the health-care sector, which produced a steady stream of new jobs even through the depths of the Great Recession.","2013-11-08 06:00:00","0","42.0","23.0","1.0","0.0","8.0","0.0","252.0","287.0","27.0","173.0","23.0","29.0","3","483","97.41","42.60","83.80","40.68","21.00","25.26","86.75","40.99","4.14","1.45","0.21","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.62","2.69","7.87","17.81","4.35","4.14","4.97","1.24","10.97","7.04","4.35","0.41","3.52","3.73","4.97","2.69","1.86","0.41","0.00","0.62","2.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.25","0.83","1.24","0.62","1.45","0.62","3.31","1.86","1.04","0.41","0.41","1.04","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.62","8.07","0.62","2.28","4.14","1.45","0.00","4.14","4.76","0.21","23.19","3.31","12.22","8.07","12.84","0.83","0.83","9.73","0.00","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.00","16.15","4.97","4.35","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.45","2.07","2.07","0.83","0.00","2351","8.37","21.695652173913043","697","467","30","64.1","11.2","8.2","13.11","11.3","117","4.625","18.261413276231263","289","20.0","4","0.39","0","16","20","39","0","75","38","5","3","0","84","38","1","50","0","0","8","0","28","3","0","5","9","0","6","21","10","11","14","9","4","0","0","1"

The rich were getting richer, the poor poorer and the unemployment numbers were stagnant.

Even though the country had added 2 million jobs, many states, especially in the South, continued to suffer. Mississippi's median household income, which is the amount of money earned by the household that falls exactly in the middle of the pack of all the other households, was nearly half that of the richest.

Childhood poverty is a big problem for states that are among the poorest. Many have a child poverty rate around 25 percent.

Even more grim is that in 2012, 46.5 million U.S. citizens lived below the poverty line, slightly more than in 2011. That's 15 percent of the country.

Although its median household income was in the top 10 of the country last year and its percentage of residents living in poverty was the 12th lowest, Moody's Analytics recently published a report that Delaware is the only state in the country still at risk of falling into an economic recession.

Moody's Analytics associate economist Brent Campbell told Reuters the tiny state ""just lagged behind the rest of the U.S. It's not necessarily performing poorly.""

The state's unemployment rate is in line with the national average and its size can both be a help and a hindrance to its financial success, another Moody's analyst said.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/17/the-most-overrated-jobs-of-2013.html","The most overrated jobs of 2013","TV and film characters like Don Draper from ""Mad Men"" and Gordon Gekko from ""Wall Street"" may have you thinking that their professions are enviably glitzy, but the truth is, they're not all that glamorous.

Job site CareerCast is out with its annual lists of the most overrated and most underrated jobs and with apologies to Messrs. Draper and Gekko, they're both overrated.



""It's all about perception. It's the perception that it's a great job,"" said Tony Lee, publisher of CareerCast. ""Every one of these overrated jobs, people think of as, 'I've got huge autonomy. I'm in control of my day and I manage everything the way I want to manage it,'"" Lee said.



""The reality is that either due to a poor hiring outlook, falling salary, rising stress or a number of other criteria, it's not as great as it appears,"" he said.



Stress, in particular, is among the biggest factors that land a job on the overrated list. You may think being a CEO is a glamorous world of corner offices and private jets, but in fact, it's a lot of stress. It's overrated.



Lee said these lists are among the most subjective that CareerCast puts together, compared to some of their other lists like the best and worst jobs. Still, the economy has played a huge role in jobs on both the overrated and underrated lists.



When it comes to the impact of the economy on overrated jobs, perhaps some of them lost perks like expensive client lunches, experienced a shift in the type of work they were getting, or have not yet seen their hiring outlook bounce back even though the economy is improving.



To come up with these lists, CareerCast takes a look at 200 jobs, using Labor Department and other statistics. On average, Lee said, hiring in those jobs are expected to increase by about 12 percent during this decade. What's particularly encouraging, he said, is that CareerCast has found more job openings for each one of the occupations on the list than in at least the last five years.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/30/us-regulators-reject-sanofis-ms-treatment-lemtrada.html","US regulators reject Sanofi's MS treatment Lemtrada","The FDA ruling could impact the value of Sanofi's Genzyme takeover, since the latter's shareholders had received so-called contingent value rights (CVRs) entitling them to future payments of up to $14 a share if certain goals were met.

Sanofi said on Monday it did not expect to meet the CVR milestone of U.S. approval for Lemtrada by the end of March. Other milestones are related to the drug's sales and would likely be hard to reach without the U.S. market.

Analysts on average had expected Lemtrada to generate annual sales of $707 million by 2018, according to forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters.

""Genzyme's takeover was about catching up in biologics, having a greater footprint in the United States, and also largely for Lemtrada,'' said Eric Le Berrigaud, analyst at Bryan Garnier & Co. ""This is unquestionably a setback, as without a U.S. market such a product doesn't have the same potential.''

Costly Process

The brokerage, which had forecast peak Lemtrada sales of $400 million in the United States, said it was scrapping the U.S. market from its forecasts. It argued it would take Sanofi at least three years to conduct the studies demanded by the FDA, and that, given an increasingly crowded market for MS drugs, it could opt out of what could be a lengthy and costly process.

But Renaud Murail, a fund manager at Barclays Bourse, said Monday's development was no big surprise for investors who had already factored in the risk of U.S. rejection. ""Genzyme remains Sanofi's gem and this is only a half-defeat,'' he said.

A Sanofi spokesman said it was reviewing the FDA letter and evaluating its next steps, including the appeal timeline.

Genzyme chief David Meeker said: ""We strongly believe that the clinical development program, which was designed to demonstrate how Lemtrada compares against an active comparator as opposed to placebo, provides robust evidence of efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile.''

The CVRs, which fell 7.6 percent to 82 cents on Friday, had slumped as low as 46 cents in November following a review by an advisory panel to the FDA which raised questions over the design of the clinical trial and Lemtrada's potential to cause cancer and other serious conditions.

A U.S. law firm acting on behalf of purchasers of the CVRs has launched a class action alleging Sanofi misled investors over Lemtrada's efficacy, safety and prospects.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, autoimmune condition which affects more than 2 million people worldwide and up to 500,000 in the U.S. It attacks the central nervous system and can cause muscle weakness, pain and cognitive difficulties.

Lemtrada is given via an intravenous drip and designed to reprogramme the immune system, but can make the body more vulnerable to other diseases. The multiple sclerosis market is increasingly moving away from injectable treatments in favour of pills such as Novartis' Gilenya and Biogen Idec's Tecfidera.

Some analysts expect Lemtrada, partly handicapped by its risk profile and injectable form, will be reserved for patients for whom other treatments are ineffective.

Sanofi also has an oral treatment, Aubagio, developed by Genzyme and which has already been approved in the U.S and Europe. Analysts on average expect Aubagio sales to reach $854 million by 2018, according to Thomson Reuters data.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/19/was-jack-welch-right-jobs-numbers-under-fire.html","Was Jack Welch right? Jobs numbers under fire","Whether that will happen is unclear, though the Department of Commerce's Inspector General's Office issued a statement to CNBC saying, ""We are aware of the media reports and our office is evaluating what actions may be warranted.""



For its part, the Census Bureau said it does not believe there has been any ""systematic"" manipulation of data, stressing its vigorous process of double-checking to make sure the information it provides is correct.

That monitoring process includes re-interviewing respondents, and rechecking the data an employee has submitted, looking for red flags that indicate possible fabrication, such as abnormally short lengths of interviews or higher survey completion rates that are out of sync with normal survey collection productivity levels,"" the bureau said in a statement. ""That is why when we learned of the allegations of fabricated Current Population survey results, we immediately reported them to the Office of the Inspector General.""

Should the controversy go full-blown, it could shake the government's data-gathering operations at their foundation.

""The problem is the financial markets are already pretty cynical. If there is any case in which this is proven that the data were not done in a satisfactory, compliant way, then markets are going to have more reason not to believe the figures,"" said Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. ""When they move in any direction that is counter to expectations, it will be one of those see-I-told-you-so moments.""

The jobless count in particular has come under scrutiny in part because the unemployment rate has been declining primarily through a reduction in the labor force.

In the September 2010 count, the participation rate held steady, but there were other startling numbers that quickly generated skepticism.

Total employment for the month soared by 873,000 after being essentially flat the previous three months. Job losers decreased by 468,000, and short-term unemployment fell by 302,000. Finally, those working part-time for economic reasons surged from 8 million to 8.6 million.

""We didn't think the numbers were accurate, but not for the reasons the (Post) article suggested,"" LaVorgna said.

(Read more: US labor costs point to still-benign inflation)

The controversy likely will feed the fire over how much investors should rely on the data.

In addition to the jobless count, critics often wonder why the government strips out gas and grocery prices when it announces the so-called core Consumer Price Index, and retail sales numbers have long been the target of questioning as well.

Economist Michael Pento said the controversy is a reminder that investors should not judge economic conditions through a single month's numbers.

""You have to look for long-term trends in the data,"" said Pento, head of Pento Portfolio Strategies. ""The (employment-to-population ratio) and labor force participation rate both popped in 2008 and have never recovered. That tells me the labor force is anemic.""

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/08/26/Least-tax-friendly-states-for-retirees.html","Least tax-friendly states for retirees","Forget what you know about withdrawal rates. The key to making your nest egg last is to spend less money than you earn.



Due to state tax law differences, however, you'll soon learn that where you live during retirement largely dictates what you spend.

Some states, such as Minnesota and Vermont, impose a hefty tax on retirement income, while California's top income tax rate is a budget busting 13.3 percent. Others, including New Jersey, have the highest property tax rate in the nation, while 14 states tax Social Security benefits either in part or in full. They are: Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia. (Not all, though, made our list of least tax friendly states for retirees.)

Also, the sheer size of the aging baby boomer population has encouraged most states to consider more tax-favorable legislation for seniors, said Kathleen Thies, state tax analyst for CCH tax services firm in Riverwoods, Ill. And some relief programs have already been enacted.



But due to their combination of taxes on ordinary income, pensions, real estate, inherited property and estates, the following 10 states can best be described as hostile territory for retirees.

The list was culled with data collected from CCH, the Tax Foundation, state revenue departments, retirementliving.com and the Federation of Tax Administrators. (Property tax rates, compiled by the Tax Foundation using Census Bureau data, are through calendar year 2011 and reflect the mean property tax as a percentage of mean home value.)

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/09/25/nokia-chairman-admits-mistake-over-25-million-elop-payoff.html","Nokia chairman admits mistake over $25 million Elop payoff","Nokia's chairman has admitted that he gave misleading information about the 18.8 million euro ($25.4 million) payoff to former chief executive Stephen Elop, as the Finnish mobile firm faces increasing pressure over the saga.

Risto Siilasmaa, chairman of Nokia, had originally said that Elop's deal was ""substantially similar"" to previous CEOs, in an attempt to calm the growing furore in Finland against the company.

But the chairman told Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, that an ""accident"" meant that he had said Elop's contract was the same as his predecessor. The Canadian will bag 14.6 million euros more through stock awards than his predecessor Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.

The admission caused further embarrassment for Nokia, after the Finnish prime minister, Jyrki Katainen, called Elop's payoff ""outrageous"" on Saturday in an interview with Finland television station Yle TV 1.

Elop's payout was triggered by Microsoft's 5.44 billion euro buyout of Nokia's mobile phone business.

The difference in payouts between Elop and Kallasvuo is laid out in documents to U.S. regulators. In Nokia's 2009 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the group said Kallasvuo was entitled to 18 months of compensation in salary and bonuses in case of a change of control. No promise of stock awards is noted.

But the 2012 SEC filing set out different terms for Elop. In the event of a change of control, the former Nokia boss could resign and be awarded 18 months of compensation and ""his unvested equity will vest in an accelerated manner"", resulting in 14.6 million euros more through stock awards than Kallasvuo.

Elop joined Nokia in September 2010 from Microsoft and was given a $6 million signing-on bonus on top of his $1.4 million salary.

Nokia said on Sunday that it amended Elop's contract at the same time it struck the Microsoft deal to ease restrictions on him working for a competitor. That would allow the former CEO to move back to Microsoft. The Bill Gates-owned company is paying 70 percent of the payoff.

Elop is set to return to his former employer when Microsoft completes the acquisition of Nokia's devices business.","2013-09-25 05:40:15","0","18.0","16.0","1.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","240.0","285.0","0.0","131.0","12.0","27.0","3","374","98.64","63.60","10.18","50.74","22.00","27.01","71.66","38.24","4.28","2.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.14","0.00","2.14","8.02","17.11","5.35","1.34","3.21","0.27","10.16","6.15","5.61","0.27","5.61","1.87","4.01","2.67","1.34","0.53","0.53","0.27","5.88","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.14","6.15","0.80","2.41","0.53","0.00","0.53","1.87","1.34","0.00","1.34","0.00","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.29","0.53","2.94","5.08","1.87","0.27","6.42","2.94","0.53","13.37","1.34","7.75","4.55","9.09","0.53","0.27","5.88","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.11","4.81","2.94","0.53","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.80","2.14","2.67","2.14","0.80","1841","7.97","23.0","546","371","23","63.59","11.4","8.4","12.64","11.2","83","6.428571428571429","17.388787061994613","207","21.29","6","0.4","0","9","27","31","0","56","24","0","0","4","66","62","1","17","0","0","5","5","4","4","0","3","11","0","10","23","7","10","2","8","1","0","0","1"
"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/12/obamacare-high-risk-pool-extended-a-month.html","Obamacare medicine: Officials urge breaks for enrollees","Scrambling to get as many people as possible health coverage by Jan. 1 despite Obamacare's botched roll-out, the Obama administration ordered insurers to give customers a slight break on bill payments, and ""strongly"" suggested a series of other breaks Thursday.

And administration officials also warned they may again extend the Dec. 23 deadline for enrolling in Obamacare insurance plans for the start of the new year should ""exceptional circumstances pose barriers to customers enrolling by that date"" via HealthCare.gov and other government-run health exchanges. Those exchanges have seen drastically fewer numbers of people sign up for health plans than originally projected.

""We are providing additional flexibility to consumers across the country to ensure they have access to coverage options that begin on Jan. 1, 2014,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, as she announced the latest series of measures.

Sebelius urged insurers to begin covering enrollees by Jan. 1, even if those people make their first premiums payment later in January. Aetna has already said it will allow Obamacare plan enrollees until Jan. 8 to make their first premium payments for plans beginning Jan. 1.



She also announced that HHS is now requiring that insurers accept payments as late as Dec. 31 for selected Obamacare plans that will begin Jan. 1, instead of leaving that payment deadline up to the insurers.

And she strongly urged insurers to accept partial premium payments for coverage that begins that day.



She also is now also urging insurers to cover people by Jan. 1 even if they select plans after the current Dec. 23 deadline set by HHS. That would include allowing people to have coverage retroactively effective Jan. 1 even if they actually sign up later in the month, which would let people who are eligible for tax subsidies to offset their insurance purchases apply them for that month.



And HHS is allowing a ""special enrollment period"" that will give people who had problems with the federal and state-run Obamacare exchanges more time than they would have had to sign up and get coverage by Jan. 1.



Those problems could include so-called 834 file errors, which affect the electronic transmission of enrollment forms to insurers from the exchanges—errors that could lead to delays in formal enrollments. Up to one in four of the 365,000 enrollments as of Nov. 30 had such errors, and the error rate this month still may be as high as one in 10.

In a series of suggestions designed to let consumers maintain existing relationships with doctors and continue drug treatments in January, the first month of their new coverage, HHS repeatedly said in a news release that is was ""strongly encouraging"" insurers to grant three specific requests.

Those included urging insurers to pay out benefits for use of ""out-of-network"" health providers by their customers to the same degree they do for those who use ""in-network providers"" in the case of emergencies. And Sebelius asked insurers to treat providers who drop out of their plan's network sometime during the open enrollment period as if they were still in the network, for the purpose of covering customers' benefits.

(Read more: Obamacare enrollment far shy of government goals)



She likewise ""strongly"" encouraged insurers to refill prescriptions in January that have been covered by their enrollees' prior insurance plans.

Finally, HHS will allow nearly 86,000 people who currently are in a federally run high-risk insurance pool a one-month extension to stay in that pool until Jan. 31 so they have more time to obtain replacement coverage through the Obamacare exchanges.

The insurance industry -- which in recent weeks has been repeatedly asked by the administration to help it mitigate the messes created by HealthCare.gov -- seemed ready to help out yet again, but not happy about it.

Karen Ignagni, president and CEO of industry lobbying group America's Health Insurance Plans, said, ""Helping consumers obtain the secure, affordable coverage they need is health plans' top priority. With only weeks to go before coverage begins, continued changes to the rules and guidance could exacerbate the challenges associated with helping consumers through the enrollment process. Health plans will continue to do everything they can to protect consumers from potential coverage disruptions caused by the ongoing technical problems with Healthcare.gov.""

Sebelius' department has been reeling from the troubled launch of HealthCare.gov, which was revealed to have scores of software-related problems after its Oct. 1 launch. Those problems crippled enrollment in the first month of operation, and lead her weeks later to extend the Dec. 15 deadline for enrolling in coverage beginning Jan. 1 to Dec. 23.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/12/swarms-of-layaway-santas-expected-as-payments-come-due.html","Swarms of 'Layaway Santas' expected as payments come due","Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus, and he's just paid off your layaway bill.

So-called Layaway Santas aren't new, but they have been growing ever since an Associated Press story pointed out the phenomenon in 2011. Despite the sluggish economy, or perhaps because of it, more people than ever seem to be driven to be some struggling family's Little Saint Nick.

Wal-Mart said it has tracked more than 1,000 instances so far this season of strangers paying down others' layaway accounts. Kmart said strangers have paid more than $1.5 million in other's layaway contracts over the years. Toys R Us said it recorded 794 layaway Santa visits in 2012, matching each one with a $200 donation to Toys for Tots, for a total of $158,800. For this year, it's pledged to donate up to $1 million.

For Dave Wilson, 65, who went from living on a poor farm in Iowa to owning 17 car dealerships in Orange County, Calif., it's a way to give back.

Every December, he gives his aptly named wife, Holly, a Kmart receipt for her birthday. On it are listed hundreds of transactions, all the layaway account balances he's paid off at his local store. ""She said it was the best birthday present ever,"" he said. In 2011, it was 260 accounts to the tune of nearly $16,000. In 2012, it was more than 320 accounts and $18,000. This year he plans for a repeat.

(Slideshow: Holiday gifts for procrastinators)

""It's not passing out Christmas hams or turkeys,"" said Wilson. ""They have to pay at least 10 percent ... this is something people have thought about and made an investment in.""

Here's how it works.

Under layaway, customers purchase items, but the store holds on to the physical merchandise as they pay it off in bits over a few weeks. For those with uncertain cash flows and limited access to credit, it's a structured way to save up for the holidays. But even this system can be a stretch too far to make those final payments, coming due at many stores at the end of this week.

""I felt that it was important to announce my intentions now because of the prospect that some lenders could start to price the announced changes into the market well before the effective dates of the changes outlined in the FHFA's December 9, 2013 News Release,"" Watt wrote in the email sent from his personal account.","2013-12-23 13:30:51","1","29.0","25.0","1.0","0.0","8.0","0.0","242.0","280.0","0.0","171.0","35.0","29.0","3","156","98.02","62.57","34.38","49.64","31.20","25.00","76.28","42.31","7.05","3.21","1.28","0.00","0.00","1.92","0.00","3.85","10.90","14.74","4.49","1.92","3.21","0.64","10.90","4.49","2.56","0.64","1.28","0.64","1.92","1.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.92","10.26","1.92","5.13","1.28","0.64","0.64","1.28","1.92","0.00","0.64","1.28","0.64","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.56","0.00","0.00","2.56","0.00","0.00","5.77","3.85","1.28","17.31","3.85","5.13","8.33","5.13","0.64","2.56","7.05","0.00","0.00","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.64","0.00","12.82","4.49","4.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.28","1.28","1.28","0.00","0.00","707","8.86","39.5","210","151","6","62.82","11.2","10.8","11.15","14.0","38","6.833333333333333","22.146225165562914","116","34.75","6","0.42","0","3","2","18","0","19","9","0","2","3","19","25","0","11","0","0","4","2","7","0","0","1","6","0","6","6","2","7","1","2","2","1","0","0"
"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/10/09/sporting-rivals-adidas-originals-puma-herzogenaurach.html","Sporting rivals: the town divided by Adidas and Puma","In the town of Herzogenaurach in Bavaria, two huge sporting businesses lie just off the main Zum Flughafen road, a mere 20-minute walk apart.

The address of one of the headquarters - as well as the brand's name - offers a clue as to why the two sportswear behemoths are based so closely in a quiet town near Nuremberg, and why their rivalry was so potent for 60 years.



Adidas group's main base lies on Adi-Dassler-Straße. It's named after Adolf ""Adi"" Dassler, who created Adidas in 1948 after he split with his business partner and brother, Rudolf Dassler – who went on to form Puma.



In an interview with CNBC Meets, former Puma CEO Jochen Zeitz said he was not sure why there was such hatred between the two brothers, although there were rumours it had to do with a woman, or the brothers' wartime records.

""Who knows?"" said Zeitz. ""It ultimately ended in the two never speaking again in their lives.""

Brotherly love gave way to a seething sibling rivalry that was absorbed by the town for several decades.

Barbara Smit's book on Adidas and Puma, Pitch Invasion, described how Herzogenaurach became known as ""the town of bent necks"" due to residents always looking down at a person's shoes before deciding whether to talk to them.

Zeitz said the divide in the town was almost like East and West Berlin. ""When I started at Puma, you had a restaurant that was a Puma restaurant, an Adidas restaurant, a bakery,"" he said. ""The town was literally divided. If you were working for the wrong company you wouldn't be served any food, you couldn't buy anything. So it was kind of an odd experience.""

Herzogenaurach's mayor, Dr.German Hacker, told CNBC: ""I was a member of a Puma family because of my aunt. I was one of the children who wore all Puma clothes. It was a joke in our youth: you wear Adidas, I have Puma. I'm a member of a Puma family.""



While anecdotes like those from Hacker and Zeitz indicate the tense atmosphere within the town for a number of years, Hacker does point out the importance of the two companies to the fabric of the town.","2013-10-09 07:46:35","1","50.0","32.0","1.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","243.0","284.0","27.0","163.0","36.0","29.0","3","375","92.03","83.15","28.54","35.06","18.75","18.40","79.47","48.53","8.53","5.07","1.60","0.27","1.33","1.07","0.80","3.47","10.67","15.20","6.40","5.07","5.60","1.07","13.33","2.93","2.93","2.93","2.67","1.33","2.67","1.60","1.07","0.27","0.53","0.00","12.53","2.13","0.27","0.53","2.13","8.53","1.33","2.13","1.07","1.87","1.07","1.87","2.13","0.27","1.60","0.00","3.20","1.33","0.27","0.00","1.33","6.13","3.73","0.80","1.33","0.00","0.27","8.00","3.47","0.00","14.93","0.53","9.87","4.53","2.40","2.40","1.33","0.80","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","19.73","5.33","5.07","0.80","0.00","0.27","0.00","1.33","3.73","2.67","0.53","0.00","1636","7.23","19.3","498","374","19","76.86","10.1","7.4","9.81","10.4","62","12.25","16.51101604278075","222","17.15","8","0.47","0","6","10","43","0","54","17","0","0","0","55","53","0","17","0","0","20","5","17","1","0","2","8","0","5","32","7","8","10","4","2","3","0","5"

The Mad Money host is convinced that if lawmakers embraced the oil and gas discoveries, the resulting boom would create a myriad of jobs and buoy more than a few local economies.



""Pipelines punch above their weight when it comes to job creation,"" Cramer insisted.



In fact, he believes the oil and nat gas deposits are so vast they could make North America energy independent and therefore free our nation from the political turmoil in the Middle East.



And he firmly believes the energy can be obtained safely and that an emphasis on domestic nat gas would also improve the environment. ""The skies would be cleaner,"" he said.



However, lawmakers just don't get it, Cramer insisted.



""This squandered opportunity is painful even as objection after objection has been met,"" said the disgusted Mad Money host.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2013/0418/Why-the-90-percent-lost-on-gun-background-checks","Why the 90 percent lost on gun background checks","The Senate defeated background checks for gun sales, despite 90 percent of Americans favoring broader checks. The simplest explanation for this is Senate procedures, but NRA intensity counts for a lot. The way ahead for gun control groups is to match the NRA email for email.

President Obama puts his arm around former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., before he speaks in the Rose Garden at the White House April 17, 2013, about measures to reduce gun violence, including the Senate defeat of broader background checks. Oped contributor John J. Pitney Jr. writes: 'The National Rifle Association wins so many battles because of its zeal, its persistence, and its organization.'

In the wake of the Sandy Hook shootings, polls have shown overwhelming public support for expanding background checks on gun sales, with one poll showing 9 out of 10 Americans backing the idea. Yet on Wednesday, a bill to do just that went down to defeat in the Senate. As President Obama pointed out, “The American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen.”

The simplest explanation for this disconnect is that Senate procedures enable minorities to thwart majorities. The legislation on background checks had the support of 54 of the 100 senators, but it takes 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.

The Senate rulebook was not the only obstacle. For several reasons, there has often been a chasm between what the people say they want and what their legislators actually do.

First, no member of Congress represents the whole country. The lawmakers answer to specific geographical constituencies, many of which may diverge from national opinion. That’s the case with gun control proposals, which often score well in surveys of the whole country while triggering strong resistance in the South and Mountain West. These regions include states with relatively small populations, which enjoy outsized influence in the Senate. Though Wyoming has less than 2 percent as many people as California, it has the same number of senators.

Second, issue polls typically include nonvoters as well as voters. But in the eyes of politicians, nonvoters are nonpersons. Elected officials focus on the people who actually show up to vote, and their sentiments might differ from those who stay home on Election Day.

More specifically, politicians also have to worry about the people who vote in primaries. Republicans and Democrats need to nurture their ideological bases, or else face defeat at the hands of primary opponents. This tendency has become more pronounced in recent years in the House of Representatives, where red districts have gotten redder and blue districts have gotten bluer.

Third, intensity comes into play, as a passionate minority can trump a relatively indifferent majority. The former will remember in November, but the latter won’t. Gun control has usually exhibited this pattern: Second Amendment enthusiasts will always get in touch with their lawmakers and vote on the basis of this one issue, while supporters of more gun regulation may answer “yes” to a survey question and then forget about it.

Advocates hoped that the Newtown shootings would change the dynamic – not only by increasing support for gun control but also by making that support more fervent. But any such effect was bound to fade, though not among those directly affected. In this case, timing worked against gun control. Newtown happened while Congress was focusing on the fiscal cliff. Then came the early months of the 113th Congress, with a relatively light work schedule. Now that the lawmakers have gotten down to business for real, months have passed and passions have cooled.

Fourth, presidents have only a limited ability to drive public opinion and mass political action. Even at the peak of his popularity, President Reagan was able to motivate cards and letters when he was selling something that people already liked (e.g., tax cuts). When he tried to stir Americans on tougher issues (e.g., aid to Nicaraguan rebels), he got nowhere.

Today, presidents work in a much more demanding media environment. Until the 1980s, they could “roadblock” the television networks with an Oval Office address. Now, they have to compete with hundreds of other channels and the Internet. Moreover, their critics and opponents have many more opportunities to respond in real time. Nobody live-blogged FDR’s “Day of Infamy” speech.

Fifth and perhaps most important, James Madison still rules America. The Framers designed a bicameral legislature and the separation of powers specifically to prevent an automatic translation of public opinion into public policy. Supporters of the system say that it fosters deliberation and ensures the protection of minority rights. Critics say that it prevents passage of necessary legislation.

At the moment, political progressives are especially disappointed in the system. They should remember, however, that it has enabled them to block conservative ideas that were popular with the general public. If the polls always prevailed, after all, America would have a balanced-budget amendment and a constitutional ban on flag burning. President Obama has frequently taken credit for making tough decisions that were unpopular at the time, implicitly acknowledging that poll numbers do not always translate into righteousness.

So what can advocates of gun control do now?

Among other things, they need to learn from the other side. The National Rifle Association wins so many battles because of its zeal, its persistence, and its organization. Those who want tougher restrictions on firearms have to stoke the same kind of ardor, matching the NRA letter for letter, email for email, and phone call for phone call.

That’s difficult, except perhaps in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy. But the president’s political group, Organizing for America (OFA), might have the resources and savvy to succeed, helped along by the efforts of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The OFA insists that it is not a purely partisan organization and will pressure Democrats and Republicans alike. We'll see if it follows through.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Family/Modern-Parenthood/2013/0116/Frank-Zamboni-We-hardly-knew-you","Frank Zamboni: We hardly knew you","Frank Zamboni would have been proud of those northern Minnesota kids. Frank Zamboni automated ice rink cleaning for the well-off, but hockey crazed 'Iron Range' kids smoothed their town's rink themselves.

Frank Zamboni made cleaning ice easy for cities and organizations that could afford a Zamboni. But young hockey fans in northern Minnesota had to make and clean our rinks ourselves. Here, a city worker floods a hockey rink in northern Wisconsin.

When growing up in central Minnesota, we didn’t have a Frank Zamboni machine to clear the ice on our hockey rinks. I used to be a Zamboni with a garden hose.

We had to do everything ourselves – flood the rinks, build the sideboards, even create our own goals, which usually took the form of stringing anything we could find, from gill nets to gunny sacks, across a series of artistically welded pipes to corral the puck.

It shouldn’t have been this way. Hockey is to small-town Minnesota what intransigence is to Washington. It’s just part of the culture. Many towns in the region had hockey programs in the schools. That means they had mechanized ways to clean their ice. We didn’t, at least not always.

Town fathers (and at that time they were all fathers) decided that the community didn’t have enough money to support three winter sports. Basketball and wrestling were well enshrined. Hockey was a recreational afterthought – something you could do on your own, including helping maintain the rink.

This was fine with us. For years, we had the only indoor skating facility in the area. It was located in a Works Progress Administration-built arena. At one point, when the town decided to refurbish the hockey rink, my father, a wholesale lumber salesman, helped with the construction of the sideboards. Everyone showed up with their hammers and handsaws. Almost overnight, a dusty oval transformed into a glistening slab on which kids could mimic the moves of Bobby Orr.

The rink in those years was maintained by the town – public works officials used a front-end loader fitted with a rotary brush to clean the ice and a fire hose to flood it.

Eventually, however, recreation succumbed to commerce. A snowmobile manufacturer bought the building and we were kicked outdoors. The town built another rink, on two tennis courts nearby, but it was never as regal. The sideboards were cheap plywood, and cryogenic winds whipped off the lake on most days, mocking even our most stoic attempts to ignore the cold.

The town assigned one man, a ‘Mr. Sears,’ to clean the ice. But he was no match for the elements. The public works department had long ago found other uses for the loader, and the fire hose had turned into a garden hose.

When it snowed, we brought down our shovels and helped him clear the ice, in part because we knew it was the only way we’d get to skate and in part because we couldn’t bear to see his frozen visage anymore – the perpetually dripping nose, the cheeks flirting with frostbite. We’d tell him to go stoke the fire in the warming house. We’d handle the rink.

Flooding the ice was another matter. We’d all watch the weather forecast to figure out when to do it. It wasn’t because it might be too warm. It was because it could be too cold. Every winter, the temperature would drop to 40 degrees below zero for several weeks. When you pour on water at that temperature, it freezes before it spreads out, turning the ice into a terraced tundra.

It was about this time that I had my first encounter with a Zamboni. Each year my father would take a group of us down to the state high school hockey tournament in Minneapolis. The games were enthralling but no more so than this ice machine that would come out between periods, achieving in 7 minutes what it often took us 7 hours to do, and without putting Mr. Sears’s life in danger.

Inevitably, the championship game would end being between some small town from the “Iron Range” in the north – a Warroad, or International Falls, or Roseau – and some big school from the twin cities – a St. Paul Johnson, or Edina, or Burnsville. We instinctively sided with the Iron Range school, both out of geographical kinship and because we knew those kids, like us, had once used Montgomery Ward catalogues as shin pads and had shoveled their share of rinks.

They weren’t always pampered by mechanization.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Family/2013/0125/Foreign-adoptions-by-Americans-fall-number-of-worldwide-orphans-rises","Foreign adoptions by Americans fall, number of worldwide orphans rises","Foreign adoptions by Americans fell to their lowest level since 1994, according to the State Department. Foreign adoptions by Americans keep falling, despite the continuing increase in the amount of orphans and needy children worldwide.

Foreign adoptions by Americans fell to a 17-year low. Some blame new restrictive policies like in South Korea, where the government is trying to encourage domestic adoption to shed its reputation of being a source for international adoption. Here, a pastor in South Korea tends to an unwanted infant left in a ""baby box"" by its mother.

The number of foreign children adopted by US parents fell by 7 percent last year, to the lowest level since 1994, and is likely to plunge further this year due to the new ban by Russia on adoptions by Americans.

Figures released Thursday by the State Department for the 2012 fiscal year showed 8,668 adoptions from abroad, down from 9,320 in 2011 and down about 62 percent from the all-time high of 22,884 in 2004. The number has dropped every year since then.

As usual, China accounted for the most children adopted in the US. But its total of 2,589 was far below the peak of 7,903 in 2005.

Ethiopia was second, at 1,568, followed by Russia with 748. For the current year, the figure from Russia is likely to shrink to only a few dozen adoptions that were in the final stages of approval before the ban was enacted last month.

The immediate purpose of Russia's ban was to retaliate for a new US law targeting alleged Russian human-rights violators. But the measure also reflects resentment over the 60,000 Russian children adopted by Americans in the past two decades, 19 of whom have died.

The ban has caused anguish for scores of US families who were in the process of trying to adopt Russian children, and it has saddened many of the families who successfully adopted Russian children in the past. They've been posting family photographs and heartwarming testimonials on a Facebook site called Orphans Without Borders.

Following Russia on the 2012 list were South Korea, which accounted for 627 adoptions, Ukraine at 395, the Democratic Republic of the Congo at 240, Uganda at 238 and Nigeria at 197.

The adoption numbers were up for several African countries and for Haiti, which had virtually halted foreign adoptions following the devastating earthquake of 2010, but has slowly resumed them. Haiti accounted for 154 adoptions by Americans last year, compared to 33 in 2011.

Overall, however, the numbers were discouraging to adoption advocates as countries that formerly provided large numbers of adopted children continued to cut back, and controversies over adoption-related fraud and corruption continued to block nearly all adoptions from Vietnam, Cambodia, Guatemala, and Nepal.

The last time there were fewer foreign adoptions to the US was in 1994, when there were 8,333, and the downward trend has troubled many supporters of international adoption.

""We're demoralized,"" said Chuck Johnson, CEO of the National Council of Adoption, in an interview before release of the latest numbers. ""It's a failure of leadership, from everyone involved, myself included, to come up with policies and procedures that open up doors for kids.""

Kathleen Strottman, executive director of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, said she found it frustrating that the foreign adoption numbers kept dropping at a time when the number of orphans and abandoned children worldwide was rising.

""Maybe, once and for all, we're at a point where we see how crucial it is for the US government to step up and take a real leadership role,"" she said.

Susan Jacobs, the State Department's special adviser on children's issues, said in a telephone interview that she and her colleagues remained ""very disappointed"" by the Russian ban.

""They're angry with us, and they've found something that would hurt us,"" she said. ""But it also hurts the Russian children who are looking for a home.""

Jacobs expressed some wariness about the increased number of adoptions from Africa, noting that several of those countries were not signatories to the Hague Convention, a treaty that sets ethical standards for intercountry adoption. But she suggested that Americans should be pleased — not disappointed — by the declining numbers of foreign adoptions from nations such as China and South Korea, which have been improving their domestic adoption and child welfare programs.

The international developments have narrowed the options for Americans who want to adopt. According to the latest tally by the National Council for Adoption — based on 2007 data — there were about 76,000 domestic adoptions that year, not including adoptions by relatives. Of that total, about 43,000 involved children adopted from foster care, and the rest were handled either by private agencies or private individuals, such as attorneys.

By last count, there were about 104,000 children in the US foster care system available for adoption. This group generally includes many children with emotional or physical difficulties, as well as higher proportions of blacks and Hispanics than the general population.

Adam Pertman, executive director of the Donaldson Adoption Institute, said the decline in foreign adoptions was part of a broader change in the demography of adoption, but he stressed that ample options remain for parents wishing to bring a child into their homes.

""There's a growing number of parents who have trouble finding a child to adopt who fits into their original vision of what would happen,"" he said. ""But if they are willing to adopt across racial and ethnic lines, or adopt older children, the kids are there.""

Bill Blacquiere of Bethany Christian Services, one the largest US adoption agencies, said his national network generally has a waiting list of some 700 would-be adoptive parents waiting for children to become available.

In hopes of adding at least a few more babies to the adoption pool, Bethany has teamed with a conservative media organization, Heroic Media, on an advertising campaign seeking to persuade pregnant women considering an abortion to choose adoption instead.

""We're not saying adoption is for everyone,"" Blacquiere said. ""We're just saying, 'Be aware of all the facts.'""

The State Department reported that 99 American children were adopted by residents of foreign countries last year — 41 of them went to Canada and 28 to the Netherlands.","2013-01-25 12:01:00","1","65.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","41.0","0.0","202.0","75.0","0.0","377.0","0.0","37.0","9","1054","97.26","83.58","19.08","13.04","24.51","29.79","74.19","44.59","6.83","3.23","0.09","1.42","0.00","0.85","0.85","3.61","8.35","18.22","5.22","3.13","4.46","0.47","10.15","4.46","2.47","1.52","5.12","2.66","3.70","1.33","2.28","0.09","0.47","1.04","10.91","1.14","0.09","0.76","0.28","7.50","1.14","0.95","0.85","2.18","0.95","1.99","1.71","0.38","1.14","0.19","0.38","0.00","0.28","0.19","0.09","8.82","2.66","0.85","5.03","0.47","0.47","4.84","4.17","0.19","14.23","1.61","8.06","4.74","3.61","0.66","0.95","0.38","0.19","0.09","0.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.09","0.00","15.18","4.08","7.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.47","2.09","1.33","0.00","0.00","5208","8.34","24.790697674418606","1580","1043","43","55.27","12.6","11.6","13.18","15.2","231","7.166666666666666","20.579060402684565","483","22.56","9","0.43","0","33","51","99","1","159","89","5","6","4","120","83","12","92","1","0","26","9","35","1","1","2","32","0","26","53","32","30","19","19","9","8","0","5"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Movies/2013/0906/Salinger-chases-a-recluse-out-of-the-shadows","'Salinger' chases a recluse out of the shadows","By turns fascinating and infuriating, the documentary “Salinger” arrives with a public-relations fanfare not unlike Geraldo Rivera’s opening of Al Capone’s vault. The promotional campaign cautions “Uncover the Mystery but Don’t Spoil the Secrets.” The “mystery” here is the life of J.D. Salinger; one of the “secrets,” already trumpeted in advance in the press, is the tantalizing possibility that Salinger, who died in 2010 at age 91, instructed his estate to publish five additional books beginning in 2015.

Shane Salerno, who wrote and directed the film, and who also produced a just-published companion book, an oral history also titled “Salinger,” is the screenwriter of “Savages” and has also written several upcoming sequels to “Avatar.” He’s a showman who treats Salinger’s life in exposé fashion, heavy on the psychobiography. Much of what is revealed in this film has been reported in the past, though not in such detail. We hear about Salinger’s posh New York upbringing – his Jewish father, who disapproved of his son’s literary ambitions, was in the cheese business; his Roman Catholic mother was much more obliging. Tossed out of a series of prep and military schools, wanting to make his mark as an actor before discovering writing, he enlisted in the Army and landed on Normandy Beach during the Allied invasion. Likely shellshocked, working in counterintelligence directly after the war, he encountered the Nazi death camps and had a nervous breakdown. He brought back to America a German bride who, it turns out, may have been a Gestapo spy. (The marriage was dissolved almost immediately.)

Salinger had been selling stories to established magazines like Esquire, but his ambition, his obsession, was to crack The New Yorker, something he finally accomplished. When “The Catcher in the Rye,” which Salinger had been working on even in wartime, was published in 1951, it turned him into his generation’s instant guru. Its success also drove him from the New York literary scene, which he hated anyway, into reclusion in the wilds of New Hampshire, where he resided until his death. His last published story, coming after the books “Franny and Zooey” and “Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters,” was in 1965.

Salerno pays lip service to Salinger’s literary accomplishment, with brief talking-head segments featuring everyone from Gore Vidal and Tom Wolfe to John Guare and Robert Towne, but what really interests him is the down-and-dirty stuff. So we hear from a parade of women, often decades younger than Salinger, with whom he consorted. (Joyce Maynard, who once wrote a tell-all book about her life with Salinger, is the most prominently featured.) Salerno pushes the idea that Salinger’s early, failed love affair with the teenage Oona O’Neill, who dumped him for Charlie Chaplin no less, was a lifelong regret.

He also pushes, more plausibly, the contention that much of Salinger’s emotional difficulties were a species of post-traumatic stress disorder suffered in the wake of World War II. But there is much overreaching in this film. A talking-head voice-over tells us in doomy tones how the birth of Salinger’s daughter, Margaret (who, unlike his son, Matthew, is interviewed in the film), disrupted his ordered life. What exactly is unique about this disruption?

The film has a quote from Salinger from 1980 saying that “writing Holden was a mistake.” Some mistake: The book has sold 60 million copies and continues to sell 250,000 a year. According to this film, Salinger stipulated in his will that “The Catcher in the Rye” never be made into a movie. (Billy Wilder and Elia Kazan, among others, tried to convince him otherwise.) So instead of a movie of “The Catcher in the Rye” we have “Salinger,” a documentary that turns the author into a crypto Holden Caulfield. Maybe Salinger was right all those years in shunning the limelight. Psychobiography isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Movies/2013/1205/Inside-Llewyn-Davis-the-story-of-a-troubled-troubadour-is-one-of-the-Coen-brothers-best","'Inside Llewyn Davis,' the story of a troubled troubadour, is one of the Coen brothers' best","In top form, Joel and Ethan Coen offer up feel-bad experiences that, like fine blues medleys, make you feel good (although with an acidulous aftertaste). “Inside Llewyn Davis” is one of their best. So many movies are emblazoned with happy faces; this one wears its sadness, and its snarl, proudly.

There is more to this film than the tinny nihilism that often mars the brothers’ movies. Set in 1961, when the folk-music scene was just beginning to morph into its early Bob Dylan phase, it’s about a week in the life of Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac, in a career-making performance), a troubadour whose heartfelt first solo album has fallen on mostly deaf ears.

Llewyn – the name is Welsh – was in a moderately successful duo until his partner jumped off the George Washington Bridge. Now he spends his nights sleeping on the couches of friends from the Upper West Side to Greenwich Village, toting his guitar as well as an orange tabby named Ulysses that escaped from one of the apartments he crashed in. It’s wintertime and Llewyn can’t even afford a heavy coat.

He has the sloe-eyed look of a famished, bearded apostle – he could have stepped out of an El Greco canvas. (Isaac, who grew up in Miami, has a Guatamalan-Cuban lineage.) Despite the hardships – the two-bit recording gigs, the lukewarm sets at the Village’s Gaslight Café, the going-nowhere tryouts – Llewyn is no figure of pathos. He’s too ornery for that. He may not have much of a life, but he manages to disrupt the lives of everybody around him.

Jean (Carey Mulligan), for example, is one half of a clean-cut folkie duo with her husband, Jim (Justin Timberlake), who is also a good friend of Llewyn’s. Llewyn has nevertheless impregnated Jean, and her vituperation with him cuts right through her stage-managed cheeriness. Already cash-strapped, he now must pay for her abortion.

Why should we care about Llewyn? It’s a fair question, and there indeed were times when I thought I was trapped inside a generic Coen Brothers drearathon. What lifts the film out of the usual glum rut is that Llewyn, for all his self-regarding annoyingness, is a genuine talent. He exhibits the true artist’s alchemy: When he’s performing, all his nonsense burns away and what you get is pure, proud, deep-toned feeling. (The marvelous soundtrack of songs, some standards, some new, was produced by T Bone Burnett.) Only as an artist is he fully realized, and so his failure to connect with audiences and booking agents isn’t just a professional loss, it’s a personal tragedy.

The Coens created a Job-like character in “A Serious Man,” a luckless professor for whom nothing could go right. There was an element of cruelty in that film, like watching someone being dismembered slowly, limb by limb, but the ghastliness of the man’s predicament was so horrible it was funny – a black comic kvell. Llewyn’s fate is more of a slow-burn slide into despair, a despair he never fully allows himself to indulge.

The Coens don’t fully allow us to indulge it, either. That’s all for the best, I think, and not just because otherwise the film might be too much to bear. They don’t get all slobby-soppy with us, and so the moments of poignancy in this film, of which there are many, come through without any special pleading. When Llewyn sings Ewan MacColl’s tender “The Shoals of Herring” to his infirm, uncomprehending ex-Merchant Marine father in a nursing home, the brief sequence has a plaintive grace.

Llewyn’s working-class background – he also has toiled as a merchant mariner – sets him somewhat apart from the other folkies that we see. It gives his grit a pedigree. There’s some class condescension in how he reacts to those who are better off than he. His response to the kindly wife of a Columbia professor who exclaims, “I thought singing was a joyous expression of the soul,” is a hard-bitten disbelief. That’s his pose, but it’s also how he copes in an unabiding world. Bitterness is his armature.

The people in this movie are writhing in various states of turmoil, but they have an avidity for their own misery. Roland Turner (marvelously played by John Goodman), the big, bleary New Orleans bluesman with whom Llewyn shares a disastrous ride to Chicago, is a Falstaffian sleazeball. The great F. Murray Abraham’s poker-faced artist’s manager Bud Grossman is not so much miserable as he is the cause of misery in others. After listening to Llewyn pour his heart out in an audition, he fills the slow silence by matter-of-factly stating, “I don’t see a lot of money here.”

The losses for Llewyn pile up, but he never quite resigns himself to his predicament. He never lets go. But we can see what he can’t – the folkie revolution that will usher in his kind of music. Is his an impending happy ending or a final forlorn put-down by the fates? The story closes on a rich and necessary ambiguity.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2013/0908/Mexico-s-reforms-are-key-to-US-immigration-reform","Mexico's reforms are key to US immigration reform","Surprising and historic political changes in Mexico hold the prospect of reducing the American fear of future waves of illegal migrants across the border.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto gives a thumbs up as he gives his first state of the nation message in Mexico City, Sept. 2. Mr. Pena Nieto opened his address by praising the passage of a key education reform just hours earlier.

The US Congress returns to work this week with little prospect of passing a proposed overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws – and not because Syria and budget battles have taken the spotlight. No, the main reason lies in a common fear that more Mexicans will illegally cross the border if the ones already in the United States are given a path to citizenship.

Is that fear founded?

Not if one sees hope in the startling progress made in Mexico over the past nine months in ending partisan gridlock. An unexpected multiparty political consensus, called the Pact for Mexico and forged last December after a presidential election, has passed one reform after another with the plan to lift nearly half of Mexicans out of poverty.

The latest proposed reform, a revamp of tax policy, was released Sunday by President Enrique Peña Nieto even as tens of thousands of Mexicans protested the next big reform, an opening of the state-run energy industry to foreign investment.

Mexico’s Congress has already passed several key reforms, breaking entrenched powers in public education, broadcasting, and telecommunications while removing legal immunity for officials for criminal prosecution.

Mr. Peña Nieto calls these steps “transformational” and wisely set a deadline to finish them by the end of the year. They are aimed at raising economic growth to 6 percent from the current 1 to 2 percent while increasing revenue to build a strong social safety net.

Poor growth has been the main driver of poor Mexicans to the US – despite the strong patriotism among Mexicans. The reforms are designed to buttress that love of country so more Mexicans don’t flee – or join a criminal drug gang.

What helps account for this surprising political momentum that emerged 12 years after full democracy was restored in Mexico? Unlike in Washington, top elected leaders have formed bonds of trust for the sake of the country. They saw a political power vacuum being filled by violent drug gangs.

“We’ve all gotten to know each other very well,” Aurelio Nuño, chief of staff to Peña Nieto, told The Wall Street Journal. “You come to see each other as people, not just politicians.”

A big test will come in passing energy reforms, which require a constitutional change. Last March, Peña Nieto persuaded the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party to go along with such change – despite the PRI’s history in nationalizing the oil industry in 1938. The shift helps challenge the notion that Mexico’s identity is wrapped up in maintaining the government oil monopoly, Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex.

Pemex faces a bleak future in providing the government with revenue unless it brings in foreign expertise to tap the country’s large reserves of deep-water petroleum and onshore shale gas. Without such reform, Mexico could become a net importer of oil by 2020. It already imports almost half its gasoline, despite reserves nearly as large as Kuwait’s.

Lifting up the poorest Mexicans may take years. Fewer than half of young people now finish high school. But the country has made a bold and urgent start. These reforms are the missing part of the “comprehensive” immigration reform in the US. The issue of border security – which is built on fear of more illegal immigration – may be less of an issue if Mexico continues its courageous reforms.","2013-09-08 21:15:00","0","54.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","186.0","76.0","0.0","383.0","0.0","37.0","10","614","98.36","58.37","43.59","46.80","19.81","26.06","75.41","40.88","4.89","1.79","0.00","0.65","0.16","0.49","0.49","3.09","10.10","15.96","4.23","2.44","3.91","0.98","9.61","6.35","2.93","0.49","2.44","2.12","5.37","3.26","2.12","0.81","0.65","0.16","5.21","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.49","6.84","0.98","1.30","0.81","2.28","0.16","2.93","0.98","0.49","0.00","0.00","1.14","0.33","0.49","0.00","0.16","12.05","2.12","1.47","7.49","0.65","0.65","3.42","6.03","1.63","17.43","2.93","7.98","6.19","5.05","0.16","0.33","1.95","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","11.73","5.05","3.42","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.33","1.30","1.30","0.00","0.00","2980","8.39","21.448275862068964","958","618","30","50.57","13.0","11.3","11.95","12.6","146","12.375","19.689838187702264","352","19.79","5","0.39","0","11","10","70","0","86","62","4","2","5","123","59","7","30","0","1","8","4","22","2","0","2","15","0","18","11","15","19","13","19","3","1","0","0"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/the-monitors-view/2013/0116/What-Obama-s-gun-proposals-left-out","What Obama's gun proposals left out","President Obama's actions and proposals on gun violence are worthy, especially his directive on research into media violence. But he failed to link gun violence to children of broken or single-parent homes.

President Obama signs executive orders Jan. 16 aimed at reducing gun violence. Watching him are four children who wrote letters to the White House about the school shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

President Obama took 23 executive actions on Wednesday to curb firearm-related deaths. That and his proposals to Congress for new gun laws are a necessary response to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

Perhaps his most important action is a directive for new research “on the causes and prevention of gun violence.” More restrictions on firearms may keep guns away from killers, but a better understanding of the roots of violent behavior – and then addressing them – would be far more effective. Most gun crimes are not done by people with mental illness but by sane people who are prone to violence.

Unfortunately, the White House seemed to focus the new research only on the relationship between violence and the kind of video games and other media images that may influence a killer. While such data would be helpful, kids who imitate fictional violence often do so because they lack a supportive family.

Mr. Obama has often noted the need to promote marriage and family – his own family certainly serves as a model. But he must also back research that looks at links between violence and children born out of wedlock or raised by single parents.

One recent study by the Brookings Center on Children and Families, for example, found that children whose births resulted from unintended pregnancy are more likely to “engage in delinquent and criminal behavior later in life.” Author and noted psychologist Andrew Solomon finds that the first risk factor in the making of a criminal is being raised by a single parent.

Current statistics on the home lives of children are not encouraging.

Nearly 26 percent are raised by single parents, and that figure jumps to 72 percent for blacks and 71 percent for the poor. For mothers with only a high school education, more than 4 out of 10 of their children are born out of wedlock – or three times the rate of the 1980s. Only a third of births to women who are unmarried and not cohabiting are intended.

Cohabitation, in fact, has taken off. The number of couples living together without the commitment and protection of being married has more than doubled since the 1990s. In 2012, 40 percent of unmarried partners had children younger than 18.

Both public and private leaders “refuse to take on the issue of children raised by single parents – despite all the statistics showing harm – or deal with it in a meaningful way,” said Robert Doar, commissioner of the New York City Human Resources Administration, in a speech last week.

Mr. Doar said New York City – which has about 50,000 out-of-wedlock births a year – is considering a campaign, much like antismoking campaigns, to show young people the effects on a child who is born out of wedlock.

But he also wants Obama to take similar action – perhaps even using his second inaugural to announce one.

“There could be no better voice on the important issue of family and the role fathers play in the lives of children than the president of the United States,” Doar said.

“With the first lady, he sets absolutely the correct example. But he says so little. And he never turns his hypercritical eye on this important issue.”

When more than half of births to women under 30 are now outside of marriage, government cannot ignore violence by children of some of these homes.

One sign of society’s disapproval of these trends was the decision Tuesday by the Oxygen cable channel to pull a reality TV show slated for later this year about a famous rap artist, Shawty Lo, who has fathered 11 children with 10 different mothers. Oxygen, an NBCUniversal cable network owned by Comcast, was bombarded by complaints from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Change.org, and the Parents Television Council.

Children need the qualities and love of a stable family to learn how to behave later in life. While many children of single parents do just fine, the many exceptions too often end up with troubled lives. A Brookings Institution study found that almost all the increase in child poverty since the 1970s would have disappeared if parents today had married at 1970 rates.

More research on this problem – and then executive attention – could do as much if not more to curb mass shootings and other gun violence as all the toughened laws on firearms.","2013-01-16 16:55:00","0","59.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","196.0","76.0","0.0","383.0","0.0","37.0","10","803","96.05","75.73","19.96","10.17","21.70","23.91","82.94","44.08","4.86","1.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.62","0.37","2.86","7.60","17.43","5.48","3.61","5.98","1.00","10.09","6.85","3.49","1.25","4.11","3.74","4.48","1.62","2.86","0.12","0.37","0.12","11.46","2.86","0.12","0.62","1.87","11.71","1.99","1.99","1.62","2.62","1.49","3.49","2.62","1.49","0.87","0.25","1.25","0.12","1.00","0.12","0.00","11.33","3.24","1.00","5.85","1.00","1.12","2.24","5.98","0.62","13.70","1.49","6.97","5.35","4.61","1.74","1.37","0.25","0.00","0.37","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.00","10.59","4.98","3.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.50","1.25","0.25","0.00","0.00","3818","7.8","26.0","1213","809","38","58.32","12.4","10.4","11.02","12.2","159","6.428571428571429","18.381557478368357","402","23.32","2","0.42","0","32","24","68","0","126","62","6","0","8","123","71","3","74","3","0","10","7","36","6","1","2","21","0","25","17","11","20","20","17","3","6","1","2"

But the US can use the lure of liberty – visas – to undercut the Kim regime and challenge China's support of it.

To help heat their homes, North Koreans wash coal cinders in a river at the North Korean town of Sinuiju, opposite the Chinese border city of Dandong, Feb. 12. North Korea under its new young leader, Kim Jong-un, conducted its third-ever nuclear test on Tuesday.

North Korea tested a nuclear device Tuesday, the third since 2006. The underground explosion, which was more powerful and perhaps smaller in design than the previous ones, has sparked a critical mass of international alarm.

Has the regime of Kim Jong-un now perfected a bomb able to be launched on a missile toward the United States? Will it sell a device to Iran or terrorist groups? Can it now blackmail South Korea into submission?

These possible dangers are pushing the US and others to toughen sanctions against North Korean leaders. Direct threats, however, have not worked up to now, and for one simple reason: China still provides an economic lifeline of fuel and food to its ally in Pyongyang. Beijing doesn’t want a unified Korea on its border, one allied with the US. And the Kim regime itself has long thrived on isolation and adversity.

Given the world’s heightened concerns over this latest nuclear test, now may be the time to try a softer approach, one based on an invitation rather than added sanctions.

Since the passage of a law in 2004, the US has opened a door for North Korean refugees, offering asylum if they escape across the Amnok and Duman rivers into China and then on to other countries. One premise of the North Korean Rights Act is to use America’s strength as a nation of freedom to complement it being a nation of military might. If enough North Koreans knew of this opportunity for liberty, the regime would steadily lose its subjects as they make for the exits.

The idea of luring a suppressed people into the light of freedom has a recent precedent. The communist regime in East Germany collapsed in 1989 after thousands of its people crossed into neighboring countries. The exodus was the spark for the implosion of the Soviet empire.

Tens of thousands of North Koreans have braved the crossing into China over the years. The physical and other hurdles to getting to the US would be huge. But what other tactic will work against the regime?

Sadly, both the Bush and Obama administrations have not used the 2004 law to induce many North Koreans to flee. Fewer than 200 have been accepted as refugees since 2006.

The US may not wish to upset China by encouraging a massive flow of migrants into the northeast region. Washington also hasn’t gone to the United Nations with an official complaint about the cruel way that China treats North Koreans who cross the border. With so many other interests with Beijing, the US may not have seen North Korea’s nuclear threat as an urgent matter.

Until now.

The latest bomb test should elevate US interest in attracting this flow of refugees. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of the 22 million North Koreans now listen to foreign radio broadcasts. According to defectors, more than half have watched foreign DVDs, usually South Korean soap operas. Such contact with the outside world has helped to shatter the illusion of a worker’s paradise.

The US could easily broadcast its invitation for asylum into North Korea. In the mid-1950s, for example, as Vietnam was being divided into communist and democratic parts, the CIA lured millions of northern Vietnamese to move to the south by dropping leaflets from planes. And the US continues to give special visa treatment to Cubans who escape from that communist-run island nation.

The US ambassador to Beijing could visit North Korean refugees now hiding in northeast China, welcoming them to apply for a visa. The US, after all, is already home to the largest Korean community outside the Korean Peninsula.

The major fault line between North Korea and most of the world lies in the denial of freedom to its people. The obvious pressure point is to offer freedom to North Koreans, thereby undercutting their ruthless rulers. Such a step is also a way to break China’s support of the regime.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2013/0515/Education-reform-s-next-big-thing-Common-Core-standards-ramp-up","Education reform's next big thing: Common Core standards ramp up","Common Core standards are aimed at building students' critical thinking skills, and 46 states have adopted them. But critics say the methods are unproven and the education reform is moving too fast.

Math teacher Kristina Smith works with her students in Loveland, Colo., as administrators look on in an effort to assess the best practices for classroom instruction.

In an Algebra I class at Mountain View High School, a freshman girl is struggling with a new assignment: The students are working in small groups to try to find the number of different-shaped tiles needed to cover a certain size tabletop – and then how to find a pattern and extrapolate on that answer for other sizes.

""Is this supposed to be hard or easy?"" she asks her teacher in frustration.

""It's supposed to make you think,"" replies Kristina Smith, the teacher, as she patiently circles through the room, responding to each student's questions not with an answer but with additional questions that encourage them to push themselves to the next step.

What's going on at this school in Loveland, Colo., as well as across the United States, is a key step in a long-running shift to national standards. These Common Core standards, which have been adopted by 45 states, have the potential to drastically change curriculum in elementary, middle, and high schools around the country.

In a crowded field of major K-12 education reforms, the shift to new, common standards is one of the biggest. Depending on whom you talk to, it's the most promising education reform in decades – an opportunity for teachers to delve more deeply into material and focus on critical-thinking skills and comprehension. Or, it's yet another reform that's being pushed through too quickly, paired with too many high-stakes consequences, and it will further drive teachers from the classroom and discourage kids.

The true test, both proponents and detractors agree, will come over the next year or two, when the standards shift from just existing on paper to becoming a reality in classrooms. Right now, teachers and administrators are discussing how to translate the standards into practice, which are in various stages of implementation. It's a state-by-state and district-by-district process, with many different approaches.

""The hope for Common Core, if it's implemented well, is that we'll have students who are having a K-12 education that has math and literacy make more sense to them, and a smoother process from grade to grade. And that ultimately, when kids graduate from high school, they are better prepared for courses they're going into in their first year in college or whatever job they go into,"" says Carrie Heath Phillips, director of Common Core standards for the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), which helped lead the push for the standards. But, Ms. Heath Phillips cautions, ""like any initiative, how this ends up being taught, how it's implemented at the local level – that is everything.""

The Common Core initiative has been in the works for some time. A state-led effort, it began in 2009, fueled by the CCSSO and the National Governors Association. Kentucky was the first state to officially adopt the standards, in 2010, followed by 44 other states and the District of Columbia. The only states not to adopt the standards are Alaska, Nebraska, Texas, and Virginia. (Minnesota adopted the English standards but not the math standards.)

Prior efforts to set common national standards had failed, in part because they came from the federal government rather than from the states themselves. The hope this time was to have rigorous standards that cross state boundaries and that are coherent across grade levels and subjects – allowing students to build from year to year on prior understanding.

Former standards in many states ""were a mile wide and an inch deep,"" says Heath Phillips. ""We're trying to go to the opposite – a few inches wide but a mile deep. We're trying to build those critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, and students' ability to apply those in various real-world situations.""

Still, the standards are seeing a fair amount of backlash – some of which, say observers, is primarily due to bad messaging or misunderstandings: people equating standards with standardized testing, for instance; assuming national standards means a national curriculum; or thinking that the standard that 70 percent of texts be informational by 12th grade means English classes will no longer focus on fiction (the standard actually applies across courses, and the intent is for social studies and science classes to do more literacy work).

But some of the backlash is also due to concerns about how standards that may look good on paper will be implemented.

""When you first introduce the concept of Common Core to teachers who have been beaten down by ... drilling kids for testing, they are extremely excited,"" says Linda Darling-Hammond, an education professor at Stanford University in California. ""It's what people want for their own children. But that excitement is very quickly followed by fear and dread, because the ways in which it's going to be used are unknown. If it gets squeezed back into the old multiple-choice testing mentality as a tool for rewards and sanctions, and not a tool for classrooms to engage with more rewarding and challenging instruction, then teachers will turn against it.""

Some educators already have.

Diane Ravitch, an education historian and New York University professor, is a frequent critic of accountability reforms, but was initially supportive of the idea of national standards. She's turned against Common Core – in large part, she says, because of the process by which the standards were created and the speed with which they're being implemented.

""No one wanted to give it a trial, and now we're trying it in 46 states,"" Ms. Ravitch says. ""How do we know it will improve achievement? We haven't tried it. How do we know it will work in real classrooms?""

Ravitch also has concerns about the appropriateness of the standards in lower grades – a concern shared by some early-childhood experts. The methods for arriving at standards, working backward from what high school graduates should be expected to know, in some cases has resulted in standards that don't take into account how young children learn, such experts say.

Moreover, the timing of the standards – along with numerous other accountability reforms – couldn't be worse, Ravitch says.

""American public education is being stretched to the breaking point,"" she says. ""If someone is struggling with a 30-pound thing on their back, do you say, carry another 35 pounds because this is good for you?""

That concern is one shared by many teachers, as well as their union leaders. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), praised the Common Core standards in an April 30 address, even as she called for a moratorium on high-stakes consequences while they're being implemented.

In a recent poll of AFT members, Ms. Weingarten noted, 75 percent supported the standards, which she said should mean ""less memorization, less racing through a course of study, and more searching for evidence and conceptual understanding.""

But in too many cases, including New York, Weingarten said, tests that are aligned with the standards are being fast-tracked before the standards have even begun to be implemented – on material students have never learned. And too many high-stakes consequences are being tied to those tests, she said.

Officials, Weingarten said in her speech, are seeking ""to make [the standards] count before they make them work.""

Advocates of Common Core also emphasize how important it is to do the implementation well.

""I think there is a growing backlash against standards and accountability-driven reform. This is basically our last shot to get this right,"" says Kathleen Porter-Magee, senior director of the High Quality Standards Program at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education think tank headquartered in Washington. ""Speed should be secondary to thoughtfulness and deliberateness.""

Here in Colorado, educators have been central to the transition to the new standards – and many are welcoming them.

The state brought more than 500 teachers together last fall to translate the standards into curriculum and materials that could be shared. This spring, the state is conducting workshops with more teachers around the state; over the summer, teachers will gather to further develop the materials, with special attention on how to improve instruction for particular groups, including special-education and gifted students and English-language learners. This is in addition to district-led efforts going on around the state.

Thompson School District, which includes Mountain View High School, is one of 13 districts working with the Colorado Legacy Foundation. Those districts are doing even more work around integrating new standards (which in Colorado include not just the Common Core ones, but also new state standards in social studies and science) and helping teachers develop curriculum. They've been holding multiple lesson studies like the one Ms. Smith was running, observed by teachers and administrators who later discuss what they saw, share ideas, and talk about what worked.

""It's no longer just about skills: It's about coherence, and how do these concepts flow from grade to grade and course to course, and about rigor,"" says Smith, who has been teaching math for seven years and welcomes the changes. ""My concern is if [we can] accomplish what we need to accomplish in the short period we have, but then I say we don't have any choice.""

Lessons like the one she was teaching about tiles, she says, are valuable since they emphasize process and understanding, rather than memorization of an equation.

""I didn't care what [students] gave me as the final answer,"" she says. ""I wanted to see the math they gave me as the process.... My goal was to get them to back up their answer.""

In a class downstairs, as part of the same lesson study, Tiffany Utoft is giving her Algebra II students the same problem. The change in the students' understanding and the sophistication of their responses compared with that of the Algebra I students – many develop complicated formulas to solve the problem – are striking.

""I just had an epiphany!"" yells Lizzy Fanning, a sophomore with curly red hair, at one point.

The exercise, she says, is a good one since it's so tangible. ""When you're learning math, everyone asks how could this apply in real life,"" Lizzy says. ""If you were a carpenter, you could have to do what we're doing now.""","2013-05-15 08:59:00","0","75.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","202.0","75.0","0.0","388.0","0.0","37.0","10","1753","84.91","69.62","35.13","55.91","22.47","26.47","82.09","47.69","9.07","4.05","0.63","0.74","0.46","0.91","1.31","5.02","7.64","15.06","8.44","3.99","6.45","0.80","15.35","6.27","2.91","2.28","1.60","2.51","3.65","2.62","1.03","0.23","0.34","0.17","7.87","0.00","0.06","0.97","0.00","10.10","2.85","2.40","1.43","2.05","0.34","2.51","2.28","0.68","1.37","0.17","0.17","0.00","0.11","0.06","0.00","10.72","1.71","3.02","4.96","0.97","0.80","3.14","10.27","1.31","15.06","2.28","8.16","4.39","9.24","0.17","0.11","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.17","0.17","0.23","0.00","19.28","4.79","6.96","0.17","0.17","0.23","0.06","1.48","2.62","1.88","0.57","0.34","8583","7.72","23.773333333333333","2571","1741","82","58.42","11.9","10.4","12.71","13.5","334","10.1","18.153750717978177","667","21.59","16","0.47","0","69","25","169","0","212","128","10","2","16","227","130","1","162","0","0","82","11","72","4","1","4","58","0","75","37","58","47","72","61","19","13","0","16"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Editorial-Board-Blog/2013/0513/A-better-way-to-talk-about-guns-in-America","A better way to talk about guns in America","Tragic events such as Sunday's Mother's Day parade shooting in New Orleans will fuel the debate over gun control in America, even if legislation is stalled. For a more productive conversation, what if we shelve policy debate and focus on understanding why people hold the views they do?

From left to right: Elaine Frank, program director at the Center on Access to Lethal Measures in Lebanon., N.H., and Larry 'Brother Lo' Banks, a community activist with the Leadership Forum in Boston, both told stories of their connection to guns at a public forum hosted April 23 by The Christian Science Monitor. Nabil Laoudji, founder of The Mantle Project, coached them in the shaping of their stories.

The Senate gun legislation dealing with background checks may have met a resounding defeat a few weeks ago, but the political debate on both sides of the gun issue is far from over. And the debate over dinner tables continues. On Sunday, police say that 19 people – including two children – were shot at a Mother's Day parade in New Orleans.

Is there a way to move this conversation ahead? Is there a better way to talk about guns?

Those are questions this news organization, in partnership with The Public Conversations Project and The Mantle Project, set out to explore a couple of weeks ago. The April 11 event was set up as an evening of storytelling by three individuals with different experiences with guns, followed by small-group dialogue among roughly 60 participants who had signed up to attend.

As an event participant, by the end of a night spent talking with and listening to strangers, I had drawn a pretty clear conclusion: For most Americans, policy debates are personal. And logjams in dialogue often come from our inability to recognize the personal stories and experiences that inform our views.

What if Americans shelved the policy debate and began their individual – and national – conversations by telling those personal experiences, focusing not on who is right, but on where people are coming from? It may not necessarily change minds or translate to political compromise, but it’s a good place to start – a foundation of understanding.

Admittedly, I come to this proposition with some skepticism. I’m an editor in the Monitor’s commentary section; I follow, commission, and edit opinions on controversial issues like gun control. The divisions on most heated subjects are stark – even among seasoned, pragmatic pundits.

On this Thursday evening in Boston’s Back Bay, I found myself sitting next to strangers on all sides of the gun-control issue. The event started with three stories – one from a gun enthusiast, one from a suicide prevention activist, and one from a father whose son was shot and killed.

These ordinary citizens were coached to tell the stories of how they came to their stances on guns by Nabil Laoudji. Mr. Laoudji founded The Mantle Projectto to showcase such stories and was recently profiled in the Monitor’s “People Making A Difference” feature.

Mark Timney spoke first. He’s a gun owner and gun lover. But little else about him fits neatly into a category. He’s a white, middle-aged college professor and former journalist. He owned his first gun at the age of five and became an avid trap shooter (competitive target shooting at clay pigeons).

Adult life took him on a series of twists and turns – divorce, career changes, depression – that ultimately led him away from shooting. It wasn’t until he hit “rock bottom” that he took it up again with an almost religious “born again” zeal, stoked by the book “Zen in the Art of Archery.” Rolling up his sleeve, he showed the audience a mantra tattooed in black ink across his forearm: “One arrow, one life.”

Elaine Frank then took the stage, adding dry wit and maternal candor. Hers was the only Jewish family in their cookie-cutter suburb of New York in the late 1960s. There she developed a “severe and chronic case of Christmas envy.” Moving later to Brookline, Mass., she graduated from what she called an “85 percent Jewish” high school.

That grounding in diverse worlds bred a bridge-building temperament – uniquely useful for what was to come in her relationship to guns. She spoke of a former Washington, D.C., neighbor who was killed in a drive-by shooting, a cousin who killed herself with a gun, and in her current hometown in New Hampshire, the accidental gun deaths of teenagers. Now she works with gun stores and dealers to promote firearm safety, particularly around suicide prevention.

The final speaker, Larry “Brother Lo” Banks, is a black father and grandfather from a Boston neighborhood plagued with violence, high unemployment, and all the statistics that go along with urban poverty. His story began the Sunday morning he received the deafening news that a mugger shot and killed his son.

But perhaps more wrenching for the audience was the emotional wrestling he underwent “between wanting to get back at who killed my son… and finding some sympathy” for the young man who did it. He described a moment – pinned on the floor of the morgue by his brothers after he’d begun clawing at the walls – when he said he felt touched by God.

In the days after his son’s death, he couldn’t stop thinking of the perpetrator – and the environment that led him to mug and kill his son. He pleaded with his son’s friends not to retaliate. And his mission continues today: With other community leaders, he works with youth, steering them away from crime. “When we have victories in the streets, I say to my son, ‘That was for you, man.’”

In a Q&A between the three storytellers and Laoudji, Brother Lo explained that he thinks guns are the vehicles for violence in his community, but that he doesn’t see them, alone, as the problem. The problem, he emphasized, is the lack of positive role models, the lack of opportunities for the young men he works with. The gun that belongs to the evening’s first speaker, Timney, isn’t doing anyone harm just sitting in his closet, Brother Lo says.

At this, Timney turns to him: “I would give up my guns in a second if I thought it could bring back your son.”

If this had been a policy debate, Brother Lo might have just conceded a vital point to the gun proponents: Guns don’t kill people; people kill people. But this wasn’t a policy debate. Instead, two people whose backgrounds and views diverged in almost every way possible shared a moment of honesty that struck at the heart of the matter.

And their truth set the tone for the conversations the audience was to have in small groups, guided by Bob Stains, director of The Public Conversations Project. PCP’S business is to train individuals and organizations to talk constructively on issues that involve differing values and views.

Mr. Stains explained the guidelines for the structured conversations we were to have: Share air time, seek to understand, refrain from attempts to persuade, ask genuine questions. Then we slid our chairs somewhat awkwardly to form groups of four or five strangers.

Each of us began by speaking for one, timed minute about our personal experience with guns.

One woman in my group was a graduate student, interested in public dialogue. Another was a mother deeply shaken by the Newtown shootings. A third was a man who had once signed up for a firearm instruction course to learn how to handle a gun so that he could commit suicide – a track he later abandoned. I offered my own varied experience with guns – family members who are gun owners and NRA members, my own work in an urban community grappling with gun violence, but no personal experience shooting a gun.

A young man named Cory was the only one in our group with extended, direct experience with guns. He prefaced his remarks by explaining that he felt out of his comfort zone. He had come prepared to debate an issue – not to share his personal story.

He wasn’t alone. The mother who was shaken by the Newtown shootings had a thick manila folder on her lap that was full of articles and “evidence” to support her stance against guns. For all her efforts “not to persuade,” her perspective was clear.

For Cory, being forced to think about his personal experience with guns stirred some disarming self-reflection. Growing up, guns were a big part of his life. As he grew up and moved to Boston, they fell away from his experience. Within a year, he says, he’d lost the emotional connection to them. But some of his friends had not. Their interest in guns increased – and he began distancing himself from them.

When asked, he couldn’t articulate why his shift of views and friendships had happened. But he did know he was being prompted on this evening to look at his feelings in a way he hadn’t before.

I began to wonder if that was the entire point of this event. The goal wasn’t to change minds or make policy points. Rather, each of us was sharing of ourselves, collectively questioning, learning, reviewing.

After the event concluded, the members of my group continued talking. Will this really do anything to move the public discussion forward? Are we just beating around the bush by avoiding policy and sticking to polite and personal stories?

Frankly, I’m not sure. But I do know that if we had launched into a policy discussion afterward, and I had disagreed with someone’s stance, that person would not have been the faceless, amorphous “other side.” And I might have understood better how that individual’s story had shaped their view.

Cory told us that in countries torn by conflict, researchers have found that when former enemies work and interact together, their attitudes about the other group change. This personal interaction is far more effective in changing perceptions than first trying to teach groups to change their attitudes so they can later work together.

But I wonder if there were any real “enemies” in the audience or on stage that night. Were we representative enough of the vast swath of American society – or those who hold the most extreme views on gun ownership?

Admittedly, we were a self-selecting group, but it seems the model itself – not necessarily the participants – is what gave legs to the conversation.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2013/0627/Voyager-1-comes-closer-to-leaving-the-solar-system-again","Voyager 1 comes closer to leaving the solar system...again","Scientists have detected one of the critical signs that the Voyager 1 is nearly in interstellar space. But this has happened before.

No, we aren’t there yet. But we're closer.

Spacecraft Voyager 1 is closer to being the first human-made object to leave the solar system – but what exactly “closer” means is still unknown.

Researchers are waiting for Voyager 1, launched some 35 years ago and now more than 11 billion miles away, to exit the heliosheath, a region that extends past all the planets in our solar system by about 8 billion miles, into interstellar space. But “about” is the critical word here, because the trouble is that scientists don’t know exactly how big that region is.

Still, three papers, published in Science, report that scientists have observed one of the signs that they expect to see as Voyager 1 nears the solar system’s edge: the total disappearance of charged particles, known as termination shock particles, that had been steadily present for seven years.

That means Voyager 1 entered a previously unknown space region called the magnetic highway, or the depletion region, on Aug. 25, 2012, when the disappearance was observed. In that zone, the charged particles travel in and out of the heliosheath along a smooth magnetic field line. Scientists believe that it is the final zone through which the spacecraft must pass before it reaches the heliopause, the exact boundary between the heliosheath and interstellar space.

“We entered an entirely new region on Aug. 25,” Ed Stone, lead project scientist for the Voyager spacecraft told the Monitor. “We think this is the zone that connects to interstellar space.”

Scientists have not yet seen the critical third sign that would mark Voyager 1’s actual passage into interstellar space: a shift in the direction of the magnetic field. The heliosheath's queen is our sun, and the sun’s east-west magnetic field governs the zone. As the space probe exits the solar system, scientists would expect to see a magnetic shift as it enters a regional field with a completely different orientation.

Another sign that Voyager 1 is still in our solar system is that the cosmic rays the craft has begun to detect from interstellar space are traveling unevenly in multiple directions. In interstellar space, scientists expect those rays to be distributed uniformly, Mr. Stone said.

Voyager 1 was launched with its sibling, Voyager 2, in 1977, and both craft have already made tours of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune before veering toward interstellar space in 1990. Even though it was launched 15 days earlier, Voyager 2 is some 2 billion miles behind Voyager 1.

Voyager 1’s triumphant departure has been heralded before. In December 2004, the Voyager reached what is now known as the termination shock boundary, where particles blown outward from the sun suddenly slow down.

Voyager 1 saw this solar wind hit a dead calm in April 2010, which again suggested that the craft was coming tantalizingly close to the edge of the solar system. That region is now known as the stagnation zone. At that time, the existence of the depletion zone up ahead was unknown.

Scientists aren’t being deliberately cruel by repeatedly announcing that Voyager 1 has departed. The heliosheath is a baffling, mysterious place, and information about its outer reaches is collected only as Voyager 1 continues its unprecedented journey.

So we don't know how long it will be before Voyager 1 leaves for good.

“It could be several more months, or it could also be several more years,” said Stone. “There could be things we still don’t know about out there. Almost every day we’re learning something new.”

“That’s the nature of exploration – you find out how nature really does things,” he said.","2013-06-27 17:32:00","0","57.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","182.0","75.0","0.0","375.0","0.0","37.0","9","624","82.00","58.24","65.54","16.59","18.35","24.36","73.24","45.51","8.65","2.08","0.00","1.60","0.16","0.16","0.16","6.57","8.81","12.02","8.81","5.45","4.49","1.12","14.74","4.97","3.37","1.44","5.93","2.24","1.60","0.48","1.12","0.00","0.64","0.00","3.53","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.16","10.10","2.24","1.60","1.44","1.76","1.44","2.08","1.76","0.80","0.48","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.53","1.76","0.80","0.96","0.32","0.16","4.65","9.46","0.96","20.67","2.88","10.58","7.37","2.88","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.83","5.61","6.25","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","2.24","2.08","0.00","0.00","3010","7.18","21.166666666666668","914","622","34","61.36","11.7","9.2","12.07","11.5","104","7.416666666666666","16.008102893890676","289","19.07","0","0.43","0","13","35","69","0","76","53","7","0","7","96","34","0","33","1","0","17","6","38","0","0","2","9","0","18","20","10","22","20","32","8","2","0","5"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/2013/0318/First-ever-cyberattack-on-US-election-points-to-broad-vulnerabilities","First-ever cyberattack on US election points to broad vulnerabilities","Experts have confirmed that a fraudulent online request for 2,500 ballots in Florida last year was the first known cyberattack against a US election. And it could be just the tip of the iceberg.

Voters stand on line to vote in Florida's Miami-Dade County in this 2004 photo. A cyberattack against the county sought to influence a 2012 primary election by fraudulently requesting 2,500 ballots.

Over a 2-1/2 week period last July, more than 2,500 online “phantom requests” for absentee ballots were made to Miami-Dade County election headquarters, marking the first known cyberattack on a US election.

The fake requests for ballots targeted the Aug. 14 statewide primary and included requests for Democratic ballots in one congressional district and Republican ballots in two state House districts, according to a recent Miami Herald report.

The fake requests were done so clumsily that they were red-flagged and did not foul up the election. In any case, they would not have been enough to change the outcome. But now confirmed as the first cyberattack aimed at election fraud, the incident is further evidence that the vote-counting process is vulnerable, particularly as elections become more reliant on the Internet.

“This is significant because it’s the first time we’ve seen a very well documented case of attempted computer election fraud in the US,” says J. Alex Halderman, a cybersecurity researcher at the University of Michigan who focuses on election-system vulnerabilities. “This should be a real wakeup call because it illustrates the sort of computer voting attacks that many scientists have been warning were possible for years.”

Florida officials “were lucky” that the attacks were so clumsy, he says. The requests poured into the voter headquarters in clumps, much faster than normal, and in many cases the clumps arrived from the same handful of computer IP addresses. At this point, it is unknown what the attackers wanted to achieve.

But if they had been only slightly more sophisticated – distributing the requests across a larger number of IP address, for instance – the attack would have been much harder to detect.

“We’ve seen very sophisticated attacks against US corporations,” Dr. Halderman says. “If that level of sophisticated attack were directed against these election systems it could have been disastrous.”

Halderman knows. In three afternoons and without breaking any tamper-proof seals or leaving any traces, he and a colleague at Princeton hacked into a kind of paperless touch-screen voting machine used by almost 9 million voters in the 2008 presidential election. Just to show how much damage they could do, they installed Pac-Man in place of the voter software.

In 2006, he and Princeton researchers proved that, with just a few minutes access to a touch-screen voting machine, they could install a practically undetectable software virus that could spread to other machines and switch those machines' votes at election time before finally deleting all traces of itself.

Rapid advances in cyberweapons and malicious software put electronic-voting machines used in the 2012 election at risk and could have tipped the presidential election in some states, cybersecurity experts warned prior to the vote.

“This Florida case is not significant because thousands of votes were lost or changed, it’s significant because it demonstrates the feasibility of the pathway to attack the vote – and because there is online access to other pieces of the voting process,” says Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, a nonprofit group focused on ensuring US election integrity.

Some Florida officials say the attack also illustrates a need to take such violations more seriously. Law-enforcement officials had dropped their investigation until news media picked up on a Miami-Dade County grand jury investigation into the attack in December.

The Miami-Dade state attorney’s office reported it was unable to identify the hacker because the actions were masked by foreign IP addresses, the Miami Herald reported. But at least some of the IP addresses originated in Miami and could have been further traced, the paper found.

“In this case it seems more of an attack on the voting process,” says Ion Sancho, supervisor of elections in Leon County, Fla., who has studied cybersecurity in detail for systems he oversees. “Most Americans are unaware of the overall insecurity of the Internet and blind to the hacking threat to US elections systems. What we desperately need are law-enforcement authorities that will really take these kinds of attack seriously and really go after them.”","2013-03-18 17:50:00","0","56.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","187.0","76.0","0.0","379.0","0.0","37.0","9","747","92.30","62.60","11.48","1.50","23.34","28.11","70.95","44.18","7.36","2.81","0.00","1.20","0.00","0.54","1.07","4.55","8.97","13.65","7.63","2.95","4.69","0.54","12.32","3.88","2.68","0.67","3.35","2.95","3.88","0.40","3.48","0.80","1.74","0.13","5.49","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.67","10.71","1.47","2.14","2.01","2.68","0.54","2.95","2.54","1.20","0.80","0.54","0.13","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","9.10","1.47","1.20","5.49","0.94","0.54","5.35","4.82","0.13","11.91","1.34","7.23","3.48","3.75","0.00","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","14.46","4.55","4.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.01","2.41","0.94","0.00","0.13","3766","8.4","26.928571428571427","1168","732","33","48.94","13.7","11.9","13.69","14.8","170","7.25","20.169617486338797","363","24.18","12","0.43","0","20","20","84","0","98","60","4","2","11","124","59","1","58","0","0","24","1","28","4","0","2","17","0","26","32","13","26","10","22","2","4","0","1"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/2013/0716/Why-black-voters-are-backing-Anthony-Weiner-in-N.Y.-mayor-race","Why black voters are backing Anthony Weiner in N.Y. mayor race","Disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner is suddenly leading in New York's mayoral race, thanks largely to support from the city's black voters. One reason: He's speaking to their concerns.

New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner (D) smiles after sharing a megaphone as he greeted parade goers during the National Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York last month.

During a summer season of politics charged with issues of race, it has been black voters in New York who have helped propel the political redemption of former Congressman Anthony Weiner.

The once Twitter-happy candidate, who resigned his House seat in 2011 after sexting disclosures, has surged to the top of the polls in the race for mayor, and he leads the current crowd with 25 percent of Democratic primary voters, according to this week’s Quinnipiac University poll. Former front-runner, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, is second with 23 percent, and last election's runner-up, former Comptroller William Thompson, is a distant third with 11 percent.

Congressman Weiner's lead is greatest among black voters – 31 percent say they prefer him, more than Speaker Quinn and Comptroller Thompson combined. And since Weiner is slightly trailing Quinn among white and Hispanic voters, according to the poll, it appears his strong support among blacks – who also have the lowest number of undecideds – is giving him his current lead.

This comes as a surprise to many, especially since Thompson, who is black, came close to unseating Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the last election, carrying more than 3 of 4 black voters in 2009.

So why do so many now seem to be gravitating toward a man who had to resign his congressional seat after sending lewd pictures of himself to a host of young women and then lying about it?

Of course, the campaigns are quick to point out that it is early in the electoral season. And getting relevant samples of racial and ethnic minorities is notoriously difficult in these kinds of polls. But significant factors are contributing to the strong black support for Weiner, especially the simple fact that he is addressing the issues important to them in ways the other candidates are not.

""Willie Thompson has been almost subterranean in terms of outreach into the African-American community, in terms of speaking out on the issues of concern to them,"" says Randolph McLaughlin, a professor at Pace Law School in New York and an attorney specializing in voting rights. ""And one of the main issues, certainly, of concern to African-American voters is the question of stop-and-frisk"" – a policy that allows cops to frisk people for weapons if they feel the person presents a threat is about to commit a serious crime.

Thompson ""has been silent, if not apologetic, for the policies of the Bloomberg administration on that score,"" says Professor McLaughlin.

Quinn, too, has not spoken out aggressively for the issues important to black voters. She has built a reputation as an outspoken advocate of gay marriage – a cause black voters are less likely to support, according to many polls. And both she and Thompson have more moderate, centrist styles, short on the outrage that many black voters are looking for in elected officials – an outrage that Weiner, a master of the fiery quip, is able to express more freely. At a black church in Staten Island this past Sunday, for example, Weiner compared stop-and-frisk to 1938 Nazi Germany.

""Because of his problems, Weiner has zero institutional support, so he can kind of say whatever he wants,"" says Evan Thies, founder of Brooklyn Strategies and a longtime political consultant in New York City. ""Meanwhile Christine Quinn, for all her virtues, has become a very institutional candidate, because of the broad institutional support she has, and that limits her ability to take a harsher tone, and she has to be more nuanced, and that is limiting her in her ability to match his level of anger about these issues important to African-Americans.""

Thompson, too, has emphasized his qualifications and experience, and has avoided taking controversial stands.

""He's not making headlines. He's a mild-mannered, soft spoken David Dinkins type,"" says McLaughlin. ""He's no firebrand. And again, if you look at media coverage, you will see that William Thompson isn't getting that much press, and frankly, unless his picture is in the paper, folks wouldn’t even necessarily know if he was black, if that's an issue for them.""

But Weiner's quest for political redemption may be helped, too, by what some have called a strong culture of faith and forgiveness among black voters, especially. From former Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry to President Bill Clinton, black voters have many times given overwhelming support to candidates mired in personal scandal.

""In politics in New York, you can see how closely likely Democratic voters in black communities are tied to their faith communities – and how the two correlate very highly,"" says Mr. Thies. ""Veterans of campaigns like myself who have been in these churches during campaign season – you can really see that culture of forgiveness, that culture of understanding, in a way that you often don't see in much more cynical parts of the city.""

Of course, as in any political contest, name recognition is essential – call it the celebrity factor – and the sex scandals of Weiner and former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer have dominated the headlines. In fact, both candidates easily have the highest name recognition in their races, and this typically correlates with higher polling numbers.

""It’s like he's the Kim Kardashian of politics right now,” says McLaughlin. ""Now Mr. Weiner, well, he's been a little more outspoken, and until Eliot Spitzer stepped into the race, Weiner was, like, everywhere. You couldn't spit on the sidewalk without Weiner doing something – he was omnipresent. And with that kind of media frenzy, everybody knows his name. But whether that will translate into votes in September in the black community, that’s another question.""","2013-07-16 19:18:00","0","58.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","185.0","76.0","0.0","380.0","0.0","37.0","9","993","87.74","77.49","10.57","44.18","25.46","25.18","76.54","45.22","9.06","4.83","0.10","0.00","0.60","3.32","0.81","4.23","6.45","15.51","7.65","3.12","5.34","1.01","12.29","6.34","3.22","1.21","1.61","2.62","4.93","2.92","1.91","0.30","1.01","0.40","10.17","0.20","0.00","0.91","2.62","8.36","1.71","1.61","1.01","2.11","1.31","2.11","4.43","2.52","1.51","0.30","0.50","0.10","0.00","0.30","0.10","7.75","1.11","1.31","4.73","0.50","0.81","2.32","9.67","0.50","13.90","1.11","7.45","5.34","3.42","0.50","0.10","0.10","0.40","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.10","0.00","18.03","4.23","8.16","0.10","0.00","0.10","0.00","1.11","2.22","1.91","0.20","0.00","4853","8.19","26.0","1494","994","40","54.66","13.0","11.8","12.65","15.1","209","8.5","20.37046277665996","464","23.33","3","0.45","0","32","13","83","0","141","108","9","4","6","124","118","2","72","0","0","38","16","43","2","0","4","29","0","19","13","26","20","28","50","4","7","0","3"

Saxby Chambliss (R) of Georgia waits to speak with reporters on Capitol Hill on Nov. 16, 2012. On Jan. 25, he announced that he will not seek a third term, citing 'frustration' with Washington gridlock.

[Updated May 21, 2014, 5:00 p.m. EDT]

Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R) of Georgia, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced that he will not seek a third term on Jan. 25, citing ""frustration"" with Washington gridlock.

Tea party activists in Georgia and beyond had been spoiling for a chance to knock out Senator Chambliss, who is best known for his efforts to work across the aisle with Democrats to find middle ground on issues like curbing deficits and debt. Only 38 percent of likely voters in the GOP primary backed Chambliss, compared with 43 percent who favored a more conservative, unnamed candidate, according to a December poll, although in a hypothetical head-to-head race in which both candidates were named, Chambliss defeated all likely GOP rivals.

""Many people in the tea party movement here in Georgia felt Chambliss was tired and unwilling to fight the difficult battles to control government spending in Washington without increasing our nation’s tax burden,"" said Tea Party Express chairman Amy Kremer in a statement after Chambliss announced his decision not to run for reelection.

But the two leading tea party candidates, US Reps. Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey, both known for provocative statements, fell short in Georgia's May 20 Republican primary. Businessman David Perdue and Rep. Jack Kingston (R) of Georgia, both viewed as establishment Republicans, finished No. 1 and No. 2 and will face each other in a July 22 runoff. Mr. Perdue, the former CEO of Dollar General, won 30.6 percent of the vote; 11-term Congressman Kingston, known for his work on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, finished at 25.8 percent.

The GOP outcome marked a setback for Democrats, who had speculated that the crowded Republican primary would produce a candidate so far to the right as to be unacceptable to general election voters. With Chambliss out of the race, Georgia had been viewed as the No. 1 prospect for a Democratic takeover in the 2014 Senate campaign cycle. The demographics of the state are shifting, with more black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters in the electorate and likely to support Democrats.

As expected, Democrats rallied behind Michelle Nunn, daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn (D), a popular centrist and, until his vote against the Gulf War, a likely presidential contender. Ms. Nunn, a former CEO of President George H. W. Bush's Points of Light Foundation, is new to politics but recent polls had her either tied with or leading potential GOP opponents.","2013-02-08 18:09:00","1","47.0","20.0","4.0","0.0","40.0","0.0","173.0","62.0","0.0","335.0","0.0","35.0","9","455","98.14","57.84","14.78","29.44","16.25","27.91","66.81","37.36","3.96","2.20","0.00","0.44","0.00","1.76","0.00","1.76","7.47","16.70","3.96","1.10","4.84","1.54","7.91","6.15","4.40","0.88","4.84","2.86","4.18","2.20","1.98","0.00","1.10","0.00","5.49","0.22","0.00","0.44","1.54","8.13","1.98","1.10","0.44","2.20","0.22","2.42","1.10","0.44","0.44","0.22","1.98","0.66","0.22","0.00","1.10","7.69","1.32","2.42","4.84","0.44","0.44","5.05","2.42","1.76","12.53","1.32","7.69","3.52","4.40","1.10","0.22","1.10","0.00","0.22","0.88","0.00","0.66","0.00","0.22","0.00","19.56","6.81","7.47","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.66","0.88","1.10","1.76","0.44","2193","8.18","27.058823529411764","680","450","24","60.85","12.2","9.4","12.36","12.0","103","7.0","18.675555555555558","261","24.65","14","0.37","0","14","22","41","0","64","32","1","0","4","60","95","5","20","0","0","3","6","10","2","1","1","14","0","13","21","9","12","1","5","1","3","0","0"

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2013/0829/Obama-s-path-to-Syria-strike-suddenly-littered-with-speed-bumps","Obama's path to Syria strike suddenly littered with speed bumps","At home and abroad, obstacles to a US strike against Syria have suddenly emerged. Obama is providing members of Congress with evidence of Syrian chemical weapons attacks.

The White House in Washington is seen through a keyhole in the fence, Thursday, Aug. 29, as President Obama continues to decide on a response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The White House planned to hold a conference call with congressional leaders late Thursday afternoon to lay out the evidence that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad carried out the Aug. 21 attacks that international relief organizations say killed hundreds of Syrian civilians.

A sudden series of obstacles, including mounting congressional resistance and speed bumps overseas, have dramatically slowed the path the US was taking toward carrying out airstrikes in Syria over the use of chemical weapons there.

As recently as Wednesday President Obama said he had “concluded” that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had conducted large-scale chemical weapons attacks, and had to be held “accountable.” It now seems he must either wait for international partners to join the US, which could effectively put off punitive attacks for more than a week, or decide the US will “go it alone” and commence retaliatory measures without allied participation.

The White House planned to hold a conference call with congressional leaders late Thursday afternoon to lay out the evidence that Mr. Assad carried out the Aug. 21 attacks that international relief organizations say killed hundreds of Syrian civilians. That evidence will be made public “by the end of the week,” according to White House officials.

But a growing roster of members of Congress is saying that a US military response requires more than a conference call with congressional leaders.

House Speaker John Boehner suggested after a phone call with Mr. Obama Thursday that many of the “concerns” he laid out in the conversation were not addressed and that the case for military strikes would require more time for explanations from the president.

“Only the president can answer these questions, and it is clear that further dialogue and consultation with Congress, as well as communication with the American public, will be needed,” Mr. Boehner’s spokesman, Brendan Buck, said in a statement.

That domestic resistance was mounting as international complications increased – starting with British Prime Minister David Cameron’s inability to win quick approval Thursday from Parliament for military action.

Obama has said ever since he began discussing the possibility of US military action against Syrian targets over the Aug. 21 chemical attacks that any US action would be conducted in conjunction with international partners. But on Thursday the White House began publicly outlining the “national security interests” in play in Syria that would justify the US taking action without participation of other countries, should the president decide to do so.

Obama will make a decision on Syria “with our national security interests front and center,” White House deputy spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Thursday afternoon. Those interests threatened by Syria’s using chemical weapons range from its location “in a very volatile region of the world” to the fact that it borders Turkey, a NATO ally; Jordan, a close US partner, and Israel, “a country we’ve vowed to protect.”

Mr. Earnest made special note that the British foreign minister, William Hague, noted in comments Thursday that the Americans “will be able to make their own decisions” concerning Syria action. Strong international condemnation of the Assad regime, including from the Arab League, further buttresses the case for holding Assad accountable, the White House added.

Most regional and military analysts still expect Obama to wait for international partners to join any effort so that he – and more broadly, the US – won’t be accused of “going it alone” if the US once again takes military action against a Middle Eastern country. But some also note that the “compressed timeframe” for punitive action against Assad that Obama laid out in a recent CNN interview could also prompt the president to act, perhaps within a few days, with something less than a robust coalition.

Among the other complications that appear to be slowing US military action:

• United Nations chemical weapons inspectors are not expected to finish their work and leave Syria until Saturday. The US was unlikely to take action, perhaps by pounding Syrian military installation with cruise missiles, while the team is on the ground, regional experts say. And some countries that might have joined a “coalition of the willing” are calling for the UN team to first deliver its report to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the Security Council.

• The British Parliament will continue its debate on Syria next week, and even then a once-certain partner in any military action may not be ready to take action.

• The Arab League on Tuesday blamed Assad for the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attacks, but at the same time declined to support any retaliatory military action. That measured stance was less than the Obama administration hoped for and suggests the US would not enjoy the kind of regional support it had for intervention in Libya in 2011 for action against Syria.

• Obama is scheduled to head to Russia next week for a G20 summit in St. Petersburg Sept. 5-6. The president would prefer not to be firing Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syrian targets while sitting down with world leaders – including Russian President Vladimir Putin – most foreign policy analysts say.

On the other hand, waiting until after the G20 summit, and into mid-September, would give Assad ample time to move what military assets he can and to brace for an attack, military experts say.

And then later in September comes the UN General Assembly session, where Obama will speak before leaders of the world. As some international affairs analysts note, Obama is unlikely to relish speaking to the world body as the US bombs an Arab country, even if it is Assad’s Syria.","2013-08-29 18:16:00","1","61.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","44.0","0.0","194.0","77.0","0.0","393.0","0.0","37.0","9","984","96.70","73.23","45.52","22.62","25.23","29.07","80.59","42.28","6.61","2.54","0.00","1.73","0.00","0.61","0.20","4.07","8.84","15.85","5.69","1.83","4.47","0.81","11.99","5.59","3.15","0.30","1.32","2.03","4.37","2.03","2.24","0.10","1.93","0.20","8.03","0.00","0.61","0.00","0.61","9.96","2.34","1.22","1.73","2.64","0.51","2.74","2.64","1.02","1.52","0.10","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.48","3.46","1.42","6.30","0.81","0.51","3.15","6.20","1.52","17.58","2.95","8.13","6.71","4.88","0.61","1.02","0.30","0.20","0.20","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.00","13.52","4.37","4.27","0.10","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.81","2.85","0.61","0.00","0.41","4965","8.11","31.967741935483872","1562","986","40","46.4","14.2","12.9","13.23","15.4","203","6.666666666666667","20.115294117647057","419","29.06","22","0.4","0","24","8","97","0","130","84","5","2","21","134","145","1","62","0","0","14","6","42","2","0","9","32","0","50","34","25","18","17","20","7","1","0","1"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2013/1217/Did-US-mistreat-Indian-diplomat-Her-country-is-furious","Did US mistreat Indian diplomat? Her country is furious.","The US promised Tuesday to look into the arrest, on visa fraud charges, of India's deputy consul-general in New York, but the indignation and retaliation has yet to abate.

A police officer stops a group of Indians protesting against the arrest of Devyani Khobragade, an Indian consular officer in New York, outside the US consulate in Hyderabad, India, Dec. 16. Khobragade was arrested in New York on charges she submitted false documents to get a work visa for a babysitter and housekeeper in her Manhattan home.

Recent cases of gang rapes of women in India, the impunity that the perpetrators of those crimes can often count on, and the low status of women in India in general have all commanded widespread attention in the United States – much to the chagrin of many Indian officials and media pundits.

But now the case of a female Indian diplomat arrested in New York City on visa fraud charges has allowed a furious Indian government and indignant domestic media an opening to turn the tables on the US – although in the process creating a diplomatic row that on Tuesday continued to escalate.

At issue is the arrest last week of the deputy consul-general of India’s New York consulate. Devyani Khobragade is accused of making false statements on the visa application of an Indian national she brought to the US to work as household help – and of paying the employee less than the US minimum wage.

The diplomat, arrested and handcuffed as she dropped her daughter off at school, was later released on $250,000 bond – but not before she was strip-searched and held with hardened criminals, according to her lawyer.

India’s national security adviser, Shivshankar Menon, blasted the diplomat’s treatment as “despicable and barbaric” – words that seemed to echo the terms that many in the US used to describe the official treatment afforded India’s gang-rape victims. Not to be outdone, India’s external affairs minister, Salman Khurshid, described Ms. Khobragade’s treatment as “a form of indignity (that) is for us completely unacceptable.”

The Indian government presented a formal complaint to the US ambassador in New Delhi.

The US initially downplayed the incident, with State Department officials insisting that standard procedures were followed in the course of the arrest, and countering India’s claim that Khobragade should have been shielded by diplomatic immunity with the argument that such immunity extends only to official duties.

But as the row showed no signs of abating Tuesday – Indian authorities were demanding that US consular officials in India relinquish their identity cards, and some high-level Indian officials, including the leaders of India’s two major political parties, canceled scheduled meetings with a visiting US congressional delegation – the State Department shifted its tone.

“We understand that this is a sensitive issue for many in India. Accordingly, we are looking into the intake procedures surrounding this arrest to ensure that all appropriate procedures were followed and every opportunity for courtesy was extended,” said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf in a statement.

Calling the arrest an “isolated episode” that does not reflect “the close and mutually respectful ties” that the US and India share, she said the two countries would “continue to work this issue … in the spirit of partnership and cooperation that marks our broad bilateral relationship.”

Rhetoric – not to mention actions – in India have not yet shifted to repair mode, however. On Tuesday the Indian police used tow trucks and backhoes to remove the security barriers protecting the US Embassy compound in New Delhi. Indian police said the removal had to do with traffic-flow improvement, but Indian media reported anonymous government sources citing the barrier removal as part of a list of retaliatory measures.

In the same vein, some officials said the government would investigate the pay and working conditions of Indians working for US diplomats.

But the heated reporting and official indignation also seemed to reveal something about the status of women in India. TV journalists made a beeline to Khobragade’s father to get on camera his view of his daughter’s treatment.

And Narendra Modi, leader of the opposition Bharativa Janata Party who would become India’s next prime minister should the opposition win national elections next year, sounded a bit old school when he proudly tweeted out having stood up the visiting US congressional delegation.

“Refused to meet the visiting USA delegation,” he wrote, “in solidarity with our nation, protesting ill-treatment meted (out) to our lady diplomat in USA.”","2013-12-17 18:44:00","1","57.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","43.0","0.0","186.0","76.0","0.0","388.0","0.0","37.0","9","744","97.59","83.34","13.50","28.01","29.76","30.51","73.25","42.47","7.26","4.44","0.00","2.69","0.00","1.61","0.13","2.82","9.95","15.59","4.03","1.48","4.70","0.81","8.74","4.57","1.61","0.27","0.67","1.75","3.09","1.61","1.48","0.00","0.81","0.27","9.81","0.40","0.40","2.02","0.67","6.18","1.34","0.94","0.67","0.81","0.67","2.02","1.61","0.81","0.81","0.00","0.81","0.13","0.40","0.27","0.00","12.63","4.30","1.75","6.45","0.54","0.54","3.63","3.90","0.00","13.31","1.61","7.53","4.17","6.45","0.54","0.40","1.08","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.58","3.63","4.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.94","2.15","1.61","0.54","0.13","3784","9.24","34.36363636363637","1228","746","25","41.23","17.0","14.9","13.82","18.3","195","12.125","24.375764075067025","370","29.5","18","0.4","0","25","5","83","1","98","69","1","0","6","138","87","3","48","0","0","11","9","19","0","0","4","25","0","25","36","22","18","5","12","4","1","0","1"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2013/0507/US-South-Korea-put-up-a-tough-front-but-it-doesn-t-close-door-to-North","US, South Korea put up a tough front, but it doesn't close door to North","South Korean President Park, in the US to meet with Obama, has made it clear that she sees her toughness as part of a “trust politik” that would allow for renewed dialogue with the North.

President Barack Obama and South Korean President Park Geun-Hye meet in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, May 7.

North Korea is in a “provocation pause,” the Pentagon said Tuesday, but that is not stopping the United States and South Korea from displaying a united front toward the North’s belligerence and growing nuclear threat.

It just may be, however, that the goal of the tough unity – on display at the White House Tuesday as President Obama greeted South Korean President Park Geun-hye – is to pave the way to renewed dialogue between the two Koreas at some point down the road.

At a White House press conference Mr. Obama said Pyongyang had “failed again” with its recent nuclear provocations to split the US and South Korea – two countries celebrating 60 years of alliance with President Park’s visit – and that the North can no longer scare the region and the world into bowing to its demands.

“The days when North Korea could create a crisis and elicit concessions, those days are over,” Obama said.

For her part, Park set the tone for the first foreign trip of her presidency with pre-departure vows of swift and more-than-commensurate military response to any North Korean attack.

But Park, who took office in February just two weeks after the North’s third nuclear test, has also made it clear that she sees her toughness as part of a “trust politik” that would allow for renewed dialogue with the North.

Yet a key ingredient of her approach toward the North is her ability to demonstrate a solid US-South Korea alliance, regional experts say – a factor that explains the tone of the Park-Obama summit Tuesday.

Part of Park’s “trust politik” is also to convince the US it can trust her to reengage with Pyongyang when (and if) the opportunity arises.

“What this summit is really about is building a relationship,” says Victor Cha, a former director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council and now the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington.

Even before Park arrived, the White House set out to underscore to North Korea and the world that the two allies stand united in their approach to the North’s provocations.

“In dealing with North Korea, it’s vital we show unity,” Obama’s senior director for Asian affairs, Daniel Russel, said Monday. He said it remains too early to tell if Pyongyang really is pulling back on its provocative actions or is simply “zigzagging.”

He said the US and South Korea agree on a policy of “incremental engagement” with North Korea, but it’s one that can only advance if the North undertakes concrete and permanent steps to dismantle its nuclear program.

The hard part for the US and South Korea won’t be in the outward display of unity, some regional experts say. The “tougher discussion behind the scenes” will be how to balance the dual-track approach to North Korea of keeping up the pressure “coupled with maintaining an opening for dialogue,” says Michael Green, a former senior director for Asia on the National Security Council and now senior vice president for Asia at CSIS. “There really is no elegant solution.”

A key problem for the united approach to the North is the growing likelihood that Pyongyang is less and less interested in provoking the world in search of concessions, and increasingly set on establishing itself as a nuclear power.

The North’s nuclear and missile tests “are not primarily statements,” Mr. Green says, “but they are technological tests” aimed at cementing North Korea’s nuclear progress. His colleague Mr. Cha agrees. “The primary driver is weapons development,” he says.

Still, Green says he sees advantages in having South Korea “take the lead” with North Korea right now. Among them, he says, is that this would “reinforce that South Korea is not the puppet of the US,” as the North Korean regime regularly trumpets.

Both Park and Obama aim to demonstrate with this visit that relations between the two countries are about much more than just North Korea. Asia’s economic vitality and the year-old US-South Korea free trade accord are certain to be highlighted as Park hosts a huge dinner in Washington Tuesday night and then addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday.

The US-South Korea FTA, however, may not be getting the unanimous applause Park might have anticipated. Critics of the trade pact say its early implementation has actually led to a drop in US exports to South Korea, although other trade experts say one year is hardly enough time to judge the agreement.

With the US currently negotiating a broader US-Asia trade pact, the Trans Pacific Partnership, those critics say it’s not too soon to worry that an unimpressive launch of the US-South Korea accord could be a bad sign for a larger Pacific-rim trade pact.","2013-05-07 19:46:00","1","63.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","198.0","78.0","0.0","384.0","0.0","37.0","9","857","92.60","73.57","37.07","45.04","29.55","20.77","78.76","45.39","8.05","3.73","0.00","1.63","0.00","1.75","0.35","4.32","10.04","13.65","5.83","3.85","5.25","0.93","9.92","5.25","2.45","0.58","1.28","1.63","3.50","2.22","1.17","0.47","0.35","0.12","8.40","0.00","0.23","1.05","0.70","7.00","0.58","1.63","1.05","1.52","0.35","2.80","4.20","1.98","1.98","0.23","0.35","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.12","10.15","2.92","1.63","4.08","1.40","1.40","1.63","7.58","1.05","18.44","2.33","11.20","5.02","4.55","0.12","0.47","0.82","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.00","15.99","3.73","4.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.63","4.20","1.52","0.47","0.00","4003","8.18","32.22222222222222","1255","848","31","52.12","13.6","12.8","11.67","15.5","171","11.0","21.02603773584906","366","28.04","17","0.42","0","28","9","97","0","102","74","5","0","12","114","159","2","31","0","0","19","14","39","2","0","3","23","0","29","16","18","12","15","36","5","2","0","3"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2013/0108/Ohio-rape-case-Evidence-on-social-media-creates-new-world-for-justice","Ohio rape case: Evidence on social media creates new world for justice","Investigators in the Ohio rape case confiscated electronic devices from those involved. Evidence from social media allows jurors to rely more on common sense and less on expert testimony.

Activists from the online groups KnightSec and Anonymous protest at the Jefferson County Courthouse in Steubenville, Ohio, on Jan. 5. Anonymous activists publicized a social media video showing students joking about the rape.

Young people’s use of social media and mobile technologies to document every facet and event in their lives, including violent and criminal behavior, has drawn national attention to the investigation into an alleged rape of a teenage girl in Ohio.

Not only are the social media being used in support of the pending legal arguments for both the alleged victim and the defendants, but this case and others are creating the potential for a whole new courtroom dynamic between the prosecution, defense, and jury.

Ma’lik Richmond and Trent Mays, two high school football players in Steubenville, Ohio, are charged with raping a 16-year-old girl at two separate parties in August. The names of both suspects, who are juveniles, are being used because a court judge, defense attorneys, and local media made their names public.

The state attorney general’s office, which is handling the case, says both boys participated in raping the girl, who remains unnamed because she is a victim, while she was unconscious. Mr. Mays is also charged with the “illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material.”

Two days after the alleged attacks was reported to law enforcement, local police confiscated about a dozen electronic devices belonging to all of the individuals involved. The devices were then turned over to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, which reviewed tens of thousands of e-mails, texts, and photos. Mays and Mr. Richmond were arrested three days later. They are currently under house arrest.

Prosecutors say a photo taken at the party shows both boys holding the alleged victim by her arms and legs, suggesting her unconscious state. Defense attorneys deny she was unconscious, and claim to have a text message from the girl sent to their client that says, “I know you didn’t rape me.”

Also circulating are text messages posted to some social networks that reference that the rape happened, while the New York Times reports that a second photo snapped by a mobile phone shows the girl naked on a floor. Adding to the digital evidence is a video published online by Anonymous, the international hacker activist group, showing a group of students joking about the assault.

“Is it really rape because you don’t know if she wanted to or not? … She might have wanted to. That might have been her final wish,” one teenager is shown saying, according to CNN.

Local police say they are also tracking a possible video that is purported to show both boys participating in the violent attack.

The role social media plays in violent crimes is a relatively recent phenomenon dating back to the popularity of so-called “flash mobs,” which are public events involving group action that are planned and then executed using social media.

In some high-profile cases, the flash mobs have been used by gangs of youths to carry out the group beatings of strangers. On Sunday, a flash mob was blamed for a riot that broke out in Baton Rouge, La., where 200 teenagers engaged in a fight, causing the mall to be evacuated.

Law enforcement is also increasingly perusing social media sites to learn more about gang activity and get a better sense of when retaliation among certain groups will strike. For example, last year, police departments in Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia announced units to investigate social media behavior among gang factions, which often use mobile technology to plan, and later brag about, violent acts related to turf battles.

In Chicago, the strategy was used to investigate Keith Cozart, a rap star known as Chief Keef, who bragged on Twitter after a rival was gunned down in September. Mr. Cozart was also known for YouTube clips in which he mocked the slain victim.

Another local rapper named Lil Reese, whose real name is Tavares Taylor, came under scrutiny in October following the release of an online video to multiple hip-hop sites that show him severely beating an unidentified woman at a party. He was not charged because the woman could not be identified.

Paul Levinson, who teaches communications and media studies at Fordham University in the Bronx, says the motivation to document violence is “old-fashioned bragging.”

“When your morality is so degraded that you do these thing in the first place, whether it’s beating somebody up or, even worse, raping someone, the appeal for some people is, as a part of that process, to proclaim to the world you did that and have documentation,” Mr. Levinson says.

He cautions against blaming the technology itself, but says that the rapid ease of taking videos and interacting with others is merely enabling certain people to capitalize on their darker predispositions.

“What that suggests is there are some people who unfortunately have violent tendencies, but, to them, it seems a good thing and so that’s why there’s almost this compulsion to make a recording of it to get it out,” he adds.

Indeed, the rise in school bullying has also been attributed to the increased proliferation of social media. According to a report published by the Pew Internet & American Life Project in November 2011, 88 percent of teenagers using social networks have witnessed others being mean and cruel on social network sites. The incidents can then lead to physical altercations.

In the Ohio case, no physical evidence of the alleged rape exists, which means the looming court battle, scheduled for Feb. 13, will focus strictly on the interpretation of the media evidence.

The dynamic is creating a “whole new world” in the criminal justice system, says Lisa Smith, an attorney who specializes in domestic violence cases and who teaches law at Brooklyn Law School. Unlike traditional cases involving DNA, or other science-based evidence, where one side might rely on the testimony of a medical professional to guide the jury through their interpretation of a certain theory, cases involving text messages, mobile videos, and Facebook and Twitter postings as evidence hang on the direct values and behaviors of the jurors themselves.

“The average juror has no way to know which cardiologist is telling the truth,” she says. “But when it comes to Facebook and photos and text messages, they are going to use their own common sense and make judgments based on their own personal experience.”

Today investigators are trained to immediately seek out any digital evidence left behind on phones, tablets, and personal computers, and attorneys are now prepared to argue cases based on the interpretation of those messages and images, Ms. Smith says. What can be recovered can be conversations related to the planning of the crime, the post-discussion of the crime, or video or photo evidence of the crime itself.

Why this is an emerging trend has to do with the relative age of those involved: usually those of the Millennial generation or younger who have grown up with digital media and are conditioned to record and transmit most aspects of their lives – even if those details are criminal.

“In almost every case I’ve seen in the last year involving young people, there’s been some kind of documentation of the incident,” Smith says.

“This is what they do all day long and it doesn’t make any difference with the substance of they’re documenting,” she adds. “There is no thought process. You have to think of it as automatic, regardless of what they document, as it is to breathe. There is no judgment.”","2013-01-08 21:00:00","0","68.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","41.0","0.0","197.0","76.0","0.0","380.0","0.0","37.0","9","1298","90.01","82.64","21.07","5.78","24.49","24.19","80.28","45.07","8.01","3.00","0.23","0.00","0.46","1.16","1.16","5.01","8.47","13.94","7.24","3.00","5.86","0.85","12.56","3.78","1.46","2.16","1.23","2.77","4.93","1.46","3.31","0.00","2.16","0.08","12.10","0.08","0.23","1.39","0.69","9.63","2.54","2.39","0.54","2.31","0.69","2.08","3.08","1.62","1.16","0.00","1.77","0.46","0.54","0.92","0.00","8.78","3.00","1.00","3.78","0.69","0.46","3.00","8.47","1.16","13.02","1.54","7.24","4.08","3.16","1.69","0.15","0.46","0.15","0.08","0.31","0.00","0.23","0.08","0.00","0.00","15.25","4.55","6.78","0.08","0.00","0.08","0.00","0.77","2.00","0.92","0.00","0.08","6298","8.42","27.872340425531913","1980","1290","54","55.68","13.4","11.4","12.48","14.4","294","8.8","20.676279069767443","595","24.55","4","0.44","0","47","12","144","0","145","99","5","1","9","208","88","0","108","0","0","39","12","39","1","0","8","44","0","40","28","46","54","40","57","11","12","1","7"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2013/0625/Supreme-Court-voids-key-portion-of-Voting-Rights-Act-as-outdated","Supreme Court voids key portion of Voting Rights Act as outdated","Obama 'deeply disappointed' by the 5-4 Supreme Court ruling on the landmark civil rights legislation. Justice Ginsburg, in dissent, decries 'hubris' in 'demolition' of the Voting Rights Act.

US Attorney General Eric Holder speaks about the Supreme Court's ruling on Tuesday that struck down part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act designed to protect minority voters, at the Justice Department in Washington, June 25. Under the invalidated provision, Holder's Justice Department reviewed proposed changes to election laws in states and localities with a history of discrimination.

The US Supreme Court struck down a central portion of the Voting Rights Act Tuesday, ruling that Congress overstepped its authority when it reauthorized the landmark civil rights law in 2006 for an additional 25 years.

The majority justices said lawmakers relied on outdated criteria tied to historic civil rights abuses in the 1960s and 1970s rather than conditions as they exist today in the US.

In a 5-to-4 decision, the high court said Congress had failed to demonstrate that current conditions justify the extraordinary remedy under the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of forcing certain state and local governments to obtain pre-approval from Washington before implementing any changes to their election procedures.

The court said Congress must demonstrate that the law’s requirements are necessary to address problems that exist right now, not problems that existed 40 years ago.

“Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion.

In a dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the majority decision “can hardly be described as an exemplar of restrained and moderate decisionmaking.”

“Quite the opposite,” Justice Ginsburg said. “Hubris is a fit word for today’s demolition of the VRA.”

In a statement from the White House, President Obama said he was “deeply disappointed” by the court’s action.

“Today’s decision invalidating one of its [the VRA’s] core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent,” he said.

Tom Perriello of the Center for American Progress said the court had ignored the reality of discrimination in the country.

“The majority overruled a bipartisan commitment to liberty and provided indefensible cover to partisan efforts across the country to rig elections,” Mr. Perriello said in a statement.

Others praised the opinion. “Today’s decision brings the Voting Rights Act into the 21st Century,” said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network.

“It is absurd to use limited federal dollars scrutinizing minor changes to voting procedures in Alaska when we could be prosecuting actual instances of voter discrimination and intimidation,” she said.

The Voting Rights Act has been called the most successful civil rights law in US history and the crown jewel of the civil rights movement. But jurisdictions long subject to its provisions complained that they were being unfairly singled out based on an outdated formula fashioned by Congress nearly a half-century ago when racial discrimination in voting was entrenched and pervasive in certain parts of the country.

The court was asked to strike down two sections of the VRA. The first was Section 5, which requires jurisdictions with a history of discrimination in voting to obtain pre-approval from Washington before enacting any changes to voting procedures.

The justices were also asked to examine Section 4 of the statute. That is the formula Congress devised in the 1960s and 1970s to determine which states and other jurisdictions would be subject to the requirements of Section 5.

In its decision, the high court struck down the Section 4 coverage formula as out of touch with current conditions, but left Section 5 and the rest of the VRA intact.

“We issue no holding on [Section 5] itself, only on the coverage formula,” Chief Justice Roberts said.

“Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions,” he said. “Such a formula is an initial prerequisite to a determination that exceptional conditions still exist justifying such an extraordinary departure from the traditional course of relations between the States and the Federal Government.”

The decision split the court into familiar conservative-liberal camps. Joining the chief justice on the conservative side were Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito.

In dissent on the liberal side with Justice Ginsburg were Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan;

Beyond the disagreement over whether to invalidate Section 4, the two camps divided sharply over the underlying theme of federalism and whether Congress could justify treating certain states differently based on evidence from the 1960s and 1970s.

“Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically,” Roberts wrote.

“In the covered jurisdictions voter turnout and registration rates now approach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels,” he said.

The chief justice added: “The tests and devices that blocked access to the ballot have been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years.”

Ginsburg countered in her dissent that Congress took improvements into account. “True, conditions in the South have impressively improved since passage of the Voting Rights Act. Congress noted this improvement and found that the VRA was the driving force behind it,” she wrote.

“But Congress also found that voting discrimination had evolved into subtler second-generation barriers, and that eliminating preclearance would risk loss of the gains that have been made,” Ginsburg said.

The opinion marks the second time in four years the high court has agreed to examine the constitutionality of Sections 4 and 5 of the VRA.

Four years ago, in 2009, the court stopped short of invalidating the measures. But the justices made clear in an 8 to 1 decision that the VRA contained constitutional deficiencies that Congress should address.

No legislative action was taken.

Justice Ginsburg said that Congress compiled significant evidence that the VRA’s preclearance requirements were necessary. “The Court should have left the matter where it belongs: in Congress’ bailiwick,” she said.

“Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet,” she wrote.

The decision stems from a lawsuit filed on behalf of Shelby County, Alabama, challenging the constitutionality of Sections 4 and 5.

At issue in the case, Shelby County v. Holder (12-96), was whether Congress was justified in reauthorizing preclearance procedure for another 25 years – until the year 2031.

The preclearance procedure dates from the VRA’s passage in 1965. Congress continued to rely on the same triggering criteria to determine which jurisdictions would be covered by the act. The law has been reauthorized four times since 1965 – in 1970, 1975, 1982, and 2006.

The 2006 reauthorization featured near-unanimous support with the Senate voting 98 to 0 and the House approving it by a vote of 390 to 33). The measure was signed into law by President George W. Bush.

Until Tuesday, nine states were fully covered by Section 5 of the VRA: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The provision also applied to counties and smaller jurisdictions in six other states: California, Florida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Dakota.

The decision to strike down Section 4 does not end legal protections under the VRA for minority and other voters.

Section 2 of the act remains fully intact. That section authorizes enforcement actions by individuals and/or the federal government to counter discriminatory tactics designed to undercut the right to vote.

The main difference between Section 5 and Section 2 is that Section 5 worked proactively, requiring covered jurisdictions to prove they were NOT discriminating before being allowed to make any changes to the election process. In contrast, Section 2 is largely reactive, authorizing enforcement only after an alleged violation has taken place.

The majority opinion issues a strong invitation to Congress to rewrite the coverage formula in a way that justifies the federal government dividing the sovereign states and treating them differently.

But some analysts doubt whether such an effort could survive the legislative process.

Roberts noted that the court invited Congress to rewrite the coverage formula in its 2009 decision.

“Congress could have updated its coverage formula at that time, but did not do so,” he said.

“Its failure to act leaves us today with no choice but to declare [Section 4] unconstitutional. The formula in that section can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance.”","2013-06-25 14:35:00","0","87.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","182.0","76.0","0.0","382.0","0.0","37.0","9","1438","97.35","57.45","30.92","34.20","20.54","32.41","69.68","40.75","5.49","1.74","0.00","0.56","0.14","0.70","0.35","3.76","9.94","14.33","5.15","2.02","4.31","0.63","10.43","2.29","1.11","0.90","4.24","2.29","2.99","1.74","1.25","0.21","0.21","0.35","3.76","0.00","0.00","0.35","0.35","8.76","2.16","2.16","1.04","1.18","0.97","1.95","1.74","0.14","1.39","0.21","0.07","0.00","0.00","0.07","0.00","9.60","0.90","1.67","6.12","0.76","0.90","4.94","4.24","0.07","15.65","1.25","10.01","4.38","4.38","0.07","0.28","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.07","0.00","15.79","4.94","4.80","0.28","0.07","0.00","0.00","0.76","2.92","1.18","0.35","0.49","7529","8.24","22.625","2334","1428","70","50.77","13.9","11.2","14.62","14.7","325","10.9","19.263641456582633","589","20.89","18","0.39","0","42","61","156","0","177","99","1","0","14","205","188","1","101","4","2","25","11","41","0","1","6","47","0","47","77","33","44","19","30","10","0","0","6"

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected in a landslide in November 2013, primarily because he was the only outspoken opponent of the New York Police Department’s controversial ""stop and frisk"" program.

During the campaign, a federal judge ruled the NYPD’s version of the policing tactic to be unconstitutional, illegally targeting minorities and crossing the line into illegal searches.

Since then, William Bratton, a pioneer of the tactic, has returned for a second act as New York’s police commissioner, revising the ""stop and frisk"" policies of America's largest police force and reducing its use dramatically.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0102/Fiscal-cliff-deal-Will-the-Tea-Party-find-renewed-strength","'Fiscal cliff' deal: Will the Tea Party find renewed strength?","Some, including members of the Tea Party, are dissatisfied with the recently agreed upon deal relating to the fiscal cliff. Tea Party groups are looking toward the next election in hopes of replacing less conservative Republican members of Congress with Tea Party candidates.

Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., left, walks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell from Kentucky, to the Senate floor for a vote on the fiscal cliff, on Capitol Hill Tuesday in Washington.

The U.S. Congress prevented hefty tax hikes and spending cuts with a ""fiscal cliff"" deal this week, but grassroots conservatives are already seeking 2014 primary challengers for high-profile Republican lawmakers who backed the deal.

Few challengers have yet come forward. But fiscally conservative activists irate at Republicans who voted to raise some taxes without cutting spending are casting about for opponents to Republicans including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and senators Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.

""Many people here have watched Mitch McConnell's voting record and are dissatisfied with what they've seen,"" said Eric Wilson, executive director of the Kentucky 9/12 project, a Tea Party group in McConnell's home state. ""There are some potential candidates working in the background and doing the right thing"" including visiting Kentucky's conservatives to gauge support.

Wilson declined to divulge names, citing McConnell's fundraising prowess that allowed him to amass almost $19 million for his 2008 re-election bid. McConnell could not be reach for comment.

""Anyone who sticks their neck out now will get their head cut off,"" he added. ""But there are definitely people here with real potential.""

In the 2010 midterm elections the Tea Party movement took the Republican ""establishment"" by surprise with high-profile primary victories over more conventional candidates and brought a wave of freshmen to the House of Representatives.

But despite successes in the primaries in 2012, most notably the defeat of Indiana's six-term Republican Senator Dick Lugar by state treasurer Richard Mourdock, conservative candidates fared poorly in the general election.

Tea Party supporters claim 2014 should be different as lower turnout in midterm years allows fiscal conservatives to punch above their weight.

""Presidential politics in 2012 sucked oxygen out of the conversation in local races,"" said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, which coordinates with Tea Party groups around the country. ""So to us, 2014 looks more like 2010.""

After some disastrous showings by Tea Party candidates, most notably Christine O'Donnell in Delaware in 2010 who ended up running a television ad denying she was a witch, conservatives are on the lookout for credible candidates who can run effective campaigns and raise sufficient funds for a general election.

It is reasonable to expect challenges to some Republicans from the right in 2014, said James Henson, a politics professor at the University of Texas in Austin.

""Whether they use the name Tea Party or not is irrelevant,"" he said. ""The DNA of their movement has now been spliced into the DNA of the Republican Party.""

'In major trouble'

Previous battles in Congress have been marked by Tea Party activists around the country bombarding their elected representatives, mostly Republicans, calling on them to hold the conservative line.

Many did not bother ahead of the fiscal cliff deal, a bipartisan agreement to raise tax rates on incomes of more than $450,000 per household.

""We knew the Republican leadership would cave in,"" said Debbie Dooley, a coordinator at national umbrella group Tea Party Patriots and a founder of the Atlanta Tea Party. ""So we didn't expend a lot of energy on this issue.""

Instead, Dooley said activists in her home state of Georgia are focused on educating voters about America's spiraling debt and seeking a replacement for Saxby Chambliss, who was forced into a runoff election in 2008 and only narrowly managed to return to the Senate.

No one has announced a challenge to Chambliss, but Georgia representatives Tom Price and Paul Broun are seen as potential candidates. Chambliss could not be reached for comment.

""If a credible candidate comes forward, then Saxby Chambliss is in major trouble,"" Dooley said.

In South Carolina, Joe Dugan of the Myrtle Beach Tea Party said there are credible alternatives to Senator Lindsey Graham, including three representatives elected in 2010 who have been reliably conservative on most issues.

""I am over 90 percent certain that if there is a reliably conservative candidate in 2014 he will have my total support,"" against Senator Graham, Dugan said.

Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity which has backing from the billionaire oil and gas brothers Charles and David Koch, said it is too early to say whether the group will get involved in primary challenges in 2014.

But the group, which raised $140 million in 2012 compared to $51 million in 2011, will focus on educating voters in 2013 on how their representatives voted on the fiscal cliff and the upcoming U.S. debt limit debate.

""We aim to hold elected officials accountable,"" he said. ""Lawmakers will not be judged solely on how they voted on the fiscal cliff, but it is a big vote to get wrong.""

Some conservative activists admit they face a steep climb at best if they want to unseat their local Republican representative. The West Chester Tea Party in House Speaker John Boehner's district in southwestern Ohio, for instance, has begun looking for a challenger to him even though he amassed nearly $22 million for his 2012 re-election bid.

""We've been getting emails from around the district and around the country asking if this is the best we can do for a representative,"" West Chester Tea Party member Ann Becker said. ""That's not an easy question to answer.""

""It will be a David-versus-Goliath battle if we do find somebody, but nothing is impossible,"" she added.

Unlike Indiana's Dick Lugar, who refused to recant on key votes that angered Tea Party activists, Utah Senator Orrin Hatch tacked rightward to defeat a primary challenge in 2012.

The University of Texas' Henson said that in the months to come the behavior of Republican lawmakers who voted for the fiscal cliff may show how seriously they take the threat of primary challenges next year.

""We will have to see what kind of compensatory behavior we see from Republicans,"" Henson said. ""I suspect we will see more conservative Republicans try to make up for the fiscal cliff by trying to revert to form on other issues.""","2013-01-02 20:39:00","0","71.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","41.0","0.0","207.0","75.0","0.0","375.0","0.0","37.0","9","1076","95.55","73.94","12.60","66.24","23.91","27.14","71.19","41.36","6.41","3.62","0.28","0.93","0.00","1.12","1.30","2.79","6.88","16.36","5.95","2.88","3.72","0.93","11.80","3.07","1.77","1.77","3.35","2.60","5.48","3.81","1.67","0.09","0.56","0.09","10.13","0.09","0.00","0.37","0.93","7.90","0.84","0.93","1.21","2.79","0.37","3.16","2.60","0.93","1.49","0.09","2.23","0.65","0.00","0.19","1.58","11.62","3.53","2.51","5.02","1.30","0.46","3.90","6.04","1.49","12.17","1.77","8.55","2.23","3.53","1.95","0.46","1.30","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.28","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.36","4.65","5.02","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.74","3.90","1.49","0.00","0.56","5381","8.13","24.795454545454547","1649","1066","46","56.39","13.5","11.2","13.58","15.0","226","10.3","19.76030018761726","492","23.0","10","0.4","0","24","35","84","1","147","77","3","4","15","132","170","9","66","0","0","32","11","34","3","1","3","32","0","40","42","27","26","32","18","5","11","0","3"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0104/New-Congress-to-vote-on-superstorm-Sandy-aid","New Congress to vote on superstorm Sandy aid","The new Congress is expected to vote on Friday for relief for the many home and business owners devastated by superstorm Sandy.

An unsafe for human occupancy sticker is attached to a home that was severely damaged two months ago by superstorm Sandy in Bay Head, N.J., Thursday. Congress will vote Friday on aid to help home and business owners with recovery from superstorm Sandy.

At last, the storm-racked Northeast is getting a House floor vote on billions in disaster relief aid for victims of October's Superstorm Sandy, but only after a host of East Coast Republican lawmakers threatened a near mutiny against GOP Speaker John Boehner.

A $9.7 billion measure to pay flood insurance claims, which amounts to just a down payment on a multibillion aid commitment, is expected to be approved by the House on Friday, boosting prospects for relief for the many home and business owners devastated by the storm. If the House acts as expected, the Senate plans to follow with a likely uncontested vote later in the day.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency warns that the National Flood Insurance Program will run out of money next week if Congress doesn't provide additional borrowing authority to pay out claims. Congress created the FEMA-run program in 1968 because few private insurers cover flood damage.

The flood insurance measure is the first phase of a proposed Sandy aid package. Under Boehner's new schedule, the House will vote Jan. 15 on an additional $51 billion in recovery money. Senate action on that measure is expected the following week. Fiscally pressured local governments are awaiting that money.

Northeast lawmakers say the money is urgently needed for storm victims awaiting claim checks from the late October storm, which was one of the worst ever to strike the Northeast, ravaging the coast from North Carolina to Maine, with the most severe flooding occurring in Atlantic City, N.J., New York City and Long Island and along the Connecticut coastline.

""People are waiting to be paid,"" said Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J., whose district includes Atlantic City and many other coastal communities hard hit by the storm. ""They're sleeping in rented rooms on cots somewhere and they're not happy. They want to get their lives back on track and it's cold outside. They see no prospect of relief.""

Boehner had promised a House vote on Friday after his decision to delay an action on a broader Sandy relief package provoked outrage from Northeast Republicans, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who said he'd lost trust in GOP leaders in Congress after being promised a vote earlier this week.

About 140,000 Sandy-related flood insurance claims have been filed, FEMA officials said, and most have yet to be closed out. Many flood victims have only received partial payments on their claims.

Philip Rock has received $8,000 in flood insurance payments so far but said he is awaiting a statement on the final amount, which he expects to be much more. A house he owns in Toms River, N.J., had a $220,000 flood insurance policy. The house, which he rents out, was destroyed, and he needs to know the final payout before he can demolish it.

The house is a ""total loss,"" Rock said. ""We don't want to demolish the house and have them say, 'We have to go around and take more pictures.'""

New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were the states hardest hit by the storm in terms of damage from high winds, flooding and storm surges. The storm damaged or destroyed more than 72,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey. In New York, 305,000 housing units were damaged or destroyed and more than 265,000 businesses were affected.

Speaking of the legislation pending Friday, Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., whose district includes Staten Island, said, ""This funding will give the city and state the much-needed resources to rebuild our damaged infrastructure and provide further aid to individuals and small businesses struggling to pick up the pieces of their lives.""

Sandy was the most costly natural disaster since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and was blamed for at least 120 deaths. Northeast lawmakers have complained that it took just 10 days for Congress to approve about $50 billion in aid for Katrina but that it hasn't provided aid for Sandy relief in more than two months.

""States and local communities need to know the money will be there before they can give a green light to start rebuilding,"" said LoBiondo.

More than $2 billion in federal money has been spent so far on relief efforts for 11 states and the District of Columbia struck by the storm.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0318/Stop-and-frisk-trial-What-s-next-for-the-controversial-tactic","Stop-and-frisk trial: What's next for the controversial tactic?","The stop-and-frisk tactic under fire in New York City has already survived a constitutionality challenge, but could face reform from the current class action suit charging that stop-and-frisk is disproportionately used against minorities.

Protesters rally near the federal courthouse in New York, Monday, March 18. Many of the 5 million New Yorkers stopped, questioned, and sometimes frisked by police in the past decade were wrongly targeted because of their race, say plaintiffs in this class-action suit targeting the stop-and-frisk tactic.

Many of the tens of thousands of New Yorkers stopped, questioned and sometimes frisked by police in the past decade were wrongly targeted because of their race, lawyers for four men who claim they were illegally stopped said Monday.

But New York Police Department lawyers countered that officers must go where the crime is — and the crime is overwhelmingly in minority neighborhoods.

A civil trial that began Monday in federal court in Manhattan will examine the police tactic that has become a city flashpoint, with mass demonstrations, City Council hearings and mayoral candidates calling for change. The lawsuit, now a class-action, seeks a court-appointed monitor to oversee changes to how the police make stops.

The courtroom and overflow rooms were packed Monday, and stop-and-frisk opponents held an afternoon rally outside the courthouse. The Rev. Jesse Jackson watched the opening statements, telling reporters outside court afterward: ""I heard rationalization and justification rather than explanation from the city. They were not denying. They were justifying.""

The trial is expected to last more than a month.

The mayor and police commissioner say stop-and-frisk is a life-saving, crime-stopping tool that has helped drive crime down to record lows.

But Darius Charney, the lawyer for the four men who filed the suit in 2008, said the department is doing stops illegally and must make adjustments. He called many of the stops a ""frightening and degrading experience"" for ""thousands if not millions"" of New Yorkers.

Charney, of the Center for Constitutional Rights, called the stops ""arbitrary, unnecessary and unconstitutional,"" and promised that plaintiffs will show the judge ""powerful testimonial and statistical evidence"" that New Yorkers are routinely stopped without suspicion.

Police have made about five million stops in the past decade, of mostly black and Hispanic men. Two witnesses testified Monday, out of a dozen who say they were targeted because of their race.

One, Devin Almonor, the 16-year-old son of a police officer, said he was thrown against an unmarked car and handcuffed when he was 13 on his way home. The other, David Floyd, testified that he was wrongly stopped twice. Both said they were testifying because they didn't want the same injustice to happen to other people. Floyd, 33, is now a medical school student.

City lawyers sought to discredit the witnesses by suggesting their stories had evolved over the years to become more dramatic.

Officers and criminologists who have studied the statistics on street stops are also slated to testify, and lawyers plan to play hours of audio tapes made by Adrian Schoolcraft, an officer who was hauled off to a psych ward against his will after he said he refused to fill illegal quotas.

U.S. District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who has said in earlier rulings that she is deeply concerned about stop and frisk, is not being asked to ban the tactic, since it has been found to be legal. But she does have the power to order reforms, which could mean major changes to the nation's largest police force and other departments.

City lawyers said Monday the department already has many checks and balances, including an independent watchdog group that was recently given authority to prosecute some excessive force complaints against police. Officers have more than 23 million contacts with the public, make 4 million radio runs and issue more than 500,000 summonses every year. Comparatively, 600,000 stops annually are not unreasonable, city attorneys said.

""The New York Police Department is fully committed to policing within the boundaries of the law,"" said Heidi Grossman, an attorney for the city. ""Crime is not distributed evenly across the city.""

The city lawyers said the expert testimony was flawed and evidence would show a correlation between the description of suspects and those stopped.

""Police are given an awesome responsibility, one of which is to bring crime down and keep people safe,"" Grossman said.

Street stops have risen dramatically since the 1990s while overall crime dropped in a city that once had the highest murder rate in the nation. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly say the stops are a deterrent that led to lower crime.

The city recorded 419 murders in 2012, down from more than 2,000 in the 1990s and the lowest since similar record-keeping began in the 1960s.

More than 531,000 people were stopped last year, more than five times the number when Bloomberg took office a decade ago. Fifty-one percent of those stopped were black, 32 percent Hispanic and 11 percent white. According to census figures, the city has 8.2 million people: 26 percent are black, 28 percent are Hispanic and 44 percent are white.

About half the people who are stopped are subject only to questioning. Others have their bag or backpack searched. And sometimes police conduct a full pat-down. Only 10 percent of all stops result in arrest, and a weapon is recovered a small fraction of the time.

Recent polls show a stark divide over how blacks and whites view the tactic, while among Hispanics, disapproval of the practice has grown.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0312/Colorado-and-Minnesota-lawmakers-approve-unions-for-gay-couples","Colorado and Minnesota lawmakers approve unions for gay couples","Historic votes in Colorado and Minnesota approved civil unions and marriages, respectively, for same-sex couples.

Dr. Paul Melchert, left, gets interrupted by his son, Emmett, at a news conference Feb. 27, in St. Paul, Minn. Behind him, his partner James Zimerman holds Emmett's twin brother, Gabriel. Minnesota lawmakers passed a bill today to legalize gay marriage. A few states to the south, Colorado lawmakers passed a bill to allow civil unions for same-sex couples.

On the same day that the Minnesota House and Senate both passed gay marriage bills along strict party-line votes, Colorado lawmakers took a historic vote to approve civil unions for gay couples. For Colorado legislators, this highlighted a dramatic shift in the political landscape of a state where voters banned same-sex marriage just six years ago.

In both states, the bills will go to the desks of Democratic governors: John Hickenlooper in Colorado and Mark Dayton in Minnesota.

Applause erupted in the Colorado Capitol as the bill won final passage on a 39-26 House vote, with two Republicans joining all Democrats to approve the measure. Several dozen people watching from the House gallery left smiling and hugging, and some wiped away tears of joy.

Once the measure is signed, Colorado will join eight states that have civil unions or similar laws. Nine states and the District of Columbia allow gay marriage now, but that number will rise to ten states when Gov. Dayton signs the Minnesota measure, as he has said he will do.

""This is the best step toward equality Colorado could take right now. I'm thankful we got it done,"" said Katy Jensen, a 34-year-old Denver engineer who plans a civil union with her partner after the bill becomes law on May 1.

Last year, Colorado's Democratic Sen. Jessie Ulibarri, a gay lawmaker serving his first term, was among those in the House gallery with his children, watching as Republicans used their one-vote majority in the House to prevent the measure from being debated in the waning hours of the session, thus killing the bill.

""I sat with my kids at midnight, wondering what was going to happen the next time we had a tragedy. What would happen if I had to take my kids to the ER and then I was questioned whether or not I was really their dad,"" said Ulibarri, one of eight gay Democratic lawmakers serving in the Colorado Legislature.

Civil unions for gay couples became a rallying cry for Democrats who took control of the Colorado House in last year's elections, and they vowed an early vote on the proposal.

""Elections have consequences,"" said Republican Rep. Frank McNulty, the former House speaker.

Democrats now control both chambers of the legislature, and the party elected Colorado's first gay House speaker, Mark Ferrandino.

""The people spoke in November, and we are fulfilling a promise we made at the end of last session,"" Ferrandino said Tuesday.

The vote marks a dramatic political shift in Colorado, a western state with deep conservative roots that has become more moderate over the past decade. In 1992, Colorado voters approved a ban on municipal antidiscrimination laws to protect gays. Four years later, the U.S. Supreme Court said the law, known as Amendment 2, was unconstitutional, but not before some branded Colorado a ""hate state.""

And in 2006, voters approved a gay-marriage ban — meaning civil unions are the only option for gay couples in the state for now. That could change with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage bans in the coming months. The court will hear argument on the bans on March 26 and 27, and is expected to issue a ruling by June.

""We truly do stand on the edge of history. For some in this chamber, this is the reason that we are here, at this time, and in this place,"" said Colorado's Democratic Rep. Pete Lee. He called the vote a time for redemption.

""We vote today to redeem our friends, our aunts, our uncles, our brothers, our sisters, our children, and I daresay, our colleagues, from the scourge of discrimination and inequality,"" he said.

Colorado's measure grants gay couples rights similar to marriage, including enhanced inheritance and parental rights. People in civil unions also would have the ability to make medical decisions for their partners.

Republicans opposed the bill, saying they would've liked to see religious exemptions to provide legal protections for those opposed to civil unions.

""I have long-standing concerns about the way in which religion isn't tolerated by some down here at the state Capitol,"" McNulty said. ""I continue to have those concerns.""

Democrats contend the Republican suggestions to amend the bill would have opened the door to discrimination. Under the bill, churches are not required to perform civil unions, but Republicans wanted broader protections to include businesses and adoption agencies.

Republicans also argued civil unions were too similar to marriage, and that they would undermine the institution of marriage.

""Civil unions are not marriage. They are something that are separate, and distinct, and lesser, and unequal,"" Democratic Sen. Pat Steadman said. ""And that really is not good enough. We passed this bill because this is the best we can do.""

When asked, five of the eight gay Democratic lawmakers said after the vote that they would get civil unions. It was a difficult question for Steadman, whose longtime partner, Dave Misner, died of cancer last year.

""Some of us don't get that opportunity,"" Steadman said.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0215/Why-Mayor-Bloomberg-opposes-legalizing-marijuana","Why Mayor Bloomberg opposes legalizing marijuana","Starting next month, people in New York City who get picked up on charges of having a small amount of marijuana will be released with appearance tickets. But Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he opposes legalization of marijuana.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg delivers his annual State Of The City address in Brooklyn, N.Y. On Friday, Bloomberg talked about why he opposes full legalization of marijuana.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he opposes legalizing marijuana — or any other illicit drug.

Bloomberg discussed the issue on his weekly WOR Radio show Friday. A day earlier, he said New York City plans to stop booking and arraigning many people arrested on low-level marijuana-possession charges.

Bloomberg says he opposes legalizing marijuana because it's stronger than it used to be. He added that if marijuana were legal, those dealers would just start selling something else, like cocaine.

He says the policy change that takes place next month will ease congestion in courts and jails.

Starting next month, people who get picked up on charges of having a small amount of marijuana will be released with appearance tickets if they have identification and no open warrants, Bloomberg said Thursday, spotlighting the issue in his State of the City address amid debate over the tens of thousands of such arrests in the city each year.

Now, many of those arrested are booked and remain in custody until they go before a judge, a process that can take 24 to 36 hours. An appearance ticket, by contrast, means a person is freed until a future court date.

""It's the right thing to do, and it will allow us to target police resources where they're needed most,"" Bloomberg said, adding that he continues to back a push to change New York state laws surrounding marijuana possession.

The change comes after several years of back-and-forth between the city and advocates for less punitive drug policies over the growing number of low-level marijuana arrests in the city in the past decade.

The announcement also comes amid what many observers see as a nationwide trend toward legalizing recreational marijuana use. In November, voters in Washington and Colorado approved decriminalizing and regulating possession of small amounts.

New York state has complicated laws surrounding small amounts of pot. Possession of less than 25 grams, or about 7/8 of an ounce, of the drug is a non-criminal violation and generates a ticket, not an arrest — unless it's ""open to public view."" Then it's a low-level misdemeanor and spurs an arrest.

That misdemeanor has been the most common arrest charge in the city for much of the past decade. More than 50,000 people were arrested on it in 2011 and 2010; figures for 2012 weren't immediately available Thursday.

Critics have said police manipulate people into getting arrested by telling them to empty their pockets or bags, and then arresting them when they pull out marijuana that's then publicly visible. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has said he didn't believe many arrests were made that way, but he sent around a memo in September 2011 reminding officers they couldn't do that.

Critics hailed the Bloomberg's announcement Thursday as a good step, while saying more needed to be done.

""With this new policy change, tens of thousands of people, mostly young men of color, will no longer be held in jail overnight for possessing small amounts of marijuana. But the arrests themselves need to end — period,"" said Gabriel Sayegh, the New York state director for the Drug Policy Alliance, a group critical of the national war on drugs.

Bloomberg said he would continue to back Gov. Andrew Cuomo's efforts to make possession of up to 25 grams of marijuana a violation even if it's in public view, though not if someone is publicly smoking it.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0320/Colorado-Shooting-death-precedes-governor-s-gun-law-signing","Colorado: Shooting death precedes governor's gun law signing","The morning after the head of Colorado's Department of Corrections was shot to death at his home, the governor signed new gun control bills into law. Police have not yet identified any suspects in the crime, which does not appear to have been a break-in, robbery, or random act.

Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper speaks at a news conference on Wednesday about the shooting death of Tom Clements, the director of the Department of Corrections. Police are searching for the gunman and trying to figure out if the attack had anything to do with his position.

The head of Colorado's prison system was shot to death as he answered the doorbell at his home in what police said may have been a targeted slaying linked to his high-profile position.

The shooting on Tuesday night punctuated an intense debate on gun control in Colorado, coming just hours before the state's Democratic governor signed into law new firearms-control measures spurred by a rash of deadly mass shootings in the state and elsewhere.

Police said Tom Clements, 58, appointed two years ago as executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections, was shot at his home in a secluded wooded area near the town of Monument, 45 miles (72 km) south of Denver.

The killing did not appear to be linked to any break-in or robbery attempt, and did not appear to be a random act of violence, said El Paso County Sheriff's Department Lieutenant Jeff Kramer.

""We are sensitive to the high-profile position in which Mr. Clements served and the fact there could be people who would target him based on his position,"" Kramer said in a statement on Wednesday.

Clements also spent 31 years in the Missouri Department of Corrections, where he became the No. 2 official.

Kramer said that according to a 911 emergency call for help received shortly before 9 p.m. local time, Clements was shot after answering the doorbell. He was found dead by sheriff's deputies arriving on the scene.

His home sits on a street that is ""not a major thoroughfare,"" Kramer said. ""There's no reason to turn off onto that road unless you had business there.""

Officials began a search for Clements' assailant on Tuesday night, but no suspects had been pinpointed, Kramer said.

He said police were investigating the sighting of what was described as an unoccupied, ""boxy"" two-door sedan idling near the house about 15 minutes before the first 911 call. The same car was reported seen a short time later traveling from the scene with a lone, unidentified occupant, he said.

Police were also looking for a woman, between ages 35 and 50, who may have been ""speed-walking"" on Clements' street about the time of the shooting and was considered a potential witness, Kramer said.

He said some neighbors told police they heard what might have been gunshots in the area at the time.

Governor signs gun laws

At a news conference on Wednesday, Governor John Hickenlooper, visibly shaken by news of the shooting, praised Clements as a ""great friend to me"" and a dedicated administrator.

At a previously scheduled event later on Wednesday, Hickenlooper signed legislation to extend background checks on gun buyers to private firearms sales. The prospective buyers would pay for the checks. He also signed legislation limiting the size of ammunition magazines that may be sold in the state.

The measures were introduced in the Democratic-controlled state Legislature earlier this year and swiftly passed, moving Colorado to the forefront of a national debate over gun violence, which was reignited by several mass shootings in 2012. They included massacres of school children in Newtown, Connecticut, and moviegoers in suburban Denver.

A previous loophole in Colorado law that exempted firearms sales at gun shows from background checks was closed after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado where two students fatally shot a teacher and 12 students before committing suicide.

Columbine had stood as the deadliest U.S. public school shooting on record until 20 first-graders and six adults were slain by a gunman last December at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

Five months before the Sandy Hook killings, a gunman opened fire during a midnight screening of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in the Denver suburb of Aurora, killing 12 people and wounding 58 others.

Hickenlooper was joined at the bill-signing by sponsors of the measures and relatives of victims of gun violence. One of them, Sandy Phillips, whose daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was killed in Aurora, told the governor, ""You've given us a real gift today, adding, ""Thank you so much.

A proposed national assault weapons ban backed by President Barack Obama ran into trouble on Tuesday when U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid acknowledged there was not enough support for it.

"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0903/Judge-orders-new-hearing-in-30-days-for-rape-case","Judge orders new hearing in 30-days-for-rape case","A Montana judge, under fire sentencing a former teacher to 30 days for raping a 14-year-old who the judge said was 'older than her chronological age,' has ordered a new sentencing hearing.

Stacey Rambold reacts to sentencing by Judge G. Todd Baugh in Billings, Mont., on Aug. 26. Rambold received a sentence of 15 years in prison, with all but 31 days suspended, for raping a 14-year-old student.

A Montana judge under fire for his comments about a 14-year-old victim in a schoolhouse rape case has ordered a new sentencing hearing for the former teacher who originally received just 30 days in prison for the crime.

In setting the hearing for Friday afternoon, District Judge G. Todd Baugh said Tuesday that state law appears to require a two-year mandatory minimum prison term for Stacey Rambold, 54, of Billings.

Rambold last week was sentenced to 15 years with all but 31 days suspended and a one-day credit given for time-served. He began serving his month-long term last week at the state prison in Deer Lodge.

""In the Court's opinion, imposing a sentence which suspends more than the mandatory minimum would be an illegal sentence,"" Baugh wrote.

But in a strange twist, Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito said Baugh may lack authority to impose a longer sentence at this point. That's because state law says an illegal sentence must be handled through the appeal process.

The judge has faced widespread condemnation from women's rights activists, elected officials, and others for the light sentence and for saying Rambold's 14-year-old victim, Cherise Moralez, was ""older than her chronological age"" and asserting that she had some control over her months-long relationship with Rambold.

The judge later apologized for his comments, although activists who have called for him to resign said an apology is not enough.

Moralez killed herself before Rambold's case came to trial. That left prosecutors without their main witness and led them to strike a deal with Rambold that allowed him to avoid prison until he violated the terms of his court-ordered release.

Court records show the sentence Baugh handed down was in line with what Rambold had requested.

Prosecutors, who had sought 20 years prison with 10 years suspended, already were considering an appeal, citing the two-year minimum requirement.

Twito said he planned to be in Baugh's courtroom Friday but was unsure how the hearing might play out given that state law says illegal sentences must be addressed through an appeal.

""I've done this a long time and I'm in an area I have not been in before,"" said Twito, now in his 16th year as a prosecutor.

If his reading of the law stands up, that could give the defendant the advantage in Friday's hearing.

Twito said members of his office, along with Rambold's defense attorney, Jay Lansing, met informally with Baugh last week to discuss the case.

Baugh said in Tuesday's order that the defendant's presentencing memorandum claimed the minimum mandatory for sexual intercourse without consent was 30 days, and the state did not object until after the sentence was handed down.

Lansing could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday.

Twito said his office will continue to pursue a possible appeal if the sentence remains unchanged. A final decision would be made in conjunction with the appellate division of the Montana attorney general's office.

Hundreds of protesters rallied outside the Yellowstone County Court House last week to call for Baugh's resignation. News of Friday's hearing in the case did little to sway those critics.

""The judge cannot take back the words he said when he blamed the victim. As far as we're concerned, Judge Baugh has lost the trust of this community,"" said Eran Thompson with Not in Our Town, a Billings group that promotes diversity and works against hate crimes.

The 71-year-old judge was first elected to the bench in 1984 and has been re-elected every six years since without an opponent. He's up for re-election in 2014.

Baugh said in response to the criticism that Rambold's sentence was based on the defendant's violation of an earlier deal he made with prosecutors, rather than the original crime. He also claimed that his remarks about Moralez were ""irrelevant"" and did not factor into his sentence.","2013-09-03 22:59:00","0","63.0","24.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","181.0","76.0","0.0","383.0","0.0","37.0","9","725","95.90","70.48","24.33","2.94","20.71","24.97","72.97","42.76","7.45","4.41","0.41","0.28","0.00","3.45","0.28","3.03","9.10","15.45","6.62","1.66","3.59","1.38","12.28","3.31","2.48","1.10","3.31","0.83","4.00","0.69","3.17","0.28","1.24","0.41","10.21","0.00","0.00","0.83","2.76","7.72","0.41","1.66","1.38","1.24","0.69","3.31","3.86","0.55","3.03","0.28","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.55","0.00","9.10","0.97","0.97","6.07","0.41","1.10","6.76","4.41","0.41","17.52","0.83","6.76","10.21","2.21","0.14","0.14","0.55","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.14","4.97","4.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.62","1.38","2.90","0.00","0.00","3446","7.89","23.25","1008","706","34","67.28","11.4","9.0","12.36","13.0","144","10.1","18.478640226628894","332","21.81","8","0.42","0","14","23","74","1","98","45","4","0","9","144","79","0","31","0","0","17","15","20","1","0","6","16","0","24","53","12","24","6","16","5","5","0","2"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0106/Chris-Christie-Political-calculator-Or-just-doing-his-job","Chris Christie: Political calculator? Or just doing his job?","New Jersey governor, and possible GOP presidential contender Chris Christie has landed in the spotlight time and again for his take-charge attitude, and his willingness to say what's on his mind. The governor says he's not trying to be political.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie poses for a photo in his office at the Statehouse in Trenton, N.J. Jan. 4. The first-term Republican has earned nearly universal praise for his handling of Superstorm Sandy, the state's worst natural disaster. But some within his own party called him out for embracing the Democratic president and hurling angry words at a fellow Republican.

In 2010, Gov. Chris Christie underestimated the first major storm of his administration by flying to Disney World hours before snow crippled New Jersey. A year later, he overplayed Tropical Storm Irene with the now-infamous order, ""Get the hell off the beach.""

When Superstorm Sandy set its sights on his state, he had learned his lesson: be more hands on, more empathetic.

""I had a sense from the beginning that this one was going to be really bad,"" Christie, 50, told The Associated Press in an interview last week that reflected on a first term that has now positioned him in the national spotlight and as a potential 2016 presidential contender.

""With Irene, I went back and forth because the forecasts were going back and forth. When the National Weather Service says it's going to be a wipe out of the Shore then they start backing off of that, it's very difficult to set the right tone and, candidly, make the right decisions,"" he said. ""I might have been firmer in Sandy if it hadn't been for the experience of Irene when I got everybody off the beach and nothing really awful happened there.""

Christie, by his own admission, is ""not a subtle personality"" and he likes to take charge. Those two traits figured prominently in how the rising Republican handled Sandy.

From his frequent, televised updates to residents as the storm's winds whipped the state's beaches to his criticism last week of fellow Republican John Boehner's decision to delay a U.S. House vote on federal storm aid, his handling of his native state's worst natural disaster may one day be considered the defining moment in the political career of a budding presidential contender.

The timing of the storm — days before a presidential election — ultimately helped define his role in it as well.

Christie has been viewed as a nonpartisan advocate for federal aid since the storm hit Oct. 29. He embraced President Barack Obama's visit to the Jersey Shore six days before the election, inciting catcalls from conservatives.

And last week he smacked down Boehner for delaying a vote on the $60.4 billion storm aid package. Christie said he tried to call Boehner four times Tuesday, but none of the calls was returned. Christie's office received 800 emails in the hours following the governor's Boehner news conference, mostly positive.

Christie said he was just doing his job.

""It never struck me that what I should do is calibrate my language in order to be more political. My view was the (president) was helping us and I wanted to tell people. He deserved that credit,"" he said. ""With Boehner, I would have reacted differently if the speaker had picked up my phone calls Tuesday night and explained what he was doing. The fact that 66 days had already gone by with no assistance, all that stuff conspired to create the reaction that I gave.""

Christie has received almost universal praise for his handling of the superstorm. A late November Quinnipiac University poll showed 95 percent of those surveyed thought he did an ""excellent"" or ""good"" job managing the storm. The poll also found he'd won over a majority of women and minority voters, two constituencies that had not supported him previously.

People think of Christie as a guy who calls it like he sees it, said political strategist Tom Wilson, former chairman of New Jersey's Republican State Committee.

""He's a Jersey guy,"" Wilson said. ""It's the quality that will carry him through the rest of his political career.""

The governor's popularity surge couldn't have come at a more opportune time. It probably helped convince Newark Mayor Cory Booker not to enter next year's governor's race. So far only one major Democratic candidate, state Sen. Barbara Buono, has stepped up to take on Christie in November.

Even Senate President Stephen Sweeney, the state's most powerful elected Democrat, finds himself agreeing with the governor more often than not.

After Christie tongue-lashed Boehner over Sandy aid, all Sweeney could do was nod.

""I want to thank the governor for listening when I asked him to step up and call on his party's congressional members to get their act together,"" Sweeney said. ""I am glad that the governor has joined me in heaping scorn on those Republican members of Congress who have left New Jersey in dire straits.""","2013-01-06 12:32:00","1","61.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","200.0","77.0","0.0","385.0","0.0","37.0","9","830","85.93","73.05","16.60","45.70","18.04","23.61","77.35","45.42","11.20","7.23","1.93","0.12","0.00","4.94","0.24","3.98","8.19","13.13","6.75","3.37","4.10","1.33","13.98","5.90","2.53","1.20","2.41","1.45","3.49","2.29","1.20","0.00","0.36","0.00","11.08","0.00","0.48","0.12","5.42","7.59","1.93","0.96","0.96","1.81","0.84","1.69","3.37","0.60","1.57","0.84","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.92","0.96","1.81","4.58","1.33","0.72","6.14","6.02","0.96","15.54","1.93","6.02","7.83","5.66","0.72","0.24","0.24","0.12","0.00","0.24","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.00","17.23","5.90","4.46","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","3.13","2.77","0.24","0.12","3922","7.72","20.357142857142858","1198","827","45","69.72","11.9","8.1","11.49","11.1","166","7.166666666666666","17.389020556227326","421","18.9","18","0.45","0","18","17","74","0","90","60","1","2","6","141","108","0","27","1","0","46","23","38","4","1","5","20","0","28","59","20","22","7","22","4","5","0","5"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2013/0915/Cyber-security-The-new-arms-race-for-a-new-front-line","Cyber security: The new arms race for a new front line","The Pentagon – and a growing cyber industrial complex – gears up for the new front line: cyberspace. Cyber defense is necessary. But it could cost us.

Cyber security and the Pentagon bid to lead it, is the topic of the cover story of the Sept. 16 issue of The Christian Science MonitorWeekly.

In the eastern New Jersey suburbs, a train carrying radiological material is barreling toward a small town, and it is up to Pentagon cyber-operators to derail it. The town is the kind of idyllic whistle-stop hamlet where residents socialize at a cafe with complimentary Wi-Fi while surfing FaceSpace, a social networking site.

But danger lurks all around. Terrorists are using the open Wi-Fi connection to hack into the laptop of a patron who works at the hospital down the street. They plan to find the hospital codes stored in his computer to access the mayor's medical records, in which they will change the dosage of a prescription the mayor refills regularly in an effort to poison him.

They have other nefarious future schemes, too: They will cut the power grid with a nasty cybervirus and destroy the local water supply by engineering a program to make it appear as though the reservoir is polluted. When employees dump chemicals into the water to fix the problem, they will inadvertently be doing just what the terrorists want: contaminating the water supply.

This model town – CyberCity – is one of the US military's premier cyberwar simulators. Situated in a surprisingly unassuming suburban enclave, it is built with hobby shop-supplied model trains, miniature cellphone towers, and streetlights – all attached to a miniature power grid.

CyberCity is just a small town compressed onto an 8-by-10-foot plywood table. But its intricate electronic detail highlights the Pentagon's growing effort to expand its offensive cyberwarfare skills in a bid to bolster the nation's cybersecurity, through increasingly sophisticated and aggressive forays that have the potential to revolutionize the way America's military fights wars.

While the military has long fought on land, sea, and air, the emerging cyber-realm is forcing top defense officials to navigate the far less tangible – ever more murky – battlefield of computer attacks.

CyberCity offers some insight into one of the attack scenarios that senior military officials fear most: Bad guys plotting to take down the US power grid or financial networks.

Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta characterized this sort of strike as a ""cyber Pearl Harbor,"" a doomsday sobriquet that has quickly become part of the cyber lexicon. And Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has picked up the banner, warning that a cybersiege could ""paralyze an electric grid, a banking system, knock out computers on ships or weapons systems – and you never fire a shot.""

So the Pentagon is rapidly ramping up to expand its cyberwarfare capacity, bidding to be the go-to authority for the nation's cyberdefense. Cyber-operations is one of its few areas that will see a considerable budget increase – from $3.9 billion this year to $4.7 billion in 2014. And its cadre of cyberwarriors manning computers will expand fivefold over the next two years.

A cyber-industrial complex blooms

Yet with this explosion in US military cyber-operations – and with the corresponding boom in the number of defense contractors to support cyber-activity – comes concern that a rapidly expanding ""cyber-industrial complex"" could jeopardize the openness and democratic ideals of the Internet.

It's a threat that seems more pressing in light of National Security Agency surveillance exposed by former Booz Allen Hamilton contractor Edward Snowden. The operations of the NSA, a US military organization, indicate that some officials want nothing more ""than to identify anyone who connects to the Internet – to get rid of anonymity – so that we can always know who says what to whom,"" argues Jerry Brito, an attorney and senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.

""Sure, that would probably make our networks very secure,"" Mr. Brito adds. ""But that's also called a police state.""

To bolster their case, analysts point to recent revelations that the NSA is secretly paying US companies hundreds of millions of dollars a year for clandestine access to their communications networks.

""It turns surveillance into a revenue stream,"" Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told The Washington Post. ""And that's not the way it's supposed to work.""

While the NSA surveillance is ostensibly to detect foreign agents who might harm the United States in a terrorist plot, there is growing concern that the Pentagon may be laying the groundwork for expanded data collection from US companies under the guise of protecting them from cyberattacks, too.

At a conference in August on the security of the electric grid, for example, former NSA Director Michael Hayden lamented that the Internet ""wasn't built to be protected ... and that remains in the architecture in today's World Wide Web, and that's why we're in the position we're in.""

Mr. Hayden then issued a warning to private companies at risk for hacks and data theft, which some analysts interpreted as a veiled threat: ""So those of you in private industry, I guess the point I really want to make to you is the next sound you hear will not be pounding hoofs as the federal cavalry comes over the nearest ridgeline to your cyber-rescue. You're responsible for your safety.""

Some companies have taken up the challenge and turned it into a lucrative – legally fraught – venture, hiring hackers to probe private networks, then sell the vulnerabilities back to corporate customers.

The well-regarded Mandiant Corporation – which uncovered a series of cyberattacks on US networks by a branch of China's People's Liberation Army – was hired by The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal when they were hacked. And Mandiant's professional hackers consult with a number of Fortune 500 companies at a reported rate of $450 an hour.

Other companies are taking matters into their own hands, raising questions about the legality of private firms striking back against cyberattackers.

Former FBI cyber lawyer Steven Chabinsky argued at a recent cyber symposium that a company attacked should be able to counterattack in order to retrieve data: ""It is universally accepted that in the physical world, you have the right to protect your property without first going to law enforcement.""

This gets messy, of course, and may argue for a more clear role for the US military. Sen. James Inhofe (R) of Oklahoma noted during a recent congressional hearing that financial firms have spent millions of dollars responding to cyberattacks and ""can't be expected to fend off attacks from a foreign government.""

Indeed, responded Gen. Keith Alexander, head of the US Cyber Command: ""I think this gets to the heart of 'how do we defend the country, and when does the Defense Department step in to defend the country?' ""

At the same time, there is reason to question an expanded military role in domestic cybersecurity, says Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. ""These are secret US military agencies that have a tendency to expand their scope of activities,"" Mr. Aftergood adds, ""but never to retreat.""

There is a concern, however, among some companies about being compelled to share data with the government – coupled with a less altruistic disinclination to let it be known when they have been hacked, since it might jeopardize customer confidence.

As a result, there is a push in some corners for establishing cybersecurity-insurance programs to mitigate the cost of fortifying networks in the event of a breach, as well as proposals to establish legislation that treats various sorts of companies and incursions differently.

""If you're an auto parts manufacturer and your data is stolen, that's sort of like if your home got burgled – it's up to you whether you want to tell your friends or not,"" says Brito. ""But if you're a company and you are breached in a way that might put your customers' data at risk, then you should be required to tell someone.""

Pentagon stakes out turf

In the meantime, the US military is for­ging ahead with its own cyberdefense plans. While the Posse Comitatus Act largely bars the US military from getting involved in law enforcement endeavors, a new Department of Defense publication argues that the Pentagon can provide ""law enforcement actions that are performed primarily for a military purpose, even when incidentally assisting civil authorities,"" notes Aftergood.

That includes cyberattacks, under the category of ""complex catastrophe"" – a ""new addition to the DOD lexicon"" introduced in the DOD report, he adds. ""There is some turf-marking that seems to be going on on the part of the Pentagon.""

It's a lexicon that has been embraced, too, by defense contractors eyeing the end of the war in Afghanistan and vying for their next business opportunity. Half of Booz Allen's $5.8 billion annual revenue comes from US military and intelligence agency contracts. Former NSA Director Mike McConnell now heads the company's ""rapidly expanding"" cyber division (earning $2.3 million a year to do so) and has likened cyberattacks to weapons of mass destruction. His division has a $5.6 billion, five-year intelligence analysis contract to protect networks in the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency.

Some analysts worry that the big money involved could encourage fearmongering.

""If you're in the business of selling safeguards against cyberthreats, as many large firms are, you have an incentive to hype the threat,"" Aftergood says. ""I don't want to be overly cynical about this and say that just because there is financial incentive, the threat is bogus, but it is a challenge to sort through the various claims and chart a way forward.""

Industry specialists point out, however, that the business is lucrative because the cost of cybertheft is high and growing. A recent report by the Ponemon Institute, an independent security policy research group, surveyed 56 multinational companies and found the average annual cybertheft losses were $8.9 million per company, up from $8.4 million in 2011. Companies in the study reported a total of 102 successful attacks per week. (By way of comparison, there are more than 15,000 DOD computers in 100 countries, which are probed ""thousands of times a day,"" according to a top Pentagon official who briefed reporters in February. ""And we have not always been successful in stopping intrusions."")

Against this backdrop, plans leaked earlier this year that the US military is quickly working to increase the size of its cyber forces in its premier computer defense arm, US Cyber Command, from 900 to 4,900 during the next two years.

One-third of these will be designated ""national mission forces,"" with special training in protecting critical infrastructure like power plants at national ""cyber ranges"" where they can practice and hone their skills. The group is slated to be ready to be up and working by the end of the month.

One-third more will be ""cyber-protection forces"" to defend the Pentagon's networks, and the final third are designated ""combat mission forces"" responsible for counterattacks and other offensive operations by September 2015.

The unprecedented growth in these forces is ""also a recognition that the problem has become so great that they need to act quickly,"" says Alan Paller, founder of the SANS Institute, a private firm that is one of the premier training organizations for the US Air Force. ""And it's a recognition that in this arena, the skills are the weapon.""

Fine lines between offense and defense

CyberCity, one of a number of Air Force cybertraining ranges, grew out of a request from senior defense officials who wanted to hone the offensive cyberskills of US troops.

""They came to us and said, 'We need you to figure out some way to teach cyberwarriors that cyberattacks have a kinetic effect – that they make stuff move, blow up – and that people can get killed,"" says Ed Skoudis, founder of Counter Hack, the company that designed CyberCity, and a trainer at the SANS Institute.

US military officials asked that the city include a reservoir, as well as a lighted landing strip.

Mr. Skoudis estimates CyberCity missions break down equally into defensive and offensive training.

To illustrate the effect of cyberattack skills, for example, Skoudis has installed a miniature Nerf rocket launcher on the outskirts of CyberCity. When the US military begins to use the cyber-range regularly later this year, the mission for trainees will be to reverse-engineer the controls to the rocket launcher to make sure it fires away from the hospital rather than – as terrorists would have it – toward innocent patients.

""If you can hack a computer and use it to launch a Nerf rocket launcher, you have some interesting skills, no?"" Skoudis says. ""The skills that we're building can be used for offense or defense.""

Cyberwarriors of the future, he points out, will often need to make use of offensive skills to defend US interests – a branch of cyber that the US military has only more recently begun to discuss, and even then in highly general terms, in the hope that mention of it might serve as some deterrent to would-be attackers.

""All the offensive stuff we describe is to take control of things to keep bad things from happening,"" Skoudis notes. ""Of course, you can always use those skills to make bad things happen.""

These are complex talents, and the plan to expand the cyber cadre has quickly raised concerns about how the services will find enough cyberwarriors to do the job – and keep them from decamping for the high-paying private sector firms eager to recruit well-trained specialists with top-secret security clearances.

Maj. Gen. Suzanne ""Zan"" Vautrinot, commander of Air Forces Cyber and of Air Force Network Operations at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, offers a glimpse of the wide scope of Pentagon designs for cybersecurity. She cites congressional figures that indicate the military has 1,000 cyberwarriors who can operate at the highest level. But, she adds, ""what we need is on the order of 20,000 or 30,000.... Cyber is foundational to everything we do, because everything you do in your mission is dependent on it.""

For this reason, the US military's cyber effort is heavily reliant on civilian contractors like Mr. Snowden, along with the National Guard.

""There is a talent search within the existing military forces,"" says Mr. Paller. This involves reaching out to increasingly young prospective cyber prodigies, including high school students, and giving them secret security clearances in order to test the extent of their skills.

At the military's largest cyberwarfare school, the Air Force's 39th Information Operations Squadron at Hurlburt Field, Fla., students conduct real-time operations against cyberattacks on simulators like CyberCity.

The training is increasingly sophisticated, notes Col. John ""Kiley"" Weigle, commander of the squadron, who adds that he would like to see the number of trainers grow: ""I could easily see this all doubling, given the correct instructors, to be much more close to what the nation needs.""

Phishing for generals

As the US military's top flag officers sit down at their office computers each morning to sift through e-mail, their in-boxes routinely hold lures from hackers across the globe in search of an easy mark.

If these would-be infiltrators succeed in getting a general to click on a link embedded in an otherwise innocuous-looking e-mail, it may offer them entry to the DOD's top-secret networks and allow them to troll undetected, potentially exporting valuable data about US defense systems.

One of the more popular – and successful – recent phishing expeditions was an attachment labeled ""I love you.""

""It's the biggest threat right now that the Air Force and others are seeing,"" says Col. David Gibson, head of the computer science department at the Air Force Academy. ""It's 'whale-phishing' – targeting a specific bigwig. In the Air Force, all of the general officers are constantly getting these,"" Gibson says.

Instead of simply remaining on the defense, the Air Force Academy is now teaching its young cadets how to wage offensive cyberwarfare by showing them how to harness some of the most insidious cybertactics used against the military. This starts with learning how to target high-profile people.

""This is a great tool to get to know the leadership in an adversary's country – where are they going to be at a certain time, trying to influence adversarial leadership. There's absolutely a lot of fruit in that sort of endeavor,"" Gibson says.

The incoming cadets get advanced instruction in ""social engineering,"" which involves, among other things, ""learning how to build e-mails to try to fool the recipient into doing something, like clicking on a link."" Such e-mails are ""incredibly sophisticated,"" because of the variety of information now available on social networking sites.

During their social engineering lessons, cadets draw on Facebook, newspapers, and other open sources of information to try to create an e-mail that might convince their targets to open an attachment or link that they shouldn't.

""It's 'how do I trick my classmates, and make this look as legitimate as possible?' "" Gibson says.

Increasingly offensive in nature, this curriculum has sparked concern among some faculty about teaching such skills to cadets.

""I still have some in my department who are really nervous about teaching teenagers that there are tools freely available out there that you can download easily and use to break into other people's computers,"" Gibson acknowledges. ""And they're right to be concerned about this. But I and most of my faculty have become convinced that this is the world we live in: that to be a good defender – which is what we need – you have to know what's coming at you and how.""

To this end, the first classified data that young cadets at the Air Force Academy receive is a briefing about the cyberthreat.

Recruiting hackers from middle school

The military is also reaching out to even younger students through high school talent searches in the form of cybergames like CyberPatriot, a hacking tournament pitting young high school students against industry mentors who play the aggressors in a contest to see who can destroy the other's network first.

""If you compete well,"" Vautrinot says, ""that highlights to the industry, 'Hey, this guy's got game.' ""

Students who have caught the eye of commanders are recruited into an internship program to do temporary stints with the military.

""We gave them clearances and they are actually doing forensics on intrusions into our network,"" says Vautrinot, who likens the process to a coach replaying a game tape for a team after the big game. Sometimes they go on ""hunt missions"" looking for enemy hackers lurking in the systems.

""They can learn, 'How did that work, so I can thwart it the next time?' "" Vautrinot says, extending the sports analogy. ""What does it look like when they move back their arm to throw? So that even before the play sets up, it can be identified and automatically responded to on the network.""

The Air Force is now even reaching down into middle schools to identify prodigies.

Even in such a prioritized field in the US military, however, there are limitations, Weigle says. ""It all costs money, and my needs smack into the fiscal reality. I can sit here as the training commander and say, 'Yes, I need my staff to double.' But at what expense, right? I do have to weigh that.""

Cybertraining will be a ""cradle to grave"" endeavor for the military for the foreseeable future, Vautrinot says.

That said, the vast resources being poured into cyber have some questioning whether it is the best use of increasingly scarce defense dollars.

Senior military officials insist that the cost of cyberattacks to the nation is great. ""We've seen the attacks on Wall Street over the last six months grow significantly – over 140...,"" Alexander told the Senate Armed Services Committee last March.

""You don't see a person on the street walking around without a cellphone or a device. It's become part of our American way of life. And it's also incorporated into our weapons systems to make them more accurate,"" says Col. Jodine Tooke, chief of the Air Force's Cyberspace Force Development Division.

These realms alone ""certainly bear protection from a military perspective,"" she argues. ""There may be industry trying to take advantage of our uncertainty about how best to protect networks, but that's why we're building astute people in the force.""

Yet Alexander acknowledges, too, that the attacks hitting Wall Street, for example, are mainly ""distributed denial-of-service attacks,"" which tend to be ""at the nuisance level.""

The vast majority of cyberthreats to US networks today are intellectual property theft and other forms of corporate espionage, rather than the dire sorts of attacks decried by top US officials.

""Any teenager can do a distributed denial-of-service attack. It's finite; when it's done, there's no permanent damage,"" says George Mason University's Brito. In other words, ""it's very easy, and not very harmful.""

On the other hand, a ""kinetic"" attack, in which a hacker is able to, say, open a dam and flood a community, ""is incredibly difficult – we've never seen it happen.""

Such an attack would be ""incredibly harmful, but if you look at the realm of possibility, really unlikely,"" Brito adds.

""When you hear all the rhetoric from politicians and defense contractors, it's a cyber Pearl Harbor where planes fall out of the sky, trains derail, and thousands are killed – but they provide no evidence to back up serious threats, and a lot of it is easily debunked.

""The lesson,"" he argues, ""is to be more critical.""

A whiff of August 1945

It is, of course, the US military's job to plan for unlikely but highly catastrophic attacks.

That said, even top defense officials acknowledge that a cyber Pearl Harbor is unlikely, and would portend more problems for America than simply cybersecurity.

China is ""without question ... the country that's out there stealing our stuff,"" says retired NSA Director Hayden.

But, he says, ""I find it hard to imagine circumstances where China would do something incredibly destructive to any American network – the grid – absent a far more problematic international environment in which the cyberattack is itself part of a larger package of really, really bad things.""

Still, the US military continues to refine and deploy its own increasingly sophisticated cyberweaponry – including Stuxnet, a cybervirus created to damage Iran's nuclear reactors, a fact that gives some top US officials pause.

Without commenting on the origin of Stuxnet, Hayden says that ""blowing a thousand centrifuges in Natanz [in Iran], I think, is absolutely, unalloyed good,"" the use of cyberweaponry should not be taken lightly.

""Someone, almost certainly a nation-state – during a time of peace – just used a cyberweapon to destroy another nation's critical infrastructure,"" Hayden said. ""That's a big deal.""

""This has the whiff of August 1945. Somebody just used a new weapon,"" he adds. ""And this weapon will not be put back into the box.""","2013-09-15 12:33:00","0","140.0","31.0","10.0","0.0","43.0","0.0","187.0","78.0","0.0","395.0","0.0","37.0","10","3841","92.18","74.84","22.04","8.61","23.14","26.74","79.25","46.71","9.68","4.14","0.52","1.41","0.91","0.31","0.99","5.55","9.48","14.89","6.80","3.57","4.37","0.60","11.72","4.19","2.21","1.54","1.72","1.95","5.36","1.95","3.38","0.44","1.67","0.10","7.60","0.00","0.21","0.08","0.31","9.55","1.82","2.16","1.25","2.29","0.86","2.11","1.80","0.57","1.02","0.13","1.07","0.29","0.52","0.00","0.23","11.38","1.98","2.00","5.39","1.15","1.80","1.35","9.27","1.17","13.49","1.43","8.33","3.83","5.60","0.44","0.08","0.86","0.08","0.13","0.29","0.00","0.03","0.10","0.13","0.00","18.82","4.61","5.86","0.23","0.03","0.16","0.00","1.20","4.19","2.13","0.16","0.26","18809","8.05","25.454545454545453","5916","3833","172","57.3","13.7","10.8","12.94","14.0","804","6.714285714285714","19.310294808244198","1371","22.77","62","0.45","0","95","59","430","0","462","305","11","7","54","602","327","3","272","3","1","141","43","154","10","2","20","144","1","188","61","95","64","119","157","28","22","0","26"
"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2013/0108/WikiLeaks-Bradley-Manning-was-treated-improperly-in-lockup-judge-rules","WikiLeaks: Bradley Manning was treated improperly in lockup, judge rules","But the military court declined to throw out the case against former Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, who faces trial for allegedly facilitating the largest leak of classified documents in US history.

Army Pfc. Bradley Manning steps out of a security vehicle as he is escorted into a courthouse in Fort Meade, Md., in this Nov. 29, 2012, file photo.

A military judge ruled on Tuesday that a former Army intelligence analyst accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive US documents to WikiLeaks was subject to improper treatment during a portion of his pretrial detention in a US Marine Corps lockup.

The judge, US Army Col. Denise Lind, said she would give former analyst Pfc. Bradley Manning credit for 112 days of time served off any potential future sentence.

But Judge Lind refused a defense request that she throw out all or part of the charges against Manning to punish the government for its misconduct.

Defense lawyers had asked the judge to dismiss the government’s case against their client based on the unusually harsh treatment he faced in a detention facility at Quantico, Va., following his arrest in 2010 for allegedly facilitating the largest leak of classified documents in US history.

The defense had also asked, in the alternative, that the judge give Manning potential credit of 10 days off any future sentence for every day he spent under improper conditions of pretrial confinement.

Although prosecutors appear to have lost, the judge’s ruling marks a toothless victory for the defense. Manning is charged with violating 22 separate counts, including that he aided the enemy. The 25-year-old private is facing a potential sentence of life in prison.

In contrast to Lind’s 112-day determination, it is not uncommon for judges to allow defendants held while awaiting trial to receive full credit for the amount of time spent in pretrial detention. They typically receive that full credit even when they aren’t subject to what Lind determined were improper and punitive conditions of confinement in the Manning case.

The judge read her decision in open court. She said Manning’s detention was “more rigorous than necessary,” according to the Associated Press. She also concluded that the government’s treatment of Manning “became excessive in relation to legitimate government interests.”

Manning was held alone in a cell for nearly nine months and kept on a highly restrictive suicide watch for much of that time despite the recommendation of a mental health adviser that the watch be lifted and his conditions of confinement be eased.

Manning and his lawyers argued that the tough treatment was illegal punishment meted out by military officials who failed to honor the requirement that defendants be treated as innocent until proven guilty.

Detention officials defended the decision to maintain the suicide watch and other tough measures, despite the earlier recommendation that conditions be eased. They said months earlier the same mental health expert had made a similar recommendation that a prisoner’s watch status be downgraded. That prisoner committed suicide in the facility.

News of Manning’s harsh treatment sparked protests at the gates of the Marine base at Quantico. In April 2011, he was moved to a medium-security pretrial detention facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.

Because of reports of his harsh treatment by the US military, Manning has attracted a significant following of supporters who view him as a crusading whistle-blower. Some expressed disappointment after the judge’s ruling.

“She confirmed that Bradley was mistreated, and vindicated the massive protest that was required to stop the Marines at Quantico from torturing Bradley,” said Jeff Paterson of the Bradley Manning Support Network.

“Yes, 112 days is not nearly enough to hold the military accountable for their actions,” he added, in a statement.

Manning’s trial is set to begin in early March in a military courtroom at Fort Meade, Md.

Lind’s ruling came on the first day of a new round of pretrial hearings this week. At issue is whether jurors should be allowed to assess Manning’s possible motives in deciding to leak certain documents.

Defense lawyers say their client was careful to release only documents he believed would not damage US national security or otherwise aid America’s enemies.

The leaked documents included diplomatic cables, battle reports from Iraq and Afghanistan, and intelligence assessments of terrorism suspects being held at Guantánamo. They were subsequently released to the public on the WikiLeaks website.","2013-01-08 19:56:00","1","61.0","23.0","10.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","190.0","76.0","0.0","379.0","0.0","37.0","9","730","97.82","73.57","16.71","11.56","19.73","32.74","73.42","41.51","7.81","4.52","0.00","0.96","0.00","2.60","0.96","3.29","8.77","16.44","4.52","1.23","3.29","0.55","9.32","4.25","2.05","0.82","1.92","1.37","6.85","2.74","3.84","0.27","1.37","0.55","8.63","0.00","0.00","0.82","1.78","8.08","2.05","0.82","0.41","1.78","0.82","2.74","2.33","1.10","0.68","0.68","0.82","0.27","0.41","0.00","0.14","10.82","1.10","1.51","6.71","0.27","1.92","5.34","3.97","0.68","13.42","1.37","6.99","5.21","3.56","0.14","0.14","0.96","0.00","0.41","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","12.60","5.34","3.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.68","1.10","1.78","0.00","0.00","3723","8.07","22.515151515151516","1160","725","38","52.09","13.9","10.7","13.63","13.2","160","6.833333333333333","18.467586206896552","347","20.67","8","0.4","0","12","11","72","0","109","67","1","2","3","136","77","0","43","0","0","19","10","20","1","0","4","22","0","26","42","16","26","6","12","1","4","0","1"

Suspected hardline ethnic Serbs are thought to be responsible for setting off tear gas canisters and smashing ballot boxes in the divided town of Mitrovica.

For the first time the Serbs had been encouraged to vote but as the polls closed there were concerns of a low turnout.

Mayoral candidate Krstimir Pantic said he expected the elections in Mitrovica to be annulled and new ones declared but not before law and order had been restored.

Some Kosovar Serbs were concerned that if they cast their ballots they would be legitimising the state’s 2008 unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia.

However the election had the backing of both the ethnic Albanian majority and Belgrade whose government is trying to normalise relations with Kosovo.

A low turnout among the ethnic Serbs would be a blow to Serbia who wants to join the European Union.

Serbia and most Serbs in Kosovo refuse to recognise the country’s independence. However for the first time Serbia is telling Serbs there to vote. It follows a deal brokered by the European Union between the two countries, which Serbia sees as helping towards its EU membership bid.

As part of the deal, Serbia has given up its legal authority over the territory. In return, Kosovo authorities will let four Serb-controlled areas of northern Kosovo have some autonomy.

However according to Ilir Deda of the Kosovar think-tank KIPRED, the deal could end the prospects for a multi-ethnic Kosovo and ultimately break up the country.

“The Brussels agreement [between Kosovo and Serbia] legalises and institutionalises the ethnic division between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo and this division should function within some sort of overall unified Kosovo legal framework with guarantees from Serbia for the existence of Serbian association of municipalities – which I think if not managed properly in the next 5 to 10 years is going to lead to the definite partition of Kosovo.”

Many Serbs in Kosovo say they are being pressured by Belgrade to vote and have been told they will lose their jobs if they do not.

If they do take part in elections they will be recognising Kosovo independence, which is for many an impossible choice.","2013-11-02 15:05:03","0","91.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","335.0","262.0","0.0","510.0","13.0","25.0","3","236","95.29","55.04","22.80","33.07","23.60","23.73","74.58","47.03","5.93","2.97","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.54","2.97","7.63","18.22","8.47","1.69","5.93","0.85","13.56","2.54","1.27","1.27","2.54","2.97","2.12","1.27","0.85","0.42","0.00","0.42","5.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.02","2.12","1.69","2.54","3.39","0.85","2.97","0.85","0.42","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.20","1.69","2.54","3.81","0.42","0.42","1.69","7.63","2.54","13.56","1.27","8.47","3.39","3.81","0.00","0.00","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.75","4.24","2.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.27","0.85","0.42","0.00","0.85","1150","8.64","26.333333333333332","362","234","10","56.18","13.0","11.2","12.42","14.1","57","6.642857142857143","21.103589743589744","141","22.56","3","0.45","0","7","5","21","0","35","14","0","1","5","28","34","1","11","0","0","7","3","8","0","0","2","8","0","13","2","7","7","8","7","3","0","0","0"

Serbia, which is seeking to join the European Union, is keen for the elections to help improve its relations with Kosovo – one of the conditions of its EU membership talks progressing.

Many of the Kosovar Serbs, however, have pledged to boycott the vote. A small minority in the country, they oppose Kosovo’s declaration of independence in 2008.

In the Serb-dominated north of the country, critics of the elections see them as validating Kosovo’s secession from Serbia. Billboards on the streets of Mitrovica encourage people not to go to the polls. The slogans say the vote is unconstitutional.

Krstimir Pantic, a Belgrade-backed candidate for mayor of Mitrovica, has complained that Pristina’s poor running of the elections could jeopardise them. Pantic said he was unable to cast his ballot early on November 3 because some members of the voting committees had not shown up for work.","2013-11-03 17:10:58","1","89.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","509.0","13.0","25.0","3","162","99.00","71.09","7.47","36.64","18.00","30.25","68.52","45.68","5.56","3.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","1.85","2.47","11.11","19.14","6.79","0.62","2.47","1.23","11.73","3.09","0.62","0.62","1.85","1.85","4.32","2.47","1.85","0.00","0.62","0.00","8.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","4.94","0.62","1.23","0.62","0.62","0.00","1.85","1.85","0.62","1.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.88","4.32","2.47","4.32","0.00","0.00","2.47","7.41","0.00","11.73","1.85","8.64","1.23","1.23","0.62","0.00","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.58","5.56","4.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","0.00","1.85","0.00","0.00","803","8.94","18.333333333333332","245","161","9","61.77","12.1","9.1","12.47","11.9","45","7.75","20.340124223602487","109","16.67","2","0.46","0","1","3","19","0","26","9","0","0","1","18","25","0","14","0","0","4","3","4","0","0","1","6","0","7","6","4","4","5","4","1","0","0","0"
"http://www.euronews.com/2013/11/04/eu-condemns-kosovo-election-violence","EU condemns Kosovo election violence","The head of the EU’s police force in Kosovo has condemned the violence that marred local elections in northern Kosovo on Sunday.

A group of Serb hardliners allegedly attacked a polling station in the ethnically-divided town of Mitrovica.

Bernd Borchardt, chief of the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), said their actions were clearly designed to intimidate voters.

“Attacking a polling station is something, it is one of the worst things you can do in civil life. We are very glad that we have been able to bring the people back without major damage to health or life, and that we were able to bring the ballot boxes back,” said Borchardt.

Participation in the elections is central to an agreement reached in April to integrate the 40,000-50,000 Serbs living there with the rest of Kosovo, which is majority Albanian and declared independence from Serbia in 2008.

But a low turnout and violence were clear signs of the scale of resistance among north Kosovo Serbs to integrate with the rest of Kosovo.

“I think the elections came too soon. It is not the same thing living in the north of Kosovo as being in the south. For the last 10 years they (Serbs south of the river Ibar) live among Albanians and are used to that,” said Gradmir Raskic, an ethnic Serb who lives in Mitrovica.

Serbia had called on Serbs in northern Kosovo to take part for the first time, with the EU holding out the prospect of January membership talks, as a reward for Belgrade’s support for the process.","2013-11-04 17:36:05","0","92.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","510.0","13.0","25.0","3","267","98.59","68.67","28.56","5.65","24.27","19.10","74.16","48.31","6.74","2.62","0.37","1.12","0.37","0.00","0.75","4.12","11.24","18.73","6.37","2.62","3.00","0.75","11.99","2.25","1.50","0.75","3.00","1.12","4.87","1.50","3.37","0.00","1.12","0.37","5.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.12","0.37","1.12","0.00","0.75","0.75","1.50","1.50","0.37","1.12","0.00","3.00","0.37","2.62","0.00","0.00","8.24","2.25","1.50","3.75","0.75","0.37","4.12","7.12","0.75","15.36","1.50","10.86","3.75","0.75","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.11","4.12","4.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.75","1.50","0.75","1.50","0.00","1200","7.58","24.454545454545453","362","263","11","64.14","11.0","10.3","10.57","12.9","46","9.0","18.55619771863118","158","21.36","5","0.45","0","6","7","30","0","42","18","0","1","1","41","37","1","12","0","0","8","1","10","0","0","1","9","0","7","12","3","6","6","7","2","1","0","0"
"http://www.euronews.com/2013/11/03/kosovo-votes-in-local-elections","Kosovo votes in local elections","Kosovo is voting in local elections. The poll is considered a crucial test of the readiness of Kosovo and Serbia – two former foes – to move closer to EU membership.

Serbs are the majority in the northern part of the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica. Here, election posters are mixed with slogans branding the vote as treason.

As part of an EU deal between the two countries, Serbia has given up its legal authority over the territory. In exchange Kosovo will let four Serb-controlled areas of northern Kosovo have some autonomy.

Dragoljub Ilic, a Serbian resident of Mitrovica, told euronews: “Pristina has called for elections but we go out to vote because of Serbia. I think this is Serbia and we have to come out and vote and show that this is Serbia.”

In the southern part of Mitrovica, where ethnic Albanians form the majority, voters will elect a mayor whose authority does not extend beyond the Ibar river that divides the town.

Lavdim Jola, an Albanian resident of Mitrovica appears optimistic: “I think it is the return to what Mitrovica was in the past [united]. I think people have started thinking differently and that the change will be positive.”

On Saturday, the Kosovan president urged voters on both sides of the ethnic divide to cast their ballots in an effort to integrate. However tensions remain high.

Some 1.8 million people are taking to the polls.","2013-11-03 03:24:02","0","92.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","335.0","262.0","0.0","509.0","13.0","25.0","3","236","96.36","56.74","48.42","33.07","16.86","23.31","72.88","45.34","6.36","2.54","1.27","0.85","0.00","0.00","0.42","3.81","10.17","15.68","8.47","1.69","4.24","0.42","14.83","3.39","1.69","1.27","2.12","3.39","2.12","1.27","0.85","0.42","0.42","0.00","4.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.78","2.12","1.27","0.00","1.27","0.42","1.69","0.85","0.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.93","1.27","1.27","2.97","1.27","0.00","2.97","9.32","1.27","15.68","1.69","11.86","2.12","1.69","0.00","0.85","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.14","5.93","3.39","0.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.42","1.69","0.00","0.00","0.85","1106","8.47","19.75","358","237","14","62.78","11.1","8.7","10.67","10.0","60","6.714285714285714","18.88658227848101","146","17.92","5","0.45","0","6","6","29","0","28","18","1","0","3","30","26","1","16","0","0","6","2","6","0","0","3","8","0","10","4","4","4","12","10","1","1","1","1"

A lack of pluralism and genuine choice were highlighted by observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

In power for more than 20 years, Rakhmon won over 83 percent of the vote according to official figures. He faced five little-known, mainly loyal challengers. His only serious rival was barred from running.

Would-be candidate Oynihol Bobonazarova, who was backed by the opposition Islamic Revival Party and the Social Democrats, was barred because she failed to present the 210,000 petition signatures required to get on the ballot.

She has said that many activists collecting signatures to support her were summoned

by prosecutors or intimidated by security agents.

As he starts a new seven-year-term, Rakhmon faces a challenge to ensure stability in a volatile region bordering Afghanistan.

Domestically, the Moscow-backed, authoritarian leader of the impoverished former Soviet nation keeps its small opposition in check. But he faces rising social tension in a country where nearly half the 8 million population lives in poverty.","2013-11-07 12:44:04","0","92.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","511.0","13.0","25.0","3","187","97.24","70.37","8.69","66.27","18.70","32.62","73.26","39.04","5.88","3.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.74","0.00","2.14","8.02","14.97","5.35","1.60","3.74","0.00","10.70","4.81","2.14","1.60","4.81","1.60","7.49","4.81","2.67","0.53","1.07","0.53","6.95","0.00","0.00","1.60","2.14","6.95","2.14","0.53","1.07","2.14","0.00","1.60","0.53","0.00","0.53","0.00","1.60","1.07","0.53","0.00","0.00","12.83","2.67","3.21","6.42","1.07","2.14","5.35","5.35","0.00","13.90","1.07","9.09","3.74","3.74","1.07","0.53","0.53","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.83","5.35","4.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.67","0.00","0.53","0.00","0.00","1005","10.2","18.8","309","181","10","44.64","13.8","11.5","15.83","14.7","65","7.25","23.604640883977904","146","17.7","1","0.39","0","5","8","14","0","24","18","1","0","1","26","20","1","11","1","0","5","3","5","0","0","0","5","0","5","11","5","10","1","5","1","1","0","1"

Serbia and most Serbs in Kosovo refuse to recognise the country’s independence. However for the first time Serbia is telling Serbs there to vote. It follows a deal brokered by the European Union between the two countries, which Serbia sees as helping towards its EU membership bid.

As part of the deal, Serbia has given up its legal authority over the territory. In return, Kosovo authorities will let four Serb-controlled areas of northern Kosovo have some autonomy.","2013-11-02 15:05:03","0","11.0","2.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","22.0","24.0","0.0","41.0","2.0","4.0","0","93","98.37","66.65","60.40","66.47","15.50","23.66","76.34","43.01","4.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.30","7.53","20.43","7.53","2.15","4.30","0.00","11.83","3.23","3.23","1.08","4.30","3.23","2.15","2.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.45","1.08","2.15","0.00","2.15","0.00","1.08","1.08","1.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.83","3.23","4.30","6.45","0.00","0.00","1.08","6.45","2.15","20.43","1.08","13.98","5.38","2.15","0.00","0.00","1.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.83","6.45","3.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.08","0.00","1.08","0.00","0.00","450","8.34","15.666666666666666","142","92","6","64.41","10.9","8.1","11.42","10.0","23","7.25","18.12","73","15.17","1","0.41","0","1","3","8","0","14","4","0","1","1","13","16","0","4","0","0","1","2","3","0","0","1","3","0","4","2","3","3","2","4","1","0","0","0"

Pristina and Belgrade have both been pushing for a strong turnout in municipal elections in Kosovo.

Many of the Kosovar Serbs, however, have pledged to boycott the vote. A small minority in the country, they oppose Kosovo’s declaration of independence in 2008.

In the Serb-dominated north of the country, critics of the elections see them as validating Kosovo’s secession from Serbia. Billboards on the streets of Mitrovica encourage people not to go to the polls. The slogans say the vote is unconstitutional.

Krstimir Pantic, a Belgrade-backed candidate for mayor of Mitrovica, has complained that Pristina’s poor running of the elections could jeopardise them. Pantic said he was unable to cast his ballot early on November 3 because some members of the voting committees had not shown up for work.","2013-11-03 17:10:58","1","9.0","2.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","23.0","25.0","0.0","41.0","2.0","4.0","0","162","99.00","71.09","7.47","36.64","18.00","30.25","68.52","45.68","5.56","3.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","1.85","2.47","11.11","19.14","6.79","0.62","2.47","1.23","11.73","3.09","0.62","0.62","1.85","1.85","4.32","2.47","1.85","0.00","0.62","0.00","8.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","4.94","0.62","1.23","0.62","0.62","0.00","1.85","1.85","0.62","1.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.88","4.32","2.47","4.32","0.00","0.00","2.47","7.41","0.00","11.73","1.85","8.64","1.23","1.23","0.62","0.00","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.58","5.56","4.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","0.00","1.85","0.00","0.00","803","8.94","18.333333333333332","245","161","9","61.77","12.1","9.1","12.47","11.9","45","7.75","20.340124223602487","109","16.67","2","0.46","0","1","3","19","0","26","9","0","0","1","18","25","0","14","0","0","4","3","4","0","0","1","6","0","7","6","4","4","5","4","1","0","0","0"

Mitrovica is split between a majority of ethnic Serbs in the north of the city, and ethnic Albanians in the south.","2013-11-17 11:15:03","1","12.0","2.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","23.0","25.0","0.0","41.0","2.0","4.0","0","76","99.00","55.22","96.09","50.32","19.00","27.63","71.05","40.79","2.63","1.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.32","1.32","13.16","19.74","2.63","1.32","2.63","0.00","5.26","3.95","2.63","0.00","1.32","3.95","3.95","2.63","1.32","0.00","1.32","0.00","2.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.32","2.63","0.00","1.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.63","0.00","1.32","2.63","0.00","0.00","2.63","3.95","1.32","30.26","3.95","19.74","6.58","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.84","5.26","2.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.63","0.00","1.32","0.00","0.00","366","9.46","19.25","112","74","4","61.16","11.7","9.3","12.59","12.1","23","8.25","21.832432432432434","58","17.0","1","0.43","0","1","1","11","0","14","7","0","0","0","13","9","0","7","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","3","2","1","3","1","0","0","0","0"

Jean-Claude Juncker’s government collapsed in July amid claims he had failed to curb abuse of power by the secret services, including illegal phone tapping.

An official report concluded that Juncker had limited control over the agency and had not reported its questionable operations.

He denies any wrongdoing and, despite the scandal, his conservative Christian Social Party is expected to top the poll.

“Normally, in other western democracies, the popularity of the prime minister would be destroyed but it is not the case,” said Philippe Poirier, a political science professor at the University of Luxembourg. “In the last survey published three weeks ago, we see 65 percent of the inhabitants of Luxembourg continue to support Mr Juncker.”

Luxembourg’s prime minister since 1995, until recently Juncker also chaired euro zone finance ministers’ meetings. Accused by critics of putting Europe first, he has pledged to refocus on the Grand Duchy if re-elected.","2013-10-19 02:16:02","0","90.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","511.0","13.0","25.0","3","167","97.81","61.78","9.62","25.77","20.88","35.93","74.25","40.12","5.39","2.99","0.00","0.60","0.00","2.40","0.00","2.40","8.98","15.57","5.39","0.60","4.19","1.20","8.38","3.59","1.20","0.00","2.40","1.20","4.79","2.40","2.40","0.00","1.20","0.60","7.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.99","8.38","1.20","1.20","2.40","1.20","0.00","3.59","1.80","0.60","1.20","0.00","0.60","0.00","0.60","0.00","0.00","12.57","1.80","2.40","8.98","0.00","1.20","2.99","5.39","0.60","13.17","0.60","5.99","6.59","8.38","0.60","0.00","1.20","2.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.17","4.79","5.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.20","2.40","1.80","0.00","0.00","867","10.4","24.142857142857142","275","165","8","42.11","14.4","12.5","14.5","14.7","60","8.3","24.78545454545455","127","22.71","0","0.38","0","5","4","16","0","24","13","0","0","1","24","23","0","9","0","0","5","2","5","0","0","0","4","0","5","10","4","8","2","5","0","0","0","0"

He called the vote seven months early after his Socialist coalition partners withdrew their support, holding him responsible for a secret service spying scandal.

“These elections are a bit unusual you know. It happens only two or three times per century that the government goes before the voters to have a fresh start. This is the case here, and I trust the Luxembourg people, and tonight we will try to get a coalition and a government,” said the outgoing Socialist Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn.

It is thought voters could be tempted by new faces after decades where the same party has led almost all governments.

The indefatigable Juncker finds his 18 years in office threatened by rising unemployment and debt, even though Luxembourg remains one of the world’s richest countries.

Euronews correspondent in Luxembourg Sándor Zsiros said:

“In the past few weeks opinion polls were banned from being published in Luxembourg, so this Sunday’s election could be really exciting and also, the vote will determine the future of Jean-Claude Juncker, who is Europe’s longest serving prime minister.”","2013-10-20 13:35:02","0","91.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","511.0","13.0","25.0","3","210","85.46","76.25","21.13","70.57","26.25","28.57","76.19","41.90","7.62","3.81","0.48","0.48","0.48","1.90","0.48","3.81","10.00","9.05","8.10","4.29","4.76","0.00","14.76","8.10","4.29","1.43","3.33","1.43","3.33","2.86","0.48","0.48","0.48","0.00","8.10","0.00","0.48","0.00","1.90","7.62","2.38","0.48","1.43","1.90","0.48","1.43","0.95","0.00","0.95","0.00","0.48","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.10","1.43","0.48","4.76","0.95","0.95","3.81","9.05","1.90","15.24","1.43","5.24","8.57","4.29","0.48","0.00","0.95","1.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.81","3.81","4.76","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.95","1.90","1.90","0.00","0.00","1053","9.18","26.75","318","208","8","53.55","13.4","12.3","13.7","16.5","56","8.5","23.16923076923077","152","25.12","2","0.41","0","6","5","25","0","21","19","0","2","4","32","24","0","14","0","0","7","3","7","0","0","0","2","0","6","5","7","7","4","11","1","1","0","1"
"http://www.euronews.com/2013/10/20/juncker-confident-over-luxembourg-vote-despite-tight-race","Juncker confident over Luxembourg vote despite tight race","The future of the EU’s longest serving head of government hangs in the balance as Luxembourg votes in an election held early after a spying scandal brought down the last coalition.

Former Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker denies he is eyeing up Brussels again as he seeks a fifth term as prime minister.

“The results according to my hope should be in line with the results we had last time, and the time before, so we’ll see tonight in what way electors are distributing their cards,” Juncker said after he had voted on Sunday morning.

Euronews correspondent Sándor Zsiros asked him whether he had ambitions to become president of the European Commission.

“No no no, I made it perfectly clear that I don’t have (such) an ambition, a future in Brussels. I hope that my future is here (in Luxembourg),” he replied.

The opposition is hoping to capitalise on the last coalition’s collapse following the Socialists’ withdrawal.

Juncker was blamed over the spy scandal which exposed the extent of secret service snooping on politicians and the public.

Added to this is rising unemployment and debt in albeit one of the world’s richest countries.

“When I think back to the campaign, what we did in the last weeks and last months, people are really waiting for political change here in Luxembourg. That’s what they wish after this election,” said Claude Meisch, leader of the opposition Democratic Party.

With opinion polls banned in the run-up to the election the outcome is hard to predict.

The EU’s second smallest country has been one of Europe’s most politically stable – but is that set to change?

In retaliation his Renamo former rebel group launched an assault on police station in Maringue.

Reports suggest police abandoned their positions after coming under heavy gunfire.

Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama is at large deep in the jungle:

Tomás Vieira Mário is a political analyst:

“It is believed that Dhlakama abandoned his base, in a hurry with no time to issue orders or give clear instructions to his men, wherever they are. The retaliation may have come about without an order from the top.”

The US government has called on both sides to take steps to refrain from further hostilities.

Mozambique was gripped by a brutal civil war following its independence from Portugal in 1975.

The strife between the now ruling Frelimo party and Renamo left around 1 million people dead.

In 1992 the parties agreed a peace deal in Rome and since then

the country has shown signs of stability and growth.

Tension has been on the rise since April and June after alleged Renamo militia killed 11 soldiers and police and six civilians and halted coal exports sent by rail to the coast.","2013-10-23 00:16:02","0","96.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","511.0","13.0","25.0","3","210","97.93","76.25","65.14","1.00","21.00","22.38","78.10","43.33","4.76","2.86","0.00","0.48","0.00","1.43","0.95","1.90","9.05","17.62","6.19","1.90","4.76","0.95","10.48","5.24","2.86","0.48","2.86","0.95","7.62","1.90","5.71","0.95","3.81","0.95","8.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.90","5.24","1.43","1.90","0.00","0.95","0.48","0.95","1.43","0.48","0.00","0.95","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.33","2.38","1.43","10.00","0.48","0.48","3.33","6.67","1.43","22.38","3.81","12.38","6.19","5.24","0.95","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.90","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.62","4.76","0.95","0.95","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.95","0.00","0.00","0.00","999","7.76","23.333333333333332","306","210","10","58.62","11.2","10.3","11.66","12.6","41","10.5","18.209523809523812","144","21.33","2","0.41","0","8","6","21","0","33","12","0","1","1","37","23","0","17","0","0","2","5","2","0","0","1","6","0","5","9","3","9","2","7","0","0","0","0"

Dhlakama’s Renamo party said the military action “puts an end” to the 1992 peace agreement that ended years of civil war.

Reports suggest that Dhlakama escaped before the troops moved in.

Renamo spokesperson Fernando Manzanga made a statement to the media: “They have taken the house of Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama. The party leader hasn’t ordered Renamo forces to respond, he has ordered the evacuation of the population that was there for protection.”

It is thought the Mozambique military moved after a suspected Renamo militia killed seven government troops last week.

The peace accord between the ruling Frelimo party and Renamo was signed in Rome in 1992 and brought an end to a civil war that had raged since the country’s independence from Portugal in 1975.

Close to a million people were killed during the violence.

Many fear a return to conflict will shatter any advances made in resource rich country since the end of the conflict.","2013-10-22 01:05:02","0","92.0","34.0","20.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","336.0","263.0","0.0","511.0","13.0","25.0","3","171","99.00","74.01","35.14","25.77","19.00","25.73","77.78","39.77","4.09","1.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.58","0.58","2.92","13.45","14.62","5.85","0.58","1.17","0.58","12.28","1.75","1.17","0.00","2.92","1.17","8.19","4.09","4.09","0.58","2.92","0.00","7.60","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.58","7.02","1.75","4.09","0.00","0.58","0.00","0.58","1.17","0.00","1.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.45","2.92","2.34","8.19","1.17","1.17","7.60","3.51","0.58","16.96","4.09","5.26","7.60","4.09","1.75","0.58","0.58","0.00","2.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.53","5.26","0.58","0.58","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.34","1.75","0.00","0.00","864","8.64","21.75","264","171","9","60.65","11.9","9.5","13.11","12.8","44","6.833333333333333","19.892397660818716","104","20.12","0","0.4","0","2","5","24","0","21","8","0","0","1","39","20","0","9","0","0","3","0","0","0","0","0","6","0","3","15","0","8","4","3","2","0","0","0"

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) encouraged supporters to tweet the phrase following controversy over products the NRCC has been selling that made light of people using the phrase ""Happy Holidays.""

Some items sold by the NRCC said only liberals would use such the phrase.

Democrats have criticized that suggestion as offensive.

“It isn't just divisive. It's offensive,” said DNC Communications Director Mo Elleithee.

“The official organization charged with electing Republicans to the House — the national Republican Party! — thinks that telling people ""Happy Holidays"" is something that only liberals do,” he wrote in a morning email to Democratic supporters.

His email links to a webpage on the DNC’s site that prompts people to wish Republicans “Happy Holidays” by selecting Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, New Years, Festivus or holidays. It then generates a tweet based on the holiday selected, and includes the hashtag: #HappyHolidaysGOP.

More than 1,000 people tweeted it on Wednesday, according to social media analytics tool TOPSY.

The NRCC launched a mug this week in its online store that says, “ ‘Happy Holidays’ is what liberals say.”

A shirt with the same phrase sold out last week and is no longer being sold.

Since last week, the committee has also been selling a shirt that says, “I’m not afraid to say ‘Merry Christmas,’ ” which is available in red or green.","2013-12-04 13:16:29","1","28.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","219.0","213.0","0.0","142.0","0.0","33.0","23","241","92.84","73.31","17.33","78.89","17.21","30.29","80.50","39.42","7.88","1.24","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.83","0.00","6.64","9.96","10.79","6.22","2.07","3.32","1.24","14.52","7.88","2.49","0.83","0.83","1.24","6.22","4.56","1.66","0.41","1.24","0.00","9.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.83","8.30","1.24","3.32","0.83","1.66","0.00","2.07","3.73","1.24","2.49","0.00","0.83","0.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.98","3.32","0.00","1.66","0.00","0.00","3.73","7.47","0.83","13.28","0.83","6.64","5.81","4.15","3.73","0.41","2.49","0.83","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.65","5.39","5.39","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.41","0.00","7.47","2.49","1.66","0.41","1248","8.38","18.846153846153847","393","244","14","53.81","13.6","10.1","14.03","13.0","60","6.071428571428571","18.79606557377049","145","17.69","12","0.4","0","5","2","28","0","20","22","1","0","1","28","43","4","14","0","0","6","2","4","1","0","1","8","0","5","8","9","9","5","14","4","1","0","0"

ADVERTISEMENT

“Pushing the pause button right now would be a good thing,” Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said at an event last Thursday, as reported by The Courant on Monday. “If you do it right now, five to 10 years from now, nobody’s going to remember this.”

Bertolini was speaking on “Reinventing Health Care” at the Annual Economic Conference of the Tunxis Community College Foundation.

Aetna is one of the nation’s “Big Five” health insurers that sells insurance across the entire country.

Bertolini said that the technological roots of HealthCare.gov's troubles meant it was best to put the whole system on ice rather than work in a patchwork manner to fix the online enrollment portal.

“When you get into this kind of situation with technology, you just don’t have a short-term solution,” he said. “Turn off the stuff that isn’t working.”

So far, the Obama administration has tried to fix the federal health insurance exchange without a general shutdown, instead gradually upgrading the site day by day. The site’s frequent crashes and low number of successful enrollments have invited severe criticism from Republicans and led to calls for Secretary of Health and Human Service Kathleen Sebelius to resign.","2013-11-06 18:32:20","1","25.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","222.0","213.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","32.0","22","226","95.08","58.74","48.64","13.73","22.60","26.55","78.76","43.36","6.64","1.77","0.00","0.00","1.33","0.44","0.00","4.87","9.73","15.04","5.75","3.98","3.98","1.77","13.27","4.87","1.77","0.44","1.77","0.88","4.42","1.77","2.65","0.00","0.44","0.88","5.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.44","7.08","1.33","1.33","1.77","0.88","0.88","2.65","1.77","0.00","1.77","0.00","2.21","0.00","2.21","0.00","0.00","8.41","0.44","3.10","3.98","1.77","0.88","3.98","7.52","0.44","19.03","2.65","9.73","6.64","6.64","0.00","0.00","2.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.14","5.31","3.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.44","6.19","2.65","0.00","0.00","1120","9.0","29.125","348","224","12","52.49","13.0","10.6","13.17","12.6","63","6.666666666666667","20.730000000000004","161","27.0","3","0.41","0","4","3","24","1","27","16","0","0","2","43","33","1","8","0","0","7","0","11","0","1","2","8","0","10","10","6","4","4","5","2","0","0","1"

“While we cannot independently verify this development,” spokeswoman Marie Harf said, “we have no reason to doubt the official KCNA report that Jang Song Thaek has been executed.

“If confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime. We are following developments in North Korea closely and consulting with our allies and partners in the region.”

Jang had been considered the communist regime's second-ranking official and a mentor to Kim, who is estimated to be about 30. His removal from power consolidates Kim's power but has raised concerns in South Korea and across the region of potential instability within the nuclear-armed nation.

"http://thehill.com/policy/international/193366-us-targets-burmese-companies-involved-in-buying-arms-from","US targets Burmese entities over arms sales to North Korea","The Treasury Department on Tuesday banned Americans from doing business with three Burmese companies and one individual accused of participating in arms sales with North Korea.

Asia Metal Company; Soe Min Htike Co.; Excellence Mineral Manufacturing Co.; and Lt. Col. Kyaw Nyunt Oo, a Burmese military staff officer, are the latest on a list the Treasury maintains of “specially designated nations” that blocks companies’ or individuals’ assets.

Burma’s Directorate of Defense Industries (DDI), specifically, received a Treasury designation in July 2012. Officials determined that the entities added on Tuesday have been linked to the DDI, which has been involved in purchasing military equipment from North Korea.

This designation does not “generally target the Government of Burma,” the department said. About a year ago, Burma's government agreed to abide by a United Nations Security Council resolution that prohibits the procurement of military goods and assistance from North Korea.

“The revenues from these continuing military sales directly support North Korea’s illicit activities,” Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen said Tuesday. “We will continue to target this activity in Burma, and the region, as we work with our international partners to shut down North Korea’s dangerous and destabilizing weapons proliferation.”

Tuesday’s update marks the second action the Obama administration has taken this year in targeting North Korean military ties to Burma. Treasury officials added the chief of the DDI in July to the designations list after they discovered he was involved in trading North Korean arms.

Despite the designations, the U.S. has been easing certain investment and financial sanctions that were previously in place against Burma's government.

""Government employees rarely get the credit they deserve but I can assure you that the people I’ve worked with at DHS are some of the most dedicated and selfless individuals in the world and deserve a great deal of credit for keeping our nation safe day in and day out.""



Weatherford's departure comes at a critical moment when DHS is working to implement President Obama's cybersecurity executive order and also expand its cybersecurity efforts. The president's cyber order directs the department to lead a program where critical infrastructure firms would choose to adopt a set of computer security best practices into their networks and systems.



This year Congress is also looking to codify the department's authority to lead the federal government's cybersecurity efforts and work with industry to better secure their networks. However, some lawmakers have questioned whether the relatively young agency is up to the task to take on this elevated role.



Weatherford will start as a principal at the security advisory firm The Chertoff Group, which was co-founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, on May 1. In his new role, Weatherford will consult with clients on their cybersecurity practices and help them take action following a cyber incident, according to The Chertoff Group.



""During his time at DHS, Deputy Under Secretary Weatherford played an important role in enhancing the Department’s cybersecurity operations, working with federal, state and local partners and the private sector to ensure the security and resiliency of the nation’s cybersecurity networks and critical infrastructure,"" said Rand Beers Rand BeersNational security figures urge Trump to disclose foreign business ties DNC creates cybersecurity board The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE, under secretary of the department's national protections and program directorate, which oversees its cybersecurity efforts. ""His contributions will be missed and we wish him all the best at his next endeavor.""



Bruce McConnell, who serves as senior counselor and director of strategy and policy for the national protections and program directorate, will step into Weatherford's role in the interim while the DHS searches for a permanent replacement, Beers said.

"http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/276715-lahood-declares-787-airplane-is-safe-","LaHood declares 787 'Dreamliner' is 'safe,' despite FAA review","Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood declared Friday that he would feel safe flying on the Boeing 787 ""Dreamliner"" airplane.



""I believe this plane is safe and I would have absolutely no reservations of boarding one of these planes and taking a flight,"" LaHood said in a news conference. ""These planes are safe.""



The comments were an effort to calm fears about the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) announcement Friday that it was launching a review of the 787's features following a series of incidents involving the new aircraft.

This week, an electrical fire broke out in the battery of one 787 aircraft, which were designed by airplane manufacturer Boeing. Another 787 developed a fuel leak and the computers on a third plane wrongly indicated there was a problem with the brakes. No one was injured in any of the incidents.

Additionally, on Friday, the cockpit windshield of a 787 plane cracked as it was leaving Tokyo. The plane landed safely.



LaHood acknowledged the incidents were concerning, but maintained that the 787 is a safe airplane.



""We're concerned about recent events with the 787, that's why today we're announcing a comprehensive review of the design and production of the [airplane],"" LaHood said.



""Throughout the development of the 787, the FAA logged 200,000 hours on the certification of the aircraft to ensure it our high level of safety,"" he quickly added.



Boeing Vice President Ray Conner joined LaHood at his news conference, adding that the 787 went through ""the most robust and rigorous certification process in the history of commercial aviation.""



Conner said the problems that were being experienced by the 787 were not ""anything unusual.""



""A lot of these issues are typical issues that come across with every airplane that's in service,"" he said.



FAA Administrator Michael Huerta added that the reviewing the initial performance of a new airplane model is a ""a normal part of what we do is as an aircraft is certified and as it goes into service.



""Nothing we have seen would indicate that this airplane is not safe,"" Huerta said.



However, the FAA has promised to conduct a ""a comprehensive review of Boeing 787 critical systems, including the design, manufacture and assembly.""

"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/governor-races/188663-two-polls-far-different-pictures-of-virginia-governors-race?amp","Three polls, far different snapshots of Virginia governor's race","Three new polls released Wednesday found Democrat Terry McAuliffe (D) remains the front-runner in Virginia's race for governor - but each painted markedly different pictures of the state of the race.

A new poll from Roanoke College finds McAuliffe with a huge advantage, leading Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli by 46 percent to 31 percent.

A separate poll from Quinnipiac University, however, finds Cuccinelli within 4 percentage points over McAuliffe, a closer result than most polls conducted this past month.

McAuliffe leads by 45 percent to 41 percent, Quinnipiac found.

Cuccinelli's campaign pointed to the Quinnipiac poll as evidence that it's closing strong. The Republican's campaign attacked McAuliffe for campaigning with President Obama and ripped the president's healthcare plan.

""Watch out folks, Cuccinelli is one of the best closers in Virginia and the president has upped the ante by coming in this weekend! This has shaped up to be a big opportunity for folks to send Washington a message on ObamaCare,"" former Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.) says in a statement released by Cuccinelli's campaign.

A third poll from the conservative Rasmussen Reports has McAuliffe ahead by 7 percentage points, down from a 17-point lead in a poll that appeared to be an outlier released last week.

Most recent polling of the race has found McAuliffe with a lead in the mid- to high single digits.

A Washington Post poll released Tuesday - and conducted during much of the same period as the Roanoke College and Quinnipiac University polls - found McAuliffe up by 51 percent to 39 percent.

Quinnipiac poll's sample has many more Republicans than much other polling of the race due to a tighter voter screen: The electorate leans 2 percentage points Republican in their results, which predicts an electorate much more similar to those in 2009 and 2010 in Virginia.

The Washington Post's poll gives Democrats an 8-percentage-point edge in the sample. Those numbers are closer to most other polling of the race that finds Democrats more excited about this election - and Republicans less so - than when Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) won his term in office four years ago.

McAuliffe's campaign touted the polls as a sign that he retains the edge in the race heading into Tuesday's election.

""Mainstream Virginians continue to side with Terry's common-sense policies to grow the economy and his commitment to working in a bipartisan way to create jobs in the Commonwealth over Ken Cuccinelli's extreme Tea Party agenda,"" said McAuliffe spokeswoman Rachel Thomas.

""The last days of this election will be about making sure those who are focused on issues like transportation, education and diversifying the economy vote on Nov. 5 and don't let their voices get drowned out by the extreme Tea Party fringe focused on ideological social issues.""

The Quinnipiac poll of 1,182 likely voters was conducted from Oct. 22-28 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.

Roanoke's poll of 838 likely voters was conducted from Oct. 21-27 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Rasmussen's poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted from Oct. 28-29 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.","2013-10-30 11:41:02","1","31.0","13.0","0.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","27.0","18.0","0.0","46.0","0.0","3.0","0","539","99.00","52.97","30.84","57.34","19.96","26.16","68.27","38.40","4.08","0.93","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.56","0.37","3.15","9.09","18.00","3.90","0.93","4.64","0.19","7.79","5.94","4.27","0.56","6.12","5.19","2.04","1.86","0.19","0.00","0.19","0.00","3.15","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.56","7.24","1.86","1.48","0.00","1.86","0.37","2.23","2.23","0.74","0.74","0.19","1.11","0.00","0.00","0.74","0.37","7.79","0.74","2.23","4.82","1.67","0.00","2.60","4.27","1.11","14.47","2.04","7.79","4.27","3.90","0.74","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.19","0.37","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.40","4.82","2.41","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.19","2.78","1.11","2.78","1.11","0.00","2612","7.71","26.476190476190474","782","528","29","61.46","11.7","9.2","12.65","12.0","106","8.9","17.31030303030303","263","24.19","7","0.4","0","22","33","54","0","72","41","2","2","1","98","80","4","26","0","0","2","4","8","4","1","4","15","0","9","24","7","14","4","20","3","1","0","1"
"http://thehill.com/polls/282147-hill-poll-voters-obama-no-better-than-bush-on-security-vs-civil-liberties?amp","Hill Poll: Voters: Obama no better than Bush on security vs civil liberties","A majority of voters believe President Obama has been no better than his immediate predecessor, President George W. Bush, when it comes to balancing national security with the protection of civil liberties, according to a new poll for The Hill.

Thirty-seven percent of voters argue that Obama has been worse than Bush while 15 percent say he has been ""about the same.""

The results cannot be fully explained as party line responses. More than one in five self-identified Democrats, 21 percent, assert that the Obama administration has not improved upon Bush's record. So do 23 percent of liberals.

The results are especially striking given the liberal hopes that attended Obama's election, the opprobrium he heaped upon Bush's national security policies during the 2008 campaign and his early promise to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.

The vexing issue of how to balance security with respect for civil liberties has taken center-stage since a document detailing the legal justification for drone strikes on overseas al Qaeda members was leaked to NBC News earlier this month.

The Justice Department ""white paper"" surfaced ahead of last Thursday's Senate confirmation hearing of President Obama's choice for CIA director, his chief counterterrorism adviser John Brennan.

The leaked memo stipulates that the government can lawfully kill one of its own citizens overseas if it determines the person has ties to al Qaeda or one of its affiliates and poses an ""imminent threat.""

But critics have said the broad language used in the document allows for an elastic interpretation, raising questions over how much authority the administration should have over the lives of American citizens.

Americans are, however, inclined to support the government in its lethal attacks on citizens and non-citizens it deems to be terrorists, according to the Hill Poll.

The poll found that 53 percent of likely voters said it should be legal for the U.S. government to kill non-U.S. citizens who meet that description. Meanwhile, 44 percent said it should be legal for the U.S. government to kill American citizens who it believes are terrorists and present an imminent threat.

By contrast, 21 percent of respondents thought such an action should be illegal if the target is a non-U.S. citizen. A slightly higher percentage of voters, 31 percent, thought killing individuals whom the government believes are terrorists should be illegal when the target is an American citizen.

A significant proportion of respondents - 26 percent and 24 percent, respectively - said they were not sure if such attacks should be legal, regardless of whether the target was an American or not.

When asked whether they oppose or back the administration's drone program, however, a significantly higher percentage of voters voiced their support. Sixty-five percent of respondents said they support the use of unmanned drones to kill ""people in foreign countries whom the US government says are terrorists and present an imminent threat,"" while just 19 percent of voters said they oppose the policy.

The findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 7 by Pulse Opinion Research.

"http://thehill.com/polls/282149-the-hill-poll-few-voters-know-what-sequester-actually-is?amp","The Hill Poll: Few voters know what sequester actually is","Only 36 percent of voters know what the sequester is, even as the topic dominates discussion inside the beltway, according to a new poll from The Hill.

When asked what the term refers to, and presented with a range of options, fully one-quarter of the public admitted that they did not know. Even more (38 percent) chose one of the incorrect explanations. Just over one-in-three voters correctly pegged it as a package of spending cuts that will soon take effect.

Washington has been feeding the public a steady diet of news headlines about the doom and gloom surrounding fiscal issues for some time. As policymakers lurch from one fiscal crisis to another, it perhaps should not be surprising that voters are having a hard time keeping track of it all.

Roughly one-fifth of those polled, 21 percent, had some sense the sequester was a fiscal issue, but got their crises tangled, believing that the term describes the possibility that the United States could soon exceed its debt limit.

Congress put that standoff to bed (for now) in January. Meanwhile, the real sequester is set to begin taking effect March 1.

Another eight percent of voters claimed to know about the sequester, but got their branches of government confused. Those voters believe the term refers to an upcoming ruling by the Supreme Court on the federal budget. Such a case would come as news to Chief Justice John Roberts.

In addition, The Hill Poll found that nine percent believe the term ""sequester"" actually describes the process by which an elected official is tossed out of office. Voters might not be happy with Washington, but the sequester won't get rid of them any more quickly than usual.

When it comes to admitting a lack of knowledge, it turns out the gender divide is just as pronounced on fiscal policy as it is on a willingness to seek driving directions. Women were almost twice as likely as men - 32 percent to 18 percent - to admit that they didn't know what the sequester was.

Regarding party affiliation, voters who identify as Democrats were significantly more likely to nail the sequester question.

Forty-one percent of left-leaning voters knew the right answer, compared to just 28 percent of Republicans. In fact, a plurality of GOP voters, 29 percent, believed the sequester referred to the debt limit.

Voters who did not identify with either party correctly answered the question to the tune of 40 percent.

The Hill Poll was conducted among 1,000 likely voters by Pulse Opinion Research on Feb. 7 and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

"http://thehill.com/polls/285899-hill-poll-presidents-support-for-israel-found-wanting-by-many-voters?amp","Hill Poll: President's support for Israel found wanting by many voters","Three times as many voters believe the Obama administration is not supportive enough of Israel as believe it is too supportive, according to a new poll for the Hill.

The proportion of voters who now say the president does not give strong enough backing to Israel is higher than it was in each of three similar surveys conducted for The Hill since May 2011. Correspondingly, fewer voters now find the White House's policy excessively supportive of Israel.

According to the latest Hill Poll, just 13 percent of respondents say the president's policy toward Israel is too supportive. A full 39 percent said Obama is not supportive enough, the highest percentage The Hill Poll has seen.

Over the past two years, recent surveys for The Hill show a fluctuating number of voters who believe the president needs to express stronger support of Israel.

In a poll for The Hill conducted in May 2011, 27 percent of voters said Obama was too supportive toward Israel, while 31 percent said he was not supportive enough.

In September 2011, the proportion of voters who said Obama was too supportive of Israel went down, and those insisting he was not supportive enough increased slightly.

March 2012 saw a slight uptick in the number of respondents who said Obama was too supportive of the Jewish state, to 25 percent, while slightly fewer voters, 32 percent, said the president was not supportive enough.

Meanwhile, in the most recent survey for The Hill, a slightly larger percentage of likely voters say Obama is generally anti-Israel than say he is pro-Israel, 30 percent to 28 percent. The percentage of voters who label Obama as pro-Israel is up slightly from a September 2011 survey for The Hill, as is the number of voters who say Obama is anti-Israel.

Overall though, the data hasn't changed much since 2011. In the September survey, 23 percent dubbed Obama pro-Israel, while 29 percent said the president was anti-Israel. In the most recent survey, 29 percent of likely voters said Obama is neither, which is a somewhat smaller figure than the 38 percent of voters who gave that answer in 2011.

These findings underline the American public's concern about Obama's policy on the Jewish state at a time of heightened fears about Iran's nuclear program. Israel has insisted that Iran must be stopped by any means necessary, including a military strike, from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The Obama administration has expressed its preference for a diplomatic solution, a posture that pro-Israel critics say is insufficiently muscular.

The White House appears to be refocusing on the U.S.-Israel alliance after spending the last few months on domestic issues. Vice President Biden is scheduled to address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's upcoming conference Monday, and Obama will make his first visit to Israel as president later this month.

Another question central to the U.S.-Israel alliance is how involved the White House should be in brokering a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. According to the latest Hill Poll, a majority of voters said Obama should be somewhat or very involved in brokering a deal, while just 32 percent of voters overall said he should be not at all or not very involved in the process.

By way of broad comparison, in a May, 2011 survey, just 24 percent said Obama should be more involved in brokering a peace between the two nations, while 50 percent of voters said Obama should not be more involved and a solid 26 percent said they were not sure.

As Obama embarks on a second-term push to secure his place in history, the president is no doubt thinking about his global reputation.

But according to a comparison of two recent surveys for The Hill, fewer voters now believe Obama has improved the United States' standing in the world.

In May 2011, 47 percent said Obama had improved the country's standing, while 38 percent said Obama damaged the nation's reputation. But in the Hill Poll's most recent survey, just 37 percent said the United States is more respected internationally than it was prior to Obama taking office, while a full 43 percent said the country is less respected in the world.

These findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 28 by Pulse Opinion Research.

"http://thehill.com/polls/287235-hill-poll-voters-see-economy-getting-worse-with-sequester?amp","Hill Poll: Voters see economy getting worse after sequester cuts","A strong plurality of voters believe economic conditions in the United States are getting worse, not better, according to a new poll for The Hill - and believe the $85 billion package of cuts known as the sequester will only make things worse.

In the first survey for The Hill conducted since the sequester kicked in a little more than a week ago, 48 percent of respondents said the country's economy is getting worse, while just 33 percent said the economy is improving.

Although many analysts have warned that the automatic cuts and the consequent furloughing of thousands of workers will harm the fragile recovery, last week saw several indications that job growth is actually picking up.

A report released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the economy added 236,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate dropped to 7.7 percent - its lowest level since President Obama took office. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average reached new, record highs four days in a row last week.

One explanation for respondents' pessimistic outlook despite the spate of encouraging economic news is the emphasis placed on the potentially catastrophic effects of sequestration by the administration and the news media.

According to The Hill poll, a majority of voters, 56 percent, believe the sequester will hurt the U.S. economy. Perhaps surprisingly, though, a strong plurality of respondents, 46 percent, said they were not expecting the sequester cuts to have a negative impact on their personal circumstances.

Party affiliation offers a partial explanation for voters' views on the country's economic condition. A full 67 percent of Republicans said the economy is worsening, versus just 26 percent of Democrats. On the flip side, just 15 percent of Republicans said the economy is improving, while 56 percent of Democrats believed this to be the case.

Notably, however, respondents who identified as ""Other"" tended to agree with Republicans: 22 percent of those independent voters said the economy was getting better, while 55 percent said it was getting worse.

But since sequestration became reality, critics of the administration have claimed that Obama and his team cried wolf on the impact the cuts could have on the economy.

In the weeks before the sequester hit, Obama traversed the country, touting the message that under no circumstances should the cuts be allowed to take effect. But he and his team made several dubious claims. Obama declared that Capitol Hill janitors would receive a pay cut under sequestration, but Capitol superintendent Carlos Elias insists that is incorrect. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Arne Duncan asserted on CBS that many teachers had received ""pink slips,"" but later walked back the statement.

Obama has since toned down his rhetoric, admitting that the cuts won't be ""an apocalypse."" But voters are not letting the president off easy: The Hill poll shows that a strong plurality of voters, 48 percent, said Obama and his team exaggerated the negative effects of the sequester cuts, while just 31 percent said the White House did not overplay its hand.

A plurality of the American public also believes the political news media are too soft on the administration. According to the Hill Poll, a solid 46 percent of respondents said the news media are excessively sympathetic to the president, while 28 percent said the press deliberately tries to hurt Obama and just 17 percent said they offer unbiased coverage.

Voters were mostly split along party lines on the question, but those who identified themselves as ""Other"" tended to agree with a strong majority of Republicans who said the news media are overly sympathetic to Obama.

These findings come as a spate of prominent national polls indicate that Obama's post-election honeymoon may be ending. Recent surveys from Gallup, Quinnipiac and CNN show that Obama's approval rating has dropped off slightly in the wake of the sequester. According to the Gallup poll, the president averaged 49 percent approval for the week ending March 3, down from 51 percent the prior week.

These results were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on March 7 by Pulse Opinion Research.

"http://thehill.com/polls/288641-hill-poll-voters-prefer-gop-budget-ideas-but-dislike-republican-party-?amp","Hill Poll: Voters prefer Republican budget ideas, but dislike GOP","More voters trust the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on budgetary issues, according to the results of a new poll for The Hill - even though a strong majority actually prefer Republican fiscal policies.

The discrepancy would appear to be rooted in the GOP's image problem, as the party attempts to recover from a bruising general election and recalibrate for a new generation of voters.

Respondents in The Hill Poll were asked to choose which of two approaches they would prefer on the budget, but the question's phrasing included no cues as to which party advocated for which option.

Presented in that way, 55 percent of likely voters opted for a plan that would slash $5 trillion in government spending, provide for no additional tax revenue and balance the budget within 10 years - in essence, the path recommended by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) last week.

This was almost twice as many voters as opted for a proposal that would include $1 trillion in added tax revenue as well as $100 billion in infrastructure spending, and which would reduce the deficit without eradicating it.

Only 28 percent of voters preferred this option, which reflects the proposal put forth by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) last week.

An even stronger majority of respondents, 65 percent, said U.S. budget deficits should be reduced mostly by cutting spending rather than by raising taxes. Just 24 percent said the budget should be balanced mostly by increasing revenue.

In general, Democrats favor a much greater emphasis on tax revenue than do Republicans, most of whom are adamantly opposed to any increased taxes at all.

Notably, many respondents who identified themselves as Democrats actually supported key Republican proposals, according to The Hill poll. Just 44 percent of Democrats said budget deficits should be reduced mostly by raising taxes, while slightly fewer, 40 percent, said balance should be achieved mostly by reining in spending.

By contrast, a strong majority of Republicans toed the party line. Eighty-eight percent, said deficits should be reduced by cutting spending, while just 7 percent said the budget should be balanced by increasing revenue.

However, as soon as respondents heard the words ""Republican"" and ""Democrat,"" the picture changed drastically. A plurality of voters, 35 percent, said they trust the Democrats more on budgetary issues, while 30 percent said they trust the Republicans more. A full 34 percent said they trust neither party.

These findings buttress the impression that the Republican label itself incites mistrust among many voters.

Since the 2012 election, which saw GOP losses in Congress as well as President Obama's reelection, the party has become increasingly divided over how to restore its tarnished reputation.

Speeches by two rising stars to activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week reflected the party's identity crisis. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio declared that the GOP does not ""need a new idea,"" while Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul called for a new Republican Party based on libertarian ideals to supplant a GOP that he charged had ""grown stale.""

One issue around which most of the party's constituency can coalesce is the objection to President Obama's healthcare overhaul. The GOP budget put forth by Ryan assumes that most of the healthcare reform law should be repealed.

Notably, a plurality of respondents in The Hill poll agreed with Ryan's assumption: Forty-five percent of voters said ObamaCare should be fully repealed, while just 37 percent said the law should be fully implemented.

The findings came from a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on March 14 by Pulse Opinion Research.

"http://thehill.com/polls/292239-hill-poll-voters-hillary-clinton-is-in-for-2016-will-win-dem-nomination?amp","Hill Poll: Voters: Hillary Clinton running in 2016, will win nomination","A majority of voters believe Hillary Clinton is running for president in 2016, according to a new poll for The Hill, and a plurality believe she will be the Democratic Party's nominee.

A full 51 percent of voters said the former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state is running for president in the 2016 election, while just 21 percent said she is not running. Meanwhile a plurality, 41 percent, believe Clinton will be the Democratic Party's 2016 nominee. Just 7 percent of voters said the party would anoint Vice President Biden, while 35 percent said the nominee would be someone else.

Democratic voters were more confident that Clinton would be the ultimate pick, with 53 percent saying she will be the nominee, 6 percent saying Biden will be chosen and 24 percent saying the party will go with someone else. Among Republicans, just 39 percent said Clinton would be the Democratic nominee, 7 percent predicted Biden, while 42 percent said the party would choose another candidate.

The question of whether Clinton will run for president in 2016 is not a new one, but the announcement last week that she will pen a memoir about world affairs and her experience as secretary of state has amped up speculation over her political future to almost feverish levels.

Clinton's closest advisers have insisted that she has not yet made a decision on a run for the White House, but that has not stopped the formation of a political action committee dedicated to promoting her candidacy called ""Ready for Hillary."" James Carville, a close friend of the Clinton family, a key advisor to Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign and a well-known Democratic strategist, joined the effort last week.

As Clinton's supporters encourage her into making another bid for the nation's highest office, a spate of recent polls show Clinton trouncing her potential opponents, both Democrats and Republicans, in hypothetical match-ups. An April 3 poll from Public Policy Poll showed Clinton leading a pack of potential Democratic nominees by 64 percent to 18 percent for the closest rival, Biden. In a general election match-up, Clinton led Republicans New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan by small margins. Such strong numbers could provide additional incentive for Clinton to run.

Although voters chose then-Sen. Barack Obama over Clinton during the 2008 primary campaign, five years later many are disappointed by Obama's presidency. According to The Hill poll, a solid 32 percent of voters said Clinton would have made a better president than Obama, while just 11 percent said she would have been a worse president and 45 percent said she would have been about the same.

Notably, 22 percent of Democrats said Clinton would have made a better president, while just 14 percent said she would have been worse. But just 14 percent of blacks said Clinton would have made a better president than Obama, while 25 percent said she would have been worse.

Although Clinton, if elected, would be the first female president, The Hill poll results showed no significant divide between male and female voters on these questions.

Almost four years out from the next presidential election, Washington is already buzzing about another potential Democratic frontrunner: Biden. But the results from The Hill Poll showed bad news for the vice president: A majority of voters, 57 percent, said Clinton would make a better president, while just 10 percent said Biden would make a better leader.

Notably, blacks tended to support a Biden candidacy more than any other race. A majority, 52 percent, of blacks said Biden is running for president, while only 28 percent of whites and 22 percent of other races said he is running. When asked which of the two would make a better president, whites picked Clinton by 59 to 9 percent. Blacks picked her by a much slimmer margin: 36 to 28 percent.

This discrepancy could be due to the vice president's close relationship with Obama, or to residual resentment toward Clinton from the heated 2008 Democratic primary.

The findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on April 4 by Pulse Opinion Research.

The FAA said it will work quickly with airlines and the 787 airplane's manufacturer, Boeing, ""to develop a corrective action plan to allow the U.S. 787 fleet to resume operations as quickly and safely as possible.""

The agency said the 787 battery failure's ""resulted in release of flammable electrolytes, heat damage, and smoke on two Model 787 airplanes.



""The root cause of these failures is currently under investigation,"" the FAA said. ""These conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical systems and structures, and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment.""

Boeing tweeted earlier Wednesday that it was ""aware of the ANA 787 diversion in Japan.

""We will be working with ANA and the authorities to determine what happened and why,"" the company said in its tweet.



The company said Wednesday evening that it was ""committed to supporting the FAA and finding answers as quickly as possible.

""The safety of passengers and crew members who fly aboard Boeing airplanes is our highest priority,"" Boeing President Jim McNerney said in a statement. ""The company is working around the clock with its customers and the various regulatory and investigative authorities. We will make available the entire resources of The Boeing Company to assist.""

McNerney added that Boeing was ""confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity.



""We will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787's safety and to return the airplanes to service,"" he said. ""Boeing deeply regrets the impact that recent events have had on the operating schedules of our customers and the inconvenience to them and their passengers.""



The FAA launched its initial review of the 787 after a spate of incidents involving the aircraft, including the first electrical fire that was sparked by a battery in Boston.



Additionally, another 787 developed a fuel leak last week, and the computers on a third plane wrongly indicated there was a problem with the brakes. No one was injured in any of the incidents.



Even as the FAA announced its initial review of the 787, Transportation Secretary LaHood and FAA Administrator Michael Huerta moved to reassured airline passengers that the aircraft was safe to fly on during a Friday press conference.

""I believe this plane is safe and I would have absolutely no reservations of boarding one of these planes and taking a flight,"" LaHood said. ""These planes are safe.""



Boeing Vice President Ray Conner argued at the same press conference that the 787 went through ""the most robust and rigorous certification process in the history of commercial aviation"" when it was initially approved by the FAA in August 2011.



""A lot of these issues are typical issues that come across with every airplane that's in service,"" Connor said.



The FAA said Wednesday that only one U.S. airline, United Airlines, is currently flying 787s. Airlines in other countries have also begun flying the airplane, however, though at least one Japanese airline has said it is also halting flights on the ""Dreamliner.""



The decision to ground the 787 could impact future orders of the aircraft for Boeing, which has touted the large airplane as a potentially big moneymaker.

"http://thehill.com/polls/280775-hill-poll-voters-oppose-deportations-but-see-border-as-vulnerable?amp","Hill Poll: Voters oppose deportations, but see border as vulnerable","A strong majority of voters oppose the deportation of people living in the United States illegally, but an equally large share of the electorate thinks that the nation's borders are not as secure as they should be, according to the results of a new poll for The Hill.

The findings underline the complexity of an issue that has taken center-stage since President Obama and a bipartisan group of senators put forward separate proposals for comprehensive immigration reform last week.

A decisive 64 percent of respondents in The Hill Poll said illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country, with 47 percent supporting the additional step of creating a pathway to citizenship for the same people.

By contrast, only 27 percent of voters called for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants to be deported.

But exactly the same share of voters - 64 percent - asserted that the borders of the United States are either ""not very secure"" or ""not secure at all.""

The latter finding could be a sign that the Senate's plan might be the more popular, because it would make the citizenship benefits ""contingent upon securing the border.""

Obama, by contrast, is supportive of tougher border measures but doesn't want to make the citizenship benefits dependent upon the security steps being taken first.

Party affiliation is a big factor underlying voters' views on immigration, the survey found, with 62 percent of Democrats supporting a pathway to citizenship versus 32 percent of Republicans; and 39 percent of Republicans backing mandatory deportations, versus 16 percent of Democrats.

Overall, respondents graded Democrats and Republicans almost equally when it comes to ""immigration and border security,"" with 41 percent favoring Obama's position and 39 percent preferring the GOP's.

Another question amid the immigration debate is whether same-sex couples should receive the same consideration as heterosexual couples under an overhaul of the system.

Behind Obama, Democrats are pushing for such equal treatment, which in practical terms would mean that non-citizen partners of Americans in same-sex unions would be entitled to a green card, just as is the case with heterosexual marriages.

But Republicans aren't on board with that proposal, and the Senate's reform blueprint excludes that language as a result.

The Hill's poll indicates that voters are split almost evenly on the issue, with 46 percent of respondents supportive of Obama's position and 45 percent opposed to it.

On that issue, both party and gender appear to play a significant role, with 59 percent of Democrats - and 52 percent of women - supporting the extension of benefits to same-sex couples, while 64 percent of Republicans - and 54 percent of men - oppose the same provision.

The findings were based on a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Jan. 31 by Pulse Opinion Research, an independent polling firm that borrows the automated procedures of Rasmussen Reports.

The push for immigration reform has risen near the top of the congressional to-do list this year, largely as a result of November's elections, which found Obama winning the support of Hispanic voters by a thumping margin of 71 percent to 27 percent over GOP contender Mitt Romney. Since then, GOP leaders have been seeking ways to attract more Hispanic voters to their side. A bipartisan reform bill, they hope, will do just that.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said this week that he's hopeful Congress will send legislation to Obama's desk this year.

""There's a lot of desire on both sides to move a comprehensive immigration bill,"" McConnell told Yahoo News.

"http://thehill.com/polls/284579-the-hill-poll-voters-pentagon-should-bear-the-brunt-of-deficit-cuts?amp","The Hill Poll: Voters: Pentagon should bear the brunt of deficit cuts","A majority of voters believe cutting America's debt is more important than maintaining domestic and military programs at their current levels, according to a new poll for The Hill.

But the public also feel strongly that the budget should be balanced on the back of reductions to defense spending rather than through cuts to programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

As the clock ticks down on any possibility of averting the sequester's across-the-board spending cuts, a solid 58 percent of respondents in The Hill Poll prioritized cutting America's debt over maintaining current spending levels on domestic and military programs. This figure is almost double the share of voters, 28 percent, who believed the opposite.

In order to reduce America's debts and deficits, more than twice as many voters said they would support defense cuts as said they would support cuts to social programs.

Forty-nine percent of respondents said they would support cutting military spending, while just 23 percent said they would support slashing Social Security and Medicare. An overwhelming majority, 69 percent, said they would oppose cuts to social programs.

The findings are particularly striking as Washington prepares for the looming sequester. Cuts amounting to $85 billion are scheduled to go into effect on March 1 if Congress cannot come to an agreement over deficit reduction.

Both parties agree that sequestration would have a damaging effect on the economy, but so far neither side has shown much willingness to compromise. President Obama has proposed the outline of a deal that would contain equal amounts of new revenues and spending cuts, but Republicans have refused to countenance new taxes and have complained that Obama's plan is overly vague.

Some voters appeared to cross party lines in their views on how to reduce the debt.

High numbers of both Republicans and Democrats said they would oppose cuts to social programs: 62 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats opposed cutting Medicare and Social Security, while just 29 percent of Republicans and 12 percent of Democrats supported potential cuts in those areas.

Notably, a higher percentage of Republicans opposed cuts to social programs (62 percent) than professed opposition to defense cuts (56 percent).

Further underlining the general preference for reductions in defense spending over cuts to social programs, 37 percent of respondents said America spends too much on the military, while just 18 percent said America spends too little.

Party affiliation is a factor underlying voters' choice between cutting the debt and maintaining spending levels, the survey found. Sixty-seven percent of Republicans say cutting America's debt is the more pressing need, in contrast to just 43 percent of Democrats. Conversely, 23 percent of Republicans said maintaining domestic and military programs at their current levels should be the priority. However, just 36 percent of Democrats prioritized maintaining current spending levels.

Notably, respondents who identified themselves with neither party appeared to align themselves with Republicans on the general issue of debt versus spending: 66 percent said cutting America's debt was more important, while just 22 percent chose maintaining current spending levels.

When asked whether America spends too much, too little or about the right amount on the military, voters also tended to break along party lines. But those respondents who identified as ""Other"" tended to align themselves with Democrats on that question: 49 percent of Democrats and 42 percent of those who identified as ""Other"" said America spends too much on the military, while just 13 and 12 percent, respectively, said America spends too little. Similarly, voters who viewed themselves as ""centrist"" tended to express similar views to those who identified themselves as ""liberal.""

Washington gridlock aside, some economists have pointed in recent months to positive economic news, like a recovery in the housing market and the rise of consumer spending. But in the face of the squabbling over the sequester, just 15 percent of likely voters say their personal financial position has improved over the past 12 months, while 37 percent of voters say it has gotten worse and 47 percent say it has stayed about the same. Democrats tended to be more optimistic: 20 percent of Democratic respondents said their situation had improved, while just 7 percent of Republicans agreed. A full 50 percent of Republicans said their situation had gotten worse, while just 24 percent of Democrats took such a negative view.

The findings came from a nationwide survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 21 by Pulse Opinion Research.

"http://thehill.com/regulation/administration/193419-democrats-split-on-gainful-employment-rules","Dems split on 'gainful employment' rules","Democrats in the House can’t reach agreement about upcoming regulations designed to cut off federal funds to poorly performing college programs.

Lawmakers are lining up on opposite sides of the effort, with some encouraging the Department of Education to finalize the contentious regulations and others hoping for a rewrite of the draft rules.

Separate letters in recent days have highlighted the split, with contrasting messages for the Obama administration as it tries to write rules holding for-profit schools and career training programs accountable for the education they offer. The regulations would outline what type of “gainful employment” graduates of those programs will need to have for their schools to continue receiving federal money.

“I think it’s refreshing,” Rep.(D-N.J.) told The Hill on Tuesday about the lack of a single party position. “I think if people are actually looking at this on the merits and not taking a knee-jerk party position, I think that’s a good thing.”

On Friday, he and 29 other Democrats wrote a letter to Education Secretary Arne Duncan worrying that the administration’s effort could “negatively impact millions of students nationwide.”

Meanwhile, 31 other House Democrats wrote a separate note arguing that the rule “will help protect student and taxpayer investments in career education programs and enforce current law.”

Supporters say that the rule is necessary to prevent some schools from ripping students off and leaving them saddled with debt but unable to get a good job. But Democrats pushing for revisions worry that the rule, while well intended, would use imperfect metrics and could rely too heavily on the administration's upcoming college rating system.

Many Republicans, meanwhile, have told the administration to entirely abandon its effort, arguing that the rules could end up hurting students.

The Education Department is expected to release a draft regulation early in the new year.

It would be the administration’s second try at a “gainful employment” rule. A federal judge struck down the administration’s previous attempt last year.

That “wasted a lot of time and money and effort,” Andrews said.

He said that Congress would ultimately be responsible for defining ""gainful employment"" when it reauthorizes the Higher Education Act, the nearly 50-year-old law that governs federal student aid, which is up for renewal in 2014.

“I’d rather us try to compromise and write a statutory definition that serves the purpose of the system,” he said.","2013-12-17 16:54:40","1","31.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","223.0","213.0","0.0","144.0","0.0","32.0","22","401","93.98","53.99","11.25","34.42","22.28","30.67","84.79","43.39","8.48","2.74","1.00","0.25","0.00","0.75","0.75","5.74","9.73","13.47","5.74","2.74","4.24","0.75","12.22","1.75","0.75","0.75","1.75","1.50","4.99","2.74","2.24","0.50","0.75","0.50","5.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.75","10.22","1.25","0.75","3.24","2.00","0.50","3.49","1.50","0.25","1.00","0.25","0.25","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.96","1.75","3.24","10.22","2.00","0.75","2.00","7.23","1.50","11.97","0.75","6.23","5.24","14.96","0.50","0.50","2.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","16.96","4.99","3.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.25","4.49","2.00","0.50","0.00","2060","9.25","29.214285714285715","644","394","18","49.25","14.5","11.8","14.45","15.3","113","13.125","22.232081218274114","231","26.07","9","0.41","0","13","4","42","0","47","32","1","0","10","67","25","5","31","0","0","14","2","15","0","0","4","12","0","26","9","17","6","11","11","3","1","0","1"
"http://thehill.com/regulation/administration/276875-obama-tosses-auto-booklets-into-the-crusher","Obama tosses auto booklets into the crusher","President Obama has signed legislation doing away with a 1972 law that required auto dealers across the country to have booklets on hand about the crashworthiness of their vehicles.





For decades, the federal government has printed and distributed booklets containing crashworthiness information to tens of thousands of dealerships around the country.



The law that required the books threatened dealers with $1,000 fines if they didn’t make them available when customers requested them.



Problem was, hardly anyone ever did.



“For all of the years I’ve been in business, I cannot recall that a customer has ever asked to see the booklet,” said Bill Underriner, a multi-franchise dealer from Montana. “Printing and mailing this booklet has simply been made obsolete by technology.”

Underriner, chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), praised President Obama for signing a bill repealing the 1972 law and stopping the production of the booklets.Penned by Reps. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) and Bill Owens (D-N.Y.), the bill passed the House and Senate without opposition. Obama signed it on Thursday.The action follows an NADA survey that found 96 percent of the group’s members had never been asked for the brochure in the 21 years they were required to stock it. The information contained in the booklets, detailing the differing costs of insurance to repair vehicles of varying makes and models, is readily available online and can be quoted by any trained insurance agent.Lawmakers touted the law’s repeal as an example of measures that can be taken to slash wasteful and onerous regulations that are costly to taxpayers and burdensome to the private sector.“This new law is another important step in peeling back outdated and unnecessary rules that businesses must deal with on a daily basis,” Harper said in a statement issued by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “This was a bipartisan effort to help eliminate regulatory red tape and I hope to see similar successes in the months ahead as President Obama has stated that it is a priority of his administration to identify and eliminate costly, outdated and unneeded regulations.”","2013-01-14 14:15:00","1","39.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","4.0","0.0","214.0","213.0","0.0","137.0","0.0","32.0","22","352","93.62","56.78","8.56","30.57","29.33","29.26","76.99","45.17","7.10","2.56","0.85","0.00","0.00","0.28","1.42","4.55","9.94","14.49","7.67","2.56","5.11","1.14","11.93","1.99","0.85","0.28","1.99","1.99","2.56","1.42","1.14","0.28","0.28","0.28","5.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","7.39","1.70","1.42","1.14","1.42","1.42","1.42","1.70","0.85","0.57","0.28","0.28","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.09","1.14","1.14","6.25","0.57","0.85","4.83","6.53","0.57","10.23","1.14","5.40","3.98","11.08","1.99","0.57","3.98","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.06","5.11","3.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.85","2.27","1.14","1.70","0.28","1775","9.43","35.6","559","343","17","50.97","13.7","11.2","14.1","14.1","104","10.2","22.208279883381927","212","30.7","10","0.43","0","14","6","41","0","41","20","0","0","3","50","38","1","29","0","0","10","2","9","0","0","0","11","0","14","17","9","18","6","10","6","0","0","1"
"http://thehill.com/regulation/administration/276877-administration-faces-backlash-over-down-payment-rules","Administration faces backlash over down payment rules","Financial and consumer groups are mounting strong opposition to an Obama administration proposal that they argue will make it harder for young people and minorities to afford a down payment on a home.



The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released sweeping new mortgage lending rules last week aimed at preventing the risky lending practices that helped fuel the financial crisis.



The proposals mostly won high marks from the financial industry and consumer-rights organizations, but a separate call from other regulatory agencies for toughened requirements on down payments is fomenting anxiety.

The administration wants to require borrowers to pony up down payments totaling as much as 20 percent of home costs to ensure that homeowners don’t take out loans they can’t afford.But many see the proposal as an overcorrection that could damage the fragile housing market just as it is beginning to recover from the national foreclosure crisis. If adopted, the rule would make buying a home prohibitively expensive, particularly for young people and minorities, critics say.“Saving up for that down payment is really the biggest hurdle to homeownership,” Mortgage Bankers Association spokesman John Mechem said. “That’s all about inherited wealth.”The plan is opposed by financial and consumer groups, which are at odds over other parts of the lending reform debate. Forty-six trade organizations and other groups, largely hailing from those two sectors, formed the Coalition of Sensible Housing Policy to fight the proposed rule. Civil-rights groups including the NAACP also joined in opposition.“Requiring down payments of 10 or 20 percent is deemed by some as ‘getting back to basics.’ However, well-underwritten low-down-payment home loans have been a significant and safe part of the mortgage finance system for decades,” the Coalition wrote in comments to federal regulators.

The Center for Responsible Lending (CRL), a member of the coalition, has also raised concerns about proposed rules. The group is pressing regulators to refrain from setting any down-payment threshold in the rule.

“The market should dictate the down payment,” CRL spokeswoman Kathleen Day said.

"http://thehill.com/regulation/administration/277039-report-obama-officials-issued-216b-in-new-regulations-last-year","Report: Obama officials issued $216 billion in regulations last year","The Obama administration issued $236 billion worth of new regulations last year, according to a report from a conservative think tank.

The analysis from the American Action Forum, led by former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, found that the administration added $216 billion in rules and more than $20 billion in regulatory proposals in 2012. Complying with those rules will require an additional 87 million hours of paperwork, the report said.

The group put the total price tag from regulations during Obama’s first term at more than $518 billion.

American Action Forum credited the administration for erasing $2.5 billion in regulatory costs last year, but said that paled in comparison to $34 billion in regulatory compliance costs reported by top companies since 2009.

The Environmental Protection Agency racked up the most in regulatory costs last year, according to the report, issuing $172 billion worth of rules. Regulations from the healthcare reform law tacked an additional $20.1 billion in costs onto the economy.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, several EPA clean air rules and the Affordable Care Act were the most notable regulatory expenses last year. But prison reform standards and conflict minerals regulation also cost a total of $10 billion in 2012, the report found.

Though the study lists the costs of regulations, it does not calculate any benefits that might have resulted from them.

Vice President Biden, who is heading a gun-violence task force formed in the aftermath of the Newtown, Conn., shooting, is preparing this week to give the president a list of recommendations. He has said executive action is on the table.

CAP, which has close ties to the Obama administration, said the president should act unilaterally to bolster the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS.) Gun dealers are required to use the system to screen for felons, drug abusers, the severely mentally ill or others who are prohibited from owning firearms.

But the database is woefully incomplete, and the federal government is partly to blame, CAP argues in its report. The group cites the case of Jared Lee Loughner, who in 2008 was excluded by the Defense Department from serving in the U.S. Army because of his struggle with drug abuse. But the agency did not submit a record to the database. Two years later, Loughner bought a Glock 19 semiautomatic handgun used in the Tucson, Ariz., shooting spree that killed six people and wounded 13, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.).

Obama “can just start by ensuring that the federal government, people within the federal government, turn over their records, also, through the background check system,” CAP President Neera Tanden said in an interview on “Fox News Sunday.”

Additionally, the group urged the Obama administration to issue an order directing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderEric Holder says he'll decide on a 2020 run by early next year Walker sets special election date after losing court fight Eric Holder says he’s considering presidential bid MORE to withhold certain Justice Department grants from states that fail to create or implement plans to transfer records to the FBI. Most states currently do not share records for the database.

Gun Owners of America Executive Director Larry Pratt countered that the criminal background database is not the answer and such background checks give Americans “false security.”

“Some of the most horrendous of the mass murders that have occurred recently, including the one in Newtown, would not have been stopped by a background check,” Pratt said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The gun is stolen. The person has no prior criminal record.”

CAP is also calling for federal audits of licensed gun dealers to ensure they do not employ people who themselves are banned from owning firearms.

“Drug addicts shouldn’t work behind the counter at a pharmacy — and felons shouldn’t sell guns in gun stores,” the group charges in its report.

CAP believes Obama should also expand reporting requirements for gun dealers. Federal law already requires dealers to alert the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) when someone buys multiple handguns within a five-day period. Certain rifles and shotguns should be added to those reporting requirements, CAP contends.

The group is recommending that Obama also direct the FBI to absorb ATF, and reclassify it as a unit within the bureau, saying funding problems and a “leadership vacuum” have made it impossible for ATF to function properly as a standalone agency.

ATF, CAP said, “has become a beleaguered agency that is unable to adequately fulfill its mission to oversee and enforce federal firearms laws.""","2013-01-14 15:19:00","0","31.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","221.0","213.0","0.0","144.0","0.0","32.0","22","537","95.55","66.58","4.19","6.85","23.35","27.19","68.16","39.11","5.03","1.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.56","0.56","3.91","9.68","12.48","6.70","1.49","4.10","1.49","11.36","2.61","1.49","1.12","1.49","2.05","3.91","1.12","2.79","0.19","1.30","0.56","7.82","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.74","7.08","0.93","1.12","1.49","1.49","0.37","2.05","1.68","0.19","1.49","0.00","1.49","0.00","1.49","0.00","0.19","8.38","0.93","1.68","5.21","0.37","1.12","2.79","7.45","0.93","9.68","0.93","4.47","4.10","6.70","0.19","0.19","1.12","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.69","5.59","5.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.74","3.35","0.93","1.12","0.00","2690","8.88","30.22222222222222","831","534","27","51.38","12.6","11.0","13.23","13.2","144","7.666666666666666","20.706516853932584","312","26.44","22","0.38","0","13","8","56","0","50","24","0","0","5","83","94","1","35","0","0","7","5","23","0","1","0","19","0","27","14","16","13","12","28","5","4","0","1"
"http://thehill.com/regulation/energy-environment/278539-consumers-herald-new-mine-safety-rule-","Consumers herald new mine safety rule","The rule, unveiled last week by the agency’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), comes in response to the 2010 explosion at Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch mine, which killed 29 men. The blast was the worst mining disaster in 40 years.



In the explosion’s aftermath, MSHA issued a scathing report finding Massey systematically violated health and safety rules that, if followed, could have prevented the deaths.



Under the new regulations, MSHA can more easily crack down on mine operators with patterns of violating health and safety violations.



“It is gratifying to have MSHA tighten its reigns [sic] on mine operators and hold them accountable,” NCL executive director Sally Greenberg said in a written statement. “We hope this new rule gives MSHA the authority it needs to regulate rogue operators, better protect miners, and prevent another mine disaster from occurring,”



The rule will take effect March 25.

Among other things, individuals and families can request money to pay rent, make home repairs and make up for other losses that are not covered by insurance.

Thursday evening, New York Governor Mario Cuomo announced that FEMA has also given New York a 30-day extension for applying for individual assistance.



In addition, FEMA has extended access to its Transitional Sheltering Assistance program, by 14 days. That will allow New Yorkers to stay in hotels through February 9 if their homes were damaged by the storm.



Cuomo said these changes will help affected residents facing the prospect of losing their shelter during the current cold snap.



""We remain committed to assisting all victims of Hurricane Sandy, ensuring that they have the shelter they need, especially in this cold weather,"" Cuomo said. ""The Transitional Sheltering Assistance program will continue to provide shelter to those New Yorkers who do not have homes to return and help others with critically needed funding to rebuild.""

On Friday, FEMA confirmed that the deadline for Connecticut to apply for Sandy relief would be extended from January 28 to February 12.



The extensions for the three states come as Congress is considering a $50.7 billion Sandy relief bill for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The House has already approved that bill, and is waiting for the Senate to take it up, which could happen next week.



President Obama has already signed into law a bill that allows the National Flood Insurance Program to go $9.7 billion deeper into debt in order to deal with Sandy-related claims.

The Environmental Protection Agency has already proposed rules that would require new plants to adhere to tough new limits. Additional ruled issued by the EPA would meet with staunch opposition from congressional Republicans.“The Environmental Protection Agency has been overly zealous,” Rep.(R-Ky.) said during remarks this week at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners’s (NARUC) winter meeting.

“If they start trying to do this with existing plants, they’re going to have a real battle,” he told reporters afterward.



Obama signaled his intention to press for measures to counter the effects of global warming during last month’s inaugural address.

“We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,” Obama said. “Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.”



Democrats heralded the remarks. Acknowledging that gridlock would make it difficult for any major climate legislation to win congressional approval, some lawmakers have urged Obama to press forward on his own.



For his part, Obama has shown a willingness to use his executive authority on issues ranging from immigration to gun control. But it is unclear how far he would go in his State of the Union speech, to be delivered Tuesday to a joint session of Congress.

"http://thehill.com/regulation/finance/282041-aclu-lauds-new-housing-rule","ACLU lauds new housing rule","“Discrimination today often takes subtle forms, and the HUD rule ensures that people will be able to battle discrimination,” Dennis D. Parker, the director of ACLU’s racial justice program, said in a statement.

HUD said the new rule, which has been heavily opposed by the financial industry, is intended to provide “clarity” for individuals, the government and businesses about what qualifies as discrimination.

The rule allows parties to claim that they have been discriminated against by lenders without having to prove it was intentional. In order for the claim to found valid, however, statistical analysis must show that certain groups of people faced more negative outcomes than others.

The ACLU has followed the issue closely. Last fall, the group released a report that said the high demand for loans encouraged predatory lending. It has also recently been involved in lawsuits against gender discrimination in housing practices and taken on large banks for their involvement in high-risk, subprime loans.

HUD, which has the authority to carry out the regulations within the Fair Housing Act, interprets it to “prohibit practices with an unjustified discriminatory effect, regardless of whether there was an intent to discriminate,” according to a pending Federal Register document. “The eleven federal courts of appeals that have ruled on this issue agree with this interpretation.”","2013-02-08 23:13:00","1","25.0","0.0","13.0","1.0","4.0","0.0","215.0","213.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","31.0","20","216","96.34","60.95","19.04","51.78","21.60","30.09","81.02","44.91","7.41","0.93","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.93","6.48","9.26","16.67","7.41","2.31","3.24","0.93","12.50","4.63","1.85","1.85","0.46","1.39","3.24","2.31","0.93","0.46","0.46","0.00","6.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.65","3.24","2.78","0.93","0.46","1.39","3.24","1.85","0.46","1.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.35","1.85","1.85","9.72","0.93","0.46","5.09","6.48","0.46","10.19","1.39","6.02","2.31","6.94","0.46","0.93","3.24","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.00","16.20","4.63","6.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.46","3.70","0.46","0.00","0.00","1142","9.77","24.11111111111111","360","215","10","41.19","14.3","12.9","14.68","15.3","69","10.5","23.437209302325584","149","22.56","6","0.42","0","3","0","22","0","30","18","0","0","2","38","13","0","20","0","0","4","1","6","1","0","1","9","0","9","7","3","11","3","10","4","1","0","0"

"http://thehill.com/regulation/finance/282839-cfpb-moves-to-help-consumers-banks-with-regulation-compliance","CFPB moves to help consumers, banks with regulation compliance","“Both consumers and industry will win when the new rules are understood, applied, and carried out evenly and effectively,” said CFPB Director Richard Cordray in a statement. “Mortgage borrowers, who have dealt with much heartache since the financial crisis, deserve this level of attentiveness.”

ADVERTISEMENT

In order to assist both industry and the public with the execution of the rules, the agency said on Wednesday that it would take a number of steps, such as making plain-language guidelines and expectations and coordinating with other federal agencies. The CFPB will also publish updates to the federal interpretations of the regulations that will respond to consumer and industry comments and concerns.

Further, “readiness guides” are set to be available this summer, the agency says, and will include preparation checklists for banks.

The regulations with the Jan. 21 deadline issued by the agency include several amendments to the Truth in Lending Act, including the ability-to-pay and qualified mortgage provisions of Dodd-Frank, which require lenders to “make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay.”

Qualified mortgage rules also attempt to tamp down on risky lending practices, restricting certain points and fees tacked onto loans, among other features. It would also give creditors a “safe harbor” from lawsuits.

Other recent CFPB rulemakings aim to tackle the bonuses that mortgage originators gain from steering consumers into loans with particular terms and the way in which subprime mortgages are issued.

Financial institutions have been largely critical of the bureau’s actions, which they claim are overly restrictive.","2013-02-13 17:10:00","0","25.0","0.0","13.0","1.0","4.0","0.0","214.0","213.0","0.0","137.0","0.0","32.0","22","257","96.36","60.75","10.94","81.77","23.36","33.07","81.32","42.41","5.84","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.39","5.45","8.95","15.56","5.45","1.95","6.61","0.00","10.12","2.72","1.56","1.95","0.39","1.56","4.67","3.89","0.78","0.39","0.39","0.00","3.89","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.39","2.72","2.33","1.17","0.00","0.78","1.17","1.17","0.00","1.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.73","0.00","2.72","5.45","1.95","1.17","1.95","5.45","2.33","10.89","1.17","6.61","2.72","10.89","0.00","1.95","8.56","0.39","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.73","4.28","6.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.56","3.89","0.78","0.00","0.00","1380","10.08","32.375","418","253","11","39.67","13.7","13.4","15.96","16.8","85","13.625","24.638735177865613","169","28.75","4","0.41","0","12","1","27","0","29","26","0","0","6","37","17","0","37","0","0","3","0","7","0","0","1","10","0","13","4","5","5","10","2","5","1","0","1"
"http://thehill.com/regulation/finance/283839-consumer-bureaus-work-confusing-duplicative-chamber-says","Consumer bureau’s work ‘confusing,’ ‘duplicative,’ Chamber says","David Hirschmann, the Chamber’s senior vice president, sent a letter last week to CFPB Director Richard Cordray offering six suggestions for how the agency could “eliminate inefficiency and unjustified burdens"" in its oversight role. He said the bureau is often making “extremely expansive requests for information” that date back more than a decade, creating huge costs for companies.

“It effectively gives carte blanche to Bureau investigators to impose huge financial burdens on companies at the outset of an investigation,” Hirschmann wrote. “We are not aware of any other agency that routinely issues such broad demands.”

The Chamber criticized the bureau for bringing enforcement attorneys to examination meetings, a practice that Hirschmann said sets an “adversarial” tone at the agency.

The CFPB says attorneys are permitted to join the examination meetings to stay informed about the issues facing the agency. The presence of the attorneys is not meant to signal to a company that an enforcement action is imminent, according to the bureau.

Hirschmann also alleged that the CFPB refuses to correct errors in examination documents, “requiring companies to invoke the complex examination review system in order to correct even the most obvious of errors (presumably because a correction would mean the embarrassment of returning the letter to supervisors in Washington who then would become aware of the factual error).”

The Chamber notes that it sent the bureau a similar letter in July without seeing action on most of its suggestions.

“The effect of this continued uncertainty and inefficiency is not simply to impose excessive, unjustified costs on legitimate businesses seeking to comply with the law — it directly constrains the lending, especially lending to small businesses that our economy desperately needs in order to grow and create jobs for the millions of Americans who remain unemployed,” Hirschmann wrote.

The CFPB was created by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, and has faced a torrent of opposition from business groups and Republican lawmakers who say it is unaccountable. The bureau says that it doesn't ""seek to burden industry beyond what is necessary to comply with the law and protect consumers.""

The Chamber said its letter to Cordray should not be interpreted as taking a position on the legality of his tenure.

A federal court last month cast doubt on Cordray’s position by overturning recess-appointments to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). President Obama recess-appointed Cordray as CFPB director at the same time.","2013-02-19 21:33:00","0","28.0","0.0","13.0","1.0","4.0","0.0","214.0","213.0","0.0","137.0","0.0","32.0","22","402","98.18","70.80","18.73","8.14","26.80","30.85","79.60","42.79","6.47","1.00","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.50","0.00","5.47","11.44","15.42","4.23","2.74","2.99","1.49","11.44","3.48","1.99","1.24","0.50","1.24","2.99","0.75","2.24","1.00","0.25","0.00","8.21","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.50","13.18","4.23","2.74","1.24","1.49","2.24","1.74","1.74","0.25","1.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.71","1.24","1.00","5.72","0.25","0.50","2.74","5.47","0.50","11.44","1.74","6.22","3.48","11.19","0.00","0.00","3.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.94","3.73","2.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.75","3.98","0.75","1.00","0.00","2126","9.7","31.153846153846153","693","400","15","35.91","16.6","14.9","14.92","17.8","120","10.3","24.680000000000003","226","27.54","8","0.41","0","6","1","48","0","46","37","0","1","4","66","34","1","32","0","0","7","5","17","1","1","0","21","0","18","12","13","6","4","15","4","4","0","1"

"http://www.newsweek.com/former-nsa-boss-michael-hayden-cant-stop-talking-224812","Former NSA Boss Michael Hayden Can't Stop Talking","First off, I say, let’s get that Amtrak thing straightened out.

Michael Hayden chuckles. The former eavesdropper-in-chief totally gets the irony of having someone secretly listening in on his phone conversation during a train trip to New York last October. Even more delicious was the revelation that the person eavesdropping on him was Tom Matzzie, former director of the Washington office of MoveOn.org, the lefty political group that is a decrier of all things NSA.

Matzzie live-tweeted Hayden’s “on background” conversation with a reporter, in which he included a few “disparaging quotes” about President Obama.

“I wasn't trashing him—that was misreporting!” says Hayden. “Let me tell you what I talked about. I’d been asked about Angela Merkel,” whose cell phone conversations the NSA had listened in on, according to über-leaker Edward Snowden. “And I said, ‘Hey, look…when the president was elected, when he was president-elect, he was fixated with his BlackBerry, and we said, ‘No Mr. President. you can't use that.’ And he said, ‘Well, I am going to use that.’ And we said, ‘Well, all right, fine, give it to us for a few days and we’ll fool around with it and give it back to you.”

And “the backstory of that,” Hayden adds, “is the security establishment is telling the soon-to-be-most-powerful man in the world in the most powerful country on Earth, that if he chooses to use his Blackberry in the national capital, a whole bunch of foreign intelligence services are going to be reading his e-mail and listening to his phone. And that's what I said.”

And the backstory to that backstory, of course, is that everybody does it -- everybody spies on everybody all the damn time -- if they can.

Matzzie “took it to be bashing the Obama administration,” Hayden says. “And that was the only thing I said. I mean, the guy was the political director of MoveOn.org.”

Hayden chuckles again.

The retired Air Force general, a former chief of both the CIA and NSA, seems to be everywhere these days — giving speeches and interviews, working the Sunday talk shows. There he was again yesterday, on BBC TV, explaining the recommendation of a White House panel to curtail NSA spying programs.

So very un-spook-like.

For a lifetime intelligence officer, he’s pretty talkative. His immediate predecessors, Porter Goss and George Tenet, are rarely heard from. Tenet, CIA director in the Clinton and first George W. Bush administrations, turns down many requests for interviews and speeches and “hasn't appeared on a Sunday show since 2007,” his spokesman Bill Harlow told Newsweek. Even the garrulous Leon Panetta, who replaced Hayden as CIA director in 2009, finally seems to be fading away to a quiet retirement on his California walnut farm after a stint as secretary of defense, among other high-level appointments and a career as a congressman before those.

Only James Woolsey, CIA director for a short while in the Clinton administration, seems to be all over town, yapping about this and that, but his advocacy of the Iraq War and other neoconservative adventures seems to have whittled down his stature.

Is Hayden running for office? Looking for another job in a future administration?

He laughs again. “If I picked up that phone, my wife would cut off my hand!”

What phone? Any phone, he says—any phone bringing a summons from a president to return to government.

“Now, I know I appear to be incredibly youthful,” he jokes, “but on my next birthday, I'll be 69. It's time to start enjoying your grandkids—that’s what it is.”

Hayden does appear comfortable in his expansive corner office in downtown Washington, with big windows overlooking a busy intersection only a few blocks from the White House. Along with other big guns at the Chertoff Group, the consulting firm headed by another all-everything, Michael Chertoff, the former homeland security secretary, he’s cashing in and having a ball.

“I’m here about half my time,” he says. “I teach at George Mason. I have a bunch of boards and consultancies and a very good speakers bureau …”

In February, he’s doing a joint speaking gig in Munich with his Israeli counterpart, Maer Dagan, the former head of Mossad. They were so close when Hayden ran the CIA, a well-placed source says, that the Israelis were afforded the unique privilege of bringing cell phones and laptops into the spy agency’s headquarters. Nobody but nobody gets to do that.

When asked about this courtesy, Hayden demurs. “I just don't remember it specifically.”

""I have no desire to be back in government,” Hayden insists. “Miss the mission, miss the people,” but those top spy jobs are killers.

The big joy of life today, he says, is that, “I get to say what I think.”

And he does. One big thing he thinks is that nobody really understands what the NSA is and isn’t doing, despite blockbuster revelations going back to 2005, a cascade of legal suits, judges’ orders curtailing its practices and the river of data and charts channeled through the media over the past six months by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

It’s just too complicated, he argues, to boil down. It’s a huge problem. Members of the intelligence committee had a hard time getting a grip on it too, he says, when he was NSA director.

“To be fair, though, this is obscure stuff. I mean, I'd be up there [in a hearing]– and I'm pretty good at this stuff—I'd be explaining things for 30 or 40 minutes, with my introduction, and slides and maps and so on, and then I say, ‘I'm ready for your first question.’ And it was clear to me they didn't understand a word that I’d said. Not to be judgmental, it's just that this is very obscure.”

As he’s said ad nauseum, NSA is not targeting Americans! Nobody gets that, he says, starting with reporters!

“I have people in your profession calling me up about the Snowden revelations saying, ’What does this mean, what does that mean?’ I'd say, ‘That's not incidental collection, that's inadvertent collection—a different thing altogether.’ And it’s, ’What-the-hell…?’ And you’ve got to to walk them through it.”

He offers a more concrete example. Stories that say NSA is targeting Americans’ e-mails are “technically correct, and a lie at the same time. I mean, what you’re talking about is foreign intelligence collection—I'm generalizing here, but I'm just trying to give you an example— you've got foreign intelligence collection, you're collecting against a foreign intelligence target. If the foreign target is in communication with a ‘protected’ person, a U.S. citizen—well, game on, that’s been permitted since 1952, you can cover the target. And then you have to minimize the U.S. identity and so on. So in a sense, yes, quote, including U.S. e-mails, quote—if I have five minutes, I can explain it on Meet the Press and everyone can go, ‘Yes, that kinda makes kinda sense,’ but that’s five minutes on ‘including U.S. e-mails,’ and I lose that [argument], NSA loses that, every time, because it takes too long to explain.“

You see the problem? Nobody seems to know what the hell they’re talking about here, maybe not even Hayden.

One of the NSA’s problems, he says, is that Snowden’s revelation of massive eavesdropping arrived “in this swirl of fear about government overreach,” especially since Obama’s election, whipped up by the Tea Party.

Hayden says even he fears “executive overreach.” Putting aside the question of whether the government has gone overboard in monitoring the telephone and computer habits and practices of American citizens—not to mention allied presidents and prime ministers—the former NSA chief avers that he, too, is worried about putting in place the tools for a future police state.

He says he warned President Bush about pushing the NSA over the line, reminding him how the agency had been rocked by revelations of illegal domestic spying in the 1970s.

“When I went into see President Bush, when he was authorizing the Terrorist Surveillance Program, I said, ‘Mr. President, we need to be very careful here. Since the mid-1970s, my agency has had a permanent one-ball, two-strike count on it. . . I actually said that to the president.”

Hayden is a man who knows his audience--Bush had been an owner of the Texas Rangers.

“And he said, ‘Michael, I understand. But we are going to do this.’”

And, of course, the NSA got caught out, first in 2005 by The New York Times, which exposed the so-called warrantless wiretapping program, and then by Snowden.

Obama’s counterterrorism policies have been even more muscular than Bush’s, Hayden acknowledges. Nevertheless, NSA has been “very cautious about” domestic spying all along, he insists.

But of course, there’s a lot of disagreement about that. So the next time you glance up at the television over the bar at your favorite watering hole, you’ll likely see Michael Hayden, the happy warrior, trying to explain it all yet again.

“What I'm trying to say is, this is an R-rated movie, this is for adults,” he says. “This is how this works.”

"http://www.newsweek.com/atheists-foxholes-want-chaplains-too-207609","Atheists in Foxholes Want Chaplains, Too","As the U.S. Senate renews debate on the National Defense Authorization Act, secularists are pushing lawmakers to add an amendment to the bill that would permit non-religious chaplains in the military. Their initiative, which includes extensive lobbying efforts and a P.R. campaign, aims to provide equal access to counseling for religious and non-religious recruits. As it stands now, members of the military who seek psychological help from a therapist or counselor are not entitled to confidentiality, so what they reveal in those conversations could be seen “as a black mark” on their record – potentially jeopardizing their career, Lauren Anderson Youngblood, Secular Coalition for America spokeswoman, tells Newsweek. Conversations with a chaplain, however, are “100 percent confidential.”

So what does this mean for the 4 percent of military members who identify as humanists and the approximately 12 percent who say they have no religious preference? According to Youngblood, nones seeking help are often steered toward a religious chaplain “who may evangelize."" Overall, the group says 60 percent of military chaplains ""evangelize,"" though only 1 percent of military members identify as evangelicals.

“There’s not a single humanist chaplain,” she says, adding that nones “are risking their lives, giving all these sacrifices to defend all our rights as Americans. Part of these rights are freedom of religion and they’re being discriminated against. How ironic is that?”

The need for humanist and non-theist chaplains is real and pressing, she says, since so many soldiers have endured multiple deployments in recent years, and struggle with immense grief and combat trauma upon their return home.

Secularists, however, previously had a hard time making this case to legislators.

Colorado Democratic Rep. Jared Polis pitched this amendment to the House this summer, when the Congressional chamber was reviewing its version of the NDAA. It didn’t have a prayer: 150 Congressman voted in favor of the amendment, but 274 voted against it. Some House Republicans decried the proposal, implying that atheists were insensitive nihilists who can’t be trusted to deal with the important issues chaplains sometimes have to handle.

Texas Republican Rep. Mike Conaway said, “I can’t imagine an atheist accompanying a notification team as they go into some family’s home to let them have the worst news of their life and this guy says, ‘You know, that’s it — your son’s just worms, I mean, worm food.’”

John Fleming, a Republican from Louisiana, said the amendment would “make a mockery of the chaplaincy… The last thing in the world we would want to see was a young soldier who may be dying and they’re at a field hospital and the chaplain is standing over that person saying to them, ‘If you die here, there is no hope for you in the future.’”

Fleming submitted an counter-amendment to bar humanists from serving in the military chaplaincy. Though 173 members of Congress voted against that amendment, 253 voted in favor of it.

Non-theists hope to do better in the Senate, where they know they have at least one friend, Iowa’s Tom Harkin who, earlier this year, became the first sitting senator to ever address the foundation, Youngblood says.

Should the amendment fail in the Senate, however, the foundation will ask supportive legislators to write the Department of Defense, requesting the agency change the chaplain corps policy.","2013-12-03 12:34:47","1","28.0","3.0","7.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","82.0","48.0","0.0","183.0","6.0","24.0","23","561","84.89","80.38","5.52","25.77","23.38","28.34","81.11","45.99","10.16","4.10","0.36","0.36","0.71","0.36","2.32","6.06","8.56","13.19","7.13","3.57","5.70","1.25","14.26","4.10","2.50","2.32","2.14","3.57","3.57","1.78","1.78","0.36","0.18","0.36","12.12","0.18","0.36","0.36","0.36","9.98","1.78","1.43","1.96","2.32","0.53","3.03","3.03","0.89","1.78","0.36","1.07","0.00","0.71","0.00","0.36","9.63","2.50","1.25","4.99","0.71","1.25","3.03","9.80","1.43","8.56","0.53","4.46","3.57","3.57","0.36","0.89","0.18","3.92","0.53","0.18","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.89","4.63","7.49","0.18","0.00","0.36","0.00","0.89","3.21","2.14","0.00","0.00","2818","8.65","31.77777777777778","874","557","25","48.84","13.8","12.0","13.7","14.6","138","10.7","20.83023339317774","327","27.67","7","0.45","0","14","10","65","0","63","33","1","2","10","90","49","2","34","1","0","22","8","20","1","0","1","18","0","27","16","22","6","24","18","2","9","0","2"
"http://www.newsweek.com/2013/11/01/whats-bugging-head-nsa-243888.html","What's Bugging the Head of the NSA?","Around the CIA's executive suites a few years ago, General Keith Alexander was known as ""The Weasel."" Not a weasel, The Weasel.

""He'd leave the room after some briefing or meeting or whatever and we'd all look at each other,"" a former denizen of the spy agency's seventh floor told me. ""Sometimes we'd just laugh. We knew he'd just lied to us, or been less than truthful about something we were supposedly working on together.""

Now everybody in the world knows Alexander can be a proficient liar, thanks to Edward Snowden's dripping spigot of top-secret NSA documents.

Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, got a taste of the NSA director's ""weaseliness"" this summer when he learned that Alexander's claim that the agency's massive data collection programs had thwarted 54 terrorist plots was a big fat lie. ""The American people are getting left with the inaccurate impression of the effectiveness of NSA programs,"" Leahy told Alexander.

When Google and Yahoo, who've made billions tracking our shopping habits, are upset about the NSA breaking into their servers, as was reported by The Washington Post this week, you know the agency is out of control.

Or is it?

The phrase ""rogue elephant"" comes to mind. It entered the political lexicon 40 years ago, after a series of revelations that Army intelligence, the NSA and the FBI had been spying on American citizens, particularly antiwar and civil rights activists, and that the CIA had been concocting assassination plots against Cuba's Fidel Castro and other foreign leaders.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

Senator Frank Church, the Idaho Democrat who presided over explosive 1975 hearings into the plots, suggested that the spy agencies were running wild. The idea was that presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford, as well as the armed services committees of the House and Senate (there were no intelligence committees back then) didn't know what was going on.

Decades later, CIA veterans were still bristling, mostly in private, over that canard. ""The Kennedys knew exactly what we were doing in Cuba,"" a former aide to CIA Director Richard Helms groused to me over a scotch one rainy day years ago.

This time, the spooks are pushing back - with media leaks, no less - against the Obama White House's suggestion that it didn't know about the NSA's astonishing range of data collection, including, perhaps, listening in on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone chats.

John Prados, author of a new history of the era, The Family Jewels, calls the ""rogue elephant"" idea a ""fiction.""

""That cute turn of phrase got Frank Church a lot of headlines, but it was ill-considered and created more misunderstanding than enlightenment,"" he writes. ""Intelligence agencies operated under presidential control at all times."" That doesn't mean the White House knew everything the spooks were up to, of course, ""but they made it clear what they wanted.""

Another astonishing thing learned from Snowden is how little the NSA and other intelligence agencies know about the millions of people with top-secret security clearances working for them. We've learned that some NSA workers used their powerful computers to check up on their ex-wives and girlfriends.

Nicholas Von Hoffman, a longtime friend of mine who wrote about the Church Committee hearings as a Washington Post columnist in 1975, offered a darker potential of thousands of such people with access to telephone and email intercepts, working at their computers after hours. ""Just the law of averages, X number of them are going to be crooks,"" he said in a telephone conversation. ""Eavesdropping on Merkel talking to Deutsche Bank and the IMF ""can be turned into money...extortion, insider trading. Somebody ought to be talking about that.""

Peter Fenn was 27 when he went to work as an investigator for the Church Committee in 1975. In late September, he and other veterans of the probe gathered at Georgetown University to discuss ""the lessons learned back then that should be applied now.""

Turns out, they still didn't have all the facts. ""What none of us knew on that Tuesday, September 24, was that the NSA Watch List that we had uncovered and investigated in 1975 contained two names: Frank Church and Howard Baker,"" a Republican leader in the Senate at the time, Fenn wrote in a little-noticed op-ed piece for the Idaho Statesman a few weeks ago. ""Two senators were spied upon, and it was kept secret for nearly 40 years. This was a bombshell that would have exploded across the land back then.""

What about today's NSA, I asked Fenn in a telephone interview this week. ""Rogue elephant?""

""Rogue elephant referred to activities of the CIA, especially in the area of assassinations, with Castro in Cuba in particular,"" he recalled. ""In a lot of that activity, those folks were taking oral instruction and running rogue with it.""

Under the principle of ""plausible denial,"" the spooks left certain unsavory details, such as murder plots, unspoken in the president's presence, he said. ""A lot of it was set in motion with a wink and a nod."" (Decades later, the CIA was careful to get approval for kidnapping and torturing terrorist suspects in writing from the George W. Bush White House.)

So the question for the current president is: What did he know, and when did he know it?

""My sense is when the president gets his daily brief, it doesn't take a mental giant to know where this [information] is coming from,"" Fenn said. ""I mean, it didn't come from bar talk.""

As for oversight of the intelligence agencies, it's Groundhog Day for Fenn and other veterans of the ""rogue elephant"" scandals. There is talk about getting a new round of hearings by a special investigating committee launched, he said.

It's hard to see what will come of that, other than finger-pointing between the president and the intelligence oversight committees that were established to stop such abuses 40 years ago.

""Oversight obviously hasn't work very well...."" Fenn said, ticking off all the House and Senate committees - armed services, intelligence, homeland security - not to mention the secret surveillance court, supposedly keeping the spy agencies in line. ""They tend to go native. There is a plethora of people with fingers in the pie.""

For starters, there's Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. After months of defending the NSA, the California Democrat declared last week that she was shocked to learn that ""the Senate Intelligence Committee was not satisfactorily informed"" of the NSA eavesdropping on Merkel.

Shocked? Oh, right. But it will be fun watching Alexander try to weasel out of this mess. To do that, he might have to take down a president. But for that, he'd better have something in writing.","2013-10-31 20:22:51","1","43.0","5.0","6.0","1.0","10.0","5.0","72.0","43.0","0.0","153.0","6.0","23.0","20","1131","89.75","70.83","35.34","43.49","19.50","23.87","79.66","47.30","9.99","3.80","0.53","0.88","0.09","1.41","0.88","6.19","9.20","14.85","7.07","4.07","4.51","1.15","14.41","5.13","2.48","1.50","1.50","1.77","3.45","2.21","1.24","0.27","0.44","0.00","8.58","0.27","0.18","0.18","1.33","9.73","3.54","0.80","0.35","1.95","1.24","2.39","2.30","0.88","0.97","0.35","0.80","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.44","8.75","2.03","1.41","4.51","0.97","0.44","6.98","6.19","0.88","14.06","1.68","6.90","5.75","5.92","0.62","0.62","0.62","0.44","0.27","0.44","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.27","0.00","21.93","5.31","6.98","0.18","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.97","5.04","2.56","0.35","0.18","5422","7.83","20.714285714285715","1640","1123","56","59.53","11.9","9.9","12.3","12.6","227","6.071428571428571","18.125485307212823","535","19.12","25","0.47","0","32","13","126","0","152","73","4","0","8","159","148","0","81","2","0","49","7","41","2","0","7","24","0","31","73","33","25","23","22","4","10","0","7"
"http://www.newsweek.com/how-federal-agents-closed-silk-road-206","How Federal Agents Closed in on Silk Road","The Glen Park public library in San Francisco is usually a quiet, calm place. No more so than the science-fiction section, where nerds congregate to read their emails on the free Wi-Fi. On Tuesday that tranquility was rudely interrupted when half a dozen FBI agents descended on the startled sci-fi guys and surrounded, then arrested, a 29-year-old man quietly working on his laptop.

The FBI claims the man it detained, Ross William Ulbricht, is an international drug smuggler known online by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts. They say he is responsible for setting up and running Silk Road, an ingenious underground online illicit marketplace known as ""the Amazon.com of illegal drugs.""

Ulbricht has been hit with a number of serious charges: narcotics trafficking conspiracy (including more than a kilogram of heroin, five kilograms of cocaine, 10 grams of LSD and 500 grams of methamphetamine); computer hacking conspiracy; and money laundering conspiracy. As soon as Ulbricht was lifted, Silk Road was promptly shut down, the result of a nearly two-year investigation by the FBI — headed by agent Christopher Tarbell, the Eliot Ness of online crime, and a tech-savvy investigator known simply as Agent-1 — that involved moles who infiltrated the market, hackers, thousands of counterfeit IDs, and an attempted assassination.

""The Silk Road website has served as a sprawling black-market bazaar where illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services have been regularly bought and sold by the site’s users,"" said Tarbell. ""Based on my training and experience, Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today. The site has sought to make conducting illegal transactions on the Internet as easy and frictionless as shopping online at mainstream e-commerce websites.""

Silk Road could only be accessed through The Onion Router , a network designed to protect online anonymity and make it extremely difficult to physically locate computers accessing certain websites. Silk Road transactions were paid in Bitcoins, an electronic currency designed to be as anonymous and untraceable as cash.

The challenge wasn’t in determining that Silk Road was conducting thousands of illegal transactions – undercover FBI agents had been buying drugs and employing hackers since November 2011. The challenge was determining the true identity of Dread Pirate Roberts , an arch-criminal masterminding the site whose name was lifted from William Goldman’s book and film The Princess Bride.

While Tarbell led the investigation, Agent-1 had the hacking skills necessary to penetrate Roberts’s domain. The identity of Agent-1 is not quite what it seems. He may not simply be a Fed agent with computer skills.

See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows

Some believe Agent-1 is actually Hector Xavier Monsegur, a.k.a. Sabu, a leading figure in the hacktivist collective Anonymous and member of an elite group of hackers known as LulzSec. Tarbell arrested Monsegur in June 2011 and, like a Cold War spy, turned him, using him to track down other members of LulzSec. The FBI has continued to postpone Monsegur’s trial, leading many to conclude that he continues to work as an informant.

Agent-1 and Tarbell started their investigation with an exhaustive search of the Internet, including the Surface Web and Deep Web, for clues about their cunning prey, the ingenious amoral hacker running Silk Road.

The first mention of Silk Road that Agent-1 could find was a January 27, 2011 post titled “anonymous market online” on a discussion forum catering to those whose drug of choice is psychedelic mushrooms. The user who posted the query was identified simply as ""altoid,"" and the post linked to a Wordpress blog created just four days earlier. Agent-1 then found a second post made just two days later on a Bitcoin discussion forum. The unidentified user of that post was also altoid.

The timing of the posts and the fact that both ended with ""Let me know what you guys think,"" led Tarbell to conclude that altoid was someone drumming up business for Silk Road.

Altoid posted to the Bitcoin forum again about eight months later, this time looking to hire an ""IT pro"" for a ""venture backed Bitcoin startup company."" The post instructed interested parties to email rossulbricht@gmail.com. It was a breakthrough for Tarbell and Agent-1. They now had a name.

The email address was linked to a Google+ account – Google’s social network – and included a photograph of Ulbricht. This matched a ""Ross Ulbricht"" LinkedIn profile picture, which gave Tarbell the first personal details of his main suspect.

The Fed agents discovered that Ulbricht graduated from the University of Texas in 2006 with a bachelor of science in physics and went to graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania School of Materials Science and Engineering from 2006 to 2010. On the profile, Ulbricht said his personal goals changed after grad school, shifting to ""creating an economic stimulation to give people a firsthand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.""

Then came a second breakthrough. Tarbell noticed that several of the links Ulbricht shared on his Google+ page matched websites and YouTube videos regularly cited by Roberts.

Tarbell obtained logs from Google to determine that the Gmail account was regularly accessed by a Comcast IP address. He tracked this virtual address to a building on Hickory Street in San Francisco, and discovered it belonged to a close friend of Ulbricht. According to a YouTube video posted by Ulbricht and his pal, Ulbricht was staying with the friend when he moved to live in San Francisco in September 2012. Ulbricht’s house move coincided with references by Roberts to the Pacific time zone.

Roberts ran Silk Road by accessing the site with a virtual private network (VPN), so that only a specific IP address could access it. The investigation stalled for a while when it was discovered the contents of this VPN server had been erased. But then came a stroke of luck. Tarbell and Agent-1 found a single record of the last IP address used to access the VPN server and traced it to an Internet café on Laguna Street, less than 500 feet from the address on Hickory Street where Ulbricht was staying.

""Based on my training and experience, this evidence places the administrator of Silk Road, that is, DPR, in the same approximate geographic location, on the same day, as Ulbricht,"" Tarbell wrote in the complaint.

Meanwhile, oblivious that Federal agents were now tracking his every move, Roberts came under heat from an unlikely source. A customer on Silk Road with the username ""FriendlyChemist"" threatened to reveal a long list of real names and addresses of Silk Road vendors and customers unless Roberts paid $500,000. One of the world’s most successful drug dealers was being blackmailed.

Roberts pondered what to do. With his multimillion-dollar business at risk, he contacted someone using the username ""redandwhite"" and agreed to pay him $150,000, in Bitcoins, to kill FriendlyChemist.

Redandwhite told Roberts he had made the hit and that he would no longer hear from FriendlyChemist. He showed him photographs of FriendlyChemist's corpse as proof. If a killing did take place, there is no official record of it. Canadian police say they do not have any record of a homicide that matches what little is known of the victim and the purported assassin.

Tarbell and Agent-1 eavesdropped on the mercenary relationship between Roberts and redandwhite, and on June 1, 2013, came the third breakthrough in the case. Roberts contacted redandwhite to ask about buying counterfeit IDs so he could rent more servers to increase the capacity and reach of Silk Road.

On July 10, 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection intercepted a package from Canada with nine counterfeit IDs. The information on each ID was different, yet all were addressed to the same location on 15th Street in San Francisco, and each featured an image of Ulbricht. When approached by Homeland Security, Ulbricht denied all knowledge of Silk Road and refused to answer questions about the IDs, though officers were able to establish an important fact about his behavior: He always paid his rent with cash. When Homeland Security questioned Ulbricht’s roommates, they said they only knew him as ""Josh"" and that he spent most of his time sitting alone in his room, working on his computer.

The final piece of the puzzle fell into place when Tarbel and Agent-1 found the record of an account created on Stack Overflow, a question-and-answer service used by programmers, with the user name ""Ross Ulbricht"" registered to the Ross Ulbricht Gmail account. The user name was later changed to ""frosty,"" but the account holder posted questions about software code that coincided with code used in the construction of Silk Road’s website.

The Internet café Ulbricht used to inhabit to throw investigators off the scent was right next door to the Glen Park public library. When Ulbricht was arrested, police also seized about 26,000 Bitcoins belonging to him, worth about $3.6 million. His arrest and the subsequent closure of Silk Road caused the value of Bitcoin to drop 20 percent, thought it has since recovered.

"http://www.newsweek.com/how-shutdown-hammered-us-economy-427","How the Shutdown Hammered the U.S. Economy","Before the latest congressional melee over government spending, the U.S. federal deficit was shrinking and seemed poised to shrivel even more in the near future. As a percentage of the nation’s gross domestic product, the cash shortfall had dropped by half in the past two years, according to Standard & Poor’s senior credit analyst Marie Cavanaugh, who heads the ratings team in charge of assessing the U.S. credit rating.

In other words, the United States was on track to slash its deficit and enjoy the spoils of its growing financial recovery – until the shutdown, which has socked the economy in the nose and soured investor confidence everywhere.

“Earlier this year, we raised our outlook for the U.S. from negative to stable based on the ability of Congress to negotiate its way out of the fiscal cliff, the nation’s strengthening economic recovery and the fact that the nation’s deficit had fallen by half of the 2011 level,” Cavanaugh told Newsweek just before Congress cobbled together a last-minute deal.

Now the same ratings agency estimates that the government shutdown knocked $24 billion out of the U.S. economy in just two weeks. That is more than $1.5 billion a day.

Essentially, the fighting over spending leaves America with less to spend.

“The bottom line is the government shutdown hurt the U.S. economy,” stated S&P’s chief economist Beth Ann Bovino, on the heels of an eleventh-hour budget compromise that effectively delays key fiscal decisions until next year. “In September, we expected 3 percent annualized growth in the fourth quarter, because we thought politicians would have learned from 2011 and taken steps to avoid things like a government shutdown and the possibility of a sovereign default.” (In 2011, consumer confidence hit a 31-year low; just this week a Gallup poll similarly showed investor confidence dropping to its lowest level in almost two years. Probably not a coincidence, as both polls took place during congressional standoffs.)

S&P, which has been the only ratings agency to slash the nation’s top-flight credit rating (also in 2011), now expects this year’s fourth quarter GDP to straggle in at closer to 2 percent.

That’s if the U.S. is lucky. With full expectations that consumer confidence will continue to plummet amid the “short turnaround for politicians to negotiate some sort of lasting deal,” Bovino predicts, “If people are afraid that the government policy brinksmanship will resurface again and, with it, the risk of another shutdown or worse, they’ll remain afraid to open up their checkbooks. That points to another humbug holiday season.”

Cavanaugh says the agency estimates that for every week in which the government was shut down, roughly 0.3 percent of the nation’s GDP was destroyed. Not really good thing for a country that, until recently, “was running one of the highest deficits the world has seen since World War II, as a share of the economy,” according to Nikola Swann, Cavanaugh’s predecessor and the credit analyst who led the team that voted the U.S. credit rating down back in 2011. The U.S. rating remains in the second-best slot, behind Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

Swann, who tracked U.S. fiscal health for some time, traces much of the trouble back to 2001, when the September 11 attacks led to a downturn in the nation’s economic growth and spiraling spending in the lead-up to the war on terror.

The U.S. did begin to recover by 2007, he says, but then it was buffeted by the financial crisis.

By 2009, the nation’s cash deficit – the annual gap between spending and revenue as a percentage of its GDP – had swelled to 11 percent, he says. Compare that to a surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2000. At present, the cash deficit has eased to under 5 percent, Cavanaugh says, but remains at the high end.

“Remember, the Clinton administration benefitted from very high rates of economic growth, real rates that were around 3 percent to 5 percent of GDP,” Swann says. “We increased spending but never got back to the high growth rates.”

Bovino warns the U.S. still has much to lose if its fiscal game of chicken doesn’t end.

A default, Bovino says, “would be devastating for markets and the economy and worse than the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008” and “put the economy in a recession and wipe out much of the economic progress made by the recovery from the Great Recession.","2013-10-17 13:57:13","1","32.0","3.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","79.0","48.0","0.0","177.0","6.0","24.0","23","760","98.42","58.83","34.15","21.72","28.15","24.74","76.71","44.08","5.92","1.18","0.00","0.66","0.00","0.26","0.26","4.74","11.18","16.71","3.95","3.03","4.47","0.66","8.42","5.26","3.55","0.92","4.61","3.03","5.00","2.37","2.63","0.66","0.66","0.66","3.95","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.39","6.45","1.05","1.18","1.05","1.58","1.05","1.71","1.32","0.26","0.79","0.13","0.53","0.39","0.13","0.00","0.00","10.53","1.58","2.11","6.32","1.45","1.05","3.68","4.21","1.18","17.11","1.97","8.95","6.58","6.84","0.66","0.13","4.87","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.00","6.45","7.11","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.79","2.50","1.84","0.53","0.66","3587","7.65","32.791666666666664","1090","755","36","67.08","11.9","9.1","11.72","12.6","142","11.75","17.92317880794702","379","28.71","33","0.44","0","20","30","95","0","106","48","5","3","4","159","78","2","28","0","0","9","8","35","2","1","3","26","0","21","35","13","17","3","24","8","3","0","1"
"http://www.newsweek.com/2013/10/25/science-passes-hat-243706.html","Science Passes the Hat","This may be hard to believe, but even Kickstarter has its limits. True, the crowdfunding website has so altered modern life that the name has become shorthand for any pass-the-hat online platform, as in ""You know GiveForward? It's like a Kickstarter for killer medical expenses, like liver transplants,"" or ""Offbeatr? Think Kickstarter, only for porn."" But as the growth of those alternative sites implies, Kickstarter isn't meant to raise cash for every scheme. For one thing, the site's guidelines specifically rule out investment pitches to develop ""pornographic materials"" - and they also forbid solicitations for causes of any sort, no matter how worthwhile.

Kickstarter also demands tangible results - and that can be a daunting challenge for scientific researchers. ""Everything on Kickstarter must be a project,"" the guidelines say. ""A project is something with a clear end, like making an album, a film, or a new game. A project will eventually be completed, and something will be produced as a result."" Science seldom works that way - most research efforts yield nothing more substantial than the publication of an article in a journal, if that. Failure is an everyday thing for every scientist. The data don't coalesce; the drug doesn't work; a rare species stubbornly refuses to show itself in the wild.

The good news is that science-specific crowdfunders have begun filling the void. With names like Petridish.org and Microryza, online innovators are willing to embrace the abstract nature of most scientific investigations. And the need has never been greater. Budgets are crumbling at America's proudest bastions of research support, like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and NASA. ""There are more and more ideas out there, and there isn't enough money to support them,"" says Cindy Wu, co-founder of Microryza.

Not that Kickstarter ignores the sciences. Earlier this year the site actually helped the private backers of the planned Arkyd space telescope to drum up more than $1.5 million. Other recent undertakings have been successful, if somewhat less dramatic, such as an illustrated field guide to slime molds. But the main difference between Kickstarter and, say, Microryza, is that the latter site's rewards are almost entirely intangible. ""For science, the actual output is more knowledge,"" says Wu.

The idea for Microryza fell on Wu like a virtual apple. She and her co-founder, Denny Luan, met as undergraduates at the University of Washington, where they were members of the school's synthetic biology team. A few years ago their team earned a gold medal in a national science competition by modifying a harmless E. coli bacterium to attack the anthrax pathogen. But Wu hit a wall when she tried to raise funds to test the technique against the antibiotic-resistant infection known as MRSA. ""The current research system doesn't fund researchers like you,"" Wu recalls her professor saying.

The professor managed to scrape up the cash for her, but Wu began pondering a larger problem: how to fund research when money is scarce. She spoke with more than 100 scientists and found that just about every one of them had some bright idea sitting on the shelf, unable to attract financial backing. In some cases the researcher had a good academic record, but the idea was deemed too speculative; in others the idea was solid, but the researcher was young and unproven.

Wu and Luan launched Microryza a year ago. It has been a godsend to some fledgling researchers, but it's no less useful to established scientists: Its most effective offering to date was a study by Bisakha (Pia) Sen, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who raised more than $22,000 to examine the effects of state gun-control policies on firearm death rates, crime rates, and children's access to guns.

Sen credits her campaign's success to help from Wu and others and to the media attention it drew. The publicity wasn't just luck: Sen says she spent at least an hour every night for several weeks cold-emailing every journalist and columnist she could find. She calls it ""an uphill battle"" and advises other researchers to set lower targets, say $5,000 or so. Crowdfunding is no substitute for a federal grant, she says: ""This is probably better for grad students and small projects. This is not the solution to the NIH cuts."" For now, however, it beats no help at all.","2013-10-22 18:27:19","1","24.0","2.0","6.0","1.0","10.0","5.0","76.0","43.0","0.0","137.0","6.0","21.0","14","751","89.86","53.73","11.67","47.97","18.77","26.76","80.69","45.94","6.92","2.40","0.00","0.00","0.27","1.46","0.67","4.53","9.85","13.45","6.79","3.86","6.52","1.86","11.32","7.06","5.19","0.80","1.20","3.99","3.86","2.40","1.20","0.00","0.53","0.27","6.66","0.00","0.13","1.46","0.00","13.18","2.80","1.86","0.80","2.80","2.26","4.13","1.86","0.40","1.20","0.27","1.46","0.13","0.93","0.27","0.00","8.26","0.93","2.93","3.99","1.33","0.67","3.60","7.72","0.53","9.19","0.53","5.19","3.46","8.12","0.80","0.00","2.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.71","5.46","6.39","0.53","0.40","0.27","0.00","1.46","2.66","1.86","0.27","0.40","3635","8.52","19.666666666666668","1113","740","42","62.07","11.7","9.0","12.24","11.6","188","7.5","19.202162162162168","427","18.26","9","0.45","0","32","10","96","0","83","63","9","3","6","137","58","2","53","0","0","21","7","27","6","2","4","23","0","27","23","10","12","15","31","0","1","0","5"
"http://www.newsweek.com/if-cia-cant-find-its-own-secrets-snowden-didnt-have-chance-2750","If the CIA Can't Find Its Own Secrets, Snowden Didn't Stand a Chance","In the vast river of documents and charts flowing from Edward Snowden, only a few of the CIA’s have bubbled to the surface, even though the fugitive whistle-blower worked for the spy agency nearly as long as he did for the NSA and its contractors.

The simplest explanation could be that Snowden had far less access to sensitive secrets as a lowly CIA Internet technician than he did when rooting around the NSA’s computers for three years. But anyone who has worked at the CIA could supply another explanation: We can’t easily find some of our deepest secrets, either – and we like it that way.

The reason lies in the computers holding the names of the CIA’s foreign spies, contacts and potential assets.

As every spy trainee learns, running “traces,” the agency’s word for a background check on a potential recruit, is one of the first steps in a process that ends with seducing a foreign official, soldier, nuclear scientist, or terrorist banker into spying for the United States. It’s as fundamental and necessary as waiting for a green light at an intersection.

An initial search might find nothing more than what Google can turn up: a name, address, job history, and immediate relatives. If the target comes from the Middle East or a tribal society like Pakistan, the file might have something about the individual’s religion, clan or political affiliations. It should also say whether the person has worked for a U.S. intelligence agency, and how that turned out. If the target is on a “burn list” – fired for reasons ranging from corruption to fabricating information to selling secrets – that should glow red in the traces.

Or the search might turn up nothing. Too often, a handful of CIA veterans tell Newsweek, operatives find that a name that should be in the file – say, of a ranking foreign official – isn’t. Or that important information is missing or incomplete; either outcome can introduce havoc, and even a fatal error, into a recruitment pitch.

Compounding the problem, especially since 9/11, is that Arabic and other non-Roman alphabetic names can be transliterated in myriad ways.

Add to that built-in security hurdles, and you’ve got a system that is unreliable and hard to use. “There are too many different databases,” a longtime CIA officer says. “There is no one centralized trace system. You gotta have three different accesses, because of our special handling issues, and even then you don’t know what’s in there. It’s like that terrorist database. It’s a nightmare.”

That the CIA “has the best trace system in the entire intelligence community,” he adds, “should tell you everything you need to know.”

CIA veterans – and FBI agents who have had temporary assignments with the CIA – marvel at the operations directorate’s reports system, called Hercules, which allows a headquarters desk officer to punch up overnight cables from a CIA station in, say, Islamabad, with the click of a mouse. Compared to the FBI’s clunky and long-troubled computerized case management systems, it’s a dream.

But the CIA’s traces system is a labyrinth with many trapdoors. Former CIA operations officer Ilana Greenstein recalls that her training session in 2002 on how to use it stretched over three days. In Baghdad three years later, she learned firsthand its limitations. As a favor to a Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) operative, she asked for a trace on a potential Iraqi agent who swore he was working with a CIA-backed group.

The answer came back negative. Just as the DIA was about to reject the Iraqi as a liar, Greenstein asked for the trace to be run again with different name spellings. Bingo: He was telling the truth. (Greenstein, who won six exceptional performance awards before quitting the agency in 2008, says she was reprimanded for letting her DIA colleague into the CIA’s classified facility.)

Another former senior CIA operative calls the system “inherently inaccurate.” As chief of a CIA station abroad, he once searched for information in the files on a foreign ministry official he was interested in recruiting. “I checked out our local database and didn’t see anything,” he says. “So I wrote a cable requesting a headquarters database check. It came back negative. The next day, I went into the office and there was an email in there from my predecessor, saying, ‘Hey I know this guy. He’s already been encrypted’ – given a code name – ‘and here’s his crypt.’ So I punched in the crypt, and there was a whole bunch of stuff I pulled up. That’s because there was a slight misspelling of the last name. So it doesn’t take much to miss something.”

Minor glitches can turn into major gaffes when the White House is on the line. It’s not uncommon for top administration officials to ask the CIA for information on a foreigner who makes contact claiming to have inside information on Iran’s nuclear program, a Syrian official who wants to defect, and so on.

“I have seen this several times: Every time you get a request from the White House or the State Department about somebody – ‘This guy has shown up, what do you know about him?’ – I have seen the entire seventh floor pucker up and cross their fingers because we have been burned so many times,” says a CIA officer.

“Or the Pakistani interior minister says, ‘We’ve just arrested this guy, and he’s your spy,’ and we’re asked about it. And we say we don’t have anything on him. But sure as s**t, two weeks later, there it is in the database and no one ever saw it: It was in a restricted-handling database, and no one ever looked. And this has happened on numerous occasions, in all those different scenarios [in which] they come back to us and we don’t have anything.”

The difficulty is compounded when rival intelligence agencies don’t let the CIA, nominally the leader of overseas spying missions, know what they’re up to. In Beirut a few years ago, Lebanese security queried the CIA about a man detained for suspicious activity. “Not ours,” the agency responded after a files check. Turned out he was the FBI’s counterterrorism spy. The Lebanese were not pleased and left they guy in jail.

Despite such confusion, there’s little call to reform the system, agency veterans say. In its screwball way, it works – like an old lawn mower that needs several cranks to get going – while making it harder for people like Snowden to steal the family jewels.

“The mind-set is (and I can understand the mind-set), ‘You know what? We’ve got sensitive stuff, and we don’t want [anyone like Snowden] just showing up and being able to access it,’” says the longtime CIA officer, a view echoed by a half-dozen other agency veterans.

“The [feeling] is, we’ll suck it up for source protection, because if you have a very efficient system, it means every source is in there for the taking – and there are sources in there you really, really don’t want people to know about.”

It doesn’t make much sense, he concedes. It’s one thing to make something hard to find, it’s another thing to lose it. But most CIA operatives are willing to live with the system’s lapses if – however inadvertently – they help prevent intruders like Snowden from stealing secrets.

“It’s not that the traces are all screwed up,” he insists, belatedly backpedaling on the numerous anecdotes suggesting just that. “You hear about the bad things, but in general, 90 percent of the time, you get what you need.”

The CIA declined to comment for this story.

"http://www.newsweek.com/cia-has-new-spy-guy-and-well-tell-you-who-he-163","The CIA Has a New Spy Guy, and We'll Tell You Who He Is","Frank Archibald is a nice guy in a killer job – literally. Last May the affable, hulking former Clemson University rugby player, 57, was named head of the CIA's National Clandestine Service, which is home to the agency's spies and hunter-killer teams, like the ones dispatched to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Libya and elsewhere in search of al Qaeda and other terrorist spore.

Not that you've seen his name all over the news. Breaking with its decades-long practice, the CIA declined to identify Archibald when he was appointed head of the NCS, even though the 30-year veteran's name was well-known among congressional oversight committees, Pentagon counterparts and journalists who cover the CIA, not to mention scores of friendly and not-so-friendly foreign spy services, including Pakistan's, where Archibald served as station chief a few years ago.

Indeed, only hours after the CIA made known Archibald's anonymous appointment, media organizations turned up a few details. The Washington Post described him as ""a longtime officer who served tours in Pakistan and Africa and was recently in charge of the agency's Latin America division, according to public records and former officials."" The Associated Press confirmed Archibald's previous job as head of the agency's Western Hemisphere division and added that he ""once ran the covert action that helped remove Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic from power.""

From there it was an easy leap for Columbia University journalism professor John Dinges, a Latin American specialist and former NPR News managing editor who has written highly regarded books about the CIA's relations with South American intelligence services, to ferret out Archibald’s name. ""It was pretty obvious who he was,"" Dinges told the website Mashable. ""It took me about five minutes to find out. It wasn't secret, nobody leaked it.… "" Within minutes, Archibald’s name circled the globe. And one downside was immediate: One website used Google Earth to post a photo of Archibald’s house. So go the hazards of the Internet Age.

But no one suggested harm would come to Archibald from that ""outing,"" and several CIA veterans remain puzzled by the agency's militant silence. Is it the Obama administration's penchant for secrecy? Going back 50 years, the agency's practice was to publicly identify and praise most of Archibald's predecessors. Why? Paradoxically, it's a job that requires a certain degree of public exposure. The spy chief's duties require him to visit regularly with the FBI, NSA and the dozen other branches of the U.S. intelligence community, to testify to congressional oversight committees and to meet with his foreign counterparts, either here or in some of the world's most dangerous neighborhoods. Nearly two dozen of his predecessors have been known to the public.

It's too bad they're going all black-cloak with Archibald, because after the bumpy tenures of the past few people in that job, the agency could benefit from letting people know that it has a ""quiet professional"" at the helm, as one former colleague put it, a figure of continuity at an agency that has changed CIA directors six times since 2003.

""Frank's an excellent officer and should do well – assuming his health problems don't catch up to him first,"" said a former senior CIA official, who recalled that many headquarters officials were worried the heavyset Archibald would have a heart attack when he was station chief in Pakistan. ""I always liked Frank,"" added another source, who like all the others quoted here demanded anonymity while discussing someone who, officially, remains undercover. ""He's had other significant responsibilities in the past, and done them well.""

""He has a good reputation for being a decent, not-screwed-up senior manager, a person with some equilibrium,"" another former CIA officer added. ""All I ever heard was that he was conscientious, intelligent, and, above all, not screwy. I know that sounds funny, but sometimes when people get up [to that position], people say he's a nice guy, but he’s crazier than a loon hen. It happens all the time.""

Archibald's understated management of the agency's covert operation to undermine Milosevic during the Clinton administration – a blueprint for running a successful peaceful covert action, agency sources told the AP – drew praise on Capitol Hill, where members of the intelligence committees were used to razzle-dazzle ""bullshit"" from ""CIA cowboys.""

Archibald's style is, apparently, disarming. The lumbering small-town South Carolinian (listed at 6 feet, 2 inches and 250 pounds when he tried out and failed to make the Clemson football team in 1978), usually showed up with his tie askew and ""his jacket was never on for long,"" one admiring observer told Newsweek.

Archibald probably learned something about persistence at Clemson, where he never got into a football game, the team's media rep told Newsweek by way of explaining why the offensive lineman's name isn’t on any of the 1978 to 1983 rosters. He just kept showing up for practice. A CIA colleague said he gave it up for club rugby.

After a stint in the Marines, Archibald began his CIA career as a weapons man in the agency's special activities division – the ""knuckle-draggers,"" as they're known around headquarters – during the Bosnian civil war. From there, he made it into the agency’s elite spy corps, rising to the rank equivalent of general in Pakistan.

How Archibald got his new job remains a mystery to everyone Newsweektalked to. One source thought he'd caught the eye of David Petraeus, whose brief tenure as CIA chief was short-circuited in 2012 by an extramarital affair. Other agency veterans think current CIA director John Brennan liked the former Marine's non-confrontational style. Bonus points: There was not a whiff of scandal in his background, unlike that of the acting chief, who was closely identified with harsh interrogations and passed over in favor of Archibald. She stayed on as his deputy.

One agency veteran has a more nuanced take on the appointment: ""Brennan is his own clandestine ops chief."" Another added, ""[Brennan] doesn’t like anyone to argue with him much.""

But there are plenty of things to argue over, insiders say, starting with the layers upon layers of assistants to deputy assistants that clog the agency's chains of command. Many agency old-timers are also dismayed that the CIA’s core mission of spying on major adversaries seems to have been eclipsed by constant commando raids and drone strikes against terrorist targets. All that, they contend, diverts the agency’s finite resources, time and attention from finding out what's really going on inside Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin, China’s weapons labs or Iran's nuclear program.

What does Frank Archibald think? Sorry. We can’t ask him.

"http://www.newsweek.com/israeli-leaders-iran-pact-bad-deal-207170","Israeli Leaders: Iran Pact Is A ‘Bad Deal'","Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, came out with guns blazing against a deal reached Sunday morning in Geneva to slow Iran’s nuclear development program, calling the agreement a “historic mistake,” while a government official made clear that Israel will not abide by the pact.

Under the six-month deal between Iranian officials and the P5+1 -- the U.S., Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany -- Iran agreed to halt some elements of its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of certain sanctions. But will the agreement make a military confrontation between Israel and Iran closer, or push it away?

Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, Yuval Steinitz, a close Netanyahu confidant, said the government will now assess its future moves, and told me that the Geneva interim agreement with Iran is “a bad deal that would allow the Iranians to continue enriching uranium, and this time do it with international legitimacy.” Given the pressure that Iran is currently under, Steinitz added, “it was possible to reach a much better deal that would start dismantling Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, not only freeze it.”

Yair Lapid, Israel’s finance minister whose centrist party, Yesh Atid, is the largest partner in the ruling coalition, implicitly criticized Netanyahu’s, saying, “We lost the ear of the world.” In an interview with Army Radio he too said the agreement was a ”bad deal,” indicating that this view is widely held in Israel’s military and political circles.

A former official at Israel’s Atomic Energy Commission who also worked for the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, Ephraim Asculai explained that at the end of six-month period, the deal can be extended for another six months. “That’s a long time,” Ascuali told me, adding that even now, with its known capabilities, Iran can conduct a nuclear test within four to six months if it so decides.

And the Geneva agreement, Asculai noted, does not cover possible undeclared nuclear facilities, which several world experts believe Iran has. “You can do a lot with a small hidden enrichment facility,” he said. Adding that the agreement is vague on inspection of sites related to the military aspects of Iran’s nuclear program – including the Parchin base, to which the IAEA has long sought access.

Much of Israel’s opposition to the deal derives from the feeling that its concerns were overlooked while agreements were tacitly reached behind Jerusalem’s back. After the Sunday signing in Geneva, unnamed U.S. officials confirmed to the website Al-monitor and to the Associated Press that, since the summer, Deputy Secretary of State William Burns has been secretly meeting in Oman with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, and other Tehran officials.

BuzzFeed quotes cabinet minister Silvan Shalom as saying that Israel knew about the secret channel from its own sources. Indeed, its existence was first reported, from unnamed Jerusalem officials, by Israel’s Channel 10 a week earlier. The television report, however, misidentified the American interlocutor, naming Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, indicating that the Israeli sources were kept in the dark, and while they may have gotten a whiff of the secret channel, likely from Saudi intelligence sources, they were blind to such details as the identity of the officials conducting it.

Another source of Israeli anger is the belief that the Obama administration is rushing toward a deal with what it believes to be a “moderate” Iranian leader, President Hassan Rouhani, even as Tehran continues to preach the elimination of the Jewish state. Last Wednesday, as representatives of Iran and the world’s six leading powers flew in for the Geneva talks, Ali Khamenei, the Islamic Republic’s Spiritual Leader who has the final say over nuclear policy, predicted that Israel will disappear, calling the “Zionist regime” the “sinister, unclean rabid dog of the region,” and saying that Israelis “cannot be called human beings.”

Secretary of State John Kerry said on several Sunday news shows that such sentiments are “unacceptable.” But the initial response from an unnamed “senior U.S. official” arriving in Geneva was that while Khamenei's statement made her “uncomfortable,” it may have resulted from “decades of mistrust” between America and Iran. “Many people in our society say difficult things about Iran and Iranians” she added.

In the Hanukkah holiday, starting Thursday, Jews commemorate an uprising in 160 BC against Antioch IV, who tried to destroy them. Israelis point to a long history in which generations of their enemies dehumanized and then tried to eliminate them. The Iranian regime is the latest link in that history, which explains why Israelis are so much more edgy that others over the possibility that Iran would obtain arms that could allow Khamenei's wish to come true. And to prevent that, Netanyahu has long said, Israel is keeping all its options open.

"http://www.newsweek.com/man-who-warned-congress-about-pakistan-nukes-paid-steep-price-207599","The Man Who Warned Congress about Pakistan Nukes Paid a Steep Price","Richard Barlow was driving his 13-year-old motorhome through a mountain state’s blizzard the week before Thanksgiving when news broke of the Iran nuclear deal.

Bad memories flooded his mind, not that they’re ever far away. For more than 25 years, ever since he testified behind closed doors on Capitol Hill that the CIA had “scores” of “absolutely reliable” reports on Pakistan’s clandestine efforts to obtain nuclear bomb technology – technology it later gave to Iran – his life has been tumbling through one trapdoor after another.

Barlow’s testimony in 1987 shocked several panel members of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, in part because Army General David Einsel, assigned to the CIA as a top intelligence official, had just told the committee that – despite the recent arrest of a Pakistani caught red-handed buying prohibited nuclear materials – the evidence that Islamabad was pursuing a bomb was inconclusive. The hearing erupted in shouts when Barlow told them differently. “They went through the roof,” he recalled from the road this week. By the time he got back to CIA headquarters, “the phones were ringing off the hook.”

Top Reagan administration officials were in “a panic,” he said, because Pakistan was the crucial player in the CIA operation funneling weapons to Islamic “holy warriors” fighting the Soviet Red Army next door in Afghanistan. If it became known that Pakistan was secretly building a bomb, a law passed by Congress would require a cut-off of military aid.

Obsessed with communism, the administration made a choice: It would turn a blind eye to Pakistan’s nuclear program in order to defeat the Soviets in Afghanistan.

And that meant Barlow, 33 at the time, had to be destroyed.

“For the Cold War warriors, the only way to save the Pakistan program was to discredit the young agency analyst,” British journalists Adrian Levy and Catherine Scott-Clark wrote in their 2007 book, Deception: Pakistan, the United States and the Secret Trade in Nuclear Weapons.

And they did. His phone stopped ringing. His reports went into circular files. Barlow realized his career at the CIA had flamed out, he says, and he resigned. He moved temporarily to U.S. Customs as a special agent and then to the Pentagon, still tracking nuclear smuggling. After internally objecting to Congressional testimony by Department of Defense officials that Pakistan’s U.S.-bought F-16s were not capable of carrying nuclear weapons he was forced out and subjected to a security investigation, his marriage (to a woman who worked at the CIA) destroyed, he left town. Today, at 59, his savings nearly drained, he wanders the mountains from Montana to Arizona in his motorhome, hunting and fishing with his three dogs, haunted by the idea of what might have been. And what is.

“If they had busted those [Pakistani] networks,” he said last week, “Iran would have no nuclear program, North Korea wouldn’t have a uranium bomb, and Pakistan wouldn't have over a hundred nuclear weapons they are driving around in vans to hide from us.”

Iran had no means to advance its nuclear desires without Pakistan’s help, he said. “It would have been impossible. The Iranians lacked the technical, scientific, and engineering capabilities to develop or manufacture centrifuges or nuclear weapons on their own. They were trying, but they were getting nowhere. It made the impossible possible.”

Barlow moved to New Mexico in 1991, but he still had a few friends in the CIA’s analytical wing who valued his expertise on Pakistan. Indeed, in 1988, before his world started crumbling, he’d won a “certificate for services of extreme value to the Central Intelligence Agency,” signed by CIA Director William Webster. And in May 1990, the Pentagon’s security office declared that “any questions of your trustworthiness or access to sensitive information was resolved in a manner completely favorable to you.”

For a while he worked for the CIA “out of my house in Santa Fe.” but efforts by his allies to get him fully reinstated were blocked by higher-ups.

He reached out to the FBI’s terrorism maven, John O’Neill (who would die on 9/11 at the World Trade Center); O’Neill asked him to help the bureau set up a nuclear counter-proliferation program from the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque.

For the next dozen years, the exiled Barlow helped run operations to penetrate the nuclear weapons programs of not just Pakistan, but Iran, North Korea, and others. In 2004 a bureaucratic power struggle broke out between the FBI and Sandia, and his job was eliminated.

Numerous efforts through the years to repair the damage to Barlow have all fallen through. Inspector general investigations at the CIA and the State Department found that officials had punished Barlow unfairly. The Pentagon’s inspector general also found that the department had retaliated against Barlow (albeit just legally).

The Government Accountability Office, Congress’s investigative arm, looked into the inspector general’s handling of Barlow’s case and confirmed the retaliation against him. Although the Senate Armed Services Committee ordered the Pentagon to compensate Barlow for the harm done to him, it refused.

In response, the committee instructed Barlow’s senator, Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, to introduce a “private bill” to recompense him. But Senator John Warner of Virginia, a former Secretary of the Navy, with the Pentagon on his home turf, objected. Ducking a confrontation with Warner, the Senate then punted Barlow’s case to the Court of Federal Claims. That proved a blind alley, however, when then-CIA director George Tenet, then-NSA director Michael Hayden and Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre declared that all the relevant classified information on Barlow’s case was protected by the so-called state secrets privilege.

In 2009, 22 years after he had first told truth to power about Pakistan, Barlow approached the Obama White House about his case. A plan was hatched to turn Barlow into a “poster boy” for a federal whistle-blowers protection act. That ploy fell apart, however, when it became clear that the president had no intention of signing a bill that would include protections for spy agency employees.

Barlow then turned to a friend, Suzanne Spaulding, a former CIA lawyer and general counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Spaulding recognized the embarrassment the public resolution of his case would cause the State and Defense departments, Barlow said, and proposed the novel idea of urging Leon Panetta, who had become CIA director in 2009, to use a little-known section of the Central Intelligence Act of 1949 that authorizes a CIA director to cut a fast check – in secret, naturally – to someone in the interest of national security. Before anything could get going, though, Spaulding was nominated to be an under-secretary of homeland security and Panetta was moved from the CIA to the Pentagon.

In any event, Barlow insisted, “I’m not a whistle-blower. I testified before a committee behind closed doors in a top-secret session with the full approval of my chain of command.”

And look what happened. He has no idea whether Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor whose leaks have caused an international uproar, drew a lesson from his case. But he noted that “none of us can go to Congress [on our own] with anything, if it’s classified.… If you understand this, you understand what Snowden did and the way he did it. My case shows what happens to you when you do it right.”

Anybody who gets Barlow on the phone had better be prepared to talk or trade emails for hours about the nuclear black market, Pakistan’s perfidy, his many travails and, now, the nuclear deal with Iran. It’s bad, he insisted. “Iran is gaming” the West.

“The holes in the agreement are multiple. Among them, it does absolutely nothing to address Iran’s extensive nuclear weapons physics work.… In addition, as long as a country maintains an enrichment plant and stocks of enriched uranium, it is has the capability to make [highly enriched uranium]. And the agreement does not remove a single one of the thousands of centrifuges Iran has.”

Centrifuges, he must remind everyone that began with Pakistan.

Barlow could go on – and he will, for hours, late into the cold Arizona night. But for a moment, he paused, hugged one of the dogs at his feet, and laughed into the Skype camera on his laptop.

“I used to hunt Pakistanis,” he said. “Now I hunt birds.”

This story has been corrected to reflect the following: Richard Barlow won back his security clearances before the GAO looked into his case, not after. While working with the FBI out of the Sandia Labs in New Mexico, Barlow helped run operations to penetrate the nuclear weapons programs of not just Pakistan, but Iran, North Korea and others. The Senate was not ""stymied"" by former Sen. John Warner's objection to a ""private bill"" on Barlow's behalf; it chose to avoid a confrontation with him and referred his case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. It is the ""Central Intelligence Act of 1949"" that has a provision authorizing the CIA director to make discreet classified payments, not the National Security Act of 1947.","2013-12-03 10:54:59","1","44.0","4.0","7.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","84.0","48.0","0.0","195.0","6.0","24.0","23","1532","94.29","68.07","11.85","15.64","21.58","26.96","77.09","46.21","9.14","5.29","0.46","0.20","0.39","3.59","0.65","3.85","9.66","15.08","5.74","2.22","4.77","1.24","10.90","5.22","1.76","1.11","1.76","0.98","4.50","1.89","2.61","0.39","0.98","0.20","8.36","0.07","0.13","0.07","3.66","8.49","2.28","0.91","1.31","1.37","1.04","2.55","1.83","0.78","0.91","0.13","0.65","0.20","0.39","0.07","0.00","7.83","0.78","1.50","3.92","0.91","1.44","6.33","3.92","0.72","13.51","1.70","7.51","4.44","5.61","0.33","0.52","1.11","0.20","0.13","0.33","0.00","0.13","0.20","0.00","0.00","19.06","5.29","6.46","0.20","0.13","0.00","0.00","1.11","3.13","1.89","0.39","0.46","7407","8.26","25.60655737704918","2312","1519","76","59.64","12.6","9.9","12.36","12.6","349","12.875","19.190256747860435","695","22.93","36","0.45","0","44","23","161","1","188","94","4","0","14","214","234","7","71","1","0","67","31","55","0","0","9","54","0","48","120","25","35","16","24","6","10","1","5"
"http://www.newsweek.com/mexico-brink-new-oil-rush-if-their-politicians-allow-it-224431","Mexico Is on the Brink of a New Oil Rush – If Their Politicians Allow It","It’s crunch time for the Mexican government’s heroic struggle to end one of the world’s most enduring monopolies and shake up its economy in the process.

President Enrique Peña Nieto wants to end his first year in office by changing the country’s constitution and opening up one of the most lucrative untapped energy sources in the world to outside investors. His government predicts the move could boost the Mexican economy and global firms hope for lucrative oil and gas extraction contracts.

But first, Peña Nieto must jump over several hurdles that politicians on his left flank keep throwing his way, including, possibly, a referendum that – if current polls are to be believed – could sink the whole enterprise.

Peña Nieto is optimistic. The Mexican senate made the initial legislative steps this week that, once completed, will repeal constitutional provisions dating back to 1938, when President Lázaro Cárdenas nationalized the country’s oil industry. New laws will also set up the rules allowing outsiders to compete with the government-owned oil monopoly over the exploitation of Mexico’s oil and natural gas.

The government would like to complete the legislation process before next week, when the Senate and the lower house adjourn for the end-of-year vacation. But officials indicate they may extend the session beyond December 15 so the complex legislation would be passed this year.

But will the new president’s attempt at revolutionizing the energy market be enough to lure the big energy investors that Mexico so desperately needs? It all depends on the final details, say oil analysts and Mexican politicians.

The president “should go the whole nine yards and do as much as politically possible” to get investors in, said New York University’s Jorge Castañeda, a former Mexican foreign minister and an early supporter of liberalizing the energy market. However, he said, there are some potential political traps that may scare off the big oil firms, including, possibly, a referendum that could rescind the new legislation.

The government is confident Peña Nieto can overcome such problems. “In three years, none of this will be an issue. Everything will be working fine,” a Mexico City official told me, asking for anonymity because of the delicate state of the political negotiations.

Legislators from Peña Nieto’s left-of-center Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its main opposition, the center-right National Alliance Party (PAN), say that between them, along with the small Green Party, they control two thirds of the Mexican parliament. That is exactly the majority they need to change the three constitutional articles that currently give the government-owned Petroleos Mexicanos sole extracting rights for the country’s oil and natural gas.

The Pemex monopoly, plagued by corruption, political favoritism, excessive union demands, and aging technology, has turned Mexico, a once-world leading energy powerhouse, into a second-rate oil manufacturer. Crude output in 1984 was 3.4 million barrels a day. This year it is a little more than 2.5 million barrels.

The fracking revolution has all but evaded Mexico and deep-water drilling technology lags far behind. As a result, a country with the world’s second-largest untapped crude reserves, according to some estimates – behind only the Arctic Circle – could soon become a net energy importer.

Pemex CEO Emilio Loyoza, a savvy veteran of several U.S. and European international business firms, knows that outsiders need to come in before Mexico can tap its potential. “To increase production in Mexico, more investment is required, [and] one way to do this is to share the investment between other companies and Pemex,” he told the Mexican congress last month.

According to Pemex estimates, Mexico needs an investment of $60 billion a year to reach its potential – double the current investment. The government estimates that opening its energy market to competition would lift economic growth by 1 percent.

Spokespersons for Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Royal Dutch Shell declined comment as legislation is pending, but they and other major energy players with an eye on huge untapped reserves and handsome profits are avidly following the political drama. To lure such investors in, however, Peña Nieto first needs to convince them his legislation will not only be lucrative enough, but that it does not contain any hidden tripwires that could threaten their investment at a later date.

This week’s “ambitious” steps in the Mexican senate represent “a very promising start,” said George Baker, a Houston energy analyst specializing in Mexico. But it is going to be hard to assess exactly how attractive the legislation will be for investors before it has completed passage and all the details are known, which is probably by next year, he said.

If the government takes 60 percent of the profit, while investors get 40 percent, they would likely come in, he said. But “a ratio of 90 to 10 wouldn’t be attractive.”

“Several months will be required for the enabling laws to be drawn up and for the first projects to be tendered,” said David Shields, a Mexico City–based independent energy analyst. “It will probably require about a year, perhaps more, for the first projects to be awarded and the first contracts to be signed.” Potential investors will compare conditions in Mexico with those in other countries before jumping in, he said.

Back in August, when Peña Nieto was still hoping to enact the energy reform with the support of Mexico’s left, he planned merely to allow foreign investors to share oil profits with the government. This month, after making an alliance with the market-oriented PAN party, the proposed legislation has grown more attractive for investors, giving them a share of the production rights, or even “concessions” – a system in which foreign firms own parcels of oil properties while paying royalties to the government.

According to Castañeda, the former foreign minister, PAN legislators know that once the constitutional changes pass both houses, they would lose all the political leverage they now have, as the PRI would no longer need their votes to get a two-thirds majority. They are therefore trying now to extract as many pro-market concessions as they can.

But many PRI members oppose such moves. They also fear the reaction of leftist parties, which have mounted street protests and acts of civil disobedience in an attempt to stop the oil reforms altogether.

This week the Mexican lower house passed a bill authorizing a national referendum on major issues if 1.6 million signatures are collected. Left-wing legislators say they have enough signatures to challenge Peña Nieta’s new law, and according to polls up to 60 percent of Mexicans would vote it down in a referendum. A former left-wing presidential candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, recently wrote a letter to several of the big oil companies, warning them that if the public votes the oil reforms down, foreigners would lose any investment they had made in Mexico until that time.

Unless the government finds a way to avoid holding the referendum, the government do it “as soon as possible” rather than wait until it is too late, said Castañeda. But a government official scoffed at the prospect. “Lopez Obrador can say what he wants, and he sure has, but we have a solution” for the constitutional impasse, he said, but declined to specify.

Passions over Mexico’s buried national treasure run high, which is why, despite declining production figures and the loss of government revenues, ending the government oil monopoly has become Mexico’s political third rail. When the PRI lost the presidency in 2000 for the first time after 71 years in power, it still could muster enough congressional votes to block any PAN reform attempt. Only after Peña Nieto, representing a new and more market-oriented generation of PRI leaders, recaptured the presidency last year, could oil reform be envisioned.

But it was Cárdenas, a PRI stalwart, who back in 1938 stunned international oil giants by nationalizing oil and confiscating their profits. No wonder that despite the significant profit potential, outside investors remain very careful before jumping back into Mexico.

"http://www.newsweek.com/2013/12/20/michael-hayden-cant-stop-talking-244954.html","Michael Hayden Can’t Stop Talking","First off, I say, let's get that Amtrak thing straightened out.

Michael Hayden chuckles. The former eavesdropper-in-chief totally gets the irony of having someone secretly listening in on his phone conversation during a train trip to New York last October. Even more delicious was the revelation that the person eavesdropping on him was Tom Matzzie, former director of the Washington office of MoveOn.org, the left-leaning political group that is a decrier of all things NSA.

Matzzie live-tweeted Hayden's ""on background"" conversation with a reporter, in which he included a few ""disparaging quotes"" about President Obama.

""I wasn't trashing him - that was misreporting!"" says Hayden. ""Let me tell you what I talked about. I'd been asked about Angela Merkel,"" whose cell phone conversations the NSA had listened in on, according to über-leaker Edward Snowden. ""And I said, 'Hey, look...when the president was elected, when he was president-elect, he was fixated with his BlackBerry, and we said, 'No, Mr. President. You can't use that.' And he said, 'Well, I am going to use that.' And we said, 'Well, all right, fine, give it to us for a few days, and we'll fool around with it and give it back to you.""

And ""the backstory of that,"" Hayden adds, ""is the security establishment is telling the soon-to-be-most-powerful man in the world in the most powerful country on Earth, that if he chooses to use his Blackberry in the national capital, a whole bunch of foreign intelligence services are going to be reading his email and listening to his phone. And that's what I said.""

And the backstory to that backstory, of course, is that everybody does it - everybody spies on everybody all the damn time - if they can.

Matzzie ""took it to be bashing the Obama administration,"" Hayden says. ""And that was the only thing I said. I mean, the guy was the political director of MoveOn.org.""

Hayden chuckles again.

The retired Air Force general, a former chief of both the CIA and NSA, seems to be everywhere these days - giving speeches and interviews, working the Sunday talk shows. There he was again yesterday, on BBC TV, explaining the recommendation of a White House panel to curtail NSA spying programs.

So very un-spook-like.

For a lifetime intelligence officer, he's pretty talkative. His immediate predecessors, Porter Goss and George Tenet, are rarely heard from. Tenet, CIA director in the Clinton and first George W. Bush administrations, turns down many requests for interviews and speeches and ""hasn't appeared on a Sunday show since 2007,"" his spokesman Bill Harlow told Newsweek. Even the garrulous Leon Panetta, who replaced Hayden as CIA director in 2009, finally seems to be fading away to a quiet retirement on his California walnut farm after a stint as secretary of defense, among other high-level appointments and a career as a congressman before those.

Only James Woolsey, CIA director for a short while in the Clinton administration, seems to be all over town, yapping about this and that, but his advocacy of the Iraq War and other neoconservative adventures seems to have whittled down his stature.

Is Hayden running for office? Looking for another job in a future administration?

He laughs again. ""If I picked up that phone, my wife would cut off my hand!""

What phone? Any phone, he says - any phone bringing a summons from a president to return to government.

""Now, I know I appear to be incredibly youthful,"" he jokes, ""but on my next birthday, I'll be 69. It's time to start enjoying your grandkids - that's what it is.""

Hayden does appear comfortable in his expansive corner office in downtown Washington, with big windows overlooking a busy intersection only a few blocks from the White House. Along with other big guns at the Chertoff Group, the consulting firm headed by another all-everything, Michael Chertoff, the former homeland security secretary, he's cashing in and having a ball.

""I'm here about half my time,"" he says. ""I teach at George Mason. I have a bunch of boards and consultancies and a very good speakers bureau.... ""

In February, he has a joint speaking gig in Munich with his Israeli counterpart, Maer Dagan, the former head of Mossad. They were so close when Hayden ran the CIA, a well-placed source says, that the Israelis were afforded the unique privilege of bringing cell phones and laptops into the spy agency's headquarters. Nobody but nobody gets to do that.

When asked about this courtesy, Hayden demurs. ""I just don't remember it specifically.""

""I have no desire to be back in government,"" Hayden insists. ""Miss the mission, miss the people,"" but those top spy jobs are killers.

The big joy of life today, he says, is that ""I get to say what I think.""

And he does. One big thing he thinks is that nobody really understands what the NSA is and isn't doing, despite blockbuster revelations going back to 2005, a cascade of legal suits, judges' orders curtailing its practices and the river of data and charts channeled through the media over the past six months by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

It's just too complicated, he argues, to boil down. It's a huge problem. Members of the intelligence committee had a hard time getting a grip on it too, he says, when he was NSA director.

""To be fair, though, this is obscure stuff. I mean, I'd be up there [in a hearing] - and I'm pretty good at this stuff - I'd be explaining things for 30 or 40 minutes, with my introduction, and slides and maps and so on, and then I say, 'I'm ready for your first question.' And it was clear to me they didn't understand a word that I'd said. Not to be judgmental, it's just that this is very obscure.""

As he has said ad nauseum, NSA is not targeting Americans! Nobody gets that, he says, starting with reporters!

""I have people in your profession calling me up about the Snowden revelations saying, 'What does this mean, what does that mean?' I'd say, 'That's not incidental collection, that's inadvertent collection - a different thing altogether.' And it's, 'What-the-hell?' And you've got to walk them through it.""

He offers a more concrete example. Stories that say NSA is targeting Americans' emails are ""technically correct, and a lie at the same time. I mean, what you're talking about is foreign intelligence collection - I'm generalizing here, but I'm just trying to give you an example - you've got foreign intelligence collection, you're collecting against a foreign intelligence target. If the foreign target is in communication with a 'protected' person, a U.S. citizen - well, game on, that's been permitted since 1952, you can cover the target. And then you have to minimize the U.S. identity and so on. So in a sense, yes, quote, including U.S. emails, quote - if I have five minutes, I can explain it on Meet the Press and everyone can go, 'Yes, that kinda makes kinda sense,' but that's five minutes on 'including U.S. emails,' and I lose that [argument], NSA loses that, every time, because it takes too long to explain.""

You see the problem? Nobody seems to know what the hell they're talking about here, maybe not even Hayden.

One of the NSA's problems, he says, is that Snowden's revelation of massive eavesdropping arrived ""in this swirl of fear about government overreach,"" especially since Obama's election, whipped up by the Tea Party.

Hayden says even he fears ""executive overreach."" Putting aside the question of whether the government has gone overboard in monitoring the telephone and computer habits and practices of American citizens - not to mention allied presidents and prime ministers - the former NSA chief avers that he, too, is worried about putting in place the tools for a future police state.

He says he warned President Bush about pushing the NSA over the line, reminding him how the agency had been rocked by revelations of illegal domestic spying in the 1970s.

""When I went into see President Bush, when he was authorizing the Terrorist Surveillance Program, I said, 'Mr. President, we need to be very careful here. Since the mid-1970s, my agency has had a permanent one-ball, two-strike count on it.... I actually said that to the president.""

Hayden is a man who knows his audience: Bush had been an owner of the Texas Rangers.

""And he said, 'Michael, I understand. But we are going to do this.'""

And, of course, the NSA got caught, first in 2005 by The New York Times, which exposed the so-called warrantless wiretapping program, and then by Snowden.

Obama's counterterrorism policies have been even more muscular than Bush's, Hayden acknowledges. Nevertheless, NSA has been ""very cautious about"" domestic spying all along, he insists.

But of course, there's a lot of disagreement about that. So the next time you glance up at the television over the bar at your favorite watering hole, you'll likely see Michael Hayden, the happy warrior, trying to explain it all yet again.

""What I'm trying to say is, this is an R-rated movie, this is for adults,"" he says. ""This is how this works.""

"http://www.newsweek.com/2013/12/06/perils-whistle-blowing-244874.html","The Perils of Whistle-Blowing","Richard Barlow was driving his 13-year-old motorhome through a mountain state's blizzard the week before Thanksgiving when news broke of the Iran nuclear deal.

Bad memories flooded his mind, not that they're ever far away. For more than 25 years, ever since he testified behind closed doors on Capitol Hill that the CIA had ""scores"" of ""absolutely reliable"" reports on Pakistan's clandestine efforts to obtain nuclear bomb technology - technology it later gave to Iran - his life has been tumbling through one trapdoor after another.

Barlow's testimony in 1987 shocked several panel members of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, in part because Army General David Einsel, assigned to the CIA as a top intelligence official, had just told the committee that - despite the recent arrest of a Pakistani caught red-handed buying prohibited nuclear materials - the evidence that Islamabad was pursuing a bomb was inconclusive. The hearing erupted in shouts when Barlow told them differently. ""They went through the roof,"" he recalled from the road this week. By the time he got back to CIA headquarters, ""the phones were ringing off the hook.""

Top Reagan administration officials were in ""a panic,"" he said, because Pakistan was the crucial player in the CIA operation funneling weapons to Islamic ""holy warriors"" fighting the Soviet Red Army next door in Afghanistan. If it became known that Pakistan was secretly building a bomb, a law passed by Congress would require a cut-off of military aid.

Obsessed with communism, the administration made a choice: It would turn a blind eye to Pakistan's nuclear program in order to defeat the Soviets in Afghanistan.

And that meant Barlow, 33 at the time, had to be destroyed.

""For the Cold War warriors, the only way to save the Pakistan program was to discredit the young agency analyst,"" British journalists Adrian Levy and Catherine Scott-Clark wrote in their 2007 book, Deception: Pakistan, the United States and the Secret Trade in Nuclear Weapons.

And they did. His phone stopped ringing. His reports went into circular files. Barlow realized his career at the CIA had flamed out, he says, and he resigned. He moved temporarily to U.S. Customs as a special agent and then to the Pentagon, still tracking nuclear smuggling. After internally objecting to Congressional testimony by Department of Defense officials that Pakistan's U.S.-bought F-16s were not capable of carrying nuclear weapons he was forced out and subjected to a security investigation, his marriage (to a woman who worked at the CIA) destroyed, he left town. Today, at 59, his savings nearly drained, he wanders the mountains from Montana to Arizona in his motorhome, hunting and fishing with his three dogs, haunted by the idea of what might have been. And what is.

""If they had busted those [Pakistani] networks,"" he said last week, ""Iran would have no nuclear program, North Korea wouldn't have a uranium bomb, and Pakistan wouldn't have over a hundred nuclear weapons they are driving around in vans to hide from us.""

Iran had no means to advance its nuclear desires without Pakistan's help, he said. ""It would have been impossible. The Iranians lacked the technical, scientific, and engineering capabilities to develop or manufacture centrifuges or nuclear weapons on their own. They were trying, but they were getting nowhere. It made the impossible possible.""

Barlow moved to New Mexico in 1991, but he still had a few friends in the CIA's analytical wing who valued his expertise on Pakistan. Indeed, in 1988, before his world started crumbling, he'd won a ""certificate for services of extreme value to the Central Intelligence Agency,"" signed by CIA Director William Webster. And in May 1990, the Pentagon's security office declared that ""any questions of your trustworthiness or access to sensitive information was resolved in a manner completely favorable to you.""

For a while he worked for the CIA ""out of my house in Santa Fe,"" but efforts by his allies to get him fully reinstated were blocked by higher-ups.

He reached out to the FBI's terrorism maven, John O'Neill (who would die on 9/11 at the World Trade Center); O'Neill asked him to help the bureau set up a nuclear counter-proliferation program from the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque.

For the next dozen years, the exiled Barlow helped run operations to penetrate the nuclear weapons programs of not just Pakistan, but Iran, North Korea, and others. In 2004 a bureaucratic power struggle broke out between the FBI and Sandia, and his job was eliminated.

Numerous efforts through the years to repair the damage to Barlow have all fallen through. Inspector general investigations at the CIA and the State Department found that officials had punished Barlow unfairly. The Pentagon's inspector general also found that the department had retaliated against Barlow (albeit just legally).

The Government Accountability Office, Congress's investigative arm, looked into the inspector general's handling of Barlow's case and confirmed the retaliation against him. Although the Senate Armed Services Committee ordered the Pentagon to compensate Barlow for the harm done to him, it refused.

In response, the committee instructed Barlow's senator, Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, to introduce a ""private bill"" to recompense him. But Senator John Warner of Virginia, a former Secretary of the Navy, with the Pentagon on his home turf, objected. Ducking a confrontation with Warner, the Senate then punted Barlow's case to the Court of Federal Claims. That proved a blind alley, however, when then-CIA director George Tenet, then-NSA director Michael Hayden and Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre declared that all the relevant classified information on Barlow's case was protected by the so-called state secrets privilege.

In 2009, 22 years after he had first told truth to power about Pakistan, Barlow approached the Obama White House about his case. A plan was hatched to turn Barlow into a ""poster boy"" for a federal whistle-blowers protection act. That ploy fell apart, however, when it became clear that the president had no intention of signing a bill that would include protections for spy agency employees.

Barlow then turned to a friend, Suzanne Spaulding, a former CIA lawyer and general counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Spaulding recognized the embarrassment the public resolution of his case would cause the State and Defense departments, Barlow said, and proposed the novel idea of urging Leon Panetta, who had become CIA director in 2009, to use a little-known section of the Central Intelligence Act of 1949 that authorizes a CIA director to cut a fast check - in secret, naturally - to someone in the interest of national security. Before anything could get going, though, Spaulding was nominated to be an under-secretary of homeland security and Panetta was moved from the CIA to the Pentagon.

In any event, Barlow insisted, ""I'm not a whistle-blower. I testified before a committee behind closed doors in a top-secret session with the full approval of my chain of command.""

And look what happened. He has no idea whether Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor whose leaks have caused an international uproar, drew a lesson from his case. But he noted that ""none of us can go to Congress [on our own] with anything, if it's classified.... If you understand this, you understand what Snowden did and the way he did it. My case shows what happens to you when you do it right.""

Anybody who gets Barlow on the phone had better be prepared to talk or trade emails for hours about the nuclear black market, Pakistan's perfidy, his many travails and, now, the nuclear deal with Iran. It's bad, he insisted. ""Iran is gaming"" the West.

""The holes in the agreement are multiple. Among them, it does absolutely nothing to address Iran's extensive nuclear weapons physics work.... In addition, as long as a country maintains an enrichment plant and stocks of enriched uranium, it is has the capability to make [highly enriched uranium]. And the agreement does not remove a single one of the thousands of centrifuges Iran has.""

Centrifuges, he must remind everyone that began with Pakistan.

Barlow could go on - and he will, for hours, late into the cold Arizona night. But for a moment, he paused, hugged one of the dogs at his feet, and laughed into the Skype camera on his laptop.

""I used to hunt Pakistanis,"" he said. ""Now I hunt birds.""

"http://www.newsweek.com/american-taxpayers-getting-drilled-big-oil-186","American Taxpayers Getting Drilled by Big Oil","Flying northwest of Aspen in a small aircraft – a single-engine Cessna Centurion 210 – I discreetly vomit into a bag of candy I find in the side door of the cockpit. The pilot, Bruce Gordon, glances back and nods with approval.

""You vomit beautifully,"" he says.

""Thank you.""

We are cruising the Roan (pronounced ROE-AHN) Plateau at 180 miles an hour from an altitude of 10,000 feet. It is a wildlife refuge in Colorado teeming with animals. But it is also federal land that is hotly contested by oil and gas drillers. Etched across the mountainous terrain are hundreds of winding paths leading to drill sites.

Dotting the high ridges and forests are outbuildings and drill rigs – camouflaged in accordance with a handbook stipulating colors acceptable to federal regulators – as well as dingy wastewater pools left over from the drilling process, which cannot be concealed.

The drilling areas are easy to spot. ""In the past few years, it has totally taken over the landscape,"" says Gordon, executive director of EcoFlight, a nonprofit that sponsors flights over drill sites, forest clear-cuts and strip mines to educate those who don't get to regularly see the full impact on the land of the energy-extraction process. ""The pristine areas are so few now, they really catch your eye,"" he said. ""You can't fly 30 minutes in any direction without seeing the wreckage.""

That was 2011, just as America came off its first full year of extracting more than 35 percent of its crude oil and nearly 25 percent of its natural gas from lands and territories owned by the U.S. taxpayer, transforming itself into a net exporter of petroleum products for the first time since 1949. The Roan Plateau figured prominently in that turnaround, reaping the greatest amount ever paid in the lower 48 states to the U.S. Treasury by drillers looking to strike it rich on federal land. Yet the total paid for ground leases came to just over $100 million, a drop in the bucket compared with the revenue oil and gas companies reported in the whole of Colorado that year – well over $9 billion.

And therein lies the rub. America owns an enormous swath of the land at the heart of the nation's energy boom – stunning wildlife territories like the Roan Plateau, where oil and gas can be found alongside rare plant and animal habitats – but American taxpayers are not very much benefitting financially.

The problem traces back to America's early days, when the concept of manifest destiny spurred President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872 to sign a mining law that allowed wildcatters stabbing westward to exploit resources on federal land at little to no cost – and keep most of what they found without having to share any of it.

""Obviously, back then they weren't even dreaming of drilling for oil or gas, but the post-Civil War era of encouraging Western settlement by giving away natural resources is still reflected in U.S. policy today,"" says Roger Flynn, who teaches mining and natural resources law at the University of Colorado at Boulder and is director of the Western Mining Action Project, offering legal advice to conservation groups and Native American tribes.

In 1920, Congress rejiggered its rules on the heels of the oil rush at the turn of the century, insisting drillers pay a low annual lease rate, revised periodically, for the right to drill on taxpayer-owned lands and requiring them to contribute one eighth of their sales revenue in royalty. Nearly 100 years later, that policy remains the law of the land, robbing Americans of untold billions, even as they're forced to pay record-high prices at the pump.

That is no rash accusation from a tree hugger or a Luddite. It is the verdict of the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress, after extensive research. Despite the promise that energy independence would benefit everyone, it is looking less likely Americans will be able to afford to enjoy their own energy heyday.

Some gripping numbers: In the past five years, more than one third of crude oil and more than one fifth of natural gas have been drilled from territories owned by the U.S. taxpayer and leased to the oil and gas majors. Yet the lease rates Big Oil pays for access to this precious acreage, last updated in 1987, are based on valuations from a year when oil prices averaged around $18 a barrel. Since then, the cost of leases has not budged, even as America has witnessed an energy revolution and oil prices have climbed to more than $100.

Why is America lowballing itself?

""There is a lot of blame to go around when it comes to how much the American taxpayer is getting for all this drilling,"" says Peter Kolbenschlag, an energy consultant with Mountain West Strategies in Paonia, Colo. ""What we're seeing right now is the result of a lot of special interests influencing fiscal policy in Washington.""

Americans may be surprised to learn that although leases on taxpayer-owned territories can fetch thousands of dollars an acre in the competitive bidding process, the starting bid for an annual lease to explore for 10 years is just $2 an acre. (That is not a typo.) Put it this way: America charges less for drilling on an acre of taxpayer-owned land for a decade than Starbucks charges for a cup of coffee. According to the Bureau of Land Management, the arm of the U.S. Department of the Interior that manages land leases, there are no plans to change that.

If you factor in inflation, the spending power of $2 in 1987 is the equivalent of 50 cents today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. So, even as energy prices skyrocket, the nation is charging Big Oil a quarter of what it did 30 years ago.

""The main question is, what does the Interior [Department] think is the right amount for us to be paid on our nation’s resources now? And are we there yet?"" says Frank Rusco, director of natural resources and the environment for the GAO, which just completed an analysis of energy drilling and the Interior Department's handling of its valuations that is due to be published next month.

Sinking a well means paying royalties – another sticking point between Big Oil and America. Onshore, oil and gas majors pay a royalty rate of 12.5 percent, based on sales of what they drill and produce. Offshore, that is slightly higher, 18.75 percent, hiked in 2007 from the 12.5 percent rate set in the 1920s. (The higher, offshore rate reflects only leases granted since 2007, which means most of the money paid to Uncle Sam comes under the older, lower rate.) Onshore rates have yet to be revised upward and proposals to boost royalties when oil prices meet high price thresholds have been met with heated opposition from members of Congress at the encouragement of Big Oil.

But in the past, Interior, which has discretionary powers over how royalties are collected, hasn't done itself any favors, either. Authorized by Congress to set rates based on fair market value, in 1982 the department decided that charging ""fair market value"" should not be defined by the value of the oil and gas discovered and produced on U.S. onshore and offshore territories, but on the value of the ""right to explore.""

Efforts to increase the return to taxpayers weren't helped when in 2009 the Interior Department appealed to the Supreme Court to collect royalties from oil and gas companies worth billions of dollars. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case. ""Whatever the precise amount of foregone future royalties ultimately proves to be, the total cost will be huge, and it will have a direct, adverse effect on the Treasury of the United States,"" the petition stated. At the time, the amount lost was estimated to be $19 billion.

As oil prices shot to nearly $150 a barrel in 2008, the GAO reviewed Interior's decision-making process and suggested that taxpayers are grossly underpaid for the vast energy resources they own. After studying how other nations priced their precious minerals, the agency concluded that America ranked the ""93rd lowest of 104 oil and gas fiscal systems evaluated"" on a global scale. That is, the U.S., which offers energy cheaply and is seen as an appealing place to do business, especially compared with other energy-rich nations that are frequently restive or at war, came in near the bottom of the list. Says a high-ranking source at the Bureau of Land Management who asked to remain unnamed, ""It is completely laughable how little we charge compared to what oil companies are paying in countries like Kazakhstan.""

The main issue with overhauling how the U.S. charges oil and gas companies can be summed up fairly easily, says Alan Jeffers, spokesman for ExxonMobil. ""Our expectation is that when certain rules are put in place, they don't change across the life of the investment, including changing the royalty structure. That is standard across the natural resources industry. We live up to our end of the bargain and we expect others to do the same."" In short, the U.S. made a bad deal.

In privately negotiated land deals, many property owners have questioned whether royalty rates are fair, stating that oil and gas companies often deduct various hidden costs and pay a net royalty instead of a gross one. ""That’s what I call the Enron-accounting royalty rate, because after deducting all kinds of unknown costs, there's your royalty,"" says Flynn. ""If I was advising someone who was looking to negotiate a private land deal as their attorney, I would never allow them to accept a net royalty.""

How do government rates compare with privately negotiated U.S. leases and royalties? While deal data vary from state to state and are generally confidential, most participants, as a rule, size up the government lease and royalty rates as the rock-bottom minimum. The federal royalty rates are set by the Secretary of the Interior and stay fixed, even as energy prices rise and fall.

The past few years of active U.S. drilling – 2010, 2011, and 2012 – have delivered little more than $11 billion a year in federal government revenue from not just oil and gas, but all its natural resources, including coal and hard-rock mining, according to the U.S. Office of Natural Resources Revenue. Meanwhile, in 2012 alone, Exxon Mobil Corp., with half its energy resources in the Americas, reported revenue of $482.3 billion.

Oil and gas resources at least raise some money for the Treasury. The U.S. does not charge royalties on gold, copper, uranium, and most of its other key mining resources, notes Flynn. ""We have been unable to change that policy in Congress,"" he says. ""The fact that we have companies from Canada and South Africa coming in here and cleaning America out while paying absolutely no royalties at all for what they take is viewed by many to be deeply unfair to the American people.""

Perhaps the ultimate sucker punch for Americans is that while the U.S. gives to Big Oil huge volumes of our commonly owned oil and gas reserves every year, Big Oil takes it, processes it and sells it back to U.S. consumers at top dollar.

This is thanks to the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act, passed by Congress in 1995. During the first five years of the program, the nation's lost royalties amounted to an estimated $80 billion, according to the GAO. On top of the gas tax, and the Big Oil’s subsidies and tax breaks, ""royalty relief"" is like getting hit with a third tax.

In the spring, Senator Dianne Feinstein, (D-California), who has been trying to eliminate royalty relief since oil prices spiked in the wake of the Iraq War, and Senator Bill Nelson, (D-Florida), introduced a bill to prohibit Interior from waiving royalty fees amounting to billions of dollars. ""Given the record profits of the big oil companies, I don’t think they need any more help from taxpayers,"" Nelson remarked.

So just how much are Americans being cheated out of? Let's just say taxpayers aren't just giving away their natural resources, they're paying Big Oil to haul them away.

In 2012, the U.S. gave away 120.8 million barrels of oil, based on Office of Natural Resources Revenue data, worth more than $10.44 billion if costed at the average oil price for that year. It also gave away 197 million cubic feet of natural gas. In total, these deals wiped out what the nation earned for all its natural resources combined. The same year, Americans got socked with $3.60 a gallon at the pump, the nation's highest-ever average gasoline price.

The previous year, 2011, America did one better: It didn't just give away what it earned – it put itself in a substantial deficit giving to Big Oil 136.9 million barrels of oil with a price tag of $11.92 billion. The oil giveaways alone that year far exceeded the lease and royalty revenue paid by Big Oil to Americans for exploiting their natural resources. Taxpayers also gave up 258.6 million cubic feet of natural gas, worth at least another billion dollars.

The U.S. is in the midst of an energy revolution, with home produced oil and gas, thanks to fracking, higher than ever before. The Department of Energy is projecting record petroleum product exports this year, narrowing the import-export gap to 4 million barrels a day, which comes on top of the record highs in 2012 and 2011.

All of this extra oil and gas flooding the market should be pushing prices lower, right? Wrong. While the new supplies of natural gas have pressed down on prices, this isn't expected to last, as oil and gas majors are hurriedly constructing gas-export facilities to ship gas out of the country as fast as they can drill it. The upshot is, the long sought after American dream of energy independence does not include lower energy prices.

While Americans pay more at the pump, many countries are willing to pay even more. Our biggest export recipients? Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Panama, France and the Netherlands, each receive more than 100,000 barrels of U.S. oil products a day. This steady outflow means Big Oil is creating enough of a scarcity within the U.S. to put a floor under prices.

On Wall Street, you get paid for taking risks. But on Main Street, Americans are being asked to take the risks that come with unprecedented drilling on their lands and coastlines – but are not getting paid for the privilege.

When it returns from its shutdown, will the federal government give American motorists a break and revisit how much Big Oil pays to sell them their own energy? Don't hold your breath. As John Paul Getty, the founder of Getty Oil, once said, ""The meek shall inherit the earth, except the mineral rights.""","2013-10-11 14:04:30","1","55.0","2.0","7.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","79.0","48.0","0.0","172.0","6.0","24.0","23","2513","95.74","57.27","32.20","56.59","24.40","22.68","78.11","43.61","6.33","2.11","0.24","0.60","0.32","0.12","0.84","4.22","8.87","15.84","5.33","3.34","5.01","1.07","9.83","5.85","3.18","1.59","3.74","2.67","4.06","2.83","1.19","0.08","0.28","0.40","4.34","0.04","0.00","0.00","0.16","7.32","1.15","1.75","0.48","1.31","1.11","2.11","3.26","0.64","0.68","0.16","0.72","0.44","0.20","0.00","0.12","7.48","0.99","0.96","4.97","0.72","0.20","2.43","6.65","0.60","15.32","1.63","9.67","4.26","5.13","0.32","0.56","4.10","0.00","0.12","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.04","0.12","0.00","16.75","5.49","6.25","0.12","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.80","1.75","0.99","0.40","0.64","11648","7.61","25.445544554455445","3628","2505","129","68.7","12.0","8.5","10.91","11.2","478","6.142857142857143","17.392734530938124","977","22.9","56","0.43","0","77","89","260","0","326","175","22","11","15","422","219","15","182","2","0","63","26","109","1","1","10","75","0","75","51","73","76","66","77","18","15","0","17"
"http://www.newsweek.com/biggest-little-cia-shop-youve-never-heard-3386","The Biggest Little CIA Shop You’ve Never Heard Of","A few years ago, an American company placed a want ad for an aerospace engineering consultant in an Asian newspaper. It quickly drew a flurry of applicants – one of whom was just the kind of person the company was looking for: someone who worked in that country’s missile program, someone who was a little sleazy, someone looking to make a little cash on the side.

This was a CIA front operation, and soon that eager applicant was supplying the spy agency with details on his country’s ballistic missile program.

That kind of covert activity is a specialty of the CIA’s National Resources Division, a little-known, U.S.-based component of the agency’s National Clandestine Service.

The CIA’s main business is sending operatives abroad to recruit spies and, especially since 9/11, chasing down terrorists for its target-hungry drone pilots. But NR, as it’s known, is the agency’s stay-at-home division. It’s nothing like Homeland, however, with operatives running about with guns in the D.C. suburbs (though its 1960s-era predecessors once spied on antiwar and civil rights activists and recruited Cuban exiles to harass Fidel Castro). It also works with the FBI and NSA in bugging foreign diplomatic missions there.

Think of it as a more cuddly CIA. Its main business is to openly gather information from Americans who’ve traveled to places the CIA is interested in, particularly hard targets like North Korea, and to inveigle foreigners in the U.S. – officials, scientists and students – into spying when they return home.

For the men (and women) of the CIA’s principal espionage corps, working abroad under cover, often in some of the world’s nastiest neighborhoods, National Resources looks like the country club of Spy-Ville, a 9-to-5 domestic job, free of risk and stress, a refuge for the lazy, the incompetents and the burnouts.

“We look down on NR: You’re a slacker, you’re going home every night and watching TV, while I’m here in Moscow with the Russians looking up my ass with a microscope. We’re not working for the same organization,” says one veteran overseas operative, echoing a common view. “In Moscow, Beijing, Delhi, whatever, I’m not only living in rotten conditions, I’ve got a hostile intelligence service following me around.”

Says another: “The problem is – they’ll deny it – but NR’s recruitments [of spies] are not to the same standards” as the rest of the clandestine service. “They’re under the gun more than others to recruit by the numbers. They’ll recruit a Moroccan because he’s a Moroccan, not because he has access. And it’s a crapshoot when they go back home.… In general, their recruitments are not viewed that positively.” (The CIA declined comment for this story.)

NR’s operations also irritate the turf-conscious FBI, which is in charge of domestic counterintelligence and counterterrorism and also recruits foreigners here as spies. Others argue that its intimate relations with top U.S. corporate executives willing to have their companies fronting for the CIA invites trouble at home and abroad.

All of which makes a few spy veterans question how valuable the NR is.

NR swelled with new CIA recruits after 9/11, but it wasn’t supposed to be that way. At a time when then-CIA director George Tenet was boasting about dispatching CIA spies around the globe to hunt down terrorists, scores of new hires were suddenly showing up in NR’s domestic offices, far from the action of places like the Middle East, Pakistan, or North Africa. As recently as 2010, a former CIA operative who writes under the pseudonym Ishmael Jones told me, “more than 90 percent” of the agency’s clandestine corps were living and working “entirely within the United States.”

Why? According to Jones, the agency chickened out, targeting Chinese, Russians, Pakistanis, Saudis, and other foreigners for recruitment while they were visiting the United States, rather than in their own countries where the secret police are ubiquitous.

That’s half-true, says a former CIA executive with extensive foreign experience, who says the new recruits landed in NR out of a bureaucratic screwup, not because the CIA was risk-averse: “What happened was, we hired a massive amount of people, and it occurred to nobody that we needed State Department plus ambassadorial approval to assign these people to overseas embassies [under diplomatic cover]. Say you tell an ambassador we’re going to assign six new people to his embassy. How is he going to explain to the local interior minister that his staff is going from 12 to 18?”

He can’t, the former official says. And if he could, the local secret police would quickly take notice of the new embassy staff, putting everyone else new to the embassy under scrutiny. “So State said, ‘F**k that. We have no space.’” (The problem was eventually eased by shunting undercover operatives into other U.S. facilities, he adds.)

Thus hundreds of new case officers – the agency’s term for spy recruiters and handlers – were shunted into NR.

Today, according to knowledgeable sources, NR has offices in about a dozen cities, down from about three times that two decades ago because of cost-cutting, sources said. Naturally, they’re located in places where foreign officials, military officers, scientists and students – as well as Americans who travel abroad on business – congregate, cities like New York, Boston, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Detroit (where there’s a large Arab population nearby) and Denver, which is such a hotbed of U.S. military and intelligence activity that the CIA considered moving NR there entirely in 2005. After much criticism, it stayed put.

In any event, since some CIA case officers discovered along the line that they weren’t suited for – or really disliked – learning foreign languages and spying in hostile territory, NR was the perfect job for them.

“At a Christmas party once,” recalls a retired CIA operative with extensive overseas experience who did a stint in a Midwestern city, ”a guy let me know he had no interest in working in the clandestine world – ‘I don't do dark street corners at night,’ he said. Well, I loved dark street corners at night.… In that same office, you have people going out to meet academics and so forth and people going out the same door under an alias to recruit sources.”

The FBI is said to despise the CIA’s domestic recruiting operations. According to a 2005 account by The Washington Post’s Dana Priest, the two sides had “highly contentious” negotiations over who could do what, “with the FBI saying that it should control and approve the CIA's domestic activities.… ” That wasn’t going to happen, so in the end, the two sides just promised to play nice.

But that hasn’t always happened.

“There are a lot of problems with NR and the FBI,” says a former senior CIA executive. “You have good one-on-one relationships, but you have terrible [FBI- field-office-to-[CIA]-station relationships. The FBI guards its turf jealously…and NR just in general hasn’t handled those relationships well.” It’s not uncommon for NR offices “to lie” to the FBI about operations they have going, the former CIA official says. And vice versa.

In New York City, NR operatives work with the FBI and NYPD on counterterrorism cases – the head of NYPD’s intelligence division, David Cohen, is a former NR chief – but they also cultivate their own sources on Wall Street, especially looking for help keeping track of foreign money sloshing around in the global financial system, while recruiting companies to provide cover for CIA operations abroad. And once they’ve seen how the other 1 percent lives, CIA operatives, some say, are tempted to go over to the other side.

“New York has a particular problem, and that’s attrition,” says this former CIA executive. “They get a pretty nice housing allowance and all that, but you’ve got an officer who, as part of his portfolio, he’s supposed to be meeting with Joe Blow at Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs. And after a year or two of this, it begins to fray. And you’ve got these people at Goldman Sachs who take a look at you and say, ‘You know, you're a good guy, you’ve got all the skill sets we need, and, oh, by the way, we’ll basically triple your salary.’ And it's, you know, ‘When do I start?’ So attrition is a big problem.”

Any conversation with operations veterans about NR begins with a 30-minute litany of its supposed shortcomings. But eventually, they’ll grant that it has value.

The best thing NR does, they say, is “finding and cultivating contacts in the local business world,” says another former CIA executive. “They look for guys who have been to China, Mongolia, Vietnam, or whatever to debrief – all the way up to arranging with a company to provide cover for us.”

Former senior U.S. government officials are happy to share information with the CIA from their foreign travels, they explain. George H.W. Bush, a former CIA director who until his recent illness continued to meet with prime ministers, had “a standing appointment with the Houston station,” recalls another former CIA executive. “He’d say, ’When I come back, I'll tell you everything I got.’ ”

And that’s another reason NR stays in regular contact with top Wall Street and other corporate executives.

It also knows some titans of finance are not above being romanced. Most love hanging out with the agency’s top spies – James Bond and all that – and being solicited for their views on everything from the street’s latest tricks to their meetings with, say, China’s finance minister.

JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein, one former CIA executive recalls, loved to get visitors from Langley.

And the CIA loves them back, not just for their patriotic cooperation with the spy agency, sources say, but the influence they have on Capitol Hill, where the intelligence budgets are hashed out.

One New York commercial real estate tycoon, who the source asked Newsweek not to name, was “a regular contact.” In exchange, he was “kept happy by bringing him down to the Farm” – the CIA’s training facility in Virginia – “and letting him shoot off weapons, [and] see some of the things we're doing down there.

“And everyone,” he says, “went away happy.”

"http://www.newsweek.com/vietnam-vets-return-tackle-mess-they-left-behind-207594","In Return to Vietnam, Vets Tackle Mess They Left Behind","It’s not easy to find a turkey dinner in Hanoi, but a handful of Americans and their Vietnamese friends gathered last Thursday over an imported bird cooked for them at a fancy restaurant in the capital’s old quarter, and they gave thanks.

One of them was Chuck Searcy, who was a U.S. Army intelligence analyst in Saigon 45 years ago. Another was Manus Campbell, who survived some of the war’s bloodiest fighting as a Marine draftee in Quang Tri Province. Both are nearly 70 now.

While hundreds of Vietnam vets have come back for brief, melancholy visits to the old battlefields to heal their psychological wounds, Searcy and Campbell are different: They and a handful of other former U.S. servicemen have moved to Vietnam more or less permanently to help clean up the deadly mess left by American bombs and Agent Orange, the widely sprayed defoliant linked to birth defects and cancers.

“Everybody at the table was asked to talk about why they live here,” Searcy said by telephone on Thanksgiving night from the Hanoi Press Club, which sits atop an elegant French-colonial style building that opened in the ancient quarter of the city in 1997. “And everybody said it was mostly the people and the unique experience of being friends with people who had survived a devastating war.”

Hanoi’s two-decades-long war with the U.S.-backed Saigon government, which peaked in 1968 with over a half-million U.S. troops in South Vietnam, caused upwards of 1.5 million Vietnamese casualties, an untold number wrought by U.S. air strikes, including those on targets near the street where they dined last week.

Years later, landmines and bombs, buried mostly in the battlefields of the south, “have killed or maimed more than 100,000 Vietnamese since the war ended” in 1975, Searcy said. And Agent Orange is still taking its toll, now on a fourth generation of Vietnamese.

In September Searcy, Campbell, and other veterans visited Washington, D.C., to lobby for increased humanitarian aid to Vietnam. But they left empty-handed. “What we spend in Afghanistan in a week could go a long way to making Vietnam safe for the next 50 years,” said Searcy, decrying the trickle of money Congress has appropriated for cleaning up the lethal mess left from the decade of direct U.S. combat operations in the country.

Searcy’s patrician good looks might get him mistaken for a Coca-Cola executive looking for business in Vietnam. Instead, as a Hanoi-based representative of two humanitarian foundations – Project RENEW and the New York–based Humpty Dumpty Institute – he has been helping the Vietnamese recruit, train, and deploy teams to defuse unexploded ordnance and treat the wounded.

Campbell, who struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder for decades after returning to New Jersey after his 1967–1968 combat tour, freely admits that he was driven to visit Vietnam in 2007 out of remorse and guilt. “That 40 years later, children, farmers, and people living their daily lives could be killed by bombs used during the war…causes me pain,” he says.

He felt ashamed. He needed forgiveness, and to his surprise – and everlasting gratitude – the Vietnamese gave him that. In 2012, after visiting an orphanage and spending time in a Buddhist pagoda in Hue, a 700-year-old city that saw some of the fiercest fighting of the war, he founded the charity Helping the Invisible Victims of War out of his own pocket.

“I came here to help disabled and orphan children at first,” he says. But then he decided to stay, “to help families who were victims of recent explosions from [unexploded ordnance].” He eventually chose Hoi An, a market town on Vietnam’s central coast where old landmines and bombs lurk beneath the saw grass and rice paddies. But he’s also supporting a clinic for Agent Orange sufferers in the bustling port city of Da Nang.

A sorrowful, slow-talking man, Campbell lives in a modest cement house. A local Vietnamese woman keeps things tidy and shops for him in the market. A typical day begins with a bowl of pho, Vietnam’s legendary spicy beef broth, followed by “reading and study,” and then an afternoon visiting his projects.

“I like to visit children at the orphanage or schools,” he says in an email from Hoi An. He keeps his stateside friends and supporters up to date by phone and email. Life is simple. Some nights he has friends over to watch a DVD. And he makes the rounds of Hoi An’s numerous coffeehouses. But tragedy is never far away.

“Living here, I hear about these accidents, and it still causes me pain,” Campbell says. “That is why I decided to help some of the families of the survivors whose husband or fathers were injured or killed by the bombs. The shock of losing a father or husband is one thing, but how do the families eat after the accident? I provide funds so they can put food on table for a few months.”

Searcy, who worked for the Small Business Administration under President Jimmy Carter and once served as executive director of the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association, moved to Vietnam in 1994.

On what was Thanksgiving morning back in the States, about 800 representatives of international humanitarian organizations and Vietnamese officials gathered in Hanoi to talk about the continuing crisis of war-casualties. The upshot was no surprise: While Vietnam’s export economy is thrumming, it’s still one of the poorest countries in the world and struggling to finance ordnance removal and medical projects.

At least 11 million gallons of cancer-causing defoliants were sprayed on Vietnam for more than a decade and now afflict a third generation born since the war.

Hanoi, and the American veterans working in Vietnam, feel that Washington is obligated to pay a bigger share of the remedial work, but U.S. officials say they are wary of government corruption siphoning off aid money. Hanoi’s jailing of dissidents and independent journalists doesn’t help, either. “Ironically, we get more support from the government of Norway than we do from the government of the United States,” Searcy says.

It’s not that Washington has completely turned its back on Vietnam. Relations have slowly warmed over the years, propelled by a mutual interest in countering Chinese hegemony in the region. In 2013, U.S. government aid, “dominated by health-related assistance,” crested at $100 million, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Defense Department, pleased by its former enemy’s continued assistance on recovering MIA remains, has fostered military cooperation with Vietnam and built health clinics and dispatched medical instructors to the country.

In 2012, the U.S. kicked off a four-year, $43 million program to clean up a particularly toxic Agent Orange site in Da Nang – which quickly ballooned to twice that, much of it hoovered up by American contractors.

But along the bomb-cratered rice paddies and the remote paths in hamlets far from Da Nang, where the elderly and children alike struggle to get around without prostheses for crippled and missing limbs, the needs remain acute. Some veterans can barely stifle their disgust.

“Agent Orange is killing Vietnamese people gradually and killing the future generations,” Chuck Palazzo, a straight-talking Bronx native, charged in an interview on the TalkVietnam web site two years ago. In 2007, the former recon Marine moved his thriving Internet technology business to Vietnam so he could be close to projects working on the issue. “I focus on the remnants of the war,” he told Newsweek, “but mostly Agent Orange.”

In an email exchange this week, Palazzo begged off talking more about his life in Vietnam because he’d been laid low by dengue fever, a common but debilitating malady spread by mosquitos.

But on a website for a fund-raising event last summer, Palazzo raged that “the Agent Orange victims throughout Vietnam received nothing from the manufacturers of this poison, and the U.S. government has given Vietnam next to nothing.” The event, hosted by the Crazy Coffee Bar in Da Nang, raised $1,412 in local currency – a pittance in a country where, according to the Red Cross, 3 million people were affected in some way by Agent Orange, including at least 150,000 children born with birth defects.

In 2011 the elite, New York–based Aspen Institute, a think tank which fosters “ideas that define a good society,” launched an Agent Orange remediation effort, called the Hope System of Care, in the Cam Le district of Da Nang.

In October, it reported that “all 165 children and 27 of the 124 youth with disabilities in Cam Le are now in the Hope System of Care. We are looking for additional funding so that we can also enroll the remaining 97 youth with disabilities.”

The U.S. Agency for International Development is not involved. Some $9 million appropriated by Congress for such projects remain in the pipeline as USAID’s private contractor carries out study after study at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

“There’s just a huge gap between USAID, which has the money, and people on the ground who can use it,” says Richard Hughes, whose humanitarian efforts in Vietnam date back to the war years, when the aspiring young actor put his career on hold, moved to Saigon and launched the fabled Shoeshine Boys Foundation to help war-orphaned street kids. The key to success, he says after decades of experience, is dropping all the consultants and contractors USAID traditionally hires and putting money directly into the hands of small nongovernmental groups in Vietnam who have shown they know what they’re doing.

In recent months he has lobbied hard in Washington for direct humanitarian assistance to nongovernmental groups in Vietnam, and come away frustrated. “Agent Orange victim relief is now in free fall,” says Hughes, who has acted extensively in film and television, including The Departed, Law & Order, and Hostages.

“USAID might as well stay in Washington for all the impact they’re having,” he says.

Some experts say Washington is right has to be cautious, given Vietnam’s record of corruption and its distrust of foreigners, but these vets say such fears are overblown. The local Vietnamese they work with just want to get the job done – and they can, efficiently and honestly.

“The police will keep an eye on you when you first arrive,” Campbell says, and question local groups “about what you are doing.” But “I never had a problem in doing my work here.”

Searcy, who once launched a newspaper in Athens, Ga., thinks he might return to the state someday, but not just yet. “I'm sure I’ll go back, I just don’t have a timetable,” he said in an interview last year. “I might not have a choice, though. I don't have any retirement provisions, so Vietnam might be the only place I can survive as an aging veteran with no means.”

Myra Macpherson, a former Washington Post reporter and author of the 1984 book, Long Time Passing: Vietnam and the Haunted Generation, threw a party at her Washington apartment in September for Searcy and Campbell and some of their Vietnamese coworkers, whom she met on a trip to Hanoi last April.

She calls these vets unsung heroes of a forgotten war. “They came as innocent young soldiers and left shattered. Their return, years later, is, in part, atonement for what their country did, as well as a personal heartfelt humanitarian apology,” she says.

“They are truly a courageous band of brothers.”

"http://www.newsweek.com/2013/10/18/just-add-water-243680.html","Just Add Water","A tiny pellet barely the diameter of a human hair is the only thing that stands in the way of extracting endless cheap energy from tap water. After years of frustration, scientists now think they are close to a breakthrough that will transform the global energy market and revolutionize the world's economy.

Nuclear fusion is the Holy Grail of energy production: the ability to re-create the hectic super-hot conditions at the centers of stars, but in miniature. By blasting a minute piece of hydrogen fuel with high-powered lasers, scientists are hoping to compress the fuel and cause the centers of atoms to fuse, leading to a massive release of energy.

If the process can be made to work, a city like San Francisco could be powered for a year with just a couple of hundred gallons of water. Even a single drop of H₂O could supply a single person's power needs for a year.

How does nuclear fusion work? Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's National Ignition Facility in Livermore, California, fire 192 lasers at a chamber the size of a pencil eraser that contains a pellet about two millimeters wide made of either plastic or high-density carbon.

The inside of the pellet is coated with a mix of deuterium and tritium, which are two variants of hydrogen. Deuterium can be readily found in water and tritium is refined from lithium, which is an element present in garden soil.

Each of the laser beams has an assigned spot on the target and must hit it within 50 micrometers (about one-five hundredth of an inch) or less. It is not an easy feat. NIF scientists compare it to throwing a strike at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles from a Giants' pitcher's mound at AT&T Park in San Francisco.

However, precision isn't the hard part. It's the makeup of the pellet.

""There are two classic problems that we have when we try to do these implosions,"" says Ed Moses, director of NIF and Photon Science at LLNL.

One is keeping the shape of the capsule spherical. Once the lasers are focused on the capsule, it is heated very quickly up to millions of degrees Fahrenheit and becomes a plasma. Keeping the pellet uniform and round is tricky; if there's even a slight difference in pressure, the pellet can warp into the shape of a pancake or a football.

The other major difficulty is when the capsule material intermingles with the hydrogen fuel. Mix issues have been traced to tiny defects on the surface of the capsule — places where the pellet is slightly thicker or thinner than the rest of the shell. These minute differences can cause the capsule to rupture, sending capsule material into the reaction.

""Think about throwing little ice cubes into a cup of hot coffee,"" Moses says.

NIF researchers have been getting the mixing issue under control by redesigning how energy is distributed across the laser pulse, shortening the pulse from about 14 billionths of a second down to about 9 billionths of a second. Those changes have almost eliminated the breakup problems that were plaguing the researchers last year.

Moses feels he is now on the threshold of one of the greatest breakthroughs in science.

""In the last few weeks we've gone to approximately four times the level of energy that we were at a year ago,"" he says. ""We're on the verge of burning.""

What they are hoping to reach is ""ignition,"" the point at which the reaction starts giving off more energy than is being put into it. To get to that point, Moses thinks the lasers have to move 20 to 25 percent faster. That doesn't sound like too tall of an order until you consider that they are already moving at about 200 miles a second.

If ignition is reached and nuclear fusion is feasible, hooking it into the grid would not be difficult, Moses says.

The energy flies out of the fused atomic nuclei in the form of neutrons. If you run those neutrons through lithium, the lithium will heat up. And from that heat you can turn water into enough steam to turn a generator to make electricity.

And electricity is just electricity, however it is made. ""You wouldn't be able to tell that you had fusion energy powering your iPod, computer, or electric car - except there'd be no pollution, and you'd be using a small amount of water for fuel,"" Moses says.","2013-10-16 20:37:10","1","36.0","2.0","6.0","1.0","10.0","5.0","71.0","43.0","0.0","162.0","6.0","22.0","17","760","96.83","56.80","23.73","45.09","20.54","20.53","77.24","49.47","6.18","2.24","0.00","0.66","0.92","0.26","0.39","3.95","11.84","16.97","8.68","3.68","3.95","0.79","12.89","5.53","1.97","1.18","3.42","1.84","3.16","2.11","1.05","0.13","0.26","0.00","3.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","8.68","1.05","2.63","1.84","2.11","0.26","2.89","1.84","0.13","0.79","1.05","1.45","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.92","5.13","0.79","1.05","2.63","0.26","0.53","1.71","10.39","0.66","14.87","1.97","9.74","3.29","2.63","0.66","0.13","0.39","0.13","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.42","4.74","3.68","0.13","0.13","0.13","0.00","0.79","1.58","1.84","0.26","0.13","3419","7.89","20.864864864864863","1080","754","37","67.69","11.5","8.9","10.1","11.0","155","11.375","18.382811671087534","393","18.54","8","0.49","0","20","14","99","0","113","55","2","1","11","154","42","1","40","0","0","24","1","21","1","0","2","21","0","30","3","23","19","23","35","8","1","0","5"
"http://www.newsweek.com/2013/12/20/fbis-own-hostage-crisis-244956.html","The FBI’s Own Hostage Crisis","Last Thursday, an urgent call went out from CIA headquarters to the spy agency's director, John Brennan, who was giving a speech to a graduating class at The Farm, the CIA's training facility near Williamsburg, Va. Brennan was warned that the Associated Press and The Washington Post were about to publish the results of a long investigation revealing that Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent who had gone missing while ""on private business"" in Iran six years ago, had actually been working for the CIA.

A handful of national security reporters in D.C. had known of Levinson's CIA connection for years but agreed to sit on it, accepting the CIA's rationale that publishing the information could endanger the life of Levinson, who was ostensibly pursuing an investigation of cigarette smuggling for a private client when he went missing on Iran's Kish Island in March 2007. Levinson was thought to be in Iranian hands.

On Thursday morning, the entreaties of lower ranking CIA officials to the AP and Washington Post not to publish the story were rebuffed. Other high-ranking Obama administration officials, including White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes, as well as FBI Deputy Director Mark Giuliano, made the same argument to the reporters and their editors.

By the time Brennan got his warning from headquarters, however, it was too late to for him to make an appeal. The story, by the AP's Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman, who had recently left AP to join The Washington Post, was online.

Levinson's family also did not want the story published, according to their attorney, David McGee. ""The family did not authorize them breaking the story,"" McGee tells Newsweek. ""We assumed the AP would actually call and ask for permission.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney said publishing the story was ""highly irresponsible.""

The AP said ""publishing this article was a difficult decision."" The news agency's executive editor and senior vice president, Kathleen Carroll, argued that with Levinson in hostile hands for all this time, ""it is almost certain that his captors already know about the CIA connection but without knowing exactly who the captors are, it is difficult to know whether publication of Levinson's CIA mission would make a difference to them. That does not mean there is no risk. But with no more leads to follow, we have concluded that the importance of the story justifies publication.""

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

On Saturday night, McGee called publication of the story ""kind of a relief.""

For years the family had known of Levinson's work for the CIA, McGee says, explaining that after Levinson disappeared, ""We searched Bob's computer and found documents that connected him to the CIA. Those were not conclusive in themselves, but in those documents we found e-mails and addresses. My paralegal hacked the email accounts, and we found day-to-day back-and-forth correspondence with the CIA.""

From the beginning of this mess, the U.S. government steadfastly denied that Levinson ""worked for"" the CIA, which is technically correct - he was a contractor. But as the years passed with no breakthrough in his case, the family chafed at suppressing the truth, and began to feel that the CIA was more interested in covering up its connection to Levinson than in finding him.

McGee says the documents he found were turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which summoned CIA officials for an explanation. ""They at first bald-faced lied about it,"" says McGee, who spent 17 years investigating organized crime in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida. ""They said he had no connection with the CIA. Then [the committee] confronted them with the documentation we had, and they went, 'Oh boy, we have to go back and do an investigation.' At that point, the CIA launched an investigation.""

The CIA eventually concluded that Levinson had been improperly contracted and supervised by an agency intelligence analyst, Anne Jablonski, an expert on Russian organized crime. That had been one of Levinson's specialties at the FBI when he retired in 1998 and went to work as a private investigator. Jablonski had been giving him intelligence-gathering assignments, normally the work of the agency's clandestine operators, although in the past two decades analysts have increasingly worked in the field.

A year after Levinson disappeared, Jablonski and other two other CIA intelligence officials were forced out of their jobs and seven others were disciplined for their roles in the affair. To avoid an embarrassing lawsuit, and buy the family's silence, the spy agency paid the Levinson family $2.5 million.

Why Levinson went to Kish, meanwhile, remains a mystery. But one thing is clear: He had arranged a meeting there with Dawud Salahuddin, an American convert to Islam and fugitive assassin for the Iranian regime. (Salahuddin famously stole a scene from Three Days of the Condor and dressed as a postman to murder an Iranian exile on his doorstep in a Washington, D.C., suburb in 1980.)

By some accounts, Salahuddin, an African-American who grew up as David Belfield on Long Island in New York, had grown disenchanted with the Iranian regime during his 27-year exile. Levinson was encouraged by a reporter friend, NBC's retired investigative producer Ira Silverman, to think of Salahuddin as a potential source. But for what? The CIA? The tobacco company client for which he was also investigating cigarette smuggling? Both?

If Levinson came to Kish on a CIA mission, Salahuddin says, he didn't act like it during their meeting at a hotel there on March 9, 2007. He didn't ask for inside dope on the Iranian regime. ""He told me he was there on behalf of British American Tobacco, and he wanted to talk to some Iranian officials about cigarette smuggling in the Persian Gulf,"" he told Time magazine last week.

McGee, however, tells Newsweek Levinson had a far more risky mission: investigating high-level Iranian corruption. And that sounds like CIA work.

Levinson was picked up for questioning by Iranian security agents, says Salahuddin (whose accounts of meeting Levinson have varied over the years). He was not seen again until 2010, when more than a half-dozen people listed as contacts on Levinson's cell phone received a mysterious ""proof of life"" video in which he asked the U.S. government to arrange his release. The family responded, but heard nothing back. And then, in 2012, the family received still photos showing him gaunt and haggard with a scraggly beard, dressed in a prison-style orange uniform and holding a variety of signs begging for his rescue, including one that said ""Help Me.""

Washington is convinced that this quasi-CIA agent has been held by Iran all along, despite that country's denials and clumsy attempts to cast suspicion elsewhere. (In the 2010 video, for example, Pashtun music native to Pakistan and Afghanistan plays faintly in the background, as if from a radio casually left on.) At one point, however, McGee told Newsweek, the Iranians virtually admitted holding Levinson by secretly haggling with Washington over the procedures for his release, including the requirement that they would not have to admit that they'd snatched him.

Emissaries of Iran, he alleges from conversations with U.S. investigators, ""demanded that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton make a statement - there were some negotiations - that he's not in Iran, that he's in some third country other than Iran"" - such as the tribal areas of Pakistan. ""The negotiators thought she had agreed to do that. But at the last minute, she decided not to, and said he's somewhere in Southwest Asia, which was not the statement that the negotiators had agreed on. And so that deal fell through.""

""Now, I'm not criticizing the Secretary of State,"" McGee adds. ""I understand there are a lot of reasons you don't want to allow the Iranians to pressure the United States into lying to the world, and I'm not prepared to make a moral judgment about that.

""But what that demonstrates is that the Iranians had decided that they wanted to create the impression that he was being held by someone else.""

Hillary Clinton's office declined comment, but a U.S. diplomatic source cast doubt on McGee's account. A spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Last Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry told ABC News that he had ""personally raised the issue, not only at the highest [Iranian] level that I have been involved with, but also through other intermediaries.""

While McGee doesn't blame American diplomats for failing to solve the faction-ridden Iranian regime, he heaps scorn on the FBI for its role in the affair. While some agents and officials worked diligently to find Levinson and get him home, the bureau's efforts overall, he says, ""ranged from neglect to insufficient to absolute obstruction.""

He says the FBI has never interviewed ""some of the key witnesses"" with information on Levinson's whereabouts and suspected abduction by Iranian agents. ""An example: the first offer we got to swap Bob came in an email from a guy named Omar,"" who sent the offer to several people whose email addresses were on Levinson's phone. ""The FBI has never interviewed those guys about their contacts with Bob. Never talked to them.""

In addition, he says, ""Bob worked undercover on Iranian issues with a Russian gentleman of some dubious background [who] had been dealing undercover with Iranian nationals on very high priority issues for the CIA. The guy was perfectly willing to cooperate [and] had great information,"" but the FBI at first declined the offer ""because he was in Canada."" Only after months of pressure from the family, McGee says, did the FBI agree to interview him.

""Their efforts have been sporadic,"" McGee says of the FBI. ""They have staffed it poorly.... For years, this was staffed by junior agents. The junior agents were controlled by management. The management limited what they could do.... Off the record they would tell us, 'We're frustrated. We can't do the things we want to do, that we think are necessary for this.' ""

An FBI spokesman declined to comment, but McGee's accusations rankle a high former FBI official who was intensely involved in in the Levinson affair. ""We worked it hard and we wanted so bad to bring him home,"" this official tells Newsweek, on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the affair, some of which remain classified. Getting Levinson back, he says, ""would have been our finest accomplishment!""

A decade or two from now, that's going to be how you take care of your house - except the work will be done by small robots, each built for a single purpose. They will hover in the air to pick up clutter, climb walls to wash windows and scuttle under furniture to vacuum while you sit back with a cappuccino and binge-watch Breaking Bad reruns.

Outdoors you'll find a robot swarm cleaning the streets, trimming trees, and watering plants. Little packages will get dropped off by flying quad-rotor drones, probably emblazoned with the familiar Amazon.com smiley face. For the big stuff - like, say, a refrigerator - an autonomous vehicle guided by Google technology will pull into your driveway, and a hulking Google bot with six legs will carry the fridge up your stairs and gently set it where you want it.

Over Thanksgiving, Amazon unveiled its drone delivery project on 60 Minutes, and in no time the jokes and indignation were flying:

Hunters will grab their shotguns and use the drones like clay pigeons.

The drones will short out and fall from the sky by the hundreds when a rainstorm blows in.

Walmart is working on drones that kill Amazon drones.

Then, days after Amazon's reveal, Google went public with its new robotics unit, run by Andy Rubin, the whiz who created Google's Android operating system. The message: Google's investment is no lark. Robots are for real.

In fact, Google and a lot of other companies believe robots today are like cell phones back when they were the size of bricks and cost $6,000. It may take 10 or 20 years, but before long everybody is going to have a robot - or several.

These robots will not look the way most people expect - they won't walk and talk like C3PO or Rosie from The Jetsons. An all-purpose humanoid robot doesn't make much sense. As tech thinker Kevin Kelly wrote, ""To demand that [intelligent robots] be human-like is the same flawed logic as demanding that artificial flying be birdlike, with flapping wings.""

Instead, the world will gradually acquire many kinds of robots, each designed and built to most effectively carry out a particular task in a way that saves humans time, money or drudgery.

The Amazon drones would do that. Loaded with artificial intelligence, they promise to deliver small items faster than any human could.

Google's experimental driverless cars are robots. One day, a delivery truck driver will seem as redundant as an elevator operator.

Robotics and artificial intelligence are tough fields, but there's so much research lab and start-up money going into it, we'll get the technology right long before we sort out how to integrate robots socially, legally and practically. It's less difficult to imagine delivery drones working than to imagine the New York sky darkened by thousands of the things carrying everything from shoes to Chinese take-out.

""We'll solve those kinds of problems when the benefits to society become large enough,"" says Colin Angle, chief executive officer of iRobot, maker of the granddaddy of consumer robots, the Roomba vacuum cleaner. Angle notes that when cars were invented, they were insanely dangerous and disruptive and widely hated.

Society is already a long way into robotics and we often don't know it. I recently visited some family members who own an enormous farm in Saskatchewan. They handle the harvest with just three people and a giant combine that has so many smarts, the driver mostly rides along and never touches anything. In another decade, the smarts will be so good that the farmer can stay inside and play the commodities market while machines do all the work in the field.

Robot news will keep coming. A company called Knightscope just unveiled its robotic security guard. It could roam a warehouse floor at night, its camera keeping an eye out for anything unusual, its chemical sensors sniffing for leaks.

A startup called Play-i is making toy-like bots that can teach a 5-year-old how to program bots. And you know where that will lead in two decades: 25-year-olds who can invent ever more intelligent bots.

Rodney Brooks, who runs the robotics lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-founded iRobot with Angle, has a new robotics company, Rethink Robotics. It is making an inexpensive industrial robot that is simple to train and can work alongside a human. An entrepreneur, for instance, could set one up in her garage and teach it to make something, creating a small automated factory.

Brooks and Angle have long believed the Roomba was the first phase of the ""robot-enabled home."" They followed Roomba up with the Scooba floor-washing robot, and promise more along those lines - perhaps a window-washing bot, or a clothes-folding bot. (iRobot won't give specifics.) The bots will likely all be wirelessly connected to each other, and to a kind of ""head butler"" robot that takes commands from its owner and hands out tasks to the many mini-bots.

Now, it seems to be ... American economic optimism? Fifty-one months after an impressive stock rally began and 48 months after economic growth started, optimism is finally—finally!—breaking out.

You can even hear crowing from Charles Morris, the author of the bestselling crisis book The Two Trillion Dollar Meltdown: Easy Money, High Rollers, and the Great Credit Crash; in June he released a sequel volume—albeit a slim one—called Comeback: America’s New Economic Boom. His cause for celebration? The fracking revolution. The nation’s supply of natural gas locked in shale “is so vast that it has the potential to transform the manufacturing economy, creating jobs across the country and requiring a new infrastructure that will benefit the nation as a whole.”

Another former economic sourpuss, banking analyst Meredith Whitney—who (accurately) predicted the financial crisis and then (inaccurately) predicted a boom in state and municipal bankruptcies—is out with Fate of the States: The New Geography of American Prosperity. Forget the coasts, she argues. The plains and interior, fueled in large part by agricultural and energy resources, are now driving economic growth.

And while in his 2011 jeremiad, The Great Stagnation, George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen said all the low-hanging fruit of productivity and technology had been picked, times have changed. Having tracked continuing technological advances and the slowdown of health-care costs, Cowen is recanting a bit in his new book, Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation, due out in September.

The data generally seem to agree with them. In recent years the U.S. economy has managed to shrug off internal and external shocks, and it is showing every sign of powering through both tax increases and sequestration. The private sector has created nearly 7 million jobs since early 2010. The U.S. economic engine may be revving in a low gear, but it’s not in neutral or reverse, as most developed economies are. And economists have been ratcheting up their growth forecasts for 2014. “When the facts change, I change my mind,” economist John Maynard Keynes is believed to have said. Some economic thinkers, following suit, have reacted to the changing facts by changing their minds too.","2013-06-19 04:45:00","1","20.0","8.0","7.0","1.0","10.0","5.0","64.0","41.0","0.0","123.0","6.0","20.0","13","381","93.33","63.35","48.23","74.62","19.05","28.61","78.22","40.94","4.99","2.89","0.52","0.00","0.26","1.31","0.79","2.10","9.45","12.07","7.09","2.89","5.77","0.26","11.55","6.04","1.84","0.52","2.89","2.62","4.72","3.67","1.05","0.00","0.26","0.52","4.72","0.00","0.00","0.26","1.05","8.40","1.57","3.15","0.00","2.36","1.31","0.79","2.10","0.26","1.31","0.26","0.52","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.26","5.77","0.26","1.31","2.36","1.84","0.52","3.94","7.09","1.84","19.16","3.41","7.87","7.61","8.66","1.31","0.00","5.77","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","18.37","6.30","6.04","1.05","0.26","0.52","0.26","1.05","1.05","0.79","1.05","0.00","1914","9.07","21.444444444444443","595","371","21","53.51","13.3","10.2","13.69","12.8","107","5.0","20.616388140161725","257","19.61","7","0.4","0","16","9","40","0","37","33","0","1","3","57","51","1","23","1","0","9","6","15","0","0","4","6","0","9","12","18","11","8","13","1","1","0","1"
"http://www.newsweek.com/2013/12/20/lindsey-vonns-uphill-battle-244934.html","Lindsey Vonn’s Uphill Battle","It's an audacious stunt fraught with extreme risk: a live performance by an attractive, flaxen-haired female set amidst the peaks of Europe and airing on NBC for prime-time family viewing. But if Carrie Underwood can do it, why can't Lindsey Vonn?

Yes, that was Underwood in the role of Maria Von Trapp in The Sound of Music, which the Peacock broadcast with much fanfare on December 5. Some critics thought Underwood wasn't dazzling in this reprise of a Broadway musical that opened in the Eisenhower era, but the show drew 18.6 million viewers. Those numbers - only Sunday Night Football scored higher for the network that week - inspired NBC to re-air the musical in prime time earlier this week. There is something about seeing a pure-as-driven-snow blonde in peril, whether it be from the Nazis or from trolls on Twitter, that compels America to watch.

That's your cue, Lindsey Vonn.

In two months, God and knee ligaments willing, Vonn will be playing the role of Maria Vonn Trapped on NBC. Sort of. She should be the marquee star of The Games of the XXII Winter Olympiad from Sochi, Russia, and NBC is counting on her to do for its February sweeps ratings what Underwood did for them earlier this month. That is, if Vonn can make it past dress rehearsals.

A Hitchcock blonde originally from St. Paul, Minn., Vonn is the most decorated skier in American history. She is the reigning Olympic gold medalist in the downhill. Also, the six-time defending champion in the World Cup season standings in that discipline, as well as a four-time overall World Cup champion. In what spare time she has, Vonn, 29, dates Tiger Woods, which is on par with that entire Fraulein Maria-Captain Von Trapp affair in terms of notoriety, and she poses in stiletto heels atop coffee tables for Vogue shoots with Annie Liebowitz.

Vonn is what Ron Burgundy might refer to as ""kind of a big deal.""

There's just one problem: Vonn's right knee. Last February 5, one year and one day before the Opening Ceremony of the 22nd Winter Olympic Games from Sochi, Russia, Vonn suffered a horrific crash at the World Championships in Schladming, Austria. She tore both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) in that knee, and fracture her tibial plateau. At the time, Vonn was sailing down the mountain at about 75 mph, in sloppy conditions, and you can hear her whimper in pain as she lays sprawled on the slope afterward.

Minnesota Viking running back Adrian Peterson, the 2012 NFL Most Valuable Player, tore both his ACL and MCL and sat out 226 days.

Chicago Bull point guard Derrick Rose, the 2011 NBA MVP, tore his ACL in April 2012 and did not return to scrimmage for 276 days.

Vonn returned to the slopes in 203 days, in early October.

Beautiful. Fearless. Resilient. How do you solve a problem like Lindsey Vonn?

Last month, while training at Copper Mountain Ski Resort in Colorado, Vonn suffered a partial tear of her surgically repaired ACL. It was a setback, but her Olympic flame has not been extinguished. Still, between now and Sochi, every time Vonn hops on a chairlift, an executive at 30 Rock may light not an Olympic torch but a votive candle at nearby St. Patrick's Cathedral.

Nothing draws bigger prime-time ratings than the NFL, but you can't air football games after the Super Bowl (God bless NBC for trying, though - anyone remember the XFL?). The Winter Olympics, though not the ratings bonanza they once were, remain huge.

But for whom will you tune in to watch? Evan Lysacek, the American who is the reigning gold medalist in men's figure skating, just dropped out due to a torn labrum. Telegenic Olympic hurdler Lolo Jones qualified in bobsled, but it remains to be seen whether Lolo's YOLO spirit will result in LOLs back home. Charismatic snowboarder Shaun White, a two-time gold medalist, returns for his third Winter Games, but the Flying Tomato, 26, has seemed more amped of late about his band, Bad Things, than the half-pipe.

And then there's Vonn. Honestly, there isn't another Olympian outside of those four that the average American can name right now.

Vonn raced a World Cup event December 7 to 8 in Lake Louise, Alberta, her first competition since last February's crash. She finished 11th in the downhill event and fifth in the super-G. Afterward Vonn said that she'd compete in perhaps just one or two more events before joining her Olympic compatriots in Sochi. ""I know that I don't need to push myself and try to push the limits of my knee to race as many as races as I can.... I'm ready for Sochi,"" Vonn said then.

Vonn may not, in fact, be ready for Sochi when her events get under way in February. The world's premier downhill racer is waging an uphill battle against time.

""Climb every mountain,"" the abbess famously advised a perplexed Maria when she faced a momentous decision. Lindsey Vonn plans to apply that wisdom at the Winter Olympics... while headed in the opposite direction, of course.","2013-12-18 18:54:35","1","35.0","7.0","7.0","1.0","10.0","5.0","74.0","43.0","0.0","147.0","6.0","22.0","17","878","91.66","53.64","47.43","37.88","17.56","20.50","70.62","42.60","8.09","3.87","0.68","0.00","0.57","2.39","0.23","4.21","7.63","14.58","5.47","3.08","5.47","1.25","8.20","4.10","2.51","1.48","3.53","1.71","3.08","1.82","1.14","0.11","0.11","0.23","5.58","0.11","0.00","2.05","0.57","7.97","1.14","0.80","0.80","2.16","0.68","3.30","2.62","1.59","0.91","0.11","0.91","0.57","0.23","0.00","0.11","5.92","0.80","2.05","2.39","0.46","0.80","2.28","5.58","1.03","18.68","0.80","9.45","8.66","1.14","2.51","0.34","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.11","0.11","0.11","0.00","19.02","6.04","7.18","0.23","0.00","0.46","0.00","1.82","0.68","1.94","0.68","0.00","3964","7.58","19.085106382978722","1171","866","46","69.31","10.2","8.3","10.62","10.6","165","6.583333333333333","17.141247113163974","477","17.81","24","0.42","0","26","29","85","0","118","55","4","0","14","136","171","5","29","0","0","27","14","30","3","1","4","14","0","29","30","17","10","6","22","6","5","0","3"
"http://www.newsweek.com/2013/12/20/two-numbers-when-moneys-gone-244964.html","Two Numbers: When the Money’s Gone","The prospect of public sector pension cuts has raised plenty of anxiety lately about retirement. We all know Americans probably aren't as saving as much as they should, but how bad could it be?

A lot worse than you might imagine. Thirty million Americans between the ages of 50 and 64, one half of the population nearing retirement, have no retirement savings at all, according to an analysis by the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School. That means no pension plan, no 401(k), no IRA.

For those nearing retirement with savings, the prospects aren't that much better. Fifteen million or so Americans - and these are the most prepared for retirement in their age group of 50- to 64-year-olds - have average retirement savings of $140,654. Typically financial planners advise 10 times your income at retirement to maintain your living standard. That would imply an annual income ahead of retirement of around $14,000, but in fact, the annual income of Americans approaching retirement in this category is more than $50,000. That suggests many with retirement savings will still experience a sharp drop in living standards upon once they stop working.

What has really hurt Americans nearing retirement is the Great Recession and its aftermath. As some lost jobs, they also lost retirement contributions and turned to their retirement accounts to make ends meet. While the labor market has been slowly improving, many of those who do land new jobs are not finding employment with the same benefits they once had. ""If you lose a couple years in accumulating retirement savings, say five years before you retire, you can never catch up,"" said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis. The retirement savings crisis may turn out to be a lot closer than we think.","2013-12-19 19:49:50","1","20.0","2.0","7.0","1.0","12.0","10.0","66.0","41.0","0.0","131.0","9.0","20.0","13","306","85.72","64.05","47.25","12.71","20.40","23.86","89.54","45.42","8.50","4.58","0.00","0.65","1.96","0.00","1.96","3.92","6.21","15.69","7.52","3.59","5.23","2.61","13.07","5.88","4.58","0.98","6.86","4.90","3.59","1.31","2.29","0.33","0.00","1.31","7.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.42","2.94","0.98","1.31","3.27","1.31","3.59","1.63","0.00","0.65","0.65","0.65","0.00","0.65","0.00","0.00","8.17","1.31","2.61","1.63","1.63","1.63","1.96","7.84","2.94","15.36","1.96","6.54","7.19","13.40","0.00","0.00","5.88","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.33","0.33","0.00","0.00","15.36","4.58","5.88","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","1.63","0.65","0.65","0.65","0.98","1472","7.63","20.533333333333335","461","300","15","59.64","13.5","9.9","12.18","12.5","57","6.583333333333333","17.6","191","18.67","2","0.44","0","7","16","29","0","42","17","4","0","7","46","19","5","21","0","0","11","5","18","0","1","2","6","0","12","4","9","4","12","7","1","2","0","1"
"http://www.newsweek.com/2014/01/03/christies-artful-conquest-244976.html","Christie’s Artful Conquest","On November 12, Christie's, the largest auction house in the world, set a record by selling $691.6 million worth of art in a single night. The lots included a gnarled, surreal $142.4 million triptych portrait of the painter Lucian Freud by Francis Bacon and a $58.4 million bright-orange fiberglass balloon dog sculpture by Jeff Koons, the highest price ever paid for a work by a living artist. But despite the staggering numbers, the company is looking for even more. They're going to get it by embracing the secretive tendencies of the art market.

In a serene meeting room on the top floor of Christie's Rockefeller Plaza offices, Marc Porter, the baronial chairman and international head of private sales for the American department of the auction house, recently outlined its plan to take over the part of the art market it doesn't already control: behind-the-scenes deals made between collectors exchanging work that has already been sold out of artists' studios.

These private sales, which the art world calls the secondary market, were previously controlled by major commercial galleries like New York's Gagosian or David Zwirner. The sales provided a way for collectors to keep their buying and selling habits secret as well as creating a much-needed backdoor business for dealers whose expenses are high and profit margins on selling work by new artists low. But that system could be disrupted as auction houses step into the picture.

Dressed in a tightly tailored blue suit worthy of David Hockney, striped purple socks and a woven red tie speckled with orange spots, Porter stated Christie's ambitious goal: ""We intend to be the largest secondary market art dealer in the world with the best artists on view, the broadest global network...and the best intelligence about who's in the market.""

Christie's was founded in 1766 by James Christie, whose first auction included chamber pots and pillowcases alongside works of art. Christie made a name for himself as a conduit for major art deals, like the sale of politician Sir Robert Walpole's collection to Catherine the Great in 1778 for $64,000, or around $1 million in today's dollars.

The business has grown to more than 40 countries - it launched its first auction in India in December - and generated $3.68 billion in sales during the first half of 2013. Christie's private sales department has also grown from $185 million in sales in 2000 to $1 billion in 2012, or 16 percent of its overall business, according to statistics provided by the company. ""There have always been privately negotiated sales at Christie's,"" Porter said. ""About 50 percent of the market is traded privately,"" he said.

The notoriously unregulated art market is built on trust and reputation rather than hard contracts. Private sales can be an appealing way to protect those intangibles. ""Collectors are inclined to sell privately when they don't want anyone to know they're divesting,"" Sarah Thornton, a sociologist and the author of Seven Days in the Art World, wrote in an email to Newsweek. A collector might be friends with the artist whose work he is offloading, or might want to flip a piece quickly for more than he paid without damaging his relationship with a dealer - and Christie's is more than happy to help him do so when galleries may balk.

Dealers want to protect their territory. ""There's an implicit understanding between our clients and us that they will offer us work if they're interested in reselling it,"" said James Cohan, the founder of the James Cohan Gallery, a large space in New York's Chelsea art neighborhood with a branch in Shanghai that shows internationally acclaimed artists like Yinka Shonibare and Trenton Doyle Hancock. ""It's about loyalty to the gallery, and like any business relationship... if people are loyal to us, we'll be loyal back to them,"" he said.

While galleries like James Cohan have the ability to offer collectors premier works by the artists they represent, auction houses have other advantages. They can reach the widest network of interested buyers with their auction research, may be able to net higher prices, and don't discriminate as much as a gallery would in selecting the perfect collector for a work. ""Our commitment is to a very particular vision.... The soul of the gallery matters,"" Cohan said. Auction houses ""come closer to treating the work of art as an asset class than we do.""

However, that market-driven attitude might be to the auction house's advantage as the taste for high-end art buying grows beyond its niche beginnings (Jay-Z, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Steve Martin are all collectors). Galleries can be too intimidating and exclusive for outsiders. ""Neophyte collectors feel reassured by the Christie's and Sotheby's brand names,"" Thornton explained. ""They may not have cultivated relationships with private dealers.""

As actor Daniel Radcliffe, an avowed art collector, discovered, it can be difficult to buy a piece even if you can afford it. Radcliffe was turned away from purchasing a Jim Hodges work by a New York City art dealer, who said he was ""waiting for a more prestigious collector to take that."" Now, Radcliffe can give Porter's team a call and have them hunt one down for him.

Or, Radcliffe could just go shopping. To capitalize on private sales, Christie's is also expanding its program of ""selling exhibitions"" where the work on display is discretely available to purchase. In late November, Christie's hosted an exhibition in London called When Britain Went Pop!, exploring the lesser-known British side of the Pop Art movement. The show included BDSM-inspired furniture-sculptures by Allen Jones, collage by Peter Blake, and Derek Bosher's Special K, an expressionistic riff on the cereal's iconic logo.

Unlike a normal museum show, one fourth of the 142 pieces on display were for sale. Of course, as the august art patron J.P. Morgan once purportedly said of the cost of his yacht, if you have to ask the price, you can't afford it. The works in When Britain Went Pop! ranged from $32,000 to six figures and beyond, according to Christie's.

Both Christie's and Sotheby's, the world's second-largest auction house, have dabbled in launching brick-and-mortar galleries to show and sell artists' work, but the results have been mixed. Christie's acquired Haunch of Venison gallery in 2007, to negative reviews, but shut it down earlier this year and folded it into the private sales department. Sotheby's S2 gallery, launched in 2011 in New York and 2013 in London, continues to provide a platform for the company's private sales. In 2012, Sotheby's reported $906.5 million in private sales, 17 percent of its total $5.4 billion.

As the two auction houses compete in an arms race to gather and sell the dwindling supply of modern art masterpieces left in the hands of private collectors, they are looking for every possible area of new market development. This is particularly the case with Sotheby's, which remains under pressure from its largest shareholder, hedge fund manager Dan Loeb. Private sales could provide the decisive advantage, making it easier for auctioneers to convince collectors that now is the time to sell while ensuring that their names don't appear in any headlines in the process.

Yet art collecting is ultimately driven by passion. For the auction houses, it could be difficult to cultivate collectors and nurture artists in the way that individual dealers do while focusing on economics and dealing with the bureaucracy of their large corporate structures. And without that feeder into the market, no future masterpieces would be made. ""It's hard to have a gallery without a face,"" Cohan critiqued. ""The soul of the gallery matters.""

Soul or not, auction houses are still trying their best to corner the private sales market. With Christie's bringing its formidable resources to bear, galleries will find it increasingly hard to stop it from becoming the go-to clearinghouse for international art deals, a kind of Walmart for the most luxurious of luxury goods. ""When buying or selling art,"" Porter said, we want people to call Christie's first.""","2013-12-31 17:57:45","1","34.0","5.0","7.0","1.0","10.0","5.0","80.0","43.0","0.0","177.0","6.0","23.0","20","1354","96.15","70.27","13.57","53.54","22.95","26.88","77.62","43.35","6.13","2.66","0.00","0.66","0.22","0.74","1.03","3.47","8.79","16.40","6.13","2.66","5.10","0.89","10.41","5.54","3.32","0.96","3.77","1.77","2.36","1.92","0.44","0.07","0.07","0.07","7.61","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.81","7.09","1.11","1.03","1.18","1.99","0.66","2.29","2.36","1.26","0.59","0.44","0.81","0.30","0.07","0.15","0.30","7.02","1.48","2.81","2.29","1.03","0.59","3.18","7.75","0.89","12.92","1.48","7.75","3.84","4.58","2.66","1.03","5.76","0.22","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.07","0.07","0.07","0.00","18.91","4.95","5.83","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.15","1.26","2.29","3.32","0.15","0.81","6558","7.99","24.63157894736842","1950","1337","66","59.33","11.5","10.0","12.47","12.9","283","4.875","18.586716529543757","625","22.21","7","0.42","0","42","47","131","1","182","96","8","10","21","221","131","1","97","0","0","45","18","48","4","1","5","43","0","62","45","35","27","40","25","5","2","3","6"

He had shared some of that porn (Robinette's computer contained more than 18,000 images and 900 videos) with someone he knew only by an email address: kiddoko@gmail.com. Eight months earlier, the man with that address, Anthony Brooks, had walked out of a federal courthouse in lower Manhattan to begin a 10-year probation sentence for possessing child pornography.

At first, Brooks, who was in his mid-30s, seemed to be a model probationer. He met deadlines. He passed mandatory polygraphs. There were suspicions when the FBI contacted Vargas to say that a computer was streaming child pornography in the vicinity of Brooks's apartment, but an investigation by a probation officer turned up nothing. Then, a couple months later, Vargas got the call from Minnesota. A search of Brooks's Gmail account uncovered a large volume of child pornography exchanged with a 34-year-old El Paso resident named Miguel Gomez. To avoid tipping off either suspect, officials in Texas and New York agreed to coordinate searches of the two men's homes. In the meantime, Vargas and his colleagues kept close tabs on Brooks through surveillance and unannounced home visits.

On December 8, at 3 p.m., Vargas got an email from an assistant district attorney in Texas. Officers there had arrested Gomez earlier than planned. Worse, the arrest had made the local TV news. Worried that Brooks might see the report, Vargas quickly assembled a team of 12 probation officers to arrest the pornographer. His unease grew when the team discovered that Brooks wasn't at work. ""He knows,"" Vargas thought. ""He's going to run."" At Brooks's home, nobody answered the door, but through a vent, Vargas could see inside. Brooks was pacing, a knife held to his wrist. The officers, with backup from the FBI, forced their way in and disarmed him. Computers seized from his home were brimming with child pornography organized into folders with names like ""babies,"" ""3yrboy"" and ""4yrboy.""

In August 2013, a federal judge sentenced Brooks to 16 years in prison. The operation was a coup for the U.S. probation office in Manhattan. Today, however, thanks to several years of budget cuts, when officers in New York recount the story, it sounds more like an elegy than a victory march.

The debate over sequestration - the automatic budget cuts that went into effect on March 1 - has centered on Congress and executive branch agencies. Yet, it's the judicial branch that has felt the pinch most acutely. While accounting for only $7 billion, or two tenths of one percent of the national budget, the courts' budget nevertheless lost $350 million, or 5 percent, to the current sequester. The new budget deal in Washington promises to restore some of what sequestration cut, on top of a slight ad hoc increase in funding in October. But court officials say it's too early to tell what the deal means for the judiciary.

Sequestration hit after several years of flat funding for the courts. ""In practice, that's a decrease, because our must-pay items - salaries and rent - have increased each year,"" Loretta A. Preska, the chief judge of the Southern District of New York, told me. (The district encompasses Manhattan, the Bronx, and several counties just north of New York City.) That sliced away the fat and then the muscle.

Sequestration is, in the metaphor frequently employed by people who work in the judiciary system, cutting bone. Salaries remain a must-pay item because the Constitution forbids lowering the wages of judges, and courts must hear all cases properly brought before them. Federal courts, notably, did not shut down in October. That leaves staff cuts. Between July 2011 and August 2013, according to court figures, the judiciary reduced its clerical and law enforcement staffing by 2,500 employees, or 12 percent. The bone-deep incisions are so severe that they prompted the chief judges of 87 federal districts to sign a letter to Vice President Joseph Biden in August pleading for increased funding. ""The cuts have created an unprecedented financial crisis that is adversely affecting all facets of court operations,"" they wrote.

In the wake of sequestration, litigants have encountered delays and criminal defendants have had to contend with a dearth of court-appointed attorneys. But another constituency hurt by the sequester - the public - has gone largely unnoticed.

The judiciary employs nearly 6,000 probation and pretrial services officers. Unlike most law enforcement officers, they police an already-identified population of accused or convicted felons. While most of them are no danger to society, a subset - like Anthony Brooks or violent offenders - pose a significant threat. And their numbers are rising. A steady wave of convicts released from federal prison has flooded the probation system in recent years - with more than 6,000 probationers added between 2010 and 2012 - and court officials expect that trend to continue in the foreseeable future. At the same time, policymakers on Capitol Hill have left federal probation offices with less and less money each year to pay for staff and programs needed to monitor this swelling population.

""I think we're at the bare bone,"" said Michael J. Fitzpatrick, the Southern District of New York's chief probation officer. ""I'm going to have to take any resources I have next year and start trying to replace officers.""

Nationwide, a quarter of the available probation and pretrial services positions stand vacant. Sequestration has so strained this system that, court officials say, it's jeopardizing public safety.

The surveillance capabilities, speed, manpower, and time that secured Brooks's arrest - ""those things are lost now,"" Vargas told me recently. That loss is particularly harmful in the Southern District of New York, where, as in many urban districts, the recidivism rate is higher than the national average - 19 percent of its nearly 3,000 supervised convicts violated their probation in 2012 versus 12 percent nationally.

Once every two weeks - on average - probation officers in the Southern District execute searches at the homes of convicted felons who they have reason to suspect are violating the terms of their release. ""A couple years ago...every time I turned around [officers returned with] a gun or large quantities of drugs,"" said Michele Greer Bambrick, a senior probation officer and sentencing specialist who also handles evidence after searches. ""I remember one day they had these eight big marijuana plants they were marching down Barclay [Street]. They recovered all sorts of firearms, from handguns to rifles. We've even seen a seized samurai sword.""

As in Brooks's case, these searches can foil ongoing criminal enterprises. A mid-September search brought down a driver's license counterfeiting operation, according to Fitzpatrick. In another case, Vargas said, probation officers disrupted a drug trafficking scheme run through LaGuardia Airport in Queens. Officers seized $300,000 in cash.

A related program - high-intensity field operations (HIFO) - has met with similar success. In HIFOs, six or seven officers pay an unannounced visit - usually in the evening or early in the morning - to the home of a probationer at risk for recidivism. Arriving during off-hours heightens the deterrent effect. ""In addition to individuals catching heat from the probation department, they're also going to catch it from their mother or grandmother, who's going to say, 'I don't like this. You get it together or you're out of here,' "" said Shawnte Lorick, a senior probation officer.

On one recent HIFO visit, officers walked in on all the signs that their ward had become a serious drug dealer - heroin, crack, baggies, and scales. In another, according to court records, officers on a HIFO visit to the Bronx apartment of Julius Kornhauser, who had been convicted of tax fraud, noticed suspicious tax documents and seized his computer. To their surprise they found 700 images of child pornography.

Searches and HIFOs are, in the realm of public safety, cost-savers. Ordinary law-enforcement investigations are expensive and have to detect unknown criminals doing their utmost to stay unknown. Searches and HIFOs, meanwhile, target known offenders when there's reason to suspect they are committing fresh crimes. They can be prompted by as little as a call from an angry girlfriend or a failed drug test.

Two years of effective budget cuts culminating in sequestration has curtailed these programs and, ironically, driven up the cost of maintaining public safety. In recent months, the probation office in Manhattan has had to delay searches by up to a week. That impairs the efficacy of searches because the tip that prompted the search - say, a run-in with the police - might also tip off the target, Fitzpatrick said. ""We need to search before the person gets home and destroys or moves evidence. Right now, we can't be sure we're always able to do that."" As of the first week in October, the office had to cut back significantly the number of HIFOs for lack of manpower. Given its uncertain impact on the courts, the pending budget deal in Washington has not affected these cutbacks.

Nationwide, since July 2011, budget cuts have forced probation and pretrial services offices to slash their staffs by 600, or 7 percent, according to court statistics. At the same time, the number of people under supervision has soared. In the Southern District of New York, for example, between June 2012 and October 2013, the number of offenders on probation with a 70 to 90 percent likelihood of recidivism surged from 469 to 610. The American Probation and Parole Association recommends that each case officer have no more than 30 high-risk cases, and based on that ratio, the district should have added four officers in that year.

""Instead, we lost officers,"" Fitzpatrick told me. Officers now carry high-risk caseloads ranging from 50 cases and up. ""We're at a point now where we can't lose any more positions."" In 2014, five officers face mandatory retirement.

The consequences are palpable. When asked about what recent searches turned up - compared to the guns, drugs, and samurai swords of two years ago - Greer Bambrick told me: ""Not much. I haven't seen many drugs, and I haven't seen any weapons.""

Where 13 or 14 officers would have taken part in a search two years ago - like the raid that brought down Anthony Brooks - Lorick said, ""now we're struggling to get six.""

Delayed searches, less time in the field, and dwindling funding for electronic monitoring are the proximate results of budget cuts to the judiciary. But the second-order effects are what frightens court officials. Ask them why, and they'll say David Renz.

On March 14, Renz, a small man with a mop of jet black hair and a wispy goatee, approached Lori Bresnahan, a 47-year-old school librarian, and her 10-year-old daughter as they left gymnastics practice at the Great Northern Mall, in Clay, N.Y., a Syracuse suburb. Renz forced his way into Bresnahan's car and restrained her and her daughter with twist ties. After raping the 10-year-old, who later managed to flee, Renz stabbed Bresnahan repeatedly in the head and chest with a knife he had used earlier to cut away her daughter's clothing.

Only after Renz was in state custody did federal probation officers in Syracuse realize that something was amiss with one of their charges. In January, FBI agents had arrested Renz after discovering more than 100 gigabytes of child pornography on his computer. His bail conditions included ""location monitoring"" - wearing an electronic ankle bracelet that could detect whether he was at home. The day Renz killed Bresnahan, he had dismantled and reassembled the bracelet before leaving home. The alert the bracelet dispatched was similar to the 46 others it had registered - indicating tampering or removal - in the two months after Renz was released on bail. For the most part, the alerts were ignored.

An investigation faulted inadequate monitoring policy and practice in the Northern District of New York, and court officials promised to reexamine location monitoring policy - ""within available funding."" That qualification prompted Congressman Dan Maffei, a Democrat in whose district Bresnahan lived, to take to the House floor to inveigh against sequestration cuts to the judiciary.

""The answer from the courts is that their ability to keep it from happening again is limited because their funding was cut,"" he said. ""We owe [the victims] an end to the sequester cuts.""

Others draw a casual connection between the budget and Renz. ""Look - you cannot say that the budgetary constraints every one has been working under for the last several years didn't contribute to that in some way, shape, or form,"" Greer Bambrick, the senior probation officer, said. ""If they don't have the manpower, every time someone's bracelet pings the wrong way and sends a message - they can't just run out and check it.""

Because officers have to respond to such alerts at all hours of the day, location-monitoring cases are particularly onerous. In the Southern District of New York, location-monitoring officers carry about 40 cases, well above the 26 recommended by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Jason Lerman, a pretrial services officer in the district who works on such cases, said that caseload approaches the human limit. Any higher and officers ""will get burned out very quickly, and they won't be able to supervise these defendants appropriately,"" he said.

The Southern District's pretrial services office has 16 vacancies and lacks funding to fill them. ""These caseloads, the only thing they're going to do is rise. As the numbers get bigger, it just gets more difficult for the officers to supervise,"" Arthur Penny, the chief of that office, told me. ""Our concern is always if they are overwhelmed - if they don't have the time to be as diligent as they should be - could there be another David Renz in the wings that we'll miss? There's a real concern about that.

""People talk about doing more with less,"" he said. ""But there's going to come a point where you're just doing less with less.""","2013-12-18 20:05:38","1","48.0","3.0","7.0","1.0","10.0","5.0","92.0","43.0","0.0","177.0","6.0","24.0","23","2376","94.80","68.12","39.22","7.37","18.42","25.67","77.90","42.42","7.37","3.79","0.55","0.55","0.17","1.09","1.43","3.58","8.50","14.90","5.68","2.57","4.71","0.80","11.57","4.59","2.95","1.05","3.58","2.74","2.99","0.67","2.27","0.63","0.51","0.51","7.58","0.25","0.08","0.42","1.05","6.90","1.43","1.05","0.76","1.89","0.88","2.23","2.06","1.09","0.84","0.13","1.43","0.51","0.59","0.42","0.04","10.31","0.97","1.39","6.40","0.93","1.09","4.76","6.82","0.72","17.00","2.23","8.67","6.14","4.00","0.34","0.76","1.77","0.04","0.04","0.04","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.04","0.00","20.66","5.89","6.94","0.08","0.00","0.04","0.00","2.57","2.40","2.06","0.25","0.42","11585","7.66","19.23015873015873","3579","2337","133","62.07","12.3","9.0","12.53","11.8","467","7.6","17.033153615746684","951","17.96","28","0.43","0","78","83","242","1","292","144","20","3","17","402","219","3","183","1","0","76","30","73","4","1","16","69","0","74","112","54","66","72","49","10","13","1","10"
"http://www.newsweek.com/afghans-take-their-legal-woes-taliban-justice-system-62977","Afghans Take Their Legal Woes to the Taliban Justice System","When Wali Khan returned to Afghanistan in 2008, having spent his entire life in an Afghan refugee camp in Pakistan, his first order of business was to build a house on his late father’s patch of land in eastern Paktia province. But when he tried to reclaim the other 70 acres he believed to be his, he ran into big trouble. A powerful tribal family warned Khan and his four uncles not to touch the land that they claimed was theirs. “The whole village was threatening us with death,” Khan says, adding that the Ahmedzais are “strong, rich, and influential.”

The tension nearly ended in violence last year as Khan, his uncles, and the Ahmedzais took up arms and prepared for battle. “There was a real danger of bloodshed,” says the 33-year-old Khan, who runs a medical laboratory in the provincial capital, Gardez. Khan quickly ruled out taking his case to the official government courts, which he says are corrupt and plodding. But he didn’t want to risk a shootout, so instead he decided to take the land feud to the Taliban’s Islamic court. The Ahmedzais agreed, saying they had no objection to submitting their claim to the Taliban’s court. “Taliban courts are easier, more transparent, and quick, and stand on Islamic law,” says Khan. “If a Taliban judge is found to be corrupt, he will be beheaded.”

The Taliban may not be popular, but their courts seem to be. Even a senior adviser to Afghan President Hamid Karzai admits that many Afghans prefer Taliban courts to the government’s legal system. And a member of Parliament from Zabul province, Qadar Qalatwal, agrees, saying local government courts are simply hopeless. “The local government is drowning in corruption so no one trusts the justice system,” he says.

As a result, increasing numbers of Afghans are taking their legal woes to the Taliban justice system. “Afghans come from all over, from the cities and countryside, to resolve family and land disputes, loan problems, and even women’s issues,” says Taliban Upper Court judge Habibullah Haqqani.

Most Afghans say they don’t want to be ruled by the Taliban again as they were for years until the American-led invasion of 2001. They don’t like the Taliban’s strict social policies and its banning of girls’ education. They deplore the fact that 80 percent of the more than 2,700 civilian casualties last year were caused by the insurgents. But they like Taliban-style justice. As Khan puts it: “We don’t want to be ruled by them. But we support the Taliban’s Islamic courts.”

A government judge from Ghazni province, who doesn’t wish to be named for security reasons, strongly defends the Afghan legal system, though he admits corruption is endemic and the wheels of justice are rather creaky. “Most Afghan people are illiterate and do not have any patience,” he says. “They want a verdict in a few weeks.” Official justice, he adds, may be slow, but it is more thorough and rigorous. “Government courts need to study each case deeply and need evidence, proof, eyewitnesses, and supporting documentation,” says the government judge. “Taliban courts are speedy and may not be corrupt but the trials are usually not fair.”

Khan says finding a Taliban court proved to be easy. “The villagers know who the judges are and how to contact them,” Khan says. Following their instructions, Khan traveled to the Shahikot Mountains along the Pakistan border, the place where the U.S. launched Operation Anaconda in 2002, one of its biggest battles against the Taliban and al Qaeda. Khan thought that he’d find a proper courtroom in the local village. “I thought I’d see banners and a room full of clerks and people,” he says. But it was just a nearly vacant mud-walled hut. The judge arrived on a motorbike, not in a fancy car like most government judges drive. The judge then took Khan to a nearby mosque where he interviewed him and took notes. The judge said he would send a couple of Taliban fighters to contact the 10 Ahmedzais, who also claim the land, and invite them to a meeting.

Ten days later, according to the instructions sent by the judge, Khan, his uncles and the 10 Ahmadzais went back to Shahikot where the judge escorted them to the courtroom nearby. “It was a simple court, just a few books in a room, and two Taliban judges,” says Khan. During the three-hour meeting both sides laid out their claims to the land. One judge threw out some of the Ahmedzais’ supporting documents, saying they were fake. “I found the Taliban judge to be a real expert on documents,” says Khan. The judges then scheduled another meeting, this time to include eyewitness testimony.

At the next meeting six days later in a mud hut near Gardez, Khan produced three witnesses, all aged between 90 and 95, to testify that the land belongs to his family. “Taliban judges respect the elderly,” says Khan. As the half-day session ended, the judges said they would send out a written and stamped verdict within one week. True to their word, Khan received the verdict one week later. But he was surprised and deeply disappointed by the judgment, which went against Khan and his uncles. Khan complains that the verdict was “not clear,” though he respects it since he believes it was based on Islamic law. He hasn’t given up, though, and has decided to appeal the decision to the Taliban’s Upper Court, which is based in an Afghan refugee camp at Kohat across the border in Pakistan. The case is scheduled to be heard this spring after the snows in the mountain passes melt, making the trip across the border easier.

Judge Haqqani, 30, is the man most likely to take up Khan’s appeal. A graduate of a religious school known as a madrassa, he was appointed to the Paktia Upper Court two years ago. “We make our decisions based on the testimony and Islamic law,” he told Newsweek. “We are not impressed by one’s position, money, or threats.” Haqqani says last year he handled 55 appeals and ruled that 45 of those lower-court verdicts were correct and only 10 were overturned. He says that over the past two years 99 percent of those who appealed to his court have accepted and implemented his decisions.

Afghans obey the decisions because they know that the penalty for flouting a Taliban court’s verdict would most likely result in a midnight visit by a guerrilla squad. And those gunmen will quickly execute the ruling on the spot.","2013-04-15 04:45:00","0","30.0","3.0","7.0","1.0","18.0","15.0","79.0","48.0","0.0","182.0","12.0","24.0","23","1118","89.36","78.44","13.89","30.29","18.63","21.29","78.18","44.72","9.03","5.99","0.27","0.54","0.00","3.22","1.97","3.04","10.02","11.90","6.08","2.42","5.99","1.43","14.31","4.20","2.24","1.25","2.86","2.33","3.85","2.06","1.79","0.36","0.54","0.36","11.72","0.72","0.27","0.18","3.76","9.66","2.33","1.43","1.25","1.88","0.81","2.68","2.50","0.36","2.06","0.09","0.54","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","9.48","1.25","0.36","6.44","0.81","0.89","4.38","7.78","0.81","13.69","2.24","7.07","4.74","3.40","0.45","0.54","0.45","0.63","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.23","5.55","6.98","0.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.72","3.58","1.97","0.00","0.36","5097","7.55","21.074074074074073","1519","1105","61","70.02","10.2","8.0","10.44","10.4","211","12.625","16.878009049773755","487","19.41","11","0.45","0","47","29","126","1","103","76","4","4","9","161","110","4","66","1","0","53","21","36","2","3","8","42","0","33","55","21","26","39","43","3","5","0","6"
"http://www.newsweek.com/2013/05/22/rehabilitating-neo-nazis-237412.html","Rehabilitating Neo-Nazis","At 23, with long hair and a colorful bandanna, “Jens” looks much like any other German university student. But the studiously scruffy demeanor belies a darker side. Jens is an ex-neo-Nazi or, in his own words, “the most dubious person that exists.” As he puts it: “Left-wing groups view you as a spy; right-wing groups consider you a traitor. And the political center is just uncomfortable with you.”

How Germany deals with neo-Nazis—and those who want to leave their ranks—is an issue that’s received a lot of attention as the trial of accused neo-Nazi leader Beate Zschäpe has gotten under way in Munich.

Few people know as much about the issue as Daniel Köhler, a manager at Exit Deutschland, the leading NGO for the rehabilitation of German extremists. Since its inception 13 years ago, Exit has rehabilitated more than 500 right-wing radicals, with a relapse rate lower than 2 percent, according to the group. Once someone comes to Exit, they get a case manager who assesses the situation, says Köhler. “Are their lives at risk because of their defection? Do they have to move to a different city or state in order to minimize the threats against them? Do they need a new identity? Do they need therapy?”

It’s an effective method to deal with a serious problem. According to the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, one of the country’s domestic intelligence services, there were 22,400 right-wing extremists in 2011, down from 26,600 in 2009. However, during that same period, the number of neo-Nazis increased from 5,000 to 6,000.

Getting individuals out can affect the collective strength of the extremist group. “It creates a huge hole in their ranks,” says Köhler. “There’s no more-effective way of combating right-wing extremism.”

As a teenager, Jens, who can’t reveal his real name publicly, felt himself drawn to an extreme-right group because it offered the attachment and closeness he didn’t have at home. At 18, he founded his own group. “For many, being a neo-Nazi is less about an ideology than about feeling strong in a group,” he says. “But after some time I realized that these people just wanted to get together to drink alcohol.” Jens decided to join a more political group but, after a while, he found himself disagreeing with the group’s entire ideology. At 20, he was ready to leave. But the price of quitting is often a life in secrecy and fear, and so Jens turned to Exit, a group he credits with making the break possible. Though living in fear of reprisals can be difficult, “I don’t see myself as a victim,” says Jens. “You have to take responsibility for what you’ve done.”

Sure, she’s pretty—stunning, actually. She has a breezy aplomb, à la Emma Stone or Jennifer Lawrence, which makes you think, I’d totally grab beers with her.

The 29-year-old actress graduated from Georgetown University with an economics degree back in 2005, but turned down a job offer from Goldman Sachs after a summer internship in favor of trying to make a go of it in the film industry. Her big breakthrough came during the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, when two movies she co-wrote and starred in premiered—the sci-fi drama Another Earth, directed by her Georgetown pal Mike Cahill, and another college friend Zal Batmanglij’s Sound of My Voice, about a mysterious cult.

Now Marling has reunited with Batmanglij for the thriller The East. In the film, which she also co-wrote, she plays Sarah Moss, an operative working for a private intelligence firm who’s tasked with infiltrating an eco-anarchist collective known as the East. The group, led by Benji (Alexander Skarsgard) and Izzy (Ellen Page), executes covert attacks—or “jams”—on eco-unfriendly corporations, e.g., flooding a Big Oil CEO’s vacation home with crude. The more time she spends with the group, however, the more she finds herself adopting its point of view.

What was your first filmmaking job when you moved to Los Angeles in 2005?

Mike, Zal, and I all spent some time working on docu-reality shows or documentaries. I had made this documentary with Mike, Boxers and Ballerinas, and learned how to shoot and edit. It was much easier to get a job doing those things, and it didn’t involve a compromise of morality the way that playing a vapid, thinly written character in some bad films did.

I think that there are starting to be more and more great roles written for women, but it’s also incredibly competitive. There aren’t as many parts as there are wildly talented young actresses, so it’s a good thing to keep writing for myself, as well as parts for all the other great women out there.

And you spent two months in 2009 with Zal practicing “freeganism,” which involves eating other people’s trash in the “total boycott of an economic system where the profit has eclipsed ethical considerations,” according to Freegan.info.

We were young, hungry, and broke, and wanted to learn more about these ideas. We spent the summer traveling—train hopping cross-country, living on organic farms—and fell in with anarchist collectives and freegan groups. We were changed by that experience. I think the activism of our generation is a kind of activism in how you live your life on a day-to-day basis, and there was something incredibly brave about that. It’s a hard thing to actually live your political ideals. It was years later, after we made Another Earth and Sound of My Voice, that we realized we couldn’t shake the experience and wrote about it.

Did you draw from your real-life experiences with the anarchist collectives for The East?

The spin-the-bottle scene came from something we did while on the road with the anarchist collectives. At first everyone’s a little embarrassed, and then you start doing it and it gets profound really fast. People feel afraid to open up and ask each other things, and then they do. We are so afraid to be intimate and vulnerable and real with each other. We prefer to tweet and Instagram and keep everything at arm’s length instead of just, “Let’s kiss.”

Why did you decide to have your eco-anarchist collective target multinational corporations and the pharma industry in the movie?

In the past, anarchy was about rebelling against governments because governments were the seat of power, but the new seat of power is definitely the corporation. Money is power, and the corporations have the money and the corporations are dictating policy. I think everybody can agree on one thing, which is that they’re frustrated by the lack of accountability. This idea that the banks are too big to jail or to fail, or that BP dumps all this oil off the coast of New Orleans and nothing of consequence really happens to them—everybody agrees that that’s foul, so The East becomes a little bit of wish fulfillment. Everybody is getting a secret pleasure out of the idea that they’re smuggling oil into the Hamptons estate of the CEO of a Big Oil company and dumping it in his pool.

You mentioned living one’s political ideals. Was that one reason you decided to walk away from your job with Goldman Sachs and veer off from the financial path you were on?

In the West, there’s this idea that what you do for a living is separate from who you are. But I think that the more you do something, the more it becomes who you are. There are a lot of people in finance who have made a lot of money and then taken that fortune and, using the same business mind that led them to acquire that fortune, applied it to attempting to do good. I respect that path, but I just didn’t know how to do it. I wasn’t happy. Don’t you have to hold yourself accountable for what your corporation does and how it’s acting in the world? And day to day, I wasn’t happy. I would go to work every day and was waiting until the clock reached an hour it was permissible to leave. Why was I going to be selling the hours of my life for that when time is your most valuable asset? It’s limited, you don’t know how limited it is, and it’s of immeasurable value. So I peaced out.","2013-05-29 04:45:00","1","33.0","16.0","7.0","2.0","12.0","10.0","67.0","43.0","0.0","150.0","9.0","22.0","17","1003","69.50","77.57","31.72","49.92","20.90","18.74","85.44","53.04","14.96","7.28","1.79","1.10","2.79","1.30","0.30","7.68","7.58","14.56","7.78","4.39","7.38","1.00","15.85","3.99","2.09","2.19","1.10","2.99","4.49","2.89","1.60","0.50","0.30","0.20","9.27","0.00","0.20","1.50","0.10","10.77","2.69","1.99","0.80","1.79","1.40","2.79","1.79","0.30","0.50","0.30","1.20","0.00","0.90","0.00","0.30","7.18","2.09","1.50","2.59","1.10","0.40","5.18","8.67","0.50","12.96","1.99","6.48","4.79","4.99","1.89","0.10","1.89","0.10","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.10","0.00","16.55","4.49","5.48","0.00","0.00","0.60","0.00","1.50","1.00","2.99","0.40","0.10","4494","7.67","22.02127659574468","1394","980","49","68.1","11.9","8.7","10.56","11.2","189","10.3","17.71428571428572","481","19.94","17","0.53","0","48","10","95","0","130","86","9","1","2","142","74","0","46","2","0","78","14","34","1","1","5","28","0","37","45","32","17","40","29","5","7","0","11"
"http://www.newsweek.com/budget-deal-hits-new-snag-both-sides-hunker-down-over-jobless-benefits-224365","Budget Deal Hits New Snag as Both Sides Hunker Down Over Jobless Benefits","Update: The House passed the bipartisan budget agreement Thursday evening, 332-94. It now heads to the Senate for final passage. The House will recess without extending unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed.

The budget deal is done, right? Warring Democrats and Republicans, faced with another shutdown of the government, have finally seen sense. Each has given a little and taken a little. For once, moderation has won the day.

Not so fast.

On Wednesday afternoon, two Democratic lawmakers made a rare trip up to the third floor of the U.S. Capitol building, where reporters spend their days in a long room overlooking the House chamber. Representatives Sander Levin of Michigan and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland were on a mission, and they wanted to make their case directly to the press.

It’s about emergency unemployment benefits, which are set to expire for the long-term unemployed on December 28 unless Congress extends them. If the House does not act before Friday, 1.3 million Americans will find themselves without any income three days after Christmas. By June of next year, that number will hit 3.2 million.

As the holiday recess draws near, lawmakers are scrambling to pass the budget deal struck by House and Senate negotiators this week and tie up a few other loose ends, including a temporary extension of the Farm Bill and what is generally referred to as the “doc fix,” an uncontroversial measure to prevent Medicare reimbursements to physicians from shrinking by 20 percent. (Lawmakers often refer to this as SGR, which comes from the Sustainable Growth Rate formula used to calculate reimbursements.) Both parties want to protect doctors from losing income.

But in a surprise move on Wednesday, even though the doc fix was not part of the budget agreement, Republicans in the House Rules Committee, which prepares legislation for a floor vote, attached a temporary, three-month doc fix to the upcoming vote on a bipartisan budget deal.

Democrats pushed back. If Republicans can vote to maintain doctors’ payments along with the budget, then surely they can vote to extend unemployment benefits for the 1.3 million uninsured, they argued. Levin and Van Hollen asked the Rules Committee to include in the vote a three-month extension of unemployment compensation. The Republican-run rules committee balked.

With the press huddled round, Van Hollen spoke first. “Right now in the Rules Committee, they’re going to adopt a rule that essentially merges the SGR fix for a three-month period into the budget agreement,” he said, stressing that a doc fix and unemployment were both specifically not part of the budget deal reached this week between the House and the Senate. “We support the doc fix, but my goodness, it would be unconscionable to not allow the House to also have a vote on extending unemployment compensation for three months at the same time.”

“It’s an appeal to the conscience of this institution,” Levin added. “Are we going to leave here saying, ‘We’ll reimburse physicians and absolutely cut off any continued help to people looking for a job who have been laid off through no fault of their own.’?”

But to Levin and Van Hollen, it’s far more than an issue of conscience. The two Democrats warned that the situation threatened the passage of the budget deal altogether, which will rely on Democratic votes to pass the House. “This does now add a new dynamic that could upset the applecart, put at risk the budget agreement,” Van Hollen warned.

One floor below the press gallery, Representative Pete Sessions, R-Texas, who chairs the Rules Committee responsible for merging the budget and doc fix votes, seemed off guard and displeased with this new twist on the budget talks.

“I do not go and negotiate deals,” Sessions told a throng of reporters, stressing that his job is just to get deals to the floor once they are made.

Sessions explained, step by step, what happened in the Rules Committee when Levin and Van Hollen pushed for a vote on unemployment benefits.

“I excused myself as chair [of the committee] for a few minutes and I went down and spoke to the speaker, to make sure I was not missing a piece, whether it was a part of an active discussion or resolution,” Sessions said.

“I went upstairs and said, ‘I asked the speaker if I was missing something, if there was this negotiated settlement that was underway,’ and told Mr. Levin and told Mr. Van Hollen that there was not a negotiated settlement that was imminent, and so I was not including it into the package.”

In other words, Sessions wasn’t including unemployment benefits in the vote because he didn’t have the go-ahead from Republican leadership. A final agreement on how to proceed did not exist.

“Does it look like doctors get theirs, the Farm Bill gets theirs, the budget deal gets done, and unemployed people are left out in the cold here?” one reporter asked Sessions.

He disagreed. “You know what it looks like to me? It looks like [Senate Majority Leader Harry] Reid, the White House and Speaker Boehner have not entered final negotiations or come to an agreement,” he replied. “That is up to them to go do. And I will take things that are final agreements.”

The question of how to pay for the unemployment benefits is the sticking point here. Republicans will only extend jobless benefits if the cost of doing so is offset somewhere else in the budget. Levin and Van Hollen are proposing to use savings found in the new Farm Bill being negotiated between the House and Senate and expected to come to a vote in January.

The problem is, that bill hasn’t passed yet, so the savings don’t technically exist for a vote today and Republicans have been dismissive of the proposal. Of course, that’s cold comfort to someone who has been unemployed for six months and is facing a new level of impoverished uncertainty in two weeks’ time.

“We have a specific proposal as to how to finance it,” Levin assured reporters, referring to the Farm Bill plan. “But the main point is that if the speaker doesn’t like this offset, he should work with us to find another one.”

“It’s pretty clear Republicans don’t want to extend unemployment benefits,” said Levin spokesman Josh Drobnyk.“If they did, they’d bring up a bill.”

With the House set to vote on the budget deal Thursday that now includes the doc fix provision, the clock is ticking to reach an agreement on unemployment insurance. Democrats seem to know that the budget is their last real point of leverage on the issue, and it won’t be long before it’s clear whether the budget is really in jeopardy.

“This is an immediate crisis for these families,” said Levin, who has led the charge to extend unemployment benefits. “So it has to be an immediate crisis for this institution.”","2013-12-12 12:01:16","1","42.0","4.0","7.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","84.0","48.0","0.0","195.0","6.0","24.0","23","1167","91.01","51.37","29.32","44.61","21.22","21.17","82.86","48.50","8.65","3.34","1.03","0.43","0.09","0.51","1.29","5.23","10.37","14.57","7.46","3.08","5.66","1.80","14.05","3.00","1.29","1.54","2.23","1.63","3.94","2.49","1.46","0.51","0.26","0.26","5.91","0.09","0.00","0.00","0.51","7.97","1.20","1.03","1.29","1.97","0.86","3.26","2.49","0.77","1.11","0.60","0.60","0.09","0.51","0.00","0.00","6.26","0.69","0.69","2.83","1.54","1.03","4.71","8.31","1.46","14.05","2.49","5.91","5.83","6.08","0.26","1.20","3.26","0.09","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.09","0.09","0.00","0.00","17.40","4.88","5.74","0.09","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.77","3.26","1.80","0.17","0.34","5436","7.34","24.729166666666668","1664","1157","60","68.81","11.5","8.5","11.26","11.4","201","4.0","16.669006050129646","487","21.81","15","0.47","0","38","25","142","0","133","64","2","0","11","183","104","13","54","0","0","47","6","54","0","0","8","48","0","53","58","28","28","27","38","9","7","0","5"
"http://www.newsweek.com/budget-passes-senate-dont-pop-champagne-yet-224797","Budget Passes the Senate, But Don’t Pop the Champagne Yet","Suddenly, peace has broken out in Washington DC. Perhaps it’s the time of the season.

On Wednesday, the Senate passed the bipartisan budget agreement on a 67-33 vote and sent it to President Obama’s desk to be signed into law.

For the first time in more than two years, both parties came together to pass a budget and prevent the government from continual crisis mode, lurching between shutdown and last-minute spending deals.

But don’t pop the champagne just yet. The deal may well be a bipartisan anomaly in what is sure to be a contentious and highly partisan new year.

Before the Senate even passed the deal, Republicans began warning that raising the debt limit in February could be a knock-down, drag-out brawl. Representative Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, warned on the Sunday talk shows that his party would not raise the debt limit without drawing significant concessions from Democrats.

“We as a caucus, along with our Senate counterparts, are going to meet and discuss what it is we want to get out of the debt limit,” Ryan said on Fox News Sunday. “We don't want nothing out of this debt limit. We're going to decide what it is we can accomplish out of this debt limit fight.”

Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, facing a tough reelection battle back home in Kentucky where Tea Party types are portraying him as a inveterate Washington insider, echoed Ryan this week. “I doubt if the House, or for that matter the Senate, is willing to give the president a clean debt-ceiling increase,"" he said Tuesday.

Next year is an election year and the debt ceiling battle lands smack in the middle of a number of key Republican primary battles, where current lawmakers will have to prove their conservative credentials if they are to hold on to office.

And what better way to show their mettle to their skeptical base than by adopting a tough stance in the impending debt ceiling battle?

“It’s not likely you’re going to see Republicans allowing it to be raised without more fiscal restraints put in place, to signal to Republican primary voters that they’re still serious about fiscal responsibility,” said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean.

“The fallout from Obamacare is still very strong. You have a debt ceiling fight in early February. It does not bode well for a feeling of kumbaya around getting a bipartisan budget deal done,” he said.

The Obamacare issue, that Republicans still see as a winning one in 2014, is another reason they may not want to put up too much of a debt ceiling fight. If the Republicans bring the United States to the edge of default, it will take attention away from what they see as their most popular issue, and remind voters that Republicans are reckless with the nation’s reputation.

To make matters worse next year, the debt ceiling isn’t the only place for potential partisan bickering. Even though the budget agreement set overall spending numbers, House and Senate appropriators must still do the nitty-gritty work of writing and passing legislation to divvy up and actually spend that money.

As everyone goes home for the holidays to bask in the bipartisan glow of the deal -- or face the wrath of those who believe compromise is a dirty word -- the staff of the appropriations committees will be hard at work. Any difficulties the appropriators run into could force Congress to pass another stopgap funding measure to prevent a government shutdown.

But right now appropriators are expressing confidence they can get the job done in a few short weeks.

“What we will be doing is implementing the Ryan-Murray budget agreement that they voted for. We will do the implementation of that,” House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, said on C-SPAN last week. “So, I would hope that those who voted for the Ryan budget will also now vote for the implementation of the Ryan budget.”

Rather than the beginning of a truce in Washington, the bipartisan budget seems far more like the calm before the storm.","2013-12-18 21:29:15","1","34.0","3.0","7.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","85.0","48.0","0.0","188.0","6.0","24.0","23","692","92.40","64.66","27.91","38.63","23.07","20.23","79.77","48.12","8.67","3.61","0.29","1.16","0.29","0.58","1.30","5.06","9.83","15.32","7.51","4.05","3.90","1.45","14.02","5.20","2.75","1.45","0.87","1.59","5.06","2.60","1.88","0.14","1.01","0.00","6.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.58","7.66","1.16","0.58","1.88","2.46","0.87","2.89","2.02","0.87","0.72","0.29","0.43","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.29","9.97","2.02","2.31","4.34","1.16","1.16","2.02","9.83","2.02","15.61","2.31","7.66","5.78","3.03","0.72","0.72","3.47","0.00","0.00","0.58","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.29","0.00","14.31","4.19","4.48","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","2.02","2.02","1.45","0.00","0.00","3229","7.63","25.071428571428573","1007","682","30","56.89","12.3","11.0","11.61","13.2","124","7.5","18.352727272727275","353","23.0","7","0.45","0","16","5","80","0","88","45","4","0","15","130","60","8","23","0","0","28","6","30","2","1","5","24","0","39","17","20","8","19","19","0","8","0","2"
"http://www.newsweek.com/budget-deal-lawmakers-hope-dodge-shutdown-20-224292","With Budget Deal, Lawmakers Hope to Dodge Shutdown 2.0","It’s a bipartisan Christmas miracle!

After six weeks of budget negotiations following the government shutdown in October, negotiators announced an agreement Tuesday evening on Capitol Hill.

Chief budget negotiators Senator Patty Murray, D-Washington, and Representative Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, put the final touches on a deal just days before the House of Representatives is scheduled to go home for the holidays.

The deal must now be approved in both houses of Congress. It has always been assumed that it would be tougher sell to the Republican-controlled House and the conservative Republican caucus. Ryan made the conservative case for the compromise, saying it lowers the deficit more than under the status quo, and predicting strong Republican support in the House.

“It reduces the deficit without raising taxes,” Ryan said at a press conference with Murray. “And it cuts spending in a smarter way. It’s a firm step in the right direction, and I ask all my colleagues in the House to support it.”

The deal sets the spending level for the rest of the current fiscal year, FY 2014, at $1.012 trillion – about the halfway point between the Senate topline number of $1.058 trillion and the House number of $967 billion. The deal offsets $63 billion in across-the-board sequester cuts over the next two years. The sequester offsets, which are split evenly between defense and non-defense spending, come from cuts elsewhere in the budget, and will actually reduce the deficit by $20 billion more than under the current budget framework

“For far too long, compromise has been considered a dirty word,” Murray said. He argued that returning to a stable budget process will help shore up the feeble economic recovery.

""Because of this deal, the budget process can stop lurching from crisis to crisis,"" Murray said.

It was never clear that the budget talks would come together, and negotiators kept the discussion close to the vest over the past few weeks as Murray and Ryan hashed out the final details of an agreement. Following years of budget fights and various fiscal cliffs scenarios, this is the closest Republicans and Democrats have come to passing a bipartisan budget.","2013-12-10 19:06:10","1","26.0","2.0","7.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","86.0","48.0","0.0","181.0","6.0","24.0","23","371","98.66","59.58","41.29","35.17","23.19","25.07","77.36","42.59","5.12","0.81","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","4.31","12.67","14.82","5.12","1.89","4.04","0.54","11.59","5.39","3.23","0.27","3.50","1.89","3.23","1.89","1.35","0.00","0.54","0.27","4.85","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.27","4.58","0.54","0.81","0.81","0.27","1.35","1.35","1.89","0.27","1.08","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.28","1.35","0.27","4.58","0.00","1.35","2.43","7.01","0.81","18.33","2.43","9.16","6.74","2.96","0.27","1.89","4.04","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.36","4.04","5.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.27","1.62","2.16","0.54","0.00","1.35","1801","8.35","25.0","545","366","18","59.33","11.6","10.0","12.47","12.9","86","8.416666666666666","19.51890710382514","210","22.47","4","0.43","0","13","15","52","0","50","25","4","1","6","64","34","3","22","0","0","11","1","12","0","0","2","7","0","9","11","9","9","4","10","1","0","0","0"
"http://www.newsweek.com/can-mayor-julian-castro-turn-texas-blue-62965","Can Mayor Julian Castro Turn Texas Blue?","Mayor Julián Castro is on his way to Austin. This wasn’t always part of the plan, or so I’m told. Castro was originally scheduled to spend the day in San Antonio, the sprawling South Texas metropolis over which he’s presided since 2009, so that he could smile and wave at a press conference for the city’s annual spring street fair.

But now he has other business to attend to. Statewide business. National business.

Last week Texas’s top three politicians—Republican Gov. Rick Perry, Republican Sen. John Cornyn, and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz—announced they’d be appearing together at the statehouse in Austin to explain (yet again) why accepting tens of millions of federal dollars to expand the state’s Medicaid program would be a terrible idea, and Lone Star Democrats were faced (yet again) with their usual problem. Texas hasn’t elected a single Democrat to statewide office since 1994; the last of the breed vanished from Austin four years later. The result, as Castro tells me somewhere between San Antonio and the capital, is that “for far too long, there has not been a voice of reason to provide an opposing idea about the direction the state should take on issues like this.” And that, apparently, is where Castro comes in.

In case you don’t remember, Castro is the guy—slight build, slick black hair, big, bashful grin—Barack Obama handpicked to deliver the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, the same venue that had propelled Obama into the political stratosphere eight years earlier. Castro was all over the news last summer. Stanford undergrad. Harvard Law. Elected to the San Antonio City Council at 26. Mayor at 34. “The Post-Hispanic Politician.” “The Latino Obama.” He came, he spoke—“of a generation born as the Cold War receded, shaped by the tragedy of 9/11, connected by the digital revolution”—and he conquered, becoming, for a few news cycles, at least, the Democratic Party’s great brown hope.

It didn’t take long for the national buzz to fade. It never does. But Castro didn’t disappear. He simply went back to Texas. His sights may not be set on the White House—not yet. But that doesn’t mean his sights aren’t set on anything else.

And so here he is, reclining in the back a large black American SUV, San Antonio receding in the rearview mirror. Castro’s communications director is perched in the passenger seat, tapping on his iPhone; a plainclothes policeman is at the wheel, tearing north on I-35—through Hill Country, toward Austin—at a speed that can’t possibly be legal. Castro and his twin brother, newly elected Texas Rep. Joaquín Castro, are racing to the capitol to deliver the Democratic counterpunch. “Joaquín and I both know that if we go to Austin, that’s raising the profile of an issue more than if two state representatives or two state senators make the same viewpoint known,” Castro tells me. “That’s why you’re not going to have an unresponded-to barking session by these Republican elected officials anymore. That’s gone. It’s over.”

As we pull into downtown Austin, I ask if Democrats will ever be able to compete in Texas again, and if so, what that will take, other than more press conferences.

“Candidates,” Castro says. “Candidates who excite people.”

Down in the Lone Star State, the notion that red Texas might someday become blue—or at the very least, purple—is no longer a crazy idea. And almost everyone I encountered cited the same three reasons.

The first is demographics. In Texas, Hispanics, African-Americans, and Asians already outnumber Anglos, yet in the last presidential election, Texas was the only majority-minority state in America that didn’t vote for Obama. In part that’s because Texas as a whole leans about 10 percent more Republican than Democratic. But the bigger issue is turnout. Even though Hispanics currently make up 38 percent of the population, they cast only 22 percent of the ballots in 2012.

As participation rates go, that’s pitiful. But the potential for Democrats, whom Hispanic voters tend to prefer by margins of 2–1 or more, is staggering. Research by Mark Jones, the chairman of the political-science department at Rice University in Houston, shows that if Texas Hispanics had voted in 2008 at the same level as their counterparts in California, John McCain’s margin of victory would have been slashed in half, from 12 percentage points to 6. What’s more, it’s clear that all this pent-up potential will only increase in the years ahead. Between 2000 and 2010, Hispanics accounted for 65 percent of Texas’s population growth, a rate that shows no signs of slowing. In fact, by 2030 Hispanics will make up a larger share of the electorate (43 percent) than Anglos (39 percent).

Which brings us to the second reason Lone Star liberals are sounding more hopeful these days: the arrival, in January, of Battleground Texas, an outfit designed to help Democrats capitalize on the state’s tantalizing demographic trends. For more than a decade, left-leaning operatives and analysts have talked of tapping into Texas’s vast, dormant Hispanic electorate, but no one has had the money, technology, or organizational oomph to actually pull it off.

The people behind Battleground Texas believe they can, and there is reason to believe them: they are, after all, the same people who got Barack Obama elected twice. Jeremy Bird, who’s advising the group from Chicago, directed Obama’s national field operation in 2012; Jenn Brown, who’s running the show in Austin, was in charge of Ohio last November. The rest of the Battleground Texas staff is drawn from other pivotal 2012 locales—Colorado, Virginia, Florida—and top Democratic donor Steve Mostyn has already pledged to round up $10 million in initial funding. The goal, says Bird, is to make Texas a battleground state by treating it like one. “Part of the reason we won Florida by 50,000 votes in 2012 is that we had organizers on the ground for six years who were running a 21st-century grassroots campaign with data, with digital, with smart analytics, with field,” he tells Newsweek. “We need that kind of long-term vision in Texas.”

Finally, there’s Julián Castro himself.

Spend some time with the mayor, and the main thing you notice is that he is openly, guilelessly ambitious. It was Castro, for example, who first brought up his alleged gubernatorial ambitions during our two days together—not me. “I’m not going to run for governor in 2014,” Castro confessed, unprompted. And yet that decision, he continued, was not without its downsides. “The bad part is that the state needs to change,” he explained. “And 2014 is going to go by, and it may well be that there’s no significant candidate on the Democratic side to start changing it.” But then Castro was quick to remind me, lest I get the wrong idea, that he wasn’t ruling out anything beyond 2014—far from it. “If I do a good job, when my term is up [in 2017], I’ll look around and see what’s possible,” he added. “So yeah, it may be that one day I run for statewide office. People shouldn’t be surprised if I do that eventually.” When I asked whether he was initially uncomfortable campaigning for public office, Castro hinted at even grander aspirations. “It’s not like I was running for president of the United States first,” he said. In short: the mayor’s current campaign—he’s up for reelection in May—probably won’t be his last.

So far, much like Obama in the early stages of his own ascent, Castro has attracted a lot of attention and acclaim because of who he is (a handsome, well-educated, charismatic, young politician with a compelling backstory and post-partisan, post-ethnic vibe) and what he represents (America’s rapidly diversifying electorate). But to begin to fulfill his promise, all Obama had to do was defeat crazy, conservative Alan Keyes in liberal Illinois. Castro, in contrast, has to accomplish something 102 consecutive Democratic candidates before him have failed to accomplish: win statewide in Texas.

One of Castro’s earliest memories is of handing out leaflets for a local school-board candidate in the late 1970s. He was 4 years old. It was a full-immersion childhood: his mother, Rosie Castro, was an activist in the Chicano movement; she met Julián’s father, Jesse Guzman, through La Raza Unida (the two never married). Still, Castro never wanted to go into politics himself.

“I didn’t like it,” he says. “I didn’t see it as much fun as a young person, or as something you could make progress with. And I didn’t want to be poor, either.”

When Castro entered Stanford, his plan was to go into broadcast journalism. (You can still see it, actually: polished and poised, he carries himself like a local news anchor.) But a pre-internship tour of a San Antonio newsroom ended that particular dream—at 19, he was too “idealistic,” he says, to hype “fires and crime” for a living—and Castro accepted a summer job in the Clinton White House instead.

That’s when Castro realized he couldn’t resist the pull of politics. It was 1994, the year of Newt Gingrich’s “Contract With America,” and before long, Castro was back at Stanford, running for student council alongside Joaquín. (They tied for first.) “At Stanford I saw a community that was much better educated, had a much higher income, and was more innovative,” he says. “At the same time, in San Antonio, I saw a city with a much stronger sense of community. I wanted more people from my city to be able to have the kind of opportunity that I had.” Castro held his first political fundraiser while still a student at Harvard Law—his classmates ponied up $2,000—and was elected to the San Antonio City Council less than a year after returning home from Cambridge.

Castro’s first run for mayor, in 2005, was unsuccessful: after a few amateurish mistakes—a shoddy contributions report, an ethics reprimand, a Parent Trap incident in which Joaquín was accused of standing in for Julián at a local event—he lost by 3,820 ballots. But four years later Castro won without a runoff, and in 2011 he was reelected with 83 percent of the vote. The mayor of San Antonio is not nearly as powerful, by law, as the mayor of, say, New York, but since taking office, Castro has maximized his impact by mastering the bully pulpit and redirecting city resources toward reform. One of his first moves was to clean up the local utility, which he quickly learned had been underreporting the potential cost of an upcoming nuclear project by $2 billion; he sacked the CEO and steered the city toward natural gas instead. In the fall of 2010, after collecting community input for six months, Castro unveiled a sweeping, progressive initiative designed to “transform San Antonio into a world-class city by the year 2020”: less driving, more public transportation; less pollution, more green jobs; less sprawl, more growth downtown; and a stronger public education system, above all else.

The rest of Castro’s tenure has centered on implementing the “SA2020” vision: a Democratic wish list geared toward helping San Antonio’s lower-income (and predominately Hispanic) population prepare for a more urban, techno-savvy future. In 2010 the city launched Cafe College, a one-stop shop for advice on the application and financial-aid process. Developers were soon proposing new residential projects downtown, and city planners were drawing up streetcar blueprints. Last May, at a time of statewide, Tea Party–inspired austerity, Castro persuaded voters to fund SA2020 with a $596 million bond issue—the largest in San Antonio’s history. His most impressive feat, however, came the following November, when San Antonio residents agreed to raise their own sales tax by an eighth of a cent to finance PreK 4 SA, a program Castro created in consultation with local business leaders that will train a new class of high-quality public-school teachers and provide early-childhood education to more than 4,000 4-year-olds. (Of the four largest cities in Texas, San Antonio schools currently perform the worst overall, according to the nonprofit Children at Risk.) “After the legislature slashed more than $200 million from full-day prekindergarten in 2011, Castro got San Antonio voters to approve a tax increase—no easy task in Texas—to make sure the youngest kiddos weren’t losing out,” says Emily Ramshaw, an editor at The Texas Tribune. “It may not be the sexiest topic, but it has real-world implications.”

On the drive up to Austin, I asked Castro to imagine that it’s 2017 and his mayoralty is over. What do you want to be able to say you’ve accomplished? He considered the question for a second or two, then started to speak in measured, emotional tones, his right hand curled into the Clintonesque remote-control position, chopping at the air for emphasis. “I want to be able to pick up a list of names of graduates from high schools and colleges in the city, and to see that that list is longer than it was when I started in 2009,” Castro said. “If we can get that right, then San Antonio is on an inevitable trajectory toward becoming one of the great cities in the United States, because it has everything else going for it: the demography, the low cost of doing business, the fact that in the near future the continent will be moving along a north-south axis with the growth of Latin America.”

Whether Castro can propel himself into the governor’s mansion at that point remains to be seen. “He’ll certainly have enough of a record to run,” says Jim Henson, who directs the Texas Politics project at the University of Texas in Austin. “We’ve seen people run for statewide office with less. Ted Cruz, for example—he had no experience as an elected official. That said, while being mayor of a big city in Texas is a decent foundation, it’s probably not sufficient on its own.”

For Castro, the likeliest barrier won’t be the length of his résumé, but rather its progressive content. Can a liberal Latino cross over and compete with Texas’s broader, conservative-leaning electorate? Castro believes he can. He is convinced, for starters, that the Texas GOP has left the political center up for grabs. “Republicans are so far out to the right, it’s pushing people into the Democratic Party,” he tells me en route to Austin. “Medicaid expansion is a good example. It’s the chamber of commerce, the Democrats, and even some Republicans on one side, and Perry, Cornyn, and Cruz on the other. These people are losing the business community. They’re losing the middle. And it’s happening right in front of their eyes.

“The advantage that Democrats have is that they’re a big-tent party,” Castro continues. “There’s no litmus test to being a Democrat here. Right now, in Texas, you could be pro-life or pro-choice. You can be pro–education reform or traditionalist on education. Republicans have already given up so much of the field. When you add in resources, demography, and strong candidates, it will catch up with them.”

Castro also thinks that generational and demographic shifts are about to make the Lone Star State less anti-government—less “Don’t mess with Texas”—than ever before. The day after the Medicaid presser, Castro is scheduled to return to Austin for an event with Joaquín at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library, followed by a dinner with members of the Johnson family in LBJ’s private suite. I ask if the current crop of Texas Democrats can learn any lessons from Johnson. “First, just a reminder that it’s possible,” Castro says. “For all of those years Texas was Democratic. There was a very significant constituency in Texas that appreciated the kinds of investments that LBJ spearheaded: in education, in housing, in social services. And now it’s a new day. When you tell this generation that all government is wasteful and that programs won’t make any difference, it doesn’t have the same resonance that it had a generation ago.”

Meanwhile, the rapid growth of Texas’s Hispanic population will only accelerate the shift away from Tea Party conservatism, according to Castro. “It’s fair to say that on hot-button topics like immigration, Texas Republicans have held their punches,” he says. “They know.” The problem, he argues, is that the GOP has ignored the less symbolic issues that affect all Texans but tend to hurt Hispanics the most. “They’re pushing some of the worst policies in the nation,” Castro insists. “They’re underfunding schools that are now 50.3 percent Hispanic. They’re attracting low-wage jobs as opposed to high-wage jobs, which creates an invisible ceiling for a lot of folks. They’re not funding Medicaid, and they’re underfunding social services in general. The Republican Party is generally not doing much for the growing young Hispanic community that exists in Texas, and eventually, that will cost them.”

But only if the Hispanic community actually turns out to vote. On a gray, drizzly Wednesday evening, I decide to drive up to Killeen, 70 miles north of Austin, to see Battleground Texas in action. A majority of Killeen residents are black or Latino, yet the city leans Republican, largely because it’s home to the conservative military voters of Fort Hood. The gap between Killeen’s demographics and its politics makes it a prime target area for Battleground Texas’s organizers, but tonight, it’s clear the effort is still in its infancy.

Clad in a crisp blue dress shirt, his goatee carefully trimmed, Alex Steele—formerly an Obama operative in Iowa and Colorado, now field director for Battleground Texas—stands in front of 50 locals, most of them senior citizens, in room 101 of the Killeen Community Center and explains how they can turn Texas blue. “To anybody who says we can’t do this,” he announces, “we say, ‘Game on.’” Steele’s plan is straight out of the Obama playbook: harness technology and social-networking strategies to exponentially enhance the impact of traditional voter outreach. Rather than getting 250 paid organizers to make 50 contacts each and ultimately reach 12,500 voters, Steele explains, we want 250 field organizers to oversee five teams of volunteer neighborhood leaders who will use their own Facebook, Twitter, and email accounts to reach 500,000 voters.

The attendees nod, fill out forms, circle up for “breakout sessions,” and pass around slices of blue and white “Game On” sheet cake. But ultimately, they seem a bit bewildered. Then again, the first volunteers to show up at the Randall, Iowa, community center back in early 2007 probably felt bewildered too.

When Castro’s name is mentioned, everyone in Austin, whether a supporter or an opponent, says the same thing: it’s not a matter of if but when.

Castro himself seems to agree. At one point, I asked what Obama’s experience on the national stage had taught him. I was surprised, for some reason, by his reply. I suppose I was expecting a homily about governance. But Castro’s answer was all about campaigning. “The importance of timing,” he said. “Obama got elected at exactly the right time, when the pendulum had swung so far in one direction, with a conservative president. And it was swinging in the other direction, to a young, fresh-faced, energetic Democratic elected official. Often the biggest changes come about at the right time.”

Publicly Castro insists that the “right time” is at least “six to eight years” off—when he believes efforts like Battleground Texas will start to bear fruit, and when (not coincidentally) term limits will mean that his time in San Antonio is up. But even so, some people are convinced the mayor is privately considering an earlier bid for statewide office. One of them is Manuel Medina, the chairman of the Bexar County Democratic Party, who last year launched his own “draft Castro” campaign. “I think he’s focused on his reelection right now,” says Medina (who adds that he has no inside information). “But we need a candidate, and I believe Mayor Castro is going to step up in 2014.”

As we weave through Austin in the black SUV, Castro’s comment about “candidates who excite people” is still hanging in the air. I decide to pose the obvious follow-up.

Like whom? I ask.

Castro pauses for a moment. When he starts to speak again, his voice is noticeably softer, his pace slower. “I believe that if Henry Cisneros had run for governor in 1990,” he says, “that would have changed the landscape of politics in Texas.”

Henry Cisneros, it’s worth noting, was a city councilman in San Antonio at 27. Mayor at 33. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development at 45. Widely touted as a leading candidate for governor, or senator, or maybe even president, until an infidelity scandal derailed him in the 1990s. A prodigiously talented, pioneering Hispanic politician. In other words: Julián Castro before Julián Castro was Julián Castro.

The current mayor of San Antonio cracks a knuckle and glances out the window, then continues. “That would have been the first time a mainline, very popular Hispanic Democrat would have run for one of the top three statewide seats,” Castro says. “If Henry had run, I think that would have galvanized Hispanics in Texas. It would have created a voting habit in the community.”

Just then, I glimpse a massive domed building on the right side of the road.

“The state capitol,” says Castro’s communications director.

Castro cuts in. “And that’s the governor’s mansion,” he says, pointing to a white Greek Revival residence across the street. His phone is buzzing; he picks it up.

“We’re almost there,” he says.

"http://www.newsweek.com/can-myth-fetal-pain-topple-roe-v-wade-3077","Can the Myth of Fetal Pain Topple Roe v. Wade?","When South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham introduced legislation last week to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, he insisted it was a sincere expression of his beliefs, and not a cynical response to the three primary challengers questioning his commitment to conservative values.

Even though Graham’s bill has little chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate, many in the GOP see it as a brilliant political move. (The premise of the bill is that a fetus feels pain at 20 weeks – a scientifically unproven assertion – so abortion should be banned four weeks earlier than the hard line of fetal viability drawn by Roe v. Wade.) Republicans think Graham’s bill is a big win for their conservative, Christian base that doesn’t scare the political center; anti-abortion folks see it as an incremental step toward an outright ban; and the more moderate crowd is susceptible to the emotional appeal of protecting a 5-month-old fetus, even if they support Roe v. Wade.

Graham didn’t invent the 20-week strategy. He is just the latest (and biggest) name to sign on to such legislation, which many state legislatures have passed since 2010. A similar ban was passed by the House of Representatives in June of this year, but its prospects for passage in the Senate are slim. No matter, Republicans see it as a winning strategy.

“I think there’s significant support across the country for the idea that after 20 weeks, abortion should be significantly limited,” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told the New York Times this summer, when he was considering introducing a 20-week ban. He is one of many co-sponsors on Graham’s bill. It is no coincidence that both Graham and Rubio are feeling pressure from the conservative wing of their party.

When Republicans took control of 26 state legislatures in 2010, they began passing many bills to restrict access to abortion, from draconian regulations for clinics to the hotly-debated bills requiring women to undergo invasive vaginal ultrasounds. While most of those laws are within –sometimes just barely – Supreme Court precedent on acceptable regulation of abortion, fetal pain laws are in direct violation of Roe v. Wade because they ban abortion before the fetus is viable. A dozen states passed such bans.

Fetal pain legislation originated with the anti-abortion group National Right to Life, which wrote draft legislation it then handed to conservative state legislatures. One after another, Republican-controlled states began passing versions of the law, women’s health groups started fighting it, and the courts began to take on the issue. After the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Arizona’s fetal pain law earlier this year, the state petitioned the Supreme Court to uphold it. The high court has yet to decide whether it will hear the case, but pro-choice advocates believe it will decline. The ultimate goal of pro-life advocates is to get the Supreme Court to rule on the fetal pain issue, because they hope conservative justices will use fetal pain to amend or overturn Roe.

“It really makes sense to look at [fetal pain laws] as part of the overall onslaught on the right,” said Julie Rikelman, litigation director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is involved in the Arizona case. “The groups that support these laws, that draft the model legislation that they’re based on, the politicians that propose them--they are all united in their goals to make abortion illegal in the United States.”

While the public is largely split on the issue of abortion, pro-life politicians and advocates believe they hold the moral high ground when it comes to abortions later in a pregnancy. But Planned Parenthood has polling to suggest that voters will take their side when they hear the stories of women who are seeking abortions at this later stage. Only 1.5 percent of abortions are performed after 21 weeks, according to the nonpartisan Guttmacher Institute, and often women who elect to have these later abortions do so because of severe fetal abnormalities, which doctors often detect at around the 20-week mark. This is where pro-choice groups think they can win over voters: the woman who wanted to have a child only to learn that her fetus was developing in such a way that is ultimately incompatible with life.

According to Planned Parenthood’s August poll, the public is on their side. It showed that a solid majority of voters believe abortion should be legal after 20 weeks when the mother’s health was at risk, when the family’s circumstances called for ending the pregnancy or when there were severe fetal abnormalities.

When Graham announced his bill, NARAL Pro-Choice America released a one-minute ad on national cable featuring a woman named Dana, who decided to have an abortion after 20 weeks when she realized the fetus had severe abnormalities. “As a mother, I didn’t want to bring this child into the world only for her to exist in immense pain,” Dana says in the ad. “Being able to come to a decision that was right for us is really what’s important here. And that’s not for a legislator to decide.”

Pro-choice advocates believe that Dana and stories like hers will trump the 20-Week gambit. “Once you start talking to people about the consequences of these [laws], they change their position very, very quickly,” says Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, who conducted the poll on 20-week abortion bans for Planned Parenthood over the summer. “You put them in a commercial, and the election’s over.”","2013-11-11 15:53:20","1","28.0","7.0","7.0","1.0","14.0","5.0","85.0","48.0","0.0","182.0","6.0","24.0","23","937","91.26","72.84","29.81","24.08","24.66","21.99","76.73","44.61","8.96","3.52","0.21","0.11","0.21","1.17","1.81","5.44","8.75","14.19","6.08","4.16","4.48","0.75","12.49","4.48","2.77","2.35","2.45","1.81","3.74","1.81","1.92","0.32","0.32","0.00","8.43","0.96","0.00","1.28","0.75","7.90","2.67","1.60","1.07","1.28","0.21","1.71","2.35","0.53","0.53","1.17","4.06","0.11","3.84","2.24","0.11","6.94","0.96","1.39","4.06","1.07","0.32","3.09","8.00","0.85","15.47","1.39","7.04","7.15","2.88","0.21","0.11","0.75","0.32","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.58","4.16","4.59","0.11","0.21","0.00","0.00","2.45","1.49","1.71","0.43","0.43","4474","8.38","28.90909090909091","1389","918","37","54.76","13.0","11.8","12.36","14.8","204","17.333333333333332","20.80888888888889","440","26.15","7","0.44","0","16","23","95","3","116","74","2","3","9","158","76","6","65","1","0","35","12","31","2","0","2","34","0","32","35","18","14","38","24","10","6","0","11"

United Continental Airlines CFO John Rainey speaks during the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington September 5, 2013. REUTERS/Gary Cameron

United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) plans to pay off $800 million in debt next year, which will strengthen the balance sheet enough to allow it to return cash to shareholders, CFO John Rainey said at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit.

Rainey also said he thinks the airline industry is strong enough to weather disruptions that a possible U.S. war in Syria could bring.

“A lot of carriers are beginning to return cash to shareholders. Every carrier is headed down that path,” he said at the summit, held at the Reuters office in Washington, D.C.

“Clearly, we have an intention of doing that.”

The $800 million debt was used for liquidity, rather than financing aircraft, and is not something the airline wants to carry on its books.

“Once we pay that off, our balance sheet has a very different look than it did three or four years ago, and I think then we can have a much more rational discussion about the best way to increase shareholder value,” Rainey said.

“It’s my full intention to pay that off next year.”

Rainey also said that while he was worried about the potential effects of a U.S. strike on Syria in terms of jet fuel prices and the airline industry, carriers were on a much more stable footing than previously.

“Six or seven years ago, people would be talking about, ‘Can the industry survive this?’” He added that airline industry liquidity could weather the effects of a possible war.

Regarding the Syria situation, he said United is not fully hedged against a rise in jet fuel prices.

“I am concerned,” he said. “Clearly, as jet fuel prices go up, we’re not 100 percent protected from that, and it will have some impact.”

He added, however: “We’ve reformed ourselves as a business and we’ve actually taken steps to mute the impact of these type of exogenous events.”

Separately on Thursday, United said it would recall 600 pilots who had been furloughed in previous years.

The Air Line Pilots Association union said the carrier started laying off pilots in September 2008, leading to a total of 1,437 pilots furloughed. United now has more than 12,000 pilots.

United said a labor agreement reached on Wednesday allowed the airline to recall the workers.

Officials at the Pentagon and top U.S. defense companies told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit this week that they are cutting travel by double-digit percentages to deal with the latest round of automatic spending cuts caused by sequestration. The reductions could create a replay of cuts in the spring that reduced airline revenue when sequestration first hit U.S. government spending.

“I get a list of the top 10 violators” of travel spending, said Dale Bennett, executive vice president for Lockheed Mission Systems and Training. Emphasizing the attention paid to travel, he said he now carries this list along with monthly travel reports in his briefcase.

His division, with 18,000 staff, is cutting travel 10 percent to 15 percent compared with last year. His unit oversees the company’s execution of programs for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Army, Coast Guard and Marine Corps.

He and others are using more teleconferences to stay in touch with customers. Frank Kendall, the Pentagon’s top arms buyer, said his department has cut back on travel “a lot” as part of 20 percent reductions in headquarters budgets.

Travel cuts do little to close the large Pentagon budget gap, Kendall said, but they are weighed against staffing cuts.

“When we furloughed people ... we all took a hard look at what we were doing,” he said. “Do I want to take this trip or do I want to have somebody work for another day?”

GOVERNMENT EFFECT

Overall corporate travel appears to be recovering with the economy. And defense officials and executives said they still must make trips to work with companies and governments around the world. Many international deals depend on handshakes and personal contacts.

Linda Hudson, outgoing chief executive of the U.S. unit of Britain’s BAE Systems, said employees must still make trips.

“And if we put people on long overseas flights, we’re going to put them in a cabin where they can be comfortable and work,” she said.

But weapons makers and suppliers like Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), BAE Systems (BAES.L), Boeing (BA.N) and EADS North America EAD.PA told the Reuters Summit they are reducing travel in an effort to contain costs as sequestration casts uncertainty over the weapons industry. Some are even asking their clients to put caps on travel expenses.

The unanimous caution by defense industry officials and executives at the Reuters Summit suggests continued weakness in government spending, which accounts for 3 percent to 4 percent of airline revenue. Many companies told this Summit, held in Reuters’ Washington office, that 2014 could be worse, with more cuts to come as sequestration continues.

The automatic budget cuts known as sequestration took effect on March 1 and defense spending has taken the single biggest hit from the cutbacks, with a $46 billion reduction through the September 30 end of the fiscal year.

Janus Research analyst Kristopher Kelley said he did not expect the budget cuts to be “a big deal” for airlines. But after sequestration reductions took effect US Airways Group LCC.N and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said the cuts reduced revenue from government customers in the first half.

Unit revenue, a measure of pricing power and how full planes are, fell in April as U.S. carriers also grappled with sequestration-related furloughs of air traffic controllers. Delta and US Airways reported drops of 2 percent and 4 percent, respectively, for April.

For hotels, business travel and leisure travel have mostly recovered but one area that is still lagging is group meetings and conventions, said Patrick Scholes, a hotel analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.

Kelley said he now expects government cuts to affect airlines this fall, despite a “decent summer” season.

David Fitzpatrick, managing partner at AlixPartners, an aviation consulting firm, said that if travel falls, airlines are likely to respond by cutting capacity, so that they can keep planes full and profitable.

Hudson of BAE Systems said customers were very creative in 2013 in tapping into resources they had available. “In 2014 most of that’s going to be gone,” making companies look harder for ways to cut expenses.

For airlines and hotels, the dire outlook could foreshadow future hurt as travel goes into its autumn slump. Airlines have already seen a sequestration-related hit earlier this year, when a fall-off in government demand hurt travel revenues.

US Airways, which has a dominant share of takeoff and landing slots at Washington’s Reagan National airport, said U.S. spending cuts reduced revenue from government customers by 30 percent in March. Delta joined in, saying reduced last-minute bookings by government workers cut its unit revenue in March.

‘ATTACKING TRAVEL’

In July, Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said traffic from government spending was “down dramatically.”

“I think we all know that sequestration is real,” the CEO said on a call with analysts.

Hudson said BAE Systems’s U.S. unit was “attacking travel in particular” by negotiating price discounts with airlines and urging more teleconferencing. The unit pared travel spending by 11.9 percent in 2012. Through July 2013, such expenses are down about 20 percent from a year earlier, she said.

At EADS North America, Chief Executive Sean O’Keefe, a former NASA administrator, said that although travel spending at his company was down “easily in the range of 15 to 20 percent” this year, it was not the main focus when it came to cost cuts.

O’Keefe said his company was paying more attention to items such as hiring when it came to cutting costs.

Boeing is also putting a key focus on travel costs, said Dennis Muilenburg, president and chief executive officer of Boeing Defense, Space & Security. He added that “in some cases, travel, spending time with our global supply chain, spending time with our global customers, is an investment in the future.”

“The small companies don’t have the same access to capital, they don’t have the strong internal financials,” Marion Blakey, president of the Aerospace Industries Association trade group told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit on Thursday.

“We’ve had a couple say that they are going out of business,” she told the summit.

Linda Hudson, chief executive of the U.S. unit of Britain’s BAE Systems (BAES.L), said her company is keeping closer tabs on its suppliers than ever before, and has already stepped in to acquire one company to ensure an uninterrupted supply of cathode ray tubes for its electronics sector.

“We are monitoring our suppliers in a way we have never monitored our suppliers,” Hudson told the Reuters summit, noting that her company was willing to invest in certain cases to “make sure a critical hole doesn’t develop in our supply chain.”

In June, BAE spent 1 million pounds to buy certain assets from Brimar Ltd, a Manchester, UK-based firm that entered bankruptcy proceedings in Britain in November of 2012.

U.S. industry executives and government officials have been warning for over a year that cutting $500 billion from U.S. defense spending over the next decade - on top of $487 billion in reductions already planned - would hit smaller players in the defense industry particularly hard.

Frank Kendall, the Pentagon’s chief arms buyer, said the Defense Department had compiled a large, detailed database identifying suppliers by sector and tier that was helping track problems, especially among companies that produced critical technologies that needed to be preserved.

He said the Pentagon had a small amount of funding - just tens of millions of dollars - to intervene in specific cases, and was also careful to assess the fallout of its budget decisions on smaller firms.

“There are two or three separate accounts that we can draw from that give us some opportunity to protect people that we think are critical to us,” Kendall told the summit.

Blakey said 88 percent of smaller suppliers surveyed earlier this year were feeling the effects of U.S. budget cuts.

Scott Thompson, who heads the aerospace and defense practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said uncertainty about U.S. military spending was taking a toll on the overall sector, and had stalled merger and acquisition activity for about two years.

He said there had been about $4.5 billion in deals in the global defense sector in the first six months of 2013, excluding the merger of two Chinese companies, which was about 50 percent below the rolling 10-year average.

Thompson said a slowdown in contracts was already putting pressure on smaller companies that had narrower margins, many of whom were sole source suppliers for bigger programs.

He said he expected more vertical integration in the lower tiers of the sector in coming years, with small and medium-sized firms acquiring even small “mom and pop” companies affected by declining volumes.

Executives at Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N) echoed those concerns at the summit, saying there were keeping a close eye on their key suppliers, and had already helped some firms facing cash flow issues.

“We have a robust process to evaluate the health of our supply chain,” said Dale Bennett, who heads Lockheed’s Mission Systems and Training business, adding that his firm stood ready to buy a company’s technology, inject cash or even acquire firms to safeguard the health of suppliers of key components.

Dennis Muilenburg, chief executive of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, said his company preferred to help suppliers with capital injections or even management help, rather than outright acquiring companies that were in trouble.

“Acquisitions for the sake of supply chain health is not something we try and do,” he said.

Under Secretary of Defense Frank Kendall told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit on Wednesday that he hoped to secure small amounts of funding for work on some leap-ahead technologies in those areas despite the challenging budget environment, although no firm decisions had been made.

Kendall said he was just starting to think about technology investments “that significantly changed the game in ground combat.” He said U.S. Army acquisition chief Heidi Shyu was interested even though he had not discussed the idea formally with U.S. Army leaders, whose budgets were “extremely tight.”

“Squeezing anything like this from the Army’s budget is going to be very hard. But I would like to see us at some point do something that made a significant improvement in ground combat capability,” he said.

Kendall and other top Pentagon leaders have repeatedly urged lawmakers to reverse $500 billion in mandatory cuts facing the U.S. defense budget over the next decade, arguing that the depth and timing of the cuts could erode military readiness and damage efforts to modernize the U.S. military.

Kendall said the cuts, which come on top of $487 billion in cuts already planned for the same period, would hit procurement and research and development (R&D) particularly hard, since it was harder to whittle down personnel costs in the short term.

But he said he was trying to safeguard R&D spending to ensure that other countries did not overtake the U.S. military with their weapons technologies.

“Our technological superiority is being challenged,” Kendall told the summit. “We can’t be complacent about that.”

Kendall first discussed the possible rotorcraft project last December, but revealed his idea for a leap-ahead ground vehicle program at the Reuters summit for the first time.

Companies that build ground vehicles, like General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and BAE Systems (BAES.L), have argued that the Pentagon needs to invest in future technologies to ensure the continued viability of that sector of the industrial base.

He said such R&D programs generally began with small study contracts valued at millions of dollars, but could eventually build to larger acquisition programs worth hundreds of millions.

He said the ground vehicle studies could look at propulsion, lethality and ways to protect troops, noting that early work on these concepts under the Army’s Future Combat Systems program had largely stopped when that program was cancelled in 2009.

Kendall told the ComDef industry conference earlier Wednesday that he had already taken steps to kick off a separate program funding early work on a successor to the F-35 fighter, now being developed and built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), that would ensure continued U.S. air dominance.

That program would fund studies for several years, followed by possible development of a prototype, he told reporters after a speech in which he warned that other countries would soon overtake the United States in development of certain weapons.

Companies like Boeing Co (BA.N); Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc (TXT.N); Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N); Europe’s EADS EAD.PA; and AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy’s Finmeccanica SIFI.MI, have been pressing U.S. defense officials to at least fund some design work on new rotorcraft programs.

Defense consultant Loren Thompson with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute said maintaining spending on research and development of new weapons was crucial to ensuring that the military was adequately equipped in later years.

“Unless spending on military aircraft is maintained, the supplier base will wither and the skills needed for development of the next generation of planes will disappear,” Thompson said.

Kendall said the Pentagon had undertaken similar efforts to continue funding work on new weapons during previous downturns.

For instance, funding for the F-15, F-16 and F/A-18 fighter programs began during the 1970s despite a decline in military spending, and then rose in the 1980s as spending rebounded.

Results were mixed with programs begun during the 1990s downturn: the Lockheed F-22 fighter survived but the Sea Wolf submarine saw only very limited production.

For several years, Frank Kendall has sought to streamline the often arcane Pentagon procurement process, but he said nearly $1 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade have undermined some of those efforts.

The Pentagon has put most new acquisition programs on hold, with officials thinking about cutting back orders for everything from new coastal warships built by Lockheed Martin and Australia’s Austal (ASB.AX), to helicopters built by Europe’s EADS EAD.PA.

Those programs will be “few and far between” if mandatory budget cuts remain on the books, Kendall told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit.

Industry executives, under pressure from their corporate boards to pare costs and maintain profits, say they have repeatedly invested tens of millions of dollars in development efforts only to have acquisition programs canceled or delayed.

They laud the increased dialogue with top Pentagon officials like Kendall and Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, but say the lack of clarity about future military budgets makes it hard for them to map out investment and hiring plans.

Kendall, a former executive with Raytheon Co (RTN.N), said he did not favor asking firms to share in the cost of new programs before they were approved, and had made that point to the military services’ acquisition chiefs.

“I want industry to have a clear understanding on the real prospects for future business so they can make a smart decision about their investments,” Kendall told the Reuters Summit.

He said uncertainty about budget levels was making it difficult for the services to stick to their acquisition plans.

The Army, for instance, was considering a third attempt to replace its Vietnam-era OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopters, a program valued at several billion dollars, but has deferred that effort due to budget pressures, Kendall said.

Executives at EADS EAD.PA; Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies (UTX.N); Boeing; and AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy’s Finmeccanica SpA SIFI.MI, among others, had hoped to bid for those orders.

Army officials last week issued a request for information about the Armed Aerial Scout program that revived industry hopes the program would proceed, but Kendall said the Army’s budget was tight and he believed the program would likely be deferred.

“If we stay in a sequestered environment, I think new starts like that are going to be few and far between for the next few years,” Kendall said.

COMPANIES CURTAIL INVESTMENT AMID UNCERTAINTY

Sean O’Keefe, a former Pentagon comptroller and Navy secretary who now heads the U.S. unit of EADS, told the summit it was difficult for industry to navigate the current budget climate, despite efforts by Kendall and other top Pentagon officials to streamline acquisition procedures.

Contract awards had slowed sharply, and the company had already opted to skip some competitions rather than invest in preparing a bid for a contract that might not ever materialize, he said. EADS invested heavily to develop a variant of its light utility helicopter for the Army helicopter competition, but was uncertain if that competition would proceed, he said.

The company was also still waiting for a contract award from the Department of Homeland Security after submitting a bid in the spring of 2012, he said.

He said the Army’s initial framework compared the cost of a new helicopter to the cost of upgrading the old ones. “Today, the definition is, can you afford anything at all?” he said.

Dale Bennett, who heads Lockheed’s Mission Systems and Training division, told the summit that changes in the projected procurement amounts would alter the business case for a project.

The Navy, for instance, is considering sharp cutbacks in its plan to buy 52 new Littoral Combat Ships to meet tough budget cut targets, but that could drive future ship prices higher.

Kendall said the current uncertainty made it difficult for companies to invest in technology that could lower manufacturing costs.

Both Lockheed and Austal invested heavily to drive down the cost of the new warships, with an eye to future profits, Kendall said. “Right now if I were in industry I would be hesitant to make major investments until I saw what was going to happen to the budgets and the product lines that I was interested in.”

Frank Kendall, U.S. undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, said the cuts would fall disproportionately on the Pentagon’s procurement and research and development accounts, since it was difficult to harvest savings from personnel accounts on short order.

He told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit that an “awful lot of smaller programs” faced delays, cuts and even cancellation if the cuts stayed in effect, while fewer of the big-ticket weapons programs would be affected.

He underscored the Pentagon’s support for its biggest weapons program, the $392 billion Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, calling it the military’s highest priority conventional warfare program.

The Pentagon must cut its base budget by $500 billion over the next decade from planned spending levels under the process called “sequestration” — cuts that come on top of $487 billion in reductions already planned. Military leaders have urged Congress to reverse the cuts, but lawmakers have failed to reach agreement on alternative ways to reduce the federal deficit.

Kendall said he had experienced previous downturns in defense spending, but the current gridlock in Congress was unprecedented, and the resulting uncertainty was wreaking havoc on the ability of the military and industry to do any planning.

He declined comment on the possibility of U.S. strikes on Syria, but said the budget cuts would limit the military’s ability to respond to natural disasters like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti or the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

“As we design our budgets to be tighter and tighter because of sequestration, we’ve given up our ability to absorb that type of thing,” he said.

He said big contractors like Lockheed, Boeing Co (BA.N) and General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) would weather the downturn, but he worried about smaller suppliers which are finding it difficult to secure capital for investments in the current market.

The Pentagon is keeping a close eye on the health of such smaller firms and has small pots of money available to help them with cash or programs under certain conditions, he said.

If the budget cuts stayed on the books, Kendall said the U.S. military would likely end up with tiered system that provided some military units with very good equipment, and others with older, less capable equipment.

Given the uncertainty about future budget levels, Kendall said he was deferring some commitments on acquisition programs. He declined to name specific programs, or estimate how many programs could face delays or cancellation.

“Depending upon how long this lasts, there’ll be more on the list as time goes on,” he said. “Until we can go through the fiscal year 2015 planning process and do some more detailed analysis on what long-term sequestration might look like, we don’t really want to make major commitments that we might have to defer.”

Frank Kendall, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit that the $392 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was the U.S. military’s highest priority conventional warfare program.

He said the Navy needed the added capabilities that the F-35 offered, noting that other countries were developing their own radar-evading fighter planes, advanced electronic warfare capabilities and other advanced weapons that threatened the U.S. military’s ability to “control the air.”

“I don’t see any indication that the Navy is going to change its plans in any fundamental way,” Kendall told the summit.

The Navy and other branches of the military have been mapping out their options if lawmakers fail to reverse mandatory budget cuts and they are forced to implement an additional 10 percent budget cut in fiscal 2015.

One possibility under discussion has been a two-year pause in orders for the F-35C carrier variant, a move that could increase the cost of the remaining aircraft to be bought by the Marine Corps and the Air Force, according to four sources familiar with the issue.

Kendall’s strong endorsement of the added capabilities of the F-35 marked a setback for Boeing Co (BA.N), which is offering the Navy upgrades of its F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter in the hopes that it can sell more of those planes.

“The F/A-18 is a great airplane, but it’s a fourth generation fighter. The F-15 is a great airplane, the F-16 is a good airplane, but they’re fourth generational fighters, and you get a quantum improvement in capability out of the F-35,” Kendall said.

Lockheed is building three variants of the F-35 for the U.S. military and the eight partner countries that are helping fund its development: Great Britain, Australia, Canada, Norway, Italy, Turkey, Denmark and the Netherlands. Israel and Japan have also placed orders for the new jet.

Kendall said Pentagon leaders next month would assess a new lower estimate of the long-term operating and maintenance cost of the jets recently prepared by the F-35 program office.

He said he expected a drop in the previous estimate of $1.1 trillion, but perhaps not one quite as steep as the projection by the F-35 program office, which now estimates it will cost $857 billion to maintain a fleet of 2,443 jets for 55 years.

He acknowledged that a decision to reduce the size of the U.S. military spurred by the budget cuts could lead to a reduction in the total number of jets to be purchased, but said those decisions were still several years off.

In the meantime, he said the Pentagon was focused on increasing the production rate so that the price of each airplane would come down.

Kendall said the F-35 program was making progress, as was the complex pilot helmet built by a joint venture of Rockwell Collins (COL.N) and Israel’s Elbit (ESLT.TA), which fuses data from the many sensors on board on the plane.

He said the Pentagon hoped to be able to use the primary helmet, but it was continuing to fund work on a less capable alternative being developed by BAE Systems (BAES.L) in case the other helmet did not advance quickly enough.

He said he also remained concerned about bringing the cost of the primary helmet down.

Unless Congress comes up with a budget for the next fiscal year, which begins October 1, air traffic controllers could find themselves facing the same furloughs that caused flight delays in March, when the cuts initially went into effect.

Congress moved quickly in April to pass legislation that allowed the Department of Transportation to use about $250 million in unspent funds from the Airport Improvement Program to cover immediate salaries of air traffic controllers and other essential employees at the FAA.

“I’m glad it was rectified quickly last year but that created a big headache for a lot of our customers, and is not something that we want to repeat again,” said United Continental (UAL.N) Chief Financial Officer John Rainey at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit.

The FAA estimated that hundreds of flight delays were directly caused by the furloughs, inciting traveler backlash at major hubs including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta.

FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the potential impact of the budget cuts in fiscal year 2014 remained unclear.

“Congress has not yet approved a budget for FY 2014 so we do not have an update on future funding allocations,” Brown said in a statement emailed to Reuters. “The administration continues to urge Congress to act to replace the damaging cuts imposed by the sequester with a balanced approach that reduces the deficit while protecting critical priorities.”

“Everything is really up in the air right now,” said one U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.

The FAA has already halted training programs, cut back on maintenance and stopped hiring new personnel, said the official, adding that it was unclear where the agency could find additional savings to avoid a bigger impact on modernization and air traffic controllers.

Marion Blakey, chief executive for the lobbyist firm Aerospace Industries Association, said sparing the highly visible air traffic controllers from cuts could come at the expense of infrastructure investment.

“The chances are excellent that the investment accounts will be hit the hardest,” said Blakey at the Summit.

Scott Thompson, who heads the aerospace and defense practice for PricewaterhouseCoopers PWC.UL, said he hoped funding for infrastructure improvements, such as the Next Generation Air Transportation System - a project to modernize the nation’s air traffic system - would be preserved alongside flexibility for keeping towers open.

“Whatever they do I think Congress will give the FAA the wherewithal to man the towers the way they need to be manned,” said Thompson.

The sequestration cuts were originally devised by Washington in 2011 as a way to force the White House and Congress to find other ways to reduce the federal deficit by $1.2 trillion over the next decade. The mandatory cuts kicked in on March 1, when lawmakers failed to reach agreement on any alternatives.

A first round of $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts was implemented in March, with another $109.3 billion to be shaved from the government budget starting October 1.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aerospace-defense-eads/eads-sees-flat-to-lower-defense-revenue-idUSBRE98313S20130904","EADS sees flat to lower defense revenue","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - EADS EAD.PA is opting out of bidding on some U.S. weapons programs as it adjusts to cuts in U.S. defense spending, and it expects flat to lower revenue in defense business in coming years as the cuts deepen, a senior executive said on Wednesday.

“There’s no doubt that the government sector is flat to declining and we’re forecasting the same,” Sean O’Keefe, chief executive of EADS North America, told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit.

International sales may compensate somewhat, he added. The company is girding for a tough year for its defense business even as its Airbus commercial jetliner business books a record backlog of orders, including a sale of 40 jets to Delta Airlines (DAL.N), announced Wednesday, a deal worth $5.6 billion at list prices that ends nearly two decades of exclusive Boeing (BA.N) sales to the U.S. airline.

O’Keefe, speaking at the Reuters office in Washington, D.C., said the U.S. bidding process has slowed in response to budget cutting and sequestration, which he called “a self-inflicted fiscal challenge that nobody’s ever seen before.”

He said EADS is targeting defense contracts that allow it to build on core strengths, while avoiding far-reaching programs that might not pay off. For example, the U.S. Army’s vertical lift aircraft program.

“I wouldn’t say that we’re walking away from things, we’re just being much more specific about the core competencies,” he said.

EADS’ defense-related businesses represent about 30 percent of overall revenue with the remainder from Airbus commercial aircraft.

In July the company said it would restructure and rebrand itself under the Airbus name, a shift caused in part by its failed effort to merge with BAE Systems PLC (BAES.L) earlier in the year. EADS had long sought to establish a defense-business identity separate from the Airbus brand, which had links to the longstanding rivalry and trade dispute with Boeing.

The attempt to merge with BAE Systems “opened up a whole new strategy” from its previous goal of balancing the size of its aircraft and its defense businesses, O’Keefe said.

The failed merger “gave us an opportunity to rethink what our strategic objectives are,” he said.

O’Keefe said the company isn’t concerned that using the Airbus name would put it at a disadvantage in bidding for U.S. defense work. The competition with Boeing to supply aerial refueling tanker aircraft, he said, showed that EADS can compete on equal footing in the United States, and that buyers don’t need to accept sole-source suppliers. Boeing ultimately won the $35 billion tanker deal on its lower price in 2011. Airbus won an earlier round in 2008 with partner Northrop Grumman (NOC.N).

NextGen, a staged program that will shift air-traffic control systems to global positioning satellites from radar, requires about $1 billion a year in federal investment and is expected to be completed in 2025, Marion Blakey, chief executive of the Aerospace Industries Association, said at the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit.

It is the biggest aviation infrastructure upgrade since radar in the 1940s, she added.

However, budget cuts required by sequestration - a procedure in U.S. law that limits the size of the federal budget - may prompt the Federal Aviation Administration to raid money set aside for infrastructure projects and use it to pay for ongoing expenses, Blakey said.

“The chances are excellent that the investment accounts will be hit much the hardest,” she said, speaking at the Reuters office in Washington, D.C. Blakey is also a former FAA administrator.

“The investment that’s required can be derailed in the course of a single year - 2014 - by the sequestration cuts.”

When the government is faced with curtailing current operations, which is felt immediately, “usually what has to go is the R&D, the investments,” she said. “That’s what we very much fear because it’s eating this country’s economic seed corn in a terrible way.”

Delay of the NextGen system could affect the capacity of the U.S. air system, which is projected to handle 1 billion passengers in 2015, up from 780,000 in 2010. The impact could be felt especially at congested hubs where airlines already are “bumping up against” system capacity. That means a tiny hiccup in the system can cause many canceled flights at a hub.

Earlier on Thursday, United Continental Holdings Inc’s (UAL.N) chief financial officer said the airline is using new slim seats and other measures to both upgrade planes and allow them to carry more passengers efficiently. John Rainey said he was concerned about sequestration’s effect on air traffic control and towers.

“The more important thing for us is really the air traffic control situation,” he told Reuters. “I’m glad it was rectified quickly” when the FAA got authority to shift money and end the furloughs, he said. “I hope that we would have a thoughtful approach to sequestration, not have any type of capricious cuts like that which would certainly hurt a particular segment of the economy more than others.”

Aerospace and airline executives expect U.S. air travel to increase about 5.5 percent a year. But some have raised concerns that growth could falter if the FAA is not able to keep control towers open or has to furlough air-traffic controllers once again, as it did earlier this year, because of budget cuts.

Blakey said she will leave soon for a conference in China to discuss airport infrastructure development there. The system is undergoing rapid growth and had large delays this summer.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-africa-summit-housingfinance/kenyas-housing-finance-eyes-more-funding-idUSBRE93A0O420130411","Kenya's Housing Finance eyes more funding","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s Housing Finance (HFCK.NR) is looking to raise more funds in the second half of this year and increase mortgage lending as it expects last month’s peaceful elections to spur demand for houses.

Kenya’s second biggest mortgage lender said it would finalize plans for more funding in the next few months, having sold the last tranche of a 10 billion shillings ($118.5 million) bond last year.

The election last month allayed fears the east African country would descent into chaos again as in the last election five years ago, and led to expectations of lower interest rates and higher consumer spending.

“We will be looking to raise more money. Either we will do it locally or offshore or both,” Chief Executive Frank Ireri told the Reuters Africa Investment Summit on Thursday. He did not say how much Housing Finance was planning to raise.

The company, which is involved in housing development as well as finance, is eyeing a bigger share of Kenya’s booming housing market and also a maiden entry into other regional countries.

Ireri said Housing Finance would use different strategies in other east African markets due to the small size of their financial sectors.

“You can’t go into south Sudan and give someone a 15-year loan today,” he said.

A rising middle class in Kenya has meant demand for housing has outstripped supply for decades, and the sector has outperformed other asset classes such as stocks and bonds with annual returns of up to 30 percent.

Housing demand is also expected to receive a big boost in coming years from recent oil and gas discoveries in the region.

“I think we’re going to see a lot of foreign investors coming in to the property space,” Ireri said, adding he expected property investments to rise in the second or third quarters of this year.

Mortgage uptake has remained very low in the region, he said, hindered by high interest rates, high cost of accessing loans, and the bureaucratic difficulty of getting land ownership deeds that lenders require as collateral.

There are less than 20,000 mortgage accounts in Kenya, a nation of more than 40 million people.

Housing finance, which controls 35 percent of the Kenya’s mortgage market, is also planning to list real estate investment trusts (REITs) on the Nairobi bourse.

Kenya’s capital markets authority is working to introduce REITs, high-yielding securities that trade like stocks.

“The impending introduction of REITs may boost it (real estate earnings) even further,” Ireri said. ($1 = 84.4000 Kenyan shillings)

This year, the oil-by-rail boom inundated the U.S. East and Gulf coasts. In 2014, the shale revolution hits the water, says U.S. commodity merchant Freepoint Commodities.

A dramatic slump in U.S. cash crude prices in recent weeks has vividly shown that the unrelenting rise in shale oil production from North Dakota and Texas is rapidly nearing the point of saturation for Gulf Coast refiners, likely forcing more and more cargoes up the East Coast on tankers.

The swell of crude emerging from the Bakken in North Dakota, plus the Eagle Ford and Permian basins in Texas, has created rippling shockwaves for oil traders, with logistical bottlenecks emerging with each expanding wave, Brison Bickerton, head of strategy for Stamford, Connecticut-based Freepoint, told the Reuters Commodity Summit this week.

First came the need for oil tank trucks to ferry crude from small shale wells to larger gathering stations, tanks or terminals. As more and more oil-by-rail terminals came online and pipelines were built, that crude flowed swiftly and easily to refiners across most of the United States.

“When you look forward, really now only three months forward, it looks like you’ve essentially debottlenecked the interior of the country to the water, with the exception of the West Coast,” said Bickerton, a former Department of Energy staffer whose first job in the oil industry was helping clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill in his native Alaska.

“So now essentially the bottleneck becomes the United States of America.”

As a result, the trade for next year will be pushing more crude up to the East Coast of Canada and the United States, a trend that has gradually emerged this year but may yet require more investment in port infrastructure as volumes grow.

“We think commodity merchants will increasingly need to look towards logistical solutions on the water in the Gulf of Mexico in 2014 to help move continued growth in U.S. shale oil.”

Freepoint has built up a growing operation along the Gulf Coast, including an active inland barge operation, crude oil tank leases in the Houston Shipping Channel and logistics operations around Corpus Christi, a port near Eagle Ford.

“We’re looking for more opportunities to get involved.”

Bickerton said that while crude oil spreads are unlikely to remain unusually wide for prolonged periods, as they have in recent years, there are still short-term bottlenecks emerging around pipeline disruptions or refinery maintenance.

“It’s going to create a lot of interesting volatility.”

THE REVOLUTION UNDERESTIMATED

The unyielding pace of the U.S. shale oil revolution has routinely surprised analysts and flummoxed doubters, and Bickerton says many people may still be underestimating the scale of the production growth - just as some did several years ago after the emergence of shale natural gas.

“At Sempra we did a pretty good job of getting the shale gas story early, and trading it well early. After a few years, we said ‘Whew - it’s been so big, gone on long, surely at some point it has to take a pause,’” he said.

But taking a rest from being “uber-optimistic” about shale gas volume was “wrong,” he said, as new projects kept coming.

“Oil right now feels like year two or three of what we thought in shale gas, where every quarter the story seems to get better and better. I’m getting more excited about it, it seems even bigger than I thought it was three months ago.”

With emerging signs that the oil supply growth may continue through 2014, traders will soon be forced to grapple with potentially the last bottleneck, which is legal rather than logistical - a U.S. law that generally prevents the export of U.S. crude to most countries apart from Canada.

“People in the merchant business dealing with oil haven’t even really begun to address how we deal with the bottlenecks in 2015 when there’s probably so much light, sweet crude that we may need to face some form of export outside of the U.S. and Canada. No one really knows what the answer to that is.”

“I don’t think there is a point when you are done,” Brian Salerno, director of the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), told Reuters during the Reuters Global Commodities Summit in Houston.

Salerno took over as director of BSEE (pronounced “Bessie”) in late August. BSEE is the enforcement side of the former U.S. Minerals Management Service and was created in 2011 after the BP well blowout to split safety and environmental enforcement from the management of offshore crude oil and natural gas resources.

Following the Macondo disaster, the worst U.S. offshore spill ever which killed 11 men and released more than 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, stories emerged about MMS employees being too cozy with oil company officials which raised questions about the integrity of regulators.

Rules have since been tightened to redouble safety and disaster response standards.

“What we mean when we talk about safety culture is that it really takes root and is built into the actual business processes of the companies,” Salerno said, adding that BSEE is working to introduce “an additional focus on how we manage risk, collectively.”

“I’ve got less than 2-1/2 months stick time,” Salerno said of his tenure at the helm of the agency, which included the three-week partial government shutdown that curtailed some of BSEE’s work.

However, Salerno is no newcomer to maritime safety regulation. Prior to taking over BSEE, he retired as a vice-admiral after a 36-year career in the U.S. Coast Guard during which he served as deputy commandant for operations.

While the general impression may be that the Macondo crisis is over, some of the problems it revealed are only beginning to be understood, he said.

LOOKING AT AVIATION SAFETY AS MODEL

“One thing we are missing is information on near misses,” Salerno said.

Near misses are breakdowns, malfunctions and operational upsets that, had they not been caught in time, could result in disasters.

Most near-misses do not release enough pollutants to require reporting to U.S. environmental agencies. They are often unknown to regulators, but after a disaster investigators see them as glaring warnings of impending tragedy.

By spring 2014, BSEE hopes to unveil a reporting system that will enable workers to report near misses to the agency through the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

Workers will be able to report problems anonymously as BTS has the legal authority to keep its information confidential, Salerno said.

“It’s done in aviation, and it can help them too in the industry,” he said.

The near-miss reporting system will help the agency learn what energy companies are really doing to improve safety as they work with increasingly advanced technologies hundreds of miles offshore and thousands of feet below the surface to extract hydrocarbons from high-pressure, high-temperature wells.

Another process for building an effective safety culture in the offshore industry is the continuing auditing of safety plans being carried out by the companies.

Eventually, those audits will be performed by independent, rigorous third-party evaluators.

“We’ve got to get it to that point,” Salerno said.

Research centers are also key contributors in developing the safest technologies for the industry. Currently, Argonne National Laboratory outside Chicago and OHMSETT, the National Oil Spill Response Research & Renewable Energy Test Facility in Leonardo, New Jersey, are working on new technologies.

BSEE is close to designating a location for the Ocean Energy Safety Institute, which will work to identify the best available technologies for safety and environmental protection.

One focus of research at OHMSETT is finding technologies for use in the Arctic Ocean off the coast of Alaska. The intensely cold region requires different systems than the balmy Gulf or the warm waters off the coast of California, where BSEE also regulates drilling and production operations.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) has submitted a plan to U.S. authorities for drilling off the shore of Alaska in 2014.

From Alaska to the Gulf, oil company plans for new wells mean higher demand for BSEE’s services. The U.S. Gulf is expected to see its biggest uptick in output ever in coming years as a string of deepwater platforms ramp up production through 2016.

“From an industry perspective, business is booming. That means, from a BSEE perspective, business is booming,” he said.

Salerno said another priority is the ability of producers to quickly respond to a blowout and cap a gushing leak within hours or days rather than the three months it took BP and other industry players to come up with the equipment that finally capped the Macondo well.

Those efforts include more research at OHMSETT on spill response technical capabilities and the use of dispersants to break up oil at the seabed in addition to sheens on the water’s surface in both warm and cold environments.

He also said he is satisfied that the industry has met the post-Macondo requirement that deepwater producers have capping mechanisms ready for dispatch to a leaking well. Oil companies have formed consortiums that built multiple huge caps, much like the one that capped Macondo, and stationed them at various coastal sites for deployment if needed.

“The technology was developed in the midst of a crisis. You could probably have long discussions as to why nobody thought of it beforehand, why we needed a crisis to stimulate that, but sometimes that’s where innovation comes from, unfortunately.”

“As to the United States, I think we are subscale there,” Senior Executive Vice-president Marco Alvera, who oversees trading operations, told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit.

“Our Houston office is performing well, it’s mainly there to sell the equity oil and gas we produce. It has the potential to develop into more of a regional office to support our activities in South America,” he said.

Eni is one of the largest buyers of gas in Europe and with output of 1.7 million barrels per day is bigger than U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips (COP.N) although its output has traditionally been more focused on Africa and the Middle East.

Several trading assets have been offered for sale over the past year in the United States, including by Wall Street bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM.N), which is looking to exit the commodities business due to tighter regulations. Hess (HES.N) is also selling out of trading unit Hetco.

Alvera declined to comment on specific assets and acquisition targets.

“I think it’s our duty to at least look at those books,” he said. Trading house Gunvor told the Reuters Summit this week it is looking at JPMorgan’s business.

“I think to be a global player, which is our ambition, growth in North America is going to be a big part of our future, starting from a small base. I would not exclude right now any growth, which is not only hiring people, but also buying into some positions,” said Alvera.

WINNING BUSINESS BACK

Alvera, who began his career at Goldman Sachs (GS.N) in the 1990s, said that as part of its expansion strategy Eni’s trading division wanted to rival banks in some of their traditional commodities trading activities, such as hedging.

“As the market becomes more liquid, especially on natural gas and power, as it becomes more sophisticated in developing specific hedging expertise and volatility trading expertise, the first step is to regain control of our flows,” he said.

“This is a very profitable business because not only you save on fees and commissions, but also because you make some interesting money if you monetize this properly.”

Eni is the largest gas buyer from Russia, Libya, Norway and Algeria and hedges those activities through fuel oil and crude oil as gas is indexed to those fuels in long-term contracts.

“Typically we would go in the market and just hedge through a third party ...What we do now is that we execute in the market directly without offloading it to a bank,” Alvera said.

He said the second step would be to take this activity to Eni’s existing customers.

“I would not say we will go to third party customers and offer hedging solutions. But if we have a customer who is already buying a commodity from us, we may as well build the commodity contract in a way that will effectively offer him a hedge or a contract that is more similar to what he needs industrially.”

He said that would increasingly become a norm in Italy and southern Europe where gas and power markets were becoming more liquid: “Before some of these guys would just buy the commodity from us and then go to a bank to do their hedging”.

PRICE AND REFINING WEAKNESS

Alvera said he believed global oil prices could drop sharply if output from Iraq, Libya or Iran was to return to the already well-supplied market.

“We have seen that when Brent drops, it drops quite rapidly... I think 2014 is going to be a very interesting year because a lot of situations could result in more production. And this is production that’s very easy to bring on line from an industrial perspective.”

He also said he expected more refineries in Europe to close down: “I think the future is very bleak. There will be huge products flows coming from the Middle East, Asia and certain products from the U.S., as well.”

“Not only a lot of European refineries are subscale, they also have to cope with higher costs of electricity and natural gas to function. The good news is that capacity is coming off.”

He expects the largest U.S. railroad’s crude shipments to approach 700,000 barrels per day by year-end, after falling below 600,000 bpd. The railroad, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), last spring had expected higher growth this year, but the pullback slowed it down.

Longer term, Rose expects growth to continue despite price volatility in oil markets, which he said is easier to tolerate than the far more volatile market for grains - historically the biggest commodity BNSF has handled in its northern U.S. network.

Canadian and U.S. crude production is rising and refiners and logistics companies are putting up more offloading infrastructure to move it by rail - particularly on the East and West coasts, where pipeline companies are not expected to build their own projects.

“We think by the end of this year we’ll be closer to 700,000 barrels per day, so we’ll kind of hit back to where we were for that short period of time in the spring this year,” Rose told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit.

Several refiners that process railed Bakken crude, including PBF Energy (PBF.N) and Phillips 66 (PSX.N), said during recent earnings conference calls that they scaled back on Bakken shipments in the third quarter in favor of imports because higher U.S. oil prices eroded the cost benefit of replacing imports with railed-in crude.

Double-digit discounts of U.S. crude to Brent had narrowed to nearly nothing, making it uneconomical to take on the added transportation costs of railed crude.

The Association of American Railroads also said on Thursday that third-quarter crude shipments via rail dropped 14 percent from the second quarter.

However, Brent’s premium to U.S. crude futures has since widened, prompting shippers to ramp up Bakken shipments again. On Thursday Brent closed at a $9.26 per barrel premium to U.S. crude, down from $10.44 on Wednesday.

“As it worked against us this summer, it’s working back now, that the marginal barrel is flowing back to rail, away from imports,” Rose said.

Rose said he was unconcerned about the volatility because he sees growth in railed crude as more offloading projects come online and U.S. oil production keeps growing. BNSF plans to double its capital spending on its crude business to $400 million next year from $200 million this year.

He said railed crude may wane along the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Midwest as pipeline projects come online, he said, but no such big projects await the East and West coasts. Those markets increasingly rely on rail to tap cheaper U.S. and Canadian crude.

As producers in Canada are just starting to build loading infrastructure to put their output on the rails, Rose said his industry is in the “first inning of the heavy crude by rail business.”

Rose said there is less volatility in crude markets than in the market for grains.

“When you talk about volatility, that is volatile. When I compare the crude business, even though there is a degree of volatility with the spreads, I really think the crude business is going to be less volatile than our grain business,” he said.

CANADIAN CRASH AFTERMATH

Rose said BNSF and other railroads are “very much involved” in scrutiny of crude-by-rail and tank railcar integrity in the aftermath of the deadly crash and explosion of a Bakken oil-laden train in a small Quebec town last July.

The Lac-Megantic crash of a runaway Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway train killed 47 people and obliterated half of the town’s main business strip.

U.S. and Canadian regulators, AAR and railroads are examining ways to increase safety in light of the accident. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has stepped up inspections and may impose stricter regulations on tank cars that carry crude and other hazardous materials.

Two years ago AAR adopted standards requiring that all such railcars ordered after October 2011 have thicker shells and reinforced valves to better prevent punctures or leaks in derailments.

However, at least 69 percent of railcars in use were built before that standard was imposed, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The rail industry has said it could cost $1 billion to retrofit all cars to meet the 2011 standard.

Rose said BNSF supports phasing out any hauling of hazardous materials by those older cars over seven years. That’s not an industry position, and PHMSA is still seeking public comment as it reviews imposing more safety rules.

“We think a seven-year phaseout is reasonable,” Rose said. “It allows people enough time to be able to build out the new cars, and the industry has the capacity to replace those cars.”

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-consumer-retail-mergers/dealmakers-expect-more-ma-despite-higher-interest-rates-idUSBRE98A1BA20130911","Dealmakers expect more M&A despite higher interest rates","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boosted by recent high profile retail deals including Hudson’s Bay Co’s (HBC.TO) acquisition of Saks Inc SKS.N and Neiman Marcus’s sale to a new private equity group, merger activity in the sector has climbed this year, and top dealmakers expect more to come despite potentially higher interest rates.

U.S. retail and consumer M&A saw an uptick of 25.4 percent as deal values rose to $88.7 billion so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The likelihood of rising interest rates, as the U.S. Federal Reserve looks to scale back its monetary easing policy, means it will be more costly for companies to issue debt. But this could also mean that companies may accelerate their merger plans in order to finance deals at more favorable rates, bankers said on Wednesday at the Reuters Global Consumer and Retail Summit in New York.

Rising rates would also signal that the economy is improving, which may help to mitigate the downside of rate hikes.

“If the economy is doing well, CEOs and boards probably feel a little better,” said Robin Rankin, global co-head of the retail & consumer products group at Credit Suisse.

Following in the footsteps of large deals announced in 2013 including OfficeMax Inc’s OMX.N merger with Office Depot Inc ODP.N and Kroger Co’s (KR.N) acquisition of Harris Teeter Supermarkets Inc HTSI.N, M&A activity in retail will continue to be driven largely by corporations as opposed to private equity firms, bankers say.

“Strategic activity is as strong as it has been in a very long time and that is going to be buttressed by some level of sponsor activity, mostly in the mid market with some large deals like the Neiman Marcus deal,” said Stefan Selig, executive vice chairman of global corporate & investment banking at Bank of America (BAC.N). “It is going to be strong but consistent with what we have seen in the first eight months of this year.”

Dealmakers also expect the retail sector to continue to be ripe for activism, although the segment may not be as attractive as it once was as share prices for retail companies have rallied so far this year.

The teen retail space, however, continues to be picked over by the activist community, where recent targets have included Abercrombie & Fitch Co (ANF.N) and Wet Seal Inc WTSL.O.

Most of these companies “are in the small to mid cap space so they’re of a size where the activists can have a more prominent role in trying to impact M&A activity there,” said David Shiffman, co-head of the global retail group at Peter J. Solomon Co.

Activists are investors who take a stake in a company with hopes to affect change.

Despite the overall performance in the sector, retail company boards are wising up to the risk of activists. “If people fall down or trip, they should be very wary because there is a huge activist community,” Rankin said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commodities-summit-mmg/chinas-mmg-sees-copper-price-steady-zinc-market-balanced-idUSBRE9A50LK20131106","China's MMG sees copper price steady, zinc market balanced","MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Chinese metals producer MMG Ltd (1208.HK) expects copper prices to hold around current levels in the medium term, with the market supported by solid growth in demand and new mines ramping up more slowly than projected.

In contrast, MMG expects zinc prices to rise as demand growth is set to outpace supply as several older mines outside China shut down and miners struggle to develop new supply sources.

MMG Chief Executive Andrew Michelmore said he sees copper prices holding in the low $7,000 a metric ton range, which is around the current LME 3-month copper price of $7,172 a metric ton (1.1023 tons), or $3.25 a pound.

“I don’t see the basis for any wild swing up or down,” he said in an interview for the Reuters Global Commodities Summit. “You had people talking $8,500, $10,000, $12,000. I think that heat has come out of it.”

MMG, listed in Hong Kong and headquartered in Melbourne, is an arm of China Minmetals Corp CHMIN.UL that has been anointed to drive the company’s western expansion in base metals. It produces copper and zinc, with mines in Australia, Laos and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Its Century zinc mine in Australia is the world’s third-largest.

Copper prices are being driven down by traders shorting the market on the view that too much supply will be coming on, such as from Rio Tinto’s (RIO.AX) Oyu Tolgoi mine and scrap metal supplies in China, Michelmore said, adding that view would probably be proven wrong.

“So I think the market’s probably overestimating the rate at which supply’s going to come on, and that will create uncertainty in the market.”

He does not see African and Asian copper mines, other than Oyu Tolgoi, having much impact on global supply in the medium term, but said MMG is still interested in expanding in both Africa and South America.

“The South American belt is the interesting one in terms of significant volumes of metal that could come on,” he said, pointing to the Las Bambas, Constancia and Toromocho projects in Peru and the Disputada project in Chile, among others.

Sources have said MMG is leading one of two Chinese consortiums bidding for the Las Bambas mine that Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L) has put up for sale.

Michelmore declined to comment on the Las Bambas auction.

On the demand side, he saw Chinese appetite for copper picking up in 2014.

“It’s not going to be the high growth that we’ve seen before. I think it’s going to take another six to 12 months to pick up. But certainly confidence is improving with the new government,” Michelmore said.

China is the world’s largest consumer of most commodities, including copper and zinc.

SHRINKING ZINC OVERSUPPLY

Michelmore said zinc prices are likely to increase as he sees the oversupply in the market shrinking sharply this year to around 50,000 metric tons or less. That’s less than half the surplus forecast by The International Lead and Zinc Study Group.

“My view would be that when the numbers come out, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were no surplus at the end of the year in 2013. So in 2014, you’re going to start seeing it getting tighter,” he said.

He said demand growth is good, but the key questions are on the supply side, in China and in the west, where about 1 million metric tons of supply will come out of the market as several older mines shut over the next few years, including MMG’s Century mine in Australia.

In China, moves to improve air quality and limit heavy metals run-off into farmland are likely to affect zinc concentrate producers and smelters.

“Our view is that China could, at a certain price, be able to produce from their own mines and new mines the zinc that’s needed (in China). Will they? It depends on the environmental restrictions that go on it. That might hold it back,” he said.

MMG’s Dugald River zinc project in Australia, while delayed due to a reworking of the mine plan, will fill some of the gap.

Beyond that, few new deposits have been identified, and where they have been, such as in Iran and South Africa, little work has been done toward developing mines, which means supply growth will lag demand growth until prices move sharply higher.

“Most of these projects need well over $1 per pound to justify any new project,” Michelmore said, declining to comment on what price MMG was basing its Dugald River approval on.

Zinc is currently around 87 cents a pound.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-summit-international-talks/white-house-cites-progress-in-cyber-talks-with-china-russia-idUSBRE94D19R20130514","White House cites progress in cyber talks with China, Russia","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has made substantial progress in recent talks on computer hacking issues with both China and Russia, a White House official told the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit on Tuesday.

Michael Daniel, the Obama administration’s cybersecurity policy coordinator, said that China has agreed to establish a joint working group with the United States to address Internet security issues such as cyber espionage.

The group will convene for the first time this summer, stepping up communication that had previously been relegated to sporadic discussions or long-running unofficial talks between private citizens from the two countries.

“We’re working to set the agenda” for the initial meeting, Daniel said at the summit held at Reuters’ Washington offices.

The move comes amid increased pressure on Beijing from President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials to curb theft of digital data, especially from targets outside the traditional spying realms of military and government.

The developments are a rare positive event after a string of unsettling cyber attacks have renewed calls for international agreements on norms of behavior.

“The ability to carry on a dialogue with both the Russians and the Chinese is improving over time,” Daniel said. “One of our key goals in this space it is to improve that international cooperation.”

With Russia, the talks are an attempt to recover ground from an earlier negotiation that would have established a Moscow-Washington hotline to defuse Internet-security emergencies. That round of discussions had seemed promising for months last year but collapsed at the last minute, officials have said.

Daniel and Obama’s national security advisor, Tom Donilon, both worked on the issue during recent travel to Russia, and “some final announcements will come over the next few months,” Daniel said, declining to give details.

Late last year, a classified consensus U.S. intelligence report determined that China was by far the largest thief of economically valuable intellectual property from U.S. companies, taking more than No. 2 Russia and other countries combined.

This year, a report by the private security company Mandiant accused a specific unit in the Chinese army of responsibility for a raft of intrusions.

Mandiant Chief Security Officer Richard Bejtlich told the Reuters Summit that the Chinese army unit changed its tactics for a while after the report was published, but he added that “it appears that these guys are reconstituting.”

Though concrete changes might be a ways off, the agreement to direct talks shows that “the Chinese apparently are taking this seriously,” said Jim Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a cybersecurity expect who has led the U.S. side of the semi-official “track two” talks. “They know they have to do something to placate the Americans.”

Dmitri Alperovitch, the chief technology officer of security firm CrowdStrike and author of several analyses on Chinese spying campaigns, said that the more formal talks with Beijing would be a “huge step forward” but one not likely to stop state-sponsored Internet spying on their own.

“The next step is to tell them what we’re going to do in response” if the behavior doesn’t change, Alperovitch said at the Summit. He suggested that the United States could penalize some sectors of Chinese imports by adding tariffs.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-consumer-retail-sanmiguel/philippines-san-miguel-plans-to-sell-another-25-percent-of-food-unit-idUSBRE98A0FX20130911","Philippines' San Miguel plans to sell another 25 percent of food unit","MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine conglomerate San Miguel Corp (SMC.PS) is planning to sell up to a quarter of the outstanding shares of its food unit next year in a follow-on offer to raise funds for the group’s expansion, company officials said on Wednesday.

San Miguel’s President Ramon Ang and Chief Financial Officer Ferdinand Constantino told Reuters that San Miguel Pure Foods Co Inc (PF.PS) was expected to end 2013 with double-digit revenue growth, up from 4 percent growth in the first half, boosted by the strength of the economy.

Higher revenues should help San Miguel to sell an additional 25 percent stake in Pure Foods at a premium to market prices, Constantino said. San Miguel raised around $150 million last year when it sold a 15 percent stake in the food unit for 240 pesos ($5.48) per share.

“It should be higher, much higher than that. If we do it next year, it could command a good price,” Constantino said, referring to the share price.

Reuters calculations, based on current market prices, show San Miguel stands to raise at least 10 billion pesos ($228 million) from the follow-on sale, which would cut its holding in Pure Food to around 60 percent.

San Miguel also expects its beer business to recover in the second half after flat sales in the first six months of the year due to the impact of a higher tax on tobacco and alcohol products. San Miguel Brewery is partly owned by Japan’s Kirin Holdings (2503.T).

“We are very happy that the food group is doing very well,” said Ang, who is the chief architect of the group’s aggressive expansion in the last five years.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-summit-nightmares/cyber-experts-fear-escalation-of-attacks-idUSBRE94H08S20130518","Cyber experts fear escalation of attacks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cybersecurity professionals know a myriad of ways hackers can try to wreak havoc on critical infrastructure or infiltrate corporations to steal or spy, but it is the fear of the unknown that some say keeps them up at night.

U.S. security officials and private sector experts wonder what kinds of time-bombs can be - or have been - embedded by malware into computer networks, just waiting to explode.

Cyber espionage is already “the greatest transfer of wealth in history,” National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander, the top U.S. general in charge of cybersecurity, told the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit in Washington this week.

“Disruptive and destructive attacks on our country will get worse,” he said. “Mark my words, it will get worse.”

Stealing software or money - like the $45 million lifted from two Middle Eastern banks in a daring global plot revealed this month - might pale next to an attack that could, for example, switch off the lights in a major U.S. city.

That was the fear in New Orleans in February when a power outage struck the Super Bowl, the National Football League’s championship game, witnessed by tens of millions of viewers. The outage was blamed on an electrical relay device not a cyber attack.

“The known unknown is what I worry about,” U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano told the Summit.

“For example, we don’t have the identity of all the adversaries who are trying to either commit crimes or acts over the cyber networks. The things we know about, we can deal with. It’s the known unknown,” she added.

The military is a big target, something that Rear Admiral William Leigher, who is in charge of “information dominance” with the U.S. Navy, takes on board.

“Our networks see thousands of intrusion attempts every day...staying up with the threat, making sure that our defensive systems are up to par is probably one of the things that gets most of my attention,” Leigher said.

To be sure, the United States has not suffered the kind of destructive cyber attack that damaged some 30,000 computers at Saudi Arabia’s oil company, Saudi Aramco, last year. But experts said they were worried about the increasingly sophisticated cyber capabilities of countries such as China, Russia and Iran.

“This new growing trend of nation states engaged in cyber attacks that are designed to be destructive to parts of the U.S. economy is very, very concerning,” said Mike Rogers, chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee.

“The ferociousness of these attacks is increasing and it’s something that we better get a handle on,” Rogers added.

Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of Crowdstrike, a security technology specialist firm that works with governments and private companies, said he is most concerned about Iran, particularly if there is a spike in tensions in the Middle East.

He is watching the attacks that have taken down the websites of more than a dozen U.S. banks in the past nine months. <ID:L2N0DY26C> There are no signs that hackers have managed to destroy or modify crucial financial data, but that is the fear.

“Attacks that focus on modifying data in the stealth way, sabotage, integrity attacks - those are the ones that are most insidious and those are the ones we really should worry about,” Alperovitch said.

The migration of ever more elements of the economy to the digital world opens the door to malfeasance.

“We keep hooking more and more stuff up to the Internet, so the attack surface keeps growing,” said Michael Daniel, cybersecurity policy coordinator at the White House. “Pretty soon your coffee maker and your refrigerator is going to be an attack vector because it’s going to be hooked up to the Internet.","2013-05-18 15:13:20","1","24.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","18.0","0.0","44.0","36.0","0.0","105.0","0.0","6.0","0","697","93.63","64.03","21.24","2.65","25.81","26.11","75.18","43.47","8.18","3.01","0.57","1.29","0.29","0.57","0.29","5.16","8.90","14.20","7.03","2.73","3.73","0.57","12.91","5.60","2.58","0.86","2.01","2.01","7.89","2.58","5.16","1.15","2.87","0.14","5.45","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.43","7.75","1.15","0.43","0.43","3.73","1.00","2.30","2.73","1.00","1.58","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.14","11.48","1.58","1.43","6.03","1.87","1.29","3.16","8.46","1.15","13.20","1.43","8.46","3.44","4.16","0.57","0.43","1.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.81","7.32","7.03","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.15","3.30","0.86","1.15","0.86","3387","8.19","27.346153846153847","1068","688","37","52.6","12.1","10.5","12.88","12.4","158","10.5","18.62604651162791","368","24.92","28","0.44","1","19","11","74","0","85","31","6","2","8","103","121","1","55","1","0","18","7","14","0","2","5","18","0","19","20","16","14","20","23","10","5","0","1"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-summit-kaspersky/kaspersky-plans-push-for-sales-to-u-s-government-idUSBRE94E14A20130515","Kaspersky plans push for sales to U.S. government","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kaspersky Lab, the Russian anti-virus software maker, plans to open an office in the Washington area to spearhead sales to the U.S. government, a bid to offset slowing demand for its programs for consumers.

Kaspersky makes one of the top-selling anti-virus programs in the United States, where it has gained market share in recent years against products from Symantec Corp (SYMC.O), Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) McAfee and Trend Micro Inc (4704.T).

Yet the Moscow-headquartered company has struggled to make inroads with the U.S. government, one of the world’s largest buyers of technology products. Security experts say that the U.S. government typically avoids Russian products out of concern they could have hidden functions that might allow Moscow to penetrate U.S. networks.

Eugene Kaspersky, the company’s co-founder and chief executive officer, told the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit that his programs have no such hidden functions. But he said he will build products aimed at the U.S. market in the United States, to assuage any concerns.

“American companies are 100 percent trusted, so we have to prove we are 200 percent trusted,” Kaspersky said. “We have to be more American than Americans.”

Kaspersky said he will hire U.S. citizens to work in the new office and write, test and compile computer programs.

The company already has a regional headquarters in Woburn, Massachusetts, and an anti-virus lab in Seattle, but does not produce software in the United States.

The new U.S. team will work on an operating system for computers that control electric generators, water systems, factories and other industrial facilities.

Kaspersky said the company is almost ready to test an early version in Russia. He said he hopes the industrial control software will one day account for about a third of its sales.

As global sales of personal computers decline, Kaspersky Lab wants to diversify its portfolio away from PC anti-virus software. Last year global PC sales posted their biggest decline in more than two decades, hurt by a shift to tablets and smartphones.

Kaspersky said falling consumer sales in 2012 crimped overall revenue growth but did not elaborate. The company still has positive revenue growth when sales to businesses are included “but it’s a little bit close to flat,” he said.

Revenue grew 14 percent in 2011 to $612 million.

Bulbank is a unit of Italy’s Unicredit (CRDI.MI).

The alliance of the Socialists and former Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai’s new Egyutt (Together) 2014 party trails Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s ruling conservative Fidesz party in opinion polls, which show voters have been slow to warm to the alliance, announced earlier this month.

“This election will be a referendum on Mr. Orban,” Socialist leader Attila Mesterhazy told a Reuters Investment Summit in a joint interview with Bajnai.

“Not just about the government, and the measures, or Fidesz. No. Do people want to leave the power in the hands of Orban? That’s the main question.”

He said polls, which suggest the two parties together have barely half of Fidesz’ support, are misleading. He said the leftists believed up to a quarter of Hungary’s 8 million voters could still be swayed.

Orban and the leader of the Fidesz parliamentary group, Antal Rogan, declined Reuters requests for interviews.

Orban’s conservative party, Fidesz, has a strong lead in opinion polls ahead of the vote, due in April or May. But close to half of Hungarian voters are undecided and the economy is growing only at a slow pace after a recession last year.

The leftist leaders said the structure of their alliance would remain. This means they will field joint candidates in local races and maintain competing party lists which will determine which of the two men will lead a coalition government if they win the elections.

According to a survey on Wednesday by pollster Median, only 23 percent of voters who wanted a change in government thought this was the best possible alliance.

Some 41 percent supported the alliance but would have preferred a joint bid and one candidate for prime minister. Some 22 percent did not support the alliance, the poll, published in weekly HVG, showed.

Mesterhazy’s Socialist Party evolved from the communists who ruled Hungary from 1956 to 1989 and has stronger support in opinion polls than Egyutt 2014. Bajnai led a Socialist government from 2009 to 2010 that cut spending to put the economy on a sustainable path.

NEW DEAL FOR BUSINESS

The two opposition leaders said the new deal they would offer international businesses and banks would gradually reduce the extra taxes that the Orban government piled on since 2010 in exchange for new investment that would bring growth to Hungary.

The taxes, including one of Europe’s highest financial sector levies and taxes on the energy and telecommunications sectors, must be reduced gradually to generate growth without endangering a low budget deficit, Bajnai said.

“The right deal is ... to say: look if you are ready to generate additional growth with significant additional investment, capital expenditure, then you can offset part of your extra special tax against those additional investments.”

Orban, who says he saved the country from a Greek-style collapse after years of economic mismanagement by Socialist governments, argues that banks and selected business sectors must take part in the burden of cutting the budget deficit.

Under Socialist governments prior to 2010, Hungary’s public debt rose sharply.

Speaking at Reuters’ Eastern European Investment Summit, Jazbec said Slovenia was in daily contact with the European Commission and the European Central Bank, finetuning banking stress tests, the government’s reform plans and next year’s budget as the small euro zone member seeks to avoid a bailout.

Its banks, struggling with at least 7.5 billion euros ($10.12 billion) of bad loans worth some 21.5 percent of GDP, are at the heart of speculation that the country could be the latest to need international aid within months.

“The government has a projection that there is enough money to run the economy without any additional financing until spring 2014,” Jazbec said, speaking in English.

“This gives us some (room), I would not say (it is) a comfortable position, but at least we do not have to panic.”

Jazbec, a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council, repeatedly refused to be drawn on the timing of any decision on seeking aid or on whether the country could find the money needed for an expected recapitalization of the banks.

He said the country would consider asking for assistance from Europe if it had no other means available to finance itself but expressed hope budget and broader economic reforms and a parliamentary confidence vote to back them would restore market confidence.

“If all three measures come together in a credible way that will convince international investors that Slovenia is able to go to international markets at rates that are sustainable..., then we can do it ourselves. If not, we will have to ask for assistance,” Jazbec said.

CRUCIAL WEEKS

The next key steps would be the adoption by the end of September of the 2014 budget, and meetings with Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem in Ljubljana next week, where Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek’s government will present its reform package.

Also vital were the central bank’s efforts to keep the banking system stable, after ordering a controlled liquidation of two troubled small banks earlier this month, and stability in the ruling coalition, made up of Bratusek’s center-left Positive Slovenia, the Social Democrats, the business oriented Civic List and the pensioners’ party.

Jazbec acknowledged that the transfer of bad loans to a state-sponsored “bad bank”, originally planned for June, appeared to be moving slowly, possibly unnerving investors but said that having a quality screening of the troubled lenders was more important than deadlines.

“Timing is not that important...We can never jeopardize quality only for the matter of timing. The decisions are too crucial to follow only the deadlines,” he said

Slovenia might also have to redo the stress tests next year, as part of European-wide banking tests, he said.

Slovenia has long suffered from political meddling in the economy and public companies, but the government’s efforts to kickstart the long delayed sale of state-owned firms could soon bear fruit, Jazbec said.

“I strongly believe in the next couple of months we will definitely see the first major investments coming in and after that everybody will follow,” he said. “But it’s always the question of who will be the first.”

But Cejka said Komercni, the third biggest Czech lender, majority-owned by Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), had not yet seen any pickup in loan demand and reiterated that the bank saw revenue drop of 6 percent this year.

Speaking at the Reuters East European Investment Summit on Wednesday, he said a pickup should eventually arrive given positive second quarter GDP figures and as companies wait for more signs of growth before investing.

“We are expecting a return to growth, but very small growth of revenue. We expect that, as the economy starts up a little, the loan portfolio should grow slightly, by some 5-6 percent,” Cejka told the summit.

“We will be very cautious on costs, we see none or minimum cost growth that should be below the rise in revenue.”

He said the bank would not maintain its very low cost of risk, seen at 40 basis points this year, and predicted a growth to 50 in 2013. This reflects provisioning against losses from loans, investments and other risks.

Komercni faces a squeeze on margins due to increasing competition from small banks and new market entrants. Cejka said Komercni and other large banks had not lost many customers but smaller players were eating into the sector’s profitability by competing with low fees.

SEES HIGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Cejka said new capital rules being introduced to strengthen banks across Europe in the coming years would have an impact on Komercni’s capital requirement, it could be “quite substantially” higher in the range of percentage points.

“It would force us to maintain capital adequacy roughly at the current level,” he said.

Central Bank Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl told Reuters this week that creating different conditions for individual banks was not the central bank’s “hallmark”, but Cejka said he still expected some additional buffer.

Komercni has, like most of the Czech banking sector, a strong capital ratio, at 16.2 percent at mid-year.

Higher capital requirements would not threaten the bank’s dividend payout ratio of 60-70 percent of profits under current conditions. But this could change if the economy picks up speed in the future.

“At the current level of the growth of the economy, the loan portfolio, the growth of business we are generating more capital than we need,” he said.

“But if the economy accelerates, if the loan portfolio started growing substantially faster, it could represent certain limitation.”

Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has previously given banks operating in Hungary until November 1 to come up with a proposal to phase out foreign currency mortgages or face a government solution that would “eliminate” these loans.

After an earlier repayment scheme that pushed banks into losses worth about a billion euros, banks fear a new relief program for households could bring more pain ahead of an election next year.

But Economy Ministry State Secretary Gabor Orban ruled out a drastic fix, such as converting the entire stock of Swiss franc mortgages held by Hungarians in one go, which could pose a threat to the forint and the banking system.

“We are fully aware of the limitations with respect to central bank foreign exchange reserves or the depth of the market to absorb such a quantity of foreign exchange demand,” Orban told a Reuters Investment Summit.

“I can rule out any conversion which would disrupt the market or have adverse consequences for central bank foreign exchange reserves in the sense that we wouldn’t want to push them too low,” he said.

“I don’t consider it a solution if it is to the detriment of the central bank’s reserve policy.”

Mihaly Patai, the head of Hungary’s Bank Association, has warned that a quick conversion of more than 10 billion Swiss francs ($10.8 billion) worth of loans into forints could undermine the forint currency if banks had to buy this currency in the spot market.

Central bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy has also expressed opposition against a one-off conversion of these loans but said, if necessary, the bank would be ready to contribute some amount of its reserves to a program at prevailing exchange rates.

Orban said a gradual conversion of these loans, which have become a major drag on consumer spending and on banks’ balance sheets as the forint weakened, could be one possible way to address the problem, based on an existing relief scheme.

But he said the average 15-year remaining lifetime of such loans could be shortened.

Orban reiterated that banks, who had pursued “reckless lending policies” before the 2008 global crisis, would have to face losses on these loans under any solution as the government had limited funds in the budget to tackle the problem.

He said the government would review its options in November, including those presented by the Banking Association, and select the one which posed the least risk to the economy and achieved the objective of phasing out the forex loans.

However, he said the solutions proposed by banks so far required too large a contribution from the government, which it was not ready to take on, adding that banks should primarily aim to sort out the situation with their clients.

“All I can tell you is that this must not jeopardize our deficit objectives,” he said.

Orban said under any scenario he saw “zero chance” of a disorderly exit of a bank from Hungary as a result.

Foreign banks whose Hungarian units may be hit by a new mortgage relief scheme include Austria’s Raiffeisen (RBIV.VI) and Erste (ERST.VI), Germany’s Bayerische Landesbank (BLGGgi.F) and Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI). Hungary’s dominant banking player is homegrown OTP OTPB.BU.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eeurope-investment-cez/cez-scales-back-new-investments-in-tough-power-market-idUSBRE98O0TZ20130926","CEZ scales back new investments in tough power market","PRAGUE (Reuters) - CEZ (CEZP.PR) is taking a wait-and-see approach to new investment as low power prices pressure energy companies and will scale back renewable plans due to an uncertain regulatory landscape, the Czech utility’s chief strategy officer said.

Pavel Cyrani, also a CEZ board member, told the Reuters Eastern Europe Investment summit on Wednesday that a cautious approach was necessary to allow central Europe’s biggest utility to remain healthy in current tough market conditions.

“For any kind of further growth either in the Czech republic or abroad we are in the wait and see mode,” Cyrani said at the summit. “We are consolidating positions where it makes sense and not growing much beyond that.”

European utilities like CEZ are squeezed by tepid electricity demand and weak wholesale power prices that have hit all-time lows in recent months.

The benchmark front-year contract has tumbled from a peak of more than 90 euros per megawatt hour in July 2008 to below 40.

Wholesale prices since have picked up but Cyrani viewed this as partly driven by expectations a new German government would support conventional power generation rather than a recovery in real demand that could spur investment.

“Our head room for further investments is decreased, therefore we have re-evaluated many of our plans,” he said.

Majority state-controlled CEZ also plans to reduce its renewables investments in the region. Cyrani said reaching a target of 3,000 MW of renewable capacity would not happen soon.

CEZ has launched a 600 MW wind farm in Romania but Cyrani said a plan to enlarge its wind portfolio in Poland would be slowed due to a lack of demand and a murky regulatory landscape.

“We are not fully preparing to build the 700 MW even if the regulation was favorable,” he said. “We will start with 100 MW or 200 MW and see how it goes.”

The utility will also only look to build on its distribution and generation assets in Turkey through expansion rather than acquisition, Cyrani added.

Legal changes in places like Romania - where a recent shift in a green certificate scheme will delay up to 66 million in annual profits from wind farms until 2018 to 2020 - is another reason to keep a leash on foreign investment, he said.

“In the mid-term, we do look at Turkey in an opportunistic way,” Cyrani said. “In terms of long-term strategy we are more committed to the Czech Republic and central Europe.

“In general, in the next three to five years we don’t see the share of foreign (operations) increasing.”

One area where CEZ will remain focused, Cyrani said, is on expanding the Temelin nuclear power plant, a multi-billion project that is the Czech Republic’s biggest ever public tender.

The utility has delayed picking a builder until the end of next year or 2015 as it negotiates with the Czech state to guarantee future electricity prices.

Analysts and shareholders have said that to go ahead with Temelin without a price guarantee would be a major risk for CEZ. The project could also hit CEZ’s dividend in the future. The company’s current a payout ratio is 50-60 percent of net profit.

Cyrani said CEZ might have to look at its dividend policy only in the final seven to eight years before the new Temelin units go online, something not expected to happen before 2025.

“It is clear that the last seven to eight years before finally going online with the (Temelin) project, that is where most of the investment is being paid,” he said.

“Going through this period we would definitely need to tighten all the money leaving the company ... so OPEX, CAPEX and dividend policy.”

Cyrani also said CEZ’s gas assets were most at risk of writedowns in an ongoing review.

Analysts have predicted a writedown could come from CEZ’s gas-fired Pocerady plant but CEZ officials said last month they did not expect one this year.

“We are still working on it,” Cyrani said. “Obviously the assets under a bigger risk are gas assets.” He said that he did not see any other extraordinary items appearing in 2013 results.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eeurope-investment-bulgaria-unicredit/bulgarian-unicredit-unit-gears-up-for-lending-boost-idUSBRE98O0KG20130925","Bulgarian Unicredit unit gears up for lending boost","SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria’s largest bank in terms of assets, Unicredit Bulbank, plans to increase lending by up to 15 percent next year to underpin an expected economic recovery in the EU’s poorest country, its chief executive said on Wednesday.

Levon Hampartzoumian told a Reuters Investment Summit in Sofia the economy was set to grow between 1 and 2 percent next year. The rate of acceleration, he said, would depend on the economic recovery in the euro zone and the political situation.

“We’re planning to increase lending between 10 to 15 percent next year,” he said. “We are set to support our clients in their efforts to grow and consume”.

With total assets of 12.7 billion levs ($8.76 billion), Unicredit Bulbank, a unit of Italy’s Unicredit (CRDI.MI), is a leading lender in the Balkan country with a loan portfolio of 9.2 billion levs as of the end of June.

Hampartzoumian, who also chairs the Association of Banks in Bulgaria, said Bulgaria needed a more stable political environment for a healthy economic recovery.

“Predictability of the political environment is a significant factor for growth for our corporate clients and an important factor for consumers,” he said.

Hundreds of Bulgarians have protested against the Socialist-led government since it took office in late May. Although rallies have eased recently, opinion polls show about 50 percent of people believe the cabinet should step down by May next year.

Bulgaria’s economy is expected to grow by a meager 0.6 percent this year, after expanding by 0.8 percent in 2012.

Hampartzoumian said his bank would support both corporate and retail lending, predicting a moderate recovery in consumer confidence after a partial recovery of the real estate sector.

Credit lending in Bulgaria grew by an average 40 percent in the pre-crisis years, but has dropped steeply to 2-3 percent rates since 2009, when the real estate and construction balloon deflated.

Bulgarian banks, about 70 percent owned by foreign hands, have weathered the credit crisis without state aid, but bad loans have picked up to 17 percent of all loans.

Hampartzoumian said that level was challenging but did not pose a significant risk for the banking system, as many of these loans were heavily collateralized.

“Potential losses during recovery of bad loans will be less than you would expect in more developed countries. It will be a relatively slow process, but recovery of value of these loans will be reasonable and will support the system,” he said.

Hampartzoumian said Bulbank would not be looking for any new acquisitions in the country, but said such could be expected as a result of mergers or acquisitions of banks in Greece.

Greek banks control over 20 percent of the banking system in Bulgaria, including UBB, controlled by National bank of Greece (NBGr.AT), Postbank, owned by Eurobank (EURBr.AT), Piraeus Bank (BOPr.AT) and a unit of Alpha bank (ACBr.AT).

“Probably there will be some mergers in Greece, some acquisitions, so that will also affect the ownership structure in Bulgaria too,” he said.","2013-09-25 13:05:30","1","21.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","48.0","37.0","0.0","107.0","0.0","6.0","0","506","97.94","63.15","11.63","43.80","25.30","29.05","77.67","41.70","4.15","2.37","0.00","0.79","0.20","1.19","0.20","1.78","7.51","18.38","6.52","2.17","4.35","0.59","12.85","4.94","2.37","0.40","4.55","4.35","3.36","2.17","1.19","0.20","0.20","0.20","5.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.19","9.49","0.40","2.57","2.17","1.98","0.59","2.37","2.77","0.40","2.17","0.20","0.20","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.87","0.99","3.56","5.53","0.40","1.19","4.35","4.74","3.36","14.43","2.17","7.91","4.55","8.30","0.00","0.00","7.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.98","4.94","6.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.79","1.98","0.99","2.77","0.20","2458","7.98","25.8","774","498","29","54.02","12.5","10.0","12.53","11.6","110","10.5","17.71534136546185","262","23.1","9","0.4","0","14","27","47","1","79","38","1","2","12","88","59","1","30","0","0","10","5","9","2","0","1","11","0","21","21","7","13","8","6","0","1","0","1"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eeurope-investment-bankingunion/europes-east-asks-do-we-have-a-place-in-banking-union-idUSBRE98P0JC20130926","Europe's east asks: do we have a place in banking union?","WARSAW (Reuters) - Eastern European countries outside the euro zone are worried they will not have a say in shaping the planned European banking union, and the result will be a new regulatory system skewed towards euro zone banks.

Debate about the banking union - which was conceived as a way to prevent a repeat of the EU’s sovereign debt crisis - has centered on European Union institutions and big euro zone economies such as Germany.

But bank executives and policymakers who spoke at a Reuters Eastern Europe Investment Summit this week said they had their own view on the future structure and were anxious for their voices to be heard.

“It makes sense within the euro zone, but I have doubts when it comes to countries outside the euro zone,” said Pavel Cejka, the chief operating officer of Komercni Banka, the Czech Republic’s third-biggest lender.

Some of the most weighty discussions about banking union are taking place within the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, from which most of eastern Europe is excluded.

The region has eight EU member states, including Europe’s sixth biggest economy in Poland. Only Slovenia and Slovakia, among the region’s smallest countries, are in the euro zone, and there is no prospect of any others joining soon.

The struggle to get a seat at the table is a worry for Zbigniew Jagiello, chief executive of Poland’s biggest lender, PKO BP.

Once the banking union is in place his bank, as one of the EU’s “systemically important” lenders, would come under the direct supervision of the ECB.

“We are not in the euro zone and that is good and bad,” Jagiello told the Reuters summit. “Regarding the banking union this is not good.

“We would like to participate in the process of creating the laws, creating procedures, but we cannot now participate in these decisions regarding the banking union because we are not euro zone (members),” he said.

MISGIVINGS

Many in Europe believe the continent badly needs a banking union to restore lending, regain confidence and boost growth. European Commissioner Olli Rehn said this week it was essential to maintain momentum.

The project has hit repeated obstacles because of the complexity of harmonizing different sets of banking regulations, and worries about giving up national sovereignty. Coalition jockeying after Germany’s election could cause further delays.

Eastern Europeans have many of the same misgivings as their counterparts in the euro zone, but there are also issues specific to their region.

Among those is the question of why countries in eastern Europe should be subjected to extra banking regulation when, in many cases, their own banks pursued conservative lending policies and avoided the bad debts of their peers elsewhere.

There are technical questions about how a single system of banking regulation can work in a country with its own currency and interest rates policy.

Another concern is that the banking union will involve fiscal funding for banks in trouble. Some in eastern Europe question the moral case for taxpayers having to bail out banks in countries that are substantially wealthier.

Gabor Orban, Secretary of State at Hungary’s Economy Ministry, said his country’s priority in banking union talks was to ensure a “fair” balance between rights and responsibilities. He said Hungary has not decided whether to be part of the union or to opt out.

Bulgarian Finance Minister Petar Chobanov said his country was building ad hoc alliances with other EU members not in the euro zone to try to help defend their interests.

“We have our position that up to now the banking union will be better for the countries that are part of the euro zone itself,” said Chobanov.

“But designing regulation, it is very important to see that ... the whole design of the system will fit also the needs of the countries that are outside the main instrument,” he told Reuters.","2013-09-26 11:58:15","1","26.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","43.0","36.0","0.0","94.0","0.0","6.0","0","647","92.52","66.19","20.58","33.78","23.96","27.98","81.61","45.44","7.11","3.40","0.15","0.93","0.00","0.93","1.39","3.71","8.96","14.68","7.73","2.94","4.95","1.24","12.98","4.02","2.47","1.24","0.93","2.16","4.17","2.32","1.85","1.08","0.00","0.00","7.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.93","7.88","1.24","1.39","0.93","1.70","0.46","2.78","2.47","0.31","2.01","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","11.90","3.71","1.08","5.41","0.93","1.39","2.94","7.73","1.24","13.76","0.46","10.97","2.32","6.96","0.00","0.00","7.57","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.76","4.48","4.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.62","2.32","1.39","0.62","0.00","3164","8.46","25.23076923076923","975","646","27","55.68","12.8","11.4","12.6","14.6","149","17.5","20.786006191950463","321","22.96","10","0.45","0","20","3","69","1","77","46","2","5","10","120","64","1","50","0","0","16","12","17","0","1","3","17","0","27","21","16","10","18","17","5","1","0","4"

Political and economic analysts speaking at the Reuters Euro Zone Summit said the decision last September by the European Central Bank to buy government bonds in unlimited amounts set a floor under one part of the crisis, but did nothing to prevent worsening social strife.

Rising popular unrest has been most immediately visible in the Italian election results, where voters overwhelmingly rejected the austerity programs supported by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti and advocated by the European Union.

Similar problems are brewing in Spain and Greece, where youth unemployment stands at 50 percent and people are facing a ‘lost generation’ of joblessness and frustration. Portugal, and to an extent Ireland, are in a similar fix. And there have been strikes and demonstrations from Belgium to Cyprus and France.

“If you look at unemployment in southern Europe, the situation is clearly not socially sustainable. The outlook for these countries is extremely bleak,” said Zsolt Darvas, a research fellow in international economics at Bruegel, a Brussels think-tank that provides input to EU policymaking.

“There’s a very high probability that if the economic situation doesn’t improve in a very strong and visible way, governments will fail and the catastrophe will come, they will leave the euro,” he said.

“They are in a spiral. The question is, when will it stop.”

Greece, where it took two elections last year before a government was formed that backed the austerity program imposed by the EU, is a particular concern. And Italy, which may have to follow Greece in holding a second poll if a government does not emerge, is an increasing threat.

“The major risk is that the political system breaks down, that’s still a major risk in Greece,” said Darvas.

“If the current government were to fall apart, it would be extremely difficult to keep Greece inside the euro. We see in Spain the social pressure is increasing. In Italy, financial markets will decide what happens, they will wait for what emerges, but something radical may have to be done.”

WILL IT GET BETTER?

There is a rising awareness among EU leaders and policymakers about the social dimension of the crisis, but it is only now, more than three years in, that steps are being taken to address the problem.

European labor ministers met in Brussels on Thursday to discuss steps needed to improve job training and employment and head off the threat that joblessness could destabilize the EU.

They agreed on a “youth guarantee scheme” focused on ensuring that young people under 25 receive either an offer of work, further education or work-related training at least four months after leaving education or becoming employed.

The scheme is part of a 6-billion-euro initiative to tackle youth unemployment in the worst-hit corners of Europe over the next decade, a plan that will be discussed in more detail at a meeting of EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on March 14-15.

But analysts are concerned the steps are too little, too late to heal unemployment which is set to scar the southern reaches of Europe for a generation to come.

Clemens Fuest, a research director in public finance at Oxford University and the incoming chief of Germany’s ZEW economic institute, said he saw the social dimensions of the crisis worsening rapidly, especially in Spain and Greece.

“I absolutely think it can get a lot worse. That is really the current plausible scenario for a break-up of the currency union,” he told the Reuters summit on Wednesday. “It may very well be that in these countries at some point the population will say ‘we don’t believe that things will get better’.”

The choice at that point would either be for the euro zone to attempt a large-scale program of redistribution to the south, which Fuest said he did not expect, “or the decision to leave the currency union, devalue and try another way”.

“I think the degree of desperation has to be high for people to take that risk. But if things continue, if unemployment goes up to 30 percent or something in Spain, there certainly is the danger that might happen.”","2013-02-28 16:33:25","1","25.0","0.0","6.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","44.0","36.0","0.0","101.0","0.0","6.0","0","760","92.57","56.80","39.95","9.56","24.52","24.61","82.37","47.63","6.45","1.71","0.26","0.26","0.13","0.53","0.53","4.74","10.53","13.55","8.68","3.55","4.87","0.79","13.95","4.08","2.37","1.18","2.11","2.11","4.61","1.58","2.89","1.18","0.39","0.53","5.66","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.66","9.08","1.84","0.26","1.71","3.16","1.05","3.29","1.97","0.92","1.05","0.00","0.39","0.26","0.13","0.00","0.00","10.79","1.71","1.84","4.34","1.18","2.76","2.89","9.47","2.37","16.32","2.24","9.74","4.21","6.32","0.00","0.13","2.76","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.13","0.00","14.87","3.95","5.26","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","1.18","2.89","1.05","0.26","0.13","3618","8.2","27.357142857142858","1130","751","31","55.37","13.6","11.5","12.13","14.3","160","15.5","20.2019707057257","387","24.43","15","0.45","0","31","14","89","1","91","59","3","4","18","129","72","0","36","0","0","19","1","26","1","0","1","23","0","40","19","16","14","16","26","7","2","0","4"

Washington and Brussels will begin talks towards a deal encompassing half the world’s economic output just a few months after the EU launches talks with Japan in March, EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht told the Reuters Euro Zone summit.

Benefits to the U.S. and EU economies, suffering from the aftermath of global financial crisis, could be tangible even before a deal is signed, while wrapping up talks by the end of 2014 was “not impossible” De Gucht said in Brussels.

“This is about the weight of the western, free world in world economic and political affairs,” said De Gucht, one of the EU’s most powerful commissioners who is negotiating trade deals with more than 80 countries on behalf of the EU’s 27 countries.

“Once we have started, failing is not an option. It would be very detrimental for both the European Union and the United States if we were not to succeed,” he said.

U.S. President Barack Obama endorsed talks this month and the EU’s leaders have also backed the plan, hoping a deal with Washington will help Europe pull out of its debt crisis.

At a time when the euro zone is in recession and the United States expects only modest growth this year, an EU-U.S. trade deal could add 0.5 percent a year to the EU economy and 0.4 percent to the U.S. economy by 2027.

De Gucht said the deal was so weighty that signs of progress, before completion of a deal, could have a positive economic effect. But the reverse was also true, he warned.

Following the collapse of global trade talks in 2008, both the United States and Europe have sought to tie up as many free-trade agreements as possible and this bilateral accord represent the pinnacle of those ambitions.

Such a deal was first discussed three decades ago and considered too difficult because of policies protecting the farm sector on both sides of the Atlantic.

De Gucht said agriculture would be part of the discussions. “We have chosen the path of a deep and comprehensive agreement,” he said, saying barriers for companies in areas ranging from data protection to regulation and government contracts could disappear.

De Gucht, a former Belgian foreign minister, said while there were no deadline, November 2014 represented a good target for a U.S. accord because his term as trade commissioner ends then and the United States holds midterm elections.

After that, six months could be lost, he said.

De Gucht also said the current value of the euro did not represent a problem for the EU’s exporters. “The euro is not at a forbidding level” for European trade, he said.

JAPAN, CANADA

Not content with an accord with the United States, the European Union will launch trade talks with Japan, the world’s third largest economy at the end of March in Tokyo, De Gucht said. But he said the going would be slower.

An EU-Japan accord would bring together two trading partners responsible for a third of global economic output and could create 400,000 jobs in Europe alone. But the complexity of the negotiations meant it could take several years to reach a deal.

“This is a negotiation that is going to take time. I don’t think you could do it in less than three years,” De Gucht said.

“With the United States, we have to crack a number of very hard nuts, but we at least we know them. In Japan, it’s very much about internally changing a mentality,” he said.

France and Italy have been worried about the impact of foreign imports from Japan on their auto industries when they are already suffering from the impact of the euro zone debt crisis and falling sales across the continent.

But De Gucht said that by the time a pact was signed, European automakers should have had more than enough time to adapt with a sustainable new business model.

“It’s so far away it cannot be an excuse not to restructure our car sector,” De Gucht said. “There is no reason at all to use (Japan trade talks) as a scapegoat.”

Canada is another of the EU’s prizes if Brussels can wrap up a deal, which would be the European Union’s first with a major world economy. Talks started in 2009 but De Gucht walked away from signing an agreement at the latest round of negotiations in Ottawa that were meant to wrap things up.

Negotiations are held up over contentious issues including agricultural exports, intellectual property and the ability being to bid for government contracts.

“We do not have an agreement and I’m not pleased with what is on the table now,” De Gucht said. “They have a very sensitive offensive interest, which is agriculture. I think we can make a deal on that. But the reward for that on the European side also has to be very clear,” he said, urging Ottawa to open up more.

Speaking days after the French government acknowledged it would talk to EU officials in Brussels about pushing back its deficit-cutting timetable, Schaeuble signaled that Berlin could live with such a delay.

But he also issued a cautionary message to France that deficit reduction and structural reform must remain a top priority.

“France and Germany have a special responsibility. Together they form a strong core in Europe,” Schaeuble told Reuters.

“Ten years ago, governments in France and Germany played a decisive role in weakening the Stability and Growth Pact. This can’t happen again under any circumstances. I have full confidence that France will meet its obligations.”

Schaeuble was referring to a loosening of the pact under former French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The German government now says the move helped contribute to the euro zone crisis by signaling to other member states that it was fine to break the rules.

Schaeuble, a francophile who grew up near the Black Forest along the French border, rejected the suggestion that Germany may soft-pedal on closer euro zone integration as the crisis eases and a German election looms.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande have said they will present joint proposals on moving towards a so-called “fiscal union” in May, a month before a summit of EU leaders.

“Germany wants to move forward with France wherever it’s possible,” Schaeuble said.

“As far as our plans for May go, the main question is how we can strengthen European decision-making and boost growth on a sustainable basis through structural reforms.”

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-its-like-to-be-gay-i_b_4510918.html","What It's Like to be Gay In the State of Duck Dynasty (Hint: It's Very, Very Bad)","Conservative, religious white people scare me. I live in a constant state of fear.

I'm a law school student in Louisiana. Why? It's cheap. It's also where I grew up and where my family has lived for the past two centuries. The state is full of history, culture, food and nature. For the five years before I moved back to Louisiana in 2012, I had studied for a master's degree in London and worked for a civil rights advocacy group in New York City. I love the city, but I thought it would be good to come down from the ivory tower for a while.

When I left New York, I was empowered and inspired. I really thought change here in Louisiana was possible and should come from within. Being away from the state for five years, however, had softened my perspective.

But it's hard to ignore bigotry in your own backyard. So here I am, halfway through law school, stuck in the state of Duck Dynasty.

I'm absorbing the reaction to Phil Robertson's racist, homophobic rants, and I'm worried. America, you seem to be writing him off as just another racist, homophobic redneck. Maybe for those of us who are living or have lived on the coasts, it's easier to write off bigots as holdovers from days long past than to consider that they are very much products of the present. I'm here to tell you that the rise of gay marriage does not mean the decline of gay hate.

Phil is not just some redneck who got rich and made it on television. He's the rule here in Louisiana, not the exception.

Phil Robertson and like-minded conservative whites believe gays like me are ""full of murder, envy, strife, hatred. They are insolent, arrogant, God-haters. They are heartless, they are faithless, they are senseless, they are ruthless.""

In truth, we gay Louisianans are full of fear.

Imagine living day-to-day among people who think you are a murderous, hateful, ruthless villain. Now, imagine that life in a state with firearms in every other home, the highest rate of homicide using those firearms, and virtually no gun laws. All those guns are owned by people who got upset when they learned the state is only in the top quarter of all states when ranked by levels of alcohol consumption. Needless to say, Louisiana is a pressure cooker. Just speaking out about gay rights in Louisiana makes one a target for hate crimes. The mix of guns, hate and alcohol all but guarantee a tragic outcome.

It's not just the bigoted public we fear down here. It's the government too.

Imagine living in what you thought was a relatively modern city, except in 2012, the sheriff's office operated undercover sting operations in public parks to enforce a gay sex ban long-ago struck down by the United States Supreme Court.

What follows is not a bad movie pitch. Sadly, it happened more than a dozen times from 2011 to 2013 in East Baton Rouge Parish, home to Louisiana's capital, two major universities, and the law school I attend.

An undercover male deputy stakes out a public park at 10 a.m. An old man pulls in and they start talking, then carry the conversation to a picnic table at the park. The undercover cop suggests the two go back to his place for ""some drinks and some fun,"" and the old man agrees. The two never discuss or exchange money. It's the same scenario that plays out at bars in every college town in America. But here, when the old man gets to the apartment with the undercover cop, he's welcomed with handcuffs for a single count of attempted crime against nature.

In the state of Duck Dynasty, it is illegal to engage in ""unnatural carnal copulation by a human being with another of the same sex or opposite sex."" Here, sheriffs say they are ""charged with enforcing the laws passed by our Louisiana Legislature,"" even if those laws are unconstitutional in the United States of America. If you want to have gay sex without the fear of being arrested, you should probably head north to Arkansas.

The dozen men who were arrested in East Baton Rouge Parish were never prosecuted, because the District Attorney's office could find no real crimes the men committed. But according to the District Attorney himself, ""The Sheriff's Office's intentions are all good."" Never mind that when the Supreme Court struck down anti-sodomy laws in 2003, one of its concerns was that arresting gay people for their sexual conduct was ""state-sponsored condemnation,"" and that in the United States, government cannot ""demean [gays'] existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.""

Maybe John Edwards is right. Maybe there are two Americas. In one of them, simply living as a gay man is illegal; in much of the other, I can marry another man. My plea is that we not simply write off Phil Robertson as a backward redneck. What's much harder but necessary is working to coax the state of Duck Dynasty back into the United States.

It's scary in here, but for now, I put on my brave face, because they can smell fear. If I stand really still, don't open my mouth, and am wearing some butch clothes, they may not even know I'm gay. I hope to see the day when they won't care. Help me get us there.

On second thought, maybe I should have gone to law school at the University of Michigan after all.","2013-12-28 13:44:43","1","21.0","4.0","0.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","122.0","87.0","0.0","168.0","0.0","55.0","17","932","81.52","53.00","50.92","11.78","16.35","18.24","81.33","50.11","10.84","6.76","3.11","0.64","0.75","0.54","1.72","4.08","7.94","15.13","7.83","5.58","5.04","1.72","14.38","4.51","1.72","1.82","2.25","2.15","4.94","1.93","3.00","1.07","1.18","0.21","7.83","0.32","0.00","0.00","1.39","10.41","1.82","1.39","1.07","2.25","1.50","3.65","0.86","0.21","0.32","0.21","4.18","0.54","1.29","1.82","0.64","5.58","1.61","0.43","3.00","0.64","0.11","3.00","9.55","0.54","14.16","1.61","8.80","4.29","3.22","1.07","0.54","0.43","0.32","0.21","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.03","6.12","6.44","0.00","0.11","0.11","0.00","0.75","1.50","2.79","0.00","0.21","4097","7.13","17.107142857142858","1262","925","55","71.34","10.3","7.5","9.39","8.9","156","6.642857142857143","15.465945945945947","443","15.77","21","0.49","0","27","16","93","0","118","77","1","1","8","149","68","5","44","1","0","64","11","54","1","0","10","23","0","26","29","17","21","43","31","2","8","0","9"

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced Thursday that the groups can apply for the funding made available through a supplemental social services block grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Gwen O'Shea, chief executive of the Health & Welfare Council of Long Island, said representatives of dozens of voluntary health and human services agencies are meeting Friday in Bethpage partly to discuss applying for the funds. Many, she said, went through their funding in the immediate aftermath of Sandy, but continue to provide services.

""They need the money,"" she said. ""The challenge is that this is a long-term issue. It's a marathon, not a sprint.""

Long Island, she said, was hard-hit by the storm and ""we want to make sure appropriate dollars go to Long Island agencies.""

Applicants can apply for funding to cover:

Unreimbursed costs of building repairs, rebuilding and renovation for child-care providers, health and mental hygiene facilities, senior centers and other health and human services facilities.

Reimbursement for child care, health, mental health, behavioral health, employment, senior-focused and costs of lost and damaged materials.

Reimbursement to food banks and food pantries.

Enhanced child care, food/nutrition, health, mental health, behavioral health, employment, legal, senior-focused, volunteer coordination, and case management for ongoing needs of Sandy-impacted residents.

Equipment and supplies needed to deliver services in Sandy-impacted areas.

""These organizations serve the needs of many of the state's most vulnerable residents,"" Cuomo said in a prepared statement. ""This funding will provide the support they need to continue helping their communities.""

So now that Smokin"" Hot Fest 2013 has died down somewhat, I figured I'd deliver on my promise to talk a little bit more about the theological root of the demeaning, misogynistic evangelical fruit that I surveyed in the first post on the topic.

It's time, you guys. Time to talk about complementarianism.

Now, I know that the uninitiated will find that word cumbersome and confusing. Does this have something to do with complimenting people? Like, ""Nice job!""-ism? Worse, does it have something to do with that particular compliment that some evangelical bros are wont to tweet and sermonize about, the smokin' hot compliment?

Well, yes and no.

Really, complementarianism describes a biblically derived complementary view of gender roles in marriage, home and church. That is, each gender -- male and female -- is different from the other, with different roles to play in these particular spheres of life; but each role is not ""better or worse"" than the other. Instead, each role complements the other! It's all good, homeboys and homegirls (so long as both the homeboy and homegirl in question each stay within their particularly defined roles). Yet, as these roles are unpacked it becomes clear that there is not just gender diversity but gender hierarchy at work. Men are uniquely called to take the ""highest"" leadership positions in both the home (head) and church (elder/pastor), and women are called to other ""lower"" tasks that generally imply submission to male leadership.

The Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood are the current Christendom guardians of the complementarian worldview (in North America at least) and they sum it up rather nicely in these first points of their audacious-sounding ""Danvers Statement"":

We have been moved in our purpose by the following contemporary developments which we observe with deep concern: 1. The widespread uncertainty and confusion in our culture regarding the complementary differences between masculinity and femininity; 2. the tragic effects of this confusion in unraveling the fabric of marriage woven by God out of the beautiful and diverse strands of manhood and womanhood; 3. the increasing promotion given to feminist egalitarianism with accompanying distortions or neglect of the glad harmony portrayed in Scripture between the loving, humble leadership of redeemed husbands and the intelligent, willing support of that leadership by redeemed wives...

Etc.

Before one can even scratch down to the content, there is something striking right here on the surface: antagonism. While complementarians are generally self-consciously biblical in their argumentation -- beginning with creation in Genesis and plodding their way through the propositions of Paul -- this opening statement deals with a decidedly cultural battle. It is antagonism toward the ""contemporary developments"" of ""feminist egalitarianism,"" etc., that has moved the men of Danvers to make a statement. And that's why it has become my conviction that the complementarian worldview, as it currently stands, is far more political than theological.

That said, I used to be a complementarian. My complementarianism even blossomed in half-hearted public ""hot wife"" talk in order to be one of the guys. It was part of the young, cool conservative evangelical package, and I was playing my ""gender role.""

As such, I've seen a spectrum within the complementarian school of thought. There's some nuance here. So without further ado, I want to introduce you to three complementarians, who differ in their particular perspective and delivery. Like the ""three men"" represented above, they all hold onto a strongly defined maleness, with much proverbial hair on their proverbial chests (though one of them is a little bit more like Steve Guttenberg).

1. The Conservative Complementarian (or, the Selleck)

This guy was one of the Danvers men, and he stands for everything conservative and culturally/politically antagonistic about the complementarian position. For him, the goal is to produce statements, white papers and apologetics against the evils of feminism, egalitarianism and ""gender/women's studies."" The Bible's black and whiteness on this issue is beyond dispute for this khaki-and-polo wearing stud, and while he may not tweet about his smokin' hot wife, he will intentionally suppress her both at home and in the church. (His wife will be inculturated enough to believe that she wants this kind of demeaning submission and stifling restriction.) And, when men in his church emotionally and physically abuse their wives, he'll discourage law enforcement/court involvement/professional counseling, and simply ""bring it to the elders"" (see here and here).

2. The Cool Complementarian (or, the Danson)

This guy LOVES tweeting about his smokin' hot wife. Because he's clear about what men and women are and do in their very different roles, he knows that women like to look hot and to have their husbands tell 8,000 Internet followers they look hot every freaking date night. And he knows that his wife's ""nagging"" at home is a problem and she needs to learn to submit and respect him. In fact, it's also getting to be a problem that she isn't ""available and awesome"" enough for him in the bedroom. But no worries, a Song of Solomon podcast and a few more ""hot"" tweets should fix all that!

3. The Common-Sense Complementarian (or, the Guttenberg)

This guy is the redeeming quality of the complementarian worldview. I know this guy, and I respect this guy. He is theoretically on board with complementarian gender roles in marriage, home and church. But he is highly critical and super suspect of both the conservative and the cool complementarians. He makes no bones about the fact that his complementarianism is completely different from Mark Driscoll's -- because the stuff that dude says is CRAZY. His chastened, common-sense approach is theologically conservative/traditional but practically careful to affirm a baseline equality (he'll even use the word ""egalitarian""). He respects his wife, and all women, and treats them as equals even if he can't offer them an elder position or Sunday morning sermon slot (he'll find every way around that, though, to empower women in the church). In the end, his actions don't create suppression or misogyny, per se; but he is yet connected to an overall theology that often does.

Now that we got our three men out of the way, let's talk about the baby.

OK, this is precisely where that metaphor breaks down. Forget the baby.

Instead, I want to briefly introduce the mutualist, the one who stands as a counterpoint to all this complementarian manliness. Mutualism may not have a Christendom guardian organization, nor even a theological Wikipedia page, but it is one way of identifying a growing Christian (and evangelical) perspective that makes a strong objection to the demeaning, misogynistic culture that complementarianism often creates. And the mutualist is self-consciously biblical, just like the complementarian claims to be.

The baseline belief is that the narrative trajectory of Scripture, both Old to New Testaments, summed up in Jesus and his gospel, speaks loudest of gender mutuality, not complementarity/hierarchy.

The examples of high female leadership in the narrative (from Deborah to Mary to Junia) are buoyed up by a much bigger theme: the oneness-equality of the genders in creation and new creation. We are all created in the image and likeness of God equally (male and female), all children of the creator-God equally. While sin and brokenness tamper with this unity (Genesis 3), the new creation in Christ super-affirms it:

So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise (Galatians 3).

Further, this oneness results in a mutuality within the body of Christ as all submit to Jesus as Head and then to each other as equal members: ""Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ"" (Ephesians 5).

The mutualist believes that this gospel oneness manifesting in mutual submission to Jesus and each other, equally among both genders, is the guiding principle for all other questions regarding roles and callings. She is saying to her complementarian brothers that the monolithic categories of difference between gender roles for which they are arguing have been effectively wiped out by Jesus and his redeeming work of new creation. Now, everyone is free to be exactly who they are, as human beings, in Christ, as gifted members of the body of Christ, together!

Because mutualism is a basline biblical/gospel category, it embraces the beauty of egalitarianism and feminism. And in affirming all people being exactly who they are as human beings in Christ, it is also inclusive of differences in gender roles and callings as they are simply lived out and expressed. It even affirms complementarity, while denying hierarchy! The kind of ""headship"" in marriage, for instance, that Paul goes on to propositionally describe in Ephesians 5 is not regarded as a ""bad authority thing"" but rather a description of a husband's gifting in an already mutually submitted marriage (verse 21 comes before verse 22). Yet, the manifestation of this ""headship"" is not monolithic, nor are the particulars set in stone, for it is subject, again, to the narrative of new creation and gospel that resoundingly shouts out the mutuality of our oneness-equality in Christ.

The mutualist reminds us that her view is grounded in Scripture, so much so that it is not mainly a political or cultural signifier, as the statement of the Danvers men seems to be. She is painting a picture that is fundamentally non-antagonistic. She's saying, ""Deborah happened! Mary is a thing! And Paul wasn't embarrassed that the Holy Spirit made Junia an authoritative apostle, leading men, just as he wasn't ashamed that the Holy Spirit fell on the Gentiles!"" The hierarchy of gender roles has been wiped out, not by cultural feminism, but by God, and even the trajectory of Paul's letters flies unmistakably in the direction of full and equal leadership in the church among genders. She says with Scot McKnight: ""I don't think the traditional complementarian view is biblical. I think it's anti-biblical.""

But there's something else about the mutualist that everyone should know. As biblically rooted as she is, she has also generally been hurt by that same Bible in the past. She is familiar with the existential reality of pain inflicted by the unrighteous wielding of the Word, especially upon women and children. She's seen the abuse. She's seen the misogyny. She's been suppressed and demeaned.

And the Jesus she knows -- existentially, experientially -- simply cannot be OK with what she's seen.

The gospel simply has to be better news than all of that mess.

And you know what?

She's right.

So, what do you think? Are you one of the three complementarians, or are you a mutualist? Or have I missed your ""type""?

When Arianna co-founded the Huffington Post back in May 2005, our community was born. The HuffPost community isn't something we've tacked on as an option; it's a core characteristic of who we are and what we do.

Our community members have always been candid and unafraid to share their opinions:

""With all due respect to the other commenters, here's an actual comment on the story in question..."" One of the first comments posted on the Huffington Post

Right from the beginning, the conversations inspired by HuffPost stories were intense and informed. College kids mixed it up with parents and political pundits and discussed everything from the issues to what was going in and out of fashion. We handle over 250 thousand comments on a slow news day. Those numbers soar when events around the world heat up. It's not unusual for an important news story to get 20 or 30 thousand comments. Our story about Mitt Romney 47 percent video attracted over 23 thousand people engaged in a conversation with over 171 thousand comments - as a small town, like Augusta, Maine or Los Gatos, California, had jumped online and engaged in an all-inclusive town hall meeting.

Processing comments at this Olympian scale requires some pretty nifty technology and talented people. We do it all with a staff of 40 moderators: 39 human and 1 machine. We're proud of our human moderators, who work hard to keep the conversation civil and spam free. But with over 200 thousand comments piling up every day we need help from our homegrown JuLiA, a collection of machine learning algorithms and distributed data processing systems that pre-moderate every comment. JuLiA enables her human co-workers to focus on the ambiguous cases while she filters out abuse. JuLiA is smart but the human touch is required to keep a community from feeling sterile.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-reasons-why-obamas-clim_b_3491481.html","5 Reasons Why Obama's Climate Change Moment Mustn't Be Missed","President Barack Obama must go big on climate change this Tuesday primarily because there will hardly be a better political moment available to him. If President Obama uses his speech to go soft -- with meager caps on carbon emissions, weak investments in renewable energy, and an uncourageous picking of low-hanging fruit on energy efficiency -- he will have missed his moment. Think of all things that have happened this year that set the stage for an all-in announcement on global warming.

First, we breached the 400 parts per million of carbon concentration in the atmosphere, a dangerous precedent in the slippery slope towards a carbon-consumed climate. This news comes despite President Obama's continued claim that we're making progress on reducing carbon emissions in the atmosphere. We're not. The only good news here is that the Obama Administration raised the social cost of carbon, which estimates the cost of pollution to society, to $38 per ton from $23 per ton.

Second, we witnessed the hottest dozen years in recorded history occur within the last decade and a half, with 2012 ranked as the hottest ever in human history. Hundreds of cities all across America are witnessing record-breaking heat waves, recording temperatures never seen before in their city's recorded history. Backing up these trends, Science Magazine reported that the earth is warming much faster than we thought.

Third, the Nation Climate Assessment, the 13 inter-agency government body making up the United States Global Change Research Program, reported that a 10-degree rise in Fahrenheit was plausible if warming trends weren't radically reversed. To put this in perspective, a 2-3 degree rise is considered undesirable but adaptable while a 4-7 degree rise is considered completely unsustainable. So with 10 degrees, forget about it, we're done.

Fourth, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) raised the level of risk associated with global warming to a ""high risk"" situation, on par with how it ranks Pentagon-related security risks. The GAO report, furthermore, noted that the government is completely ill equipped to deal with the financial implications from climate change disasters, citing $80 billion in funds owed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the US Treasury in less than 10 years of disaster response. And that doesn't even include the tens of billions from Hurricane Sandy.

Fifth, and most recently, the National Research Council came out this month swinging for a carbon tax, suggesting that it was the only government tool effective enough to save society from rising carbon emissions and the concomitant climate change. The NRC studied the efficacy, or lack thereof, of tax credits, noting that the only tax credits that made a real difference in carbon reduction were the production (PTC) and investment (ITC) tax credits. The PTC and the ITC were the only tax credits making any kind of dent, albeit only 0.3 percent reduction in carbon emissions, by helping public and private sectors switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

President Obama, in sum, has ample weather data and his own government agencies on his side here, ready to back him up for a big plan to cut carbon emissions. Whether or not he takes this opportunity to be a foresighted leader who is ready to protect the environment for generations to come is still unclear since Obama has done little to date to do so. This is his time and could be his legacy, and he certainly needs one in light of recent disappointments on the National Security Agency (NSA) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) fronts.

Unlike those problems, however, which can be remedied more quickly with some serious government reform, a failure to fix global warming now sets the stage for inevitable irreversibility. NSA email safety issues and IRS 501c3 statuses will be minor, unmemorable issues at that point because the safety and the status of our society will be in critical jeopardy.

That is the reality that faces President Obama amidst Tuesday's climate speech. This is no time for a small pitch on power plant carbon parameters. We need something big if we are to survive at all. Now let's hope he understands that and does something real to address it.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alison-lundergan-grimes-abortion-positions_n_3698539.html","Alison Lundergan Grimes Talks Abortion As She Unfurls Policy Positions","PADUCAH, Ky. -– Sitting at a mahogany table on her new campaign bus, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes used her first substantive interview on issues to toss a nasty jab at her foe, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, and to begin unveiling her own positions in the high-profile Kentucky Senate race.

With an icy smile, the 34-year-old Grimes scoffed at the notion that she was philosophically or politically close to President Barack Obama, who is so unpopular here that he is mentioned by Kentucky Democrats fewer times than Voldemort ever was at Hogwarts.

“The president and I disagree on a lot of things,” she said. “Sen. McConnell will use the same tactics that the GOP has used in other red states, and try to claim that I was a cheerleader for President Obama.

“Well, I am as much a cheerleader for President Obama as Sen. McConnell is a Chippendale dancer.”

It was funny -– and definitely not nice. Even the thought of the doughy, 71-year-old McConnell in a dancer’s outfit might be enough to cost him a sixth term.

In a wide-ranging, half-hour interview, Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state and presumptive Democratic Senate nominee for 2014, told me that she was pro-choice down the line on abortion, and that she would delay the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that small businesses provide medical coverage to their employees.

The two statements were her first substantive comments on policy matters. Until now she has spent most of her time attacking McConnell as the embodiment of all that is corrupt and unproductive about Washington.

The interview took place on the eve of the 133rd annual Fancy Farm Picnic, a church-sponsored day of politicking and speechifying on a rural expanse in the far-western Purchase region of Kentucky.

Grimes is one of five daughters in a devout Catholic family in Lexington. “I am a practicing Catholic,” she told me. “But I’m also for separation of church and state. I am supportive of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. And I think that this is the kind of choice that has to be up to the woman, her God and her doctor.”

On the Affordable Care Act -– Obama’s signature legislative measure -– Grimes was cautiously critical. “I am troubled by some of the provisions,” she said, and for the first time said exactly which one.

“There are 700,000 businesses in Kentucky and I am concerned that especially the smaller ones are overburdened,” she said.

Her suggestion: delay the imposition of the coverage mandate on small business, as the president already has done for larger corporations.

“The mandate will not work for many small businesses in Kentucky,” she said, “so I believe that a delay is the right course so that changes can be made.”

She also blasted McConnell for wanting to abandon the law altogether, pointing out that the state’s health ratings are among the worst in the nation, and that other provisions in the law will extend coverage to an estimated 600,000 more Kentuckians.

“Unlike Sen. McConnell, I don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water,” she said. Of course McConnell is being blasted by tea party conservatives for his refusal -– so far -– to sign a letter that would force the issue by tying the next budget and debt-ceiling bills to the “defunding” of the ACA.

“He has a tightrope to walk,” Grimes observed, not sympathetically.

Her opening gambits on the issues are revealing for what they show about her beliefs and the strategy -- disagree with Washington Democratic orthodoxy when she can; hew to it when it is useful.

A pure pro-choice view is a must in the Democratic Party, if for no other reason than so many women activists are motivated to vote for –- and work for -– the party because of their strong belief in that view.

Grimes clearly wants to tap the fast-growing power of women in the Democratic Party, a phenomenon with a surprisingly long history in Kentucky politics.

She stressed the female mentors in her life -– a teacher who taught her rhetoric, her mother and grandmothers, her four sisters. She proudly stated that she is the “youngest female secretary of state in the nation.”

It sounded like a rather obscure claim when she made it at the Marshall County Bean Supper in nearby Kentucky Lakes on Friday night.

But it drew a big round of applause -– even bigger than the one Marshall County Judge/Executive Mike Miller got when he auctioned off a donated “whole hog” for $350.

Her speech was primarily sound-bitten attacks on McConnell. It was well received, if only because Democratic loyalists deeply despise McConnell.

But to win -– she is in a dead-heat in some recent polls –- she will have to come of age on the fly in the midst of a grueling, 15-month race from here to November 2014.

Nobody really knows who she is or what she really stands for, but she began the process of saying so Friday night.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alison-lundergan-grimes-ad_n_4169609.html","Alison Lundergan Grimes Goes Hard Against Mitch McConnell With Burning Building Web Ad","Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D) released a new web ad Monday in her race for U.S. Senate that compares the job of her opponent, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), to lighting a house on fire and then claiming credit for putting it out.

""He calls himself a 'proud guardian of gridlock,'"" says a male narrator, over an image of a burning house. ""He's blocked the Senate over 400 times. Then voted to shut down the government, hurting Kentucky's economy.""

The ad continues, ""Mitch McConnell can't light the house on fire and then claim credit for putting it out -- especially while it's still burning.""

The video rejects McConnell's contention that he deserves credit for ending the government shutdown earlier this month in a bipartisan deal. ""I’ve demonstrated, once again, that when the Congress is in gridlock and the country is at risk, I’m the guy who steps forward and tries to get us out of the ditch,"" McConnell told the National Review after the shutdown.

Although the ad is only running online, it marks a significant escalation of rhetoric by the Grimes campaign. Her 2011 campaign for Secretary of State, by contrast, featured the candidate posing with her grandmothers.

The McConnell campaign responded to the video in a statement. ""For days on end Alison Lundergan Grimes criticized Senator McConnell for fighting to delay Obamacare during the shutdown talks and now she has embraced his view when it becomes politically convenient. She reversed course only after her Democrat bosses in Washington told her to,"" said press secretary Allison Moore. ""If you need a glimpse into the kind of partisan follower Alison Lundergan Grimes would be in the Senate it doesn't get clearer than this.""","2013-10-28 09:21:16","1","12.0","2.0","0.0","4.0","16.0","0.0","116.0","91.0","0.0","229.0","0.0","58.0","19","286","95.89","78.95","12.12","20.48","22.00","27.97","75.52","46.15","10.14","5.94","0.70","0.35","0.35","4.55","0.00","4.20","10.84","15.38","4.20","2.80","4.55","0.70","8.39","3.15","1.75","1.05","1.05","0.00","3.15","1.40","1.75","0.35","0.70","0.70","10.14","0.35","0.70","3.15","2.45","3.85","0.70","0.35","1.05","0.70","0.35","1.40","4.55","1.75","0.70","2.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.09","0.35","1.05","6.64","0.70","0.70","1.75","6.99","1.05","16.78","1.75","7.34","8.39","5.94","1.05","1.05","1.40","0.00","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.63","5.59","4.90","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.05","4.20","3.50","1.40","0.00","1391","8.45","22.76923076923077","425","286","15","60.55","11.9","9.6","12.3","12.1","70","5.785714285714286","19.43020979020979","176","21.23","6","0.47","0","5","2","33","0","43","12","1","0","2","51","45","0","6","0","0","16","7","13","1","0","2","6","0","6","11","9","2","3","16","1","1","0","2"

The Kentucky secretary of state released a memo to The Huffington Post Wednesday outlining how her campaign could prevail in the 2014 election, citing polling results, the lack of a significant primary challenge on the Democratic side and the minority leader's high negative ratings. McConnell faces a Republican primary foe in tea party-aligned businessman Matt Bevin, who has been endorsed by the Senate Conservatives Fund. That group has already launched a six-figure ad buy against McConnell.

""As the most unpopular Senator in the country, McConnell’s costly primary battle and skyrocketing in-state disapproval rating greatly weaken his chances in this race,"" wrote Grimes adviser Jonathan Hurst. ""Kentucky's political landscape and Alison's strong candidacy, overwhelming support and lack of a major primary challenger all position her to win next November.""

The polling shows a close race. The Huffington Post Pollster average gives Grimes a two-point edge over McConnell, 45 percent to 43 percent. However, much of the polling thus far has been conducted by Democratic-leaning firms. The Cook Political Report rates the contest as a ""toss-up.""

Grimes beat McConnell in her first quarter of fundraising as a candidate, although McConnell has a far larger war chest, with $10 million in cash on hand.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alison-lundergan-grimes-suv_n_3991593.html","New Video Of Alison Lundergan Grimes Will Likely Kill Her Senate Chances, Depending On How Dumb Everyone Wants To Be","In previous dispatches on the Kentucky Senate race, I've noted that the many achievements of GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell's supporters include things like reading a book that Ashley Judd wrote, and noticing that Democratic contender Alison Lundergan Grimes' last name rhymes with stuff, and talking loud enough for the country's most hapless super PAC to overhear them at a closed door meeting. Chris Cillizza says the ""most important thing"" we've learned about McConnell's campaign is that they have a ""lack of good opposition research on Grimes."" But they do manage to spell Mitch McConnell's name right most of the time, so they have that going for them.

Well, that's all about to change. Apparently Kentucky College Republicans have shot a SHOCK VIDEO OMGZ of Grimes that had McConnell allies straight up jumping OFF. Buzzfeed's Andrew Kaczynski drolly notes: ""Allies of her opponent, Mitch McConnell, who sent the video to a BuzzFeed reporter were very excited about it."" Go read Kaczynski's piece and see for yourself. See how it excites you.

Wow, right? This video of Grimes being picked up by her husband at the airport is definitely a game-changer. Now, we just have to figure out why that is. Is it strange to be picked up at the airport by somebody? No. Only unloveable people don't have someone who will come get them at the airport. Is it the fact that she's riding around in a gas-guzzling SUV? No, this is Kentucky, and Grimes isn't really thought of as an environmentalist anyway. So what is it? The summary provided on the YouTube clip provides a clue:

Apparently Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky's Secretary of State who is less than half way through her first term in her first public office, thinks she's so important that she needs to ride around town in the back seat of a black suburban...driven by personal chauffeur, her husband.

Oh, okay. This is apparently because Grimes got in the back seat of the SUV, instead of the passenger seat. Admittedly, that's a bit outside the norm. And I gather that the lesson we are supposed to extract is that Grimes is some sort of fancy-pants elitist person.

Ahh, you know what? Team McConnell really needs this one, so I'll say, ""Nailed her!"" Check your privilege, woman with a husband who loves her!

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/allen-west-susan-rice_n_3395811.html","Allen West: Obama Giving The 'Finger' To American People By Promoting Susan Rice","Calling the move ""inept, incompetent and absolutely arrogant,"" former Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) accused President Barack Obama on Wednesday of having flipped ""a certain finger in the face of the American people"" with his decision to name former U.N. ambassador Susan Rice as his new national security adviser.

In an interview on Fox News, West suggested that Obama was a ""petty, personal type of person and not a professional"" for promoting Rice, despite Republicans' outspoken criticism of her media appearances in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, last Sept. 11.

""I think that when you question someone that clearly misled and lied to the American people, that's not being petty,"" West said. ""That's asking for this government, which was supposed to be the most transparent in the history of this country, to indeed be transparent and to be honest and truthful with the American people.""

Rice has claimed she was relying on talking points crafted by the administration and the CIA, which inaccurately suggested that the Benghazi attack was a spontaneous act sparked by an anti-Islam YouTube video. But many Republicans have not been willing to let Rice off the hook, continuing to accuse her of deliberately mischaracterizing the nature of the siege, which left four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, dead.

West had led the charge on Rice during his time in Congress, taking to Fox News less than a week after the attack to describe her as ""asinine, naive, inept, incompetent and borderline ignorant.""

Despite the apparent Republican outrage, no Senate confirmation is needed for Rice's elevation. On Wednesday, Obama announced that she would be replacing outgoing National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, calling her a ""fierce champion for justice and human decency.""

While West is no longer in Congress, the inflammatory nature of his criticism of the administration has remained consistent from his perch outside Washington. On Wednesday, his political action committee sent out a fundraising email suggesting that Attorney General Eric Holder was a bigger threat to the nation than Al Qaeda.","2013-06-06 09:35:50","1","13.0","1.0","0.0","3.0","16.0","0.0","118.0","91.0","0.0","227.0","0.0","59.0","19","342","95.66","74.95","10.43","3.47","22.80","29.24","77.19","44.74","8.48","4.39","0.29","0.00","0.58","3.51","0.00","4.09","9.06","15.79","6.43","1.17","3.80","1.46","10.23","6.73","3.22","1.17","0.58","0.88","7.02","2.05","4.39","0.58","2.92","0.00","10.23","0.00","0.00","1.75","1.75","7.31","0.88","0.58","0.58","1.46","1.75","2.34","1.17","0.58","0.29","0.29","2.63","0.88","0.29","0.00","1.46","7.02","0.00","1.17","5.56","0.88","0.88","4.68","4.09","0.00","14.04","1.46","8.48","4.09","4.09","0.58","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.29","1.17","0.00","0.58","0.58","0.00","0.00","19.01","5.26","7.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.58","4.09","1.17","0.58","0.00","1735","9.32","28.833333333333332","559","339","15","48.54","14.8","12.1","14.05","15.1","98","7.083333333333334","22.603421828908555","212","25.92","7","0.42","0","9","2","35","0","49","33","2","0","1","51","58","3","7","0","0","5","9","8","1","1","1","10","0","8","15","15","9","4","4","5","0","0","1"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americas-gun-debate-debacle_b_2728983.html","America's Gun Debate: A Misguided Debacle","I was recently skimming through my Facebook newsfeed when I happened upon a debate between two friends. The pair were arguing over gun control, and I couldn't resist giving it a read. My friends were at opposite ends of the spectrum, with one being the proud conservative and the other a devout liberal on the matter.

As they argued back and forth through the string of comments, I couldn't help but notice one thing: they were both so misguided and uninformed. It was when the gun rights advocate said, ""Why is it called an assault rifle? A rifle can't assault anyone,"" that I realized the argument was becoming ridiculous. He thought his argument as cunning and clever, but the reality is it's cliche and pointless. If the gun control debate in America has been diminished to arguing over the semantics of the term ""assault rifle,"" we are all in a lot of trouble.

There's no doubt there is a gun violence epidemic in the United States, but the issue is being tackled from the entirely wrong direction. America is a nation built on firearm ownership, and anyone who thinks that is going to change any time soon needs to return to reality. Each time we have a major shooting incident, the cries for the elimination of guns becomes louder and louder, but that is just never going to happen. We, as a nation, desperately need a new approach.

I have a lemon tree in my back yard. As the lemons bloom, the fruit attracts hornets, and I am constantly plucking the lemons to rid myself of the pests. Just as fast as I pick the lemons, however, new ones arrive in their place. Rather than picking the lemons, I have to remove the tree if I want to eliminate the hornets. As far as gun violence is concerned, we need to stop looking at the guns and start looking for the root causes - we need to eliminate the tree.

Gun violence can be broken down into two main groups: the result of criminal activity and the result of mental disorder. Gun violence related to criminal activity is that which is the result of drug or gang activity, robberies, home invasions, and so on. Gun violence related to mental disorders are those incidents which leave us scratching our heads and all wondering why this had to happen - the incidents which just don't seem to make sense.

The gun violence incidents related to mental instability are the incidents that gain the most media attention - mass, rampage-style shootings such as those in Newtown, CT or Aurora, CO. These types of incidents nearly always point back to a very deeply disturbed shooter, and leave people screaming ""Why didn't anyone do anything to stop this?""

America needs to wake up and take a fresh look at the way we approach those with potentially violent mental illness. Digging our heads in the sand and pretending it isn't there just isn't working. The problem is there, and it isn't going away; it's getting worse. Organizations such as the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI) struggle to implement programs to get deeply troubled people the help they need, but the funding isn't available. It's cheaper for America to medicate the mentally ill and look the other way, but prepare to pay the piper.

Gun violence resulting from criminal activity is far more common and is the result of our revolving-door justice system. Violent criminals are arrested, prosecuted, and are back out on the streets to commit more crime at a lightning fast pace.

So where is the root of this problem? Most likely within your local District Attorney or State Attorney's office.

Your local state prosecutor is an elected position, and we've all seen the ads during campaign season where the incumbent candidate lauds his 99.8 percent conviction rate. The in-office state prosecutor needs to keep his conviction rate up high so as to ensure another victory at the next election. After all, are you going to vote for the candidate who only had a 28 percent conviction rate?

One needs to ask how a state prosecutor maintains such a high conviction rate, and the answer is through plea deals. If a defendant pleads guilty to a crime, it's considered a win for the state prosecutor's office. The reward to a defendant for pleading guilty is very often a reduced charge and, almost always, far less actual jail time. A criminal arrested for armed robbery with a firearm may plead guilty to aggravated assault, and he'll quickly be back on the streets to commit crime again.

I believe the remedy to this situation is quite simple. Let's start urging our leaders to enact legislation requiring candidates for state prosecutor positions to make full disclosures. If a candidate wants to rely on his conviction rate, he should also be required to announce his percentage of plea deals. The 99.8 percent conviction rate doesn't sound so stunning when it's followed by an 89 percent, reduced charge, plea deal disclosure.

When it comes to gun control and gun-related violence, I certainly admit I don't have the answers. I can say, however, that I do know we are looking for them in the wrong places. Just like the lemon tree in my backyard, let's stop focusing on plucking guns off the street, and let's start going after the actual root of the problem.

We need to start focusing on addressing mental health concerns before they erupt in violence. We need to focus on getting violent criminals off the street the first time, and not waiting until a criminal's fifteenth conviction before we start taking it seriously. We need to hold our state prosecutors and the judicial system far more accountable for their role in our society. And whatever we do, we need to stop splitting hairs over the semantics of the term ""assault rifle"", because that's just getting us nowhere.","2013-02-21 17:03:56","1","17.0","1.0","0.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","112.0","87.0","0.0","173.0","0.0","55.0","17","992","82.61","67.85","33.52","1.00","20.24","23.19","81.55","49.90","10.38","6.25","2.02","2.52","0.30","0.71","0.71","4.13","9.88","13.61","7.26","4.84","6.85","1.51","14.82","5.85","2.82","1.61","1.11","2.22","5.34","0.71","4.54","0.71","1.61","0.10","8.17","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.81","12.40","2.32","2.42","2.52","2.52","1.21","2.82","1.71","0.60","0.60","0.30","1.21","0.40","0.71","0.00","0.10","9.78","3.33","0.91","3.73","1.21","1.51","1.71","10.38","1.11","14.52","1.81","7.86","5.54","1.11","0.20","0.40","0.40","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.52","4.54","4.94","0.20","0.10","0.40","0.00","0.71","0.81","2.62","0.20","0.00","4558","7.72","20.816326530612244","1462","988","50","59.84","12.4","9.8","10.5","11.0","194","7.083333333333334","17.77425101214575","448","19.12","20","0.49","0","38","11","117","0","97","71","3","0","5","194","31","1","55","0","0","53","18","53","5","2","4","41","0","53","19","38","16","40","35","5","2","0","10"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amid-nuclear-threats-un-p_b_2877564.html","Amid Nuclear Threats, UN Provides Platform to Advance U.S.-China Relations","In the wake of newly-passed UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea, Pyongyang has issued a new batch of heated rhetoric nearly every day. But beyond the threats--directed largely at the U.S. and South Korea--something equally headline-worthy is transpiring.

Through what has undoubtedly been a tireless effort, the United States brokered a successful negotiation via the United Nations to further isolate the DPRK and, at the same time, opened new doors for multilateral engagement with China.

Barely more than six months ago, Chinese state media hailed North Korea as a smart place to invest. North Korea's biggest trading partner had openly helped to sustain what is now Kim Jong-un's regime. Yet, days ago, China agreed to international sanctions that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice warns will ""bite and bite hard.""

The DPRK's giant neighbor has been slow to anger and still remains its most critical ally. Yet, following Pyongyang's third nuclear test in February, China has now thrown its support behind these forceful and aggressive UN provisions.

Specifically, the sanctions call on the global community to block monetary transfers--even if money is literally being carried in suitcases full of bulk cash--to prevent North Korea from moving money to pay for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Further, Rice has said that North Korean banks will find it much harder to launder money for the DPRK nuclear program. The UN sanctions also impose new travel restrictions.

To be fair, China's enforcement of previous sanctions has been spotty to date. A December 2010 report from the U.S. Congressional Research Service found that Chinese exports of banned luxury goods averaged around $11 million per month in 2009. Yet, the events over the last week have pointed toward optimistic signs for multilateral solidarity.

Take, for example, North Korea's latest declaration that the Korean War armistice is ""null and void."" China is also a signatory to this agreement. Rather than suggest any intent or willingness to advance its nullification, Beijing has instead stated support for the armistice. As Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said earlier this week, ""the Korean armistice agreement plays an important role in safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.""

So, have we truly reached a turning point? The United States and China no doubt share a common interest in nuclear nonproliferation. Indeed, as Rice affirmed upon passage of the sanctions, ""the entire world stands united in our commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and in our demand that North Korea comply with its international obligations.""

And though it remains to be seen whether or not China will live up to this latest commitment, the cooperative exercises under the auspices of the Unites Nations marks an important diplomatic achievement. As notes Orville Schell of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society in New York, what ends up being most significant about the Security Council action ""may not be what it amounts to in terms of denuclearizing the DPRK, but what it portends for U.S.-China relations... It may well represent the most significant gesture China has made toward Washington in recent years of wanting to reset the bilateral relationship.""

In the months to come, the U.S. will do well to continue using its heft on the Security Council to maintain pressure on China--and the global community--to enforce these important sanctions. Certainly, this strategy executed through the United Nations has yielded meaningful progress already.","2013-03-14 14:59:08","1","13.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","12.0","0.0","113.0","84.0","0.0","163.0","0.0","54.0","17","579","95.51","56.18","51.62","74.08","22.27","27.63","73.40","41.45","5.35","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.84","8.46","14.85","5.53","4.15","4.49","0.52","9.50","6.56","3.45","1.04","1.04","1.73","5.70","4.15","1.55","0.52","0.86","0.17","3.97","0.00","0.69","0.00","0.00","7.60","0.86","0.86","0.52","2.25","1.55","2.42","1.04","0.17","0.52","0.35","1.04","0.17","0.35","0.00","0.52","7.43","2.25","1.04","2.59","0.86","1.38","3.28","5.35","1.04","18.48","2.07","10.36","6.04","3.80","0.52","0.35","1.55","0.17","0.17","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.35","0.00","17.10","6.74","4.32","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","2.94","1.73","1.04","0.00","0.17","2947","8.94","21.88888888888889","926","568","31","52.9","12.8","10.4","13.98","13.1","158","8.0","20.44676056338028","331","20.26","20","0.39","0","17","5","57","0","68","57","2","4","6","80","96","4","31","0","0","6","8","28","1","2","1","23","0","24","15","9","15","4","22","2","4","0","0"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-all-american-crisis_b_2842649.html","An All-American Crisis","“We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”

--Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote these words in his April 1963 Letter from a Birmingham Jail, in the same passage with his well-known warning that “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” A few months later, Dr. King wrote that the same culture of violence that killed Medgar Evers in Mississippi in June 1963 and four little Black girls in Birmingham in September 1963 had finally killed President Kennedy in November 1963 reminding us that it’s not possible to confine injustice, hatred, or violence to one group or community. What is tolerated in one place will eventually infect and affect everyone.

When many people think about gun deaths in America, the first stereotype that comes to mind is urban gun homicide—a crisis that disproportionately affects the Black community. As a result, too many people assume that despite recurring cases of often labeled “isolated” or “unpredictable” mass gun violence primarily committed by White male shooters, “ordinary” gun violence is mostly a Black problem that is or should be the Black community’s responsibility alone to solve. This is simply not true, although the Black community must mount a much stronger and more persistent voice against gun violence. The fact is that most Americans killed by guns are White, and most Americans who kill themselves or others with guns are White and our nation’s gun death epidemic is not simply a White or Black crisis but an American crisis.

Between 1963 and 2010, 73 percent of gun deaths in America were among Whites—over one million deaths. Large numbers of White parents have borne the terrible burden of losing their child to guns: Whites comprised 62 percent of child and teen gun deaths between 1963 and 2010—exceeding 100,000 deaths. In 2010, 65 percent of gun deaths among Americans of all ages were among non-Hispanic Whites, as were 34 percent of gun deaths among children and teens. Gun deaths were the second leading cause of death for non-Hispanic White children and teens that year, second only to motor vehicle accidents, and the fourth leading cause of death among non-Hispanic Whites ages 1 to 64 after cancers, heart disease, and non-gun accidents. Eighty-three percent of White gun deaths were suicides, 14 percent were homicides, and two percent were accidents. Among White children and teens, 63 percent of gun deaths were suicides, 26 percent were homicides, and nine percent were accidents.

The state with the highest overall number of gun deaths among non-Hispanic Whites in 2010 was Texas, with 1,620, followed by Florida, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, Tennessee, Arizona, and Michigan. The ten states with the highest rates of gun deaths among non-Hispanic Whites were Nevada, New Mexico, Alaska, Wyoming, Arizona, Mississippi, Montana, Alabama, Louisiana, and West Virginia.

The total of 31,328 people of all ages who died from guns in 2010 included 20,427 Whites, 7,291 Blacks, 2,943 Latinos, 378 Asian-Americans, and 289 American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Where do all of these deaths leave us? Fifty years later, it leaves us right back with Dr. King: there is no point making gun violence just one group’s problem because we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality without a place to hide from pervasive guns and gun violence. Gun violence is a White problem because most gun death victims in America are White. Gun violence is a Black problem because Blacks are disproportionately more likely to be gun death victims. Gun violence is a Latino and an Asian-American and an American Indian and Native Alaskan problem because shamefully children and people of all races are dying from guns.

Gun violence is an urban problem that devastates cities like Chicago, and Detroit, and Tucson, Arizona, and Washington, D.C. Gun violence is a suburban, small town, and rural problem that devastates places like Newtown, Connecticut, and Conyers, Georgia, and Littleton and Aurora, Colorado, and Pearl, Mississippi. Gun violence is a problem in states with strong gun laws because guns still travel in from states next door. Gun violence is a problem for parents who would never dream of owning a gun and for parents whose guns are stored responsibly and safely because their children share the same playdates and parks and schools and universities and movie theaters and streets as children and adults who do have access to guns and whose family members and friends do not store them safely.

Gun deaths are a tragedy for families whose loved ones are murdered. Gun deaths are a tragedy for families whose loved ones commit suicide. We should take our blinders off because when the 2010 gun death rate for non-Hispanic Whites in the United States was nearly eight times higher than the average gun death rate in 25 other high income countries—and the overall gun death rate for all Americans was seven and a half times higher than the average gun death rate in those countries—and when children are killed or injured by guns every 30 minutes, gun violence is an all-American crisis. Other countries have already made the decision to say no more. It is time for all Americans to stand up, speak up, work together and do the same for our children and all of us.","2013-03-09 05:08:09","1","14.0","19.0","0.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","110.0","87.0","0.0","168.0","0.0","55.0","17","915","86.04","70.77","7.23","1.00","26.91","24.37","73.01","39.23","5.36","1.75","0.00","1.09","0.00","0.22","0.44","3.61","5.46","12.02","6.56","2.51","7.54","0.87","8.85","5.36","2.73","1.53","6.34","4.04","5.79","0.87","4.92","0.22","0.87","0.77","7.54","0.66","0.11","0.11","0.77","9.62","0.44","2.08","1.42","2.19","2.30","2.30","2.40","2.08","0.33","0.00","1.09","0.22","0.66","0.11","0.00","9.73","3.06","0.77","4.04","0.22","2.08","2.62","5.57","0.33","11.15","0.98","6.89","3.39","1.31","0.77","0.44","0.22","0.00","3.93","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.41","4.15","7.87","0.22","0.00","0.11","0.00","1.53","1.09","0.44","0.00","0.00","4369","7.61","30.666666666666668","1315","892","36","54.76","13.0","11.8","12.48","14.9","155","5.928571428571429","18.870672645739912","393","25.37","3","0.38","0","55","50","65","0","109","76","3","5","5","123","113","7","97","0","0","12","7","34","4","0","3","13","0","19","23","9","15","23","30","7","5","4","3"

Andy Joseph received a welding engineering degree from Ohio State University. This clean-shaven, buttoned-down Midwestern father of five likes making things, but he never expected to be selling those things to the medical marijuana industry. How did it happen?

""The cannabis industry came to me,"" he said.

One of the things Joseph's 12-year-old company, Apeks Supercritical, sells us a $63,500 piece of equipment that uses CO2 to extract oil from plants, including marijuana. Medical pot patients sometimes prefer consuming oils over smoking the plant.

I caught up with Joseph at the National Marijuana Business Conference outside Seattle. He explained that he had to overcome a reluctance to get involved in the business—all forms of marijuana are illegal in Ohio—but began to change his mind when he met with actual clients and their patients.

""There are real benefits from the medicine,"" he said.

Apeks has expanded to seven employees, and Joseph expects sales to hit $3 million this this.

(Read more: Don't get sucked into a pot stock scam)

In the video, Joseph lays out the challenges of manufacturing equipment for an industry still considered illegal by the federal government. Apeks is providing the financing to buy the machines, because he doesn't want to get paid in cash that has been transported across state lines.

Joseph said his insurer won't back him if any of his loans go bad and the equipment disappears, but so far—""knock on wood""—he hasn't had problems.

Not bad for a business in which doing credit checks can be a challenge, as so many people involved don't even have bank accounts.

""At the end of the day,"" Joseph said of sizing up a client, ""it's a lot of gut feeling.""","2013-11-10 16:47:56","0","21.0","3.0","0.0","3.0","16.0","0.0","114.0","91.0","0.0","216.0","0.0","57.0","19","318","90.81","65.88","3.45","20.97","21.20","22.64","80.19","44.97","9.43","5.35","0.63","0.63","0.00","3.77","0.31","4.09","8.18","15.41","6.60","2.83","4.09","2.52","16.04","2.52","0.94","0.94","2.52","2.20","3.46","1.57","1.89","0.31","0.63","0.00","9.12","0.31","0.00","0.00","4.40","7.55","1.26","1.57","1.89","1.26","0.63","1.89","3.14","0.63","1.26","0.31","2.20","0.31","1.26","0.00","0.63","8.18","0.94","0.94","3.46","1.57","1.26","5.03","8.81","0.94","11.95","1.89","7.23","3.46","7.55","1.89","0.00","4.40","0.00","0.00","0.63","0.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.75","4.72","4.72","0.94","0.00","0.31","0.00","3.14","3.14","2.52","0.63","0.63","1460","7.86","21.733333333333334","438","309","16","68.81","11.9","8.5","12.01","12.0","64","6.357142857142857","18.00478964401295","211","20.33","5","0.44","0","6","8","31","0","35","12","0","0","1","57","36","0","24","0","0","14","5","12","2","0","3","11","0","11","17","9","9","6","11","3","0","0","2"

Angela McCaskill was placed on leave in October. Her reinstatement was announced in an email sent out Monday by Gallaudet President T. Alan Hurwitz.

The blog Planet DeafQueer published the email:

Dear Campus Community, With this communication I am announcing that Dr. Angela McCaskill has returned to campus to resume her full-time duties and responsibilities as Chief Diversity Officer. During the past three months a large number of you have taken the initiative to communicate with me. I have also had the opportunity of attending discussions with students and with others. This has been a period of reflection for all of us. I am deeply appreciative of the time you have taken to communicate your views, of the clearly heartfelt manner in which you have expressed those thoughts, and of the overall maturity you have shown in your willingness to consider the differing views others may hold. The work of the University’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion is vital and must continue in an active and vibrant way. I personally look forward to working with Dr. McCaskill on the work of that office. Alan

As reported by the Washington Blade, those who oppose gay marriage as well as a number of prominent marriage equality supporters, including Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D), asked that McCaskill be reinstated:

Anti-gay groups opposing the marriage law immediately denounced Hurwitz’s action, saying it confirmed their predictions that the law would lead to intolerance toward people of faith who oppose gay marriage. The opponents noted that McCaskill, a Maryland resident, signed the petition at her church. In a news conference in Annapolis one week after what supporters called the suspension from her job, McCaskill said the action violated her right as a citizen to petition the government to give voters the opportunity to decide on a controversial issue. She declined to say whether she would vote for or against the marriage equality law in the November election. Marriage equality supporters, including Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley, joined opponents in calling on Gallaudet to reinstate McCaskill, saying they, too, believe she shouldn’t be penalized for expressing her personal views on the matter.

McCaskill is Gallaudet's first chief diversity officer -- and is also the first black deaf woman to earn her PhD from the university, which was founded to serve deaf and hard-of-hearing students.

Maryland voters approved the state's same sex marriage law on Nov. 6.

WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - American and German officials sought to overcome tension between their governments on Wednesday following reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.

A meeting between White House national security adviser Susan Rice and her German counterpart came a week after an infuriated Merkel complained to President Barack Obama about accusations that the United States had for years been eavesdropping on her.

Obama, in response to the diplomatic outcry that grew out of the reports, is considering a ban on U.S. eavesdropping on leaders of allied nations, senior administration officials say.

German's national security adviser, Christoph Heusgen, and the German chancellery intelligence coordinator, Guenter Heiss, sat down with Rice and Obama's homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, at the White House.

U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and NSA Deputy Director Chris Inglis also participated.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the meeting was ""part of our efforts to resolve some of the tension that has arisen out of some reports about surveillance activities reportedly being conducted by the U.S.""

Obama is under pressure to reassure allies about the scope and scale of American intelligence gathering. The White House has promised that U.S. officials are not and will not in the future eavesdrop on Merkel's communications.

Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said the meeting was an attempt to intensify and strengthen cooperation between U.S. and German intelligence services.

""Today's discussions were an opportunity to hear from one another and jointly determine how the dialogue can best proceed in order to provide the necessary assurance and strengthen our cooperation,"" she said.","2013-10-30 18:26:00","1","11.0","1.0","0.0","1.0","4.0","0.0","13.0","5.0","0.0","48.0","0.0","4.0","4","277","97.27","83.52","8.17","95.49","30.78","36.82","73.65","37.18","4.33","2.17","0.00","0.72","0.00","1.08","0.36","2.17","7.94","14.80","4.69","1.81","4.69","0.72","9.39","4.69","0.72","0.36","0.72","1.44","7.58","6.14","1.44","1.08","0.00","0.00","10.47","0.00","0.00","1.08","0.00","4.69","1.44","0.72","0.00","0.72","1.08","0.72","5.05","2.17","2.89","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.72","11.55","2.53","2.17","5.78","0.72","1.81","5.05","4.33","0.72","11.55","1.08","6.86","3.25","7.94","0.00","1.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.61","7.58","4.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.36","1.44","1.81","0.72","0.00","1538","9.29","32.0","480","277","14","42.92","14.7","12.2","16.24","15.7","82","8.9","21.76115523465704","168","29.0","15","0.4","0","11","2","25","0","35","15","0","0","2","40","72","2","17","0","0","1","5","5","0","0","1","8","0","10","14","6","4","6","4","2","0","0","1"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anita-hill-the-powerhouse_b_3481486.html","Anita Hill, the Powerhouse Woman","In an era where sexual harassment in the workforce was hardly a cause for complaint, Anita Hill defied the social constraints of the time by asserting her rights and doing what was necessary for herself and for society at large. Acting as a true sociological documentarian, director Freida Mock brings together the story in this all-too-real documentary of Hill entitled, Anita.

By weaving in footage from the period, including Senate hearings, Mock details the story of Hill and how she was verily and forcibly thrust into the national spotlight. The facts are as follows: In 1991, Hill, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma College of Law, was inquired by the FBI about her former boss, Clarence Thomas, at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on his suitability to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Hill complied and answered all questions, also slipping in her belief that Thomas' behavior toward her had been sexually inappropriate.

What transpired next was a glaringly controversial hearing that titillated American audiences. Hill was questioned for nearly nine hours before a Senate committee chaired by Joe Biden and other 14 white senators. ""I thought that he respected my work and trusted my judgement,"" Hill says with a broken edge. Unfortunately, an all too familiar statement, comments like these are painfully common amongst sexual abuse victims. As if to behold a scam, Hill was asked to give vivid explanations about what Thomas had uttered. Hill abided and gave graphic explanations of Thomas' interest in ""group sex, pornographic materials and his own sexual prowess.""

Though uncomfortable, Hill held her composure despite having to relive the sad and uncomfortable details, showcasing the destructive reality of the criminal justice system. Unfortunately women in sexual abuse scandals must always prove their own innocence.

Shots of Thomas throughout the film include his resilience: ""I unequivocally, uncategorically deny all allegations made against me."" Reminiscent of a similar catalytic denial, Thomas astutely, with his Clintonian guise, reveres his own sanctity. Dismaying at the audacity that he could do the things he's been accused of doing. When he declares what he's experiencing as a ""high tech lynching,"" the all-white committee flinches. A seamless tactic that proves to work. The articulation and defiance of Thomas is a stark juxtaposition against the tongue-tied Hill, making the case against her stronger.

Mock makes it clear: these matters should not have been publicized, and yet they were. It's obvious that America loves a good race story, and what more could one ask for? A former black employee speaking out against her misogynistic black boss? A perfectly thrilling and money-making story.

By facilitating the defense that Hill never got, Mock tries to enlighten the audience about the story behind this sensationalized scandal, as undoubtedly through time the case became more of an investigation of Hill's own character than Thomas.' She tries to disentangle the facts and uses the footage to back up her belief of Hill's innocence. It's evident that rape trials are modern day witch hunts and in the face of supposed democracy and fairness Hill, a sagacious black woman, sat forthright.

What makes this story so enduring is Hill herself. At times nervous and taciturn, she was no less astute and defiant in her belief to set the record straight. Compelling and necessary, women all around the world should flock to see a woman who took no punches, ultimately believing in the power of her mind and her own humanity.","2013-06-24 15:39:07","0","11.0","2.0","0.0","1.0","10.0","0.0","109.0","87.0","0.0","162.0","0.0","54.0","17","578","90.79","76.63","2.81","7.67","19.93","26.64","76.30","44.98","10.03","5.71","0.87","0.00","0.00","4.50","0.35","4.33","8.82","14.36","5.71","3.11","5.54","0.69","11.25","5.88","2.77","1.73","0.69","1.90","6.06","2.25","3.81","0.52","1.56","0.17","10.55","0.00","0.00","3.63","1.73","10.73","2.77","1.73","1.04","1.04","3.63","1.73","2.77","1.56","0.52","0.17","2.08","0.35","0.17","1.38","0.00","6.40","0.69","1.04","3.81","0.87","0.35","4.84","5.36","0.00","9.69","0.69","5.88","3.11","2.60","0.17","0.00","0.35","0.52","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.40","5.02","5.71","0.52","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.87","1.38","1.56","0.00","0.00","2919","9.03","20.17241379310345","915","573","29","51.38","13.4","11.0","13.29","13.3","160","12.125","21.08928446771379","336","18.76","8","0.44","0","21","4","63","1","76","59","4","0","5","86","57","0","28","0","0","16","19","24","0","0","2","10","0","18","31","16","13","5","14","3","7","0","3"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arne-duncan-sallie-mae_n_4499216.html","Major Education Groups Pressure Arne Duncan To Crack Down On Sallie Mae","Student borrowers can't expect the basic consumer protections provided to millions of Americans who take out loans because the Department of Education fails to enforce the law, a prominent group of colleges, students and teachers has alleged.

In a stinging Dec. 20 letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan obtained by The Huffington Post, the group, led by the workers' rights organization Jobs With Justice, accused the federal department of effectively allowing loan servicers to violate the rights of student borrowers.

""For many borrowers, economic hardship is just one of the hurdles standing in the way of paying back their federal student loans,” the group of students, educators and colleges said. “Borrowers also have to contend with inept, subpar and potentially illegal conduct on behalf of the loan servicing and debt collection contractors that are selected and supervised by the department.”

The Education Department pays private-sector companies hundreds of millions of dollars each year to collect payments on student loans and work with borrowers when they fall behind on their debts. But it has made ""little-to-no effort"" to address longstanding complaints by borrowers and consumer advocates or to hold companies accountable when they mistreat borrowers and violate their federal contracts, the group said.

“We believe that these detrimental and misleading practices will not only continue to harm borrowers, but that continued inaction by your department will damage its credibility in overseeing these contracts,” reads the letter, signed by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, and the United States Student Association, among others. “It is simply unacceptable that the Department of Education continues to allow loan servicers to routinely break the rules of these servicing and debt collection contracts and go completely unpunished by your office.”

The group called on Duncan to prohibit Sallie Mae, the nation’s largest handler of student debt, from servicing federal student loans until the company complies with government rules. The group also recommended the Education Department immediately launch a probe of Sallie Mae’s servicing and debt collection practices and then publish the results.

Sallie Mae recorded $84 million in revenue last year from its Education Department contracts, according to securities filings. The company was servicing 5.7 million federal loans under its Education Department contract as of Sept. 30, a 39 percent increase from the previous year.

The letter follows news reports and congressional correspondence detailing the Education Department’s lackluster oversight of its corporate partners, most notably Sallie Mae; poor loan servicing; rising defaults in its loan portfolio; disappointing debt-relief measures; and the department’s intentions to renew Sallie Mae’s contract despite pending investigations by at least three federal agencies over allegations that the company has violated borrowers’ rights.

""The department strives to ensure that college remains affordable and student loan debt remains manageable for the millions of Americans pursuing a college education,"" said Education Department press secretary Dorie Nolt. ""The department continuously works with and monitors all of its student loan servicers to provide outstanding service to borrowers, serve as good stewards of taxpayer dollars, and ensure the integrity of its financial aid programs.""

But Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis for the AASCU, said his group has become ""increasingly alarmed about the quality of loan servicing offered by the department's contractors."" The letter notes that borrowers disputing their account balances, interest accrual or fees constitute the fastest-growing complaints. Those complaints more than doubled from 2009 to 2012, according to Education Department data.

“It seems to us there are certain basic rights that Americans take for granted when it comes to consumer credit transactions -- we are entitled to have our balances correctly tracked -- and it goes without saying that if you have a dispute, question or there is an issue with your account, you are entitled to a basic resolution process,” Nassirian said. ""But sadly, none of these fundamental assumptions seem to be operational when it comes to loan servicing by the Education Department’s contractors.""

Sallie Mae representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Rohit Chopra, the assistant director and student loan ombudsman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who was copied on the group’s letter, declined to comment on its contents. But Chopra said his agency had recently finalized a rule enabling it to supervise student loan servicers, bringing oversight to the market.

The criticisms levied against Duncan’s department by the group, which includes the country's two largest teachers’ unions and a trade association acting on behalf of more than 400 state schools, represent an escalation of an ongoing campaign by consumer advocates to significantly improve the treatment of student loan borrowers and crack down on companies that have allegedly violated borrowers’ basic consumer rights for years. Their letter comes amid mounting complaints from borrowers and increasing concerns from federal regulators that poor servicing of federal student loans risks driving up defaults and sapping economic growth.

Already, lawmakers have warned the Education Department to expect heightened scrutiny of its loan servicing operations. Congress is gearing up to reauthorize the nearly 50-year-old Higher Education Act, the federal law governing how tens of billions of taxpayer dollars are allocated towards higher education each year, and lawmakers have said they want to make changes to how federal student loans are serviced, and to the Education Department’s oversight of its corporate partners.

A Dec. 9 letter from James Runcie, the chief operating officer of the Education Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid, to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) set off the latest round of outrage.

In that letter, Runcie said the department had declined to levy any fines on student loan giant Sallie Mae, despite confidential determinations over the past 10 years that allege the company had harmed borrowers and incorrectly billed the department, among other servicing failures.

Nassirian said the AASCU was moved to join the coalition demanding Education Department action in part after reading Runcie’s letter, which he said showed how deficient the department’s oversight has been.

The NEA, which represents some 3 million educators, also hopes to get more active in the coming months on student loan servicing issues because it “wants to see the rules enforced,” said Mark Smith, senior policy analyst for higher education for the union.

""Our members are concerned about their children and the students they teach,"" Smith said. ""This is a consequence of the debt level getting so large in terms of aggregate and individual burdens on students. Student debt has gotten so big it’s playing havoc with other sectors of the economy.""

Nearly 40 million Americans collectively owe more than $1 trillion in student debt that is ultimately guaranteed by taxpayers. Outstanding federal student debt has more than doubled since 2007, according to the Education Department. Borrowers who graduated with bachelor’s degrees in 2012 on average had $29,400 in student debt, according to The Institute for College Access & Success. More than seven in 10 graduates from the Class of 2012 had student loan debt.

Chris Hicks, an organizer at Jobs With Justice’s Debt-Free Future Campaign, said his group hopes to increase pressure on the Education Department to spur servicing reforms that would avoid needless student loan defaults.

""The Department of Education can either do the right thing by borrowers, or they can maintain the status quo,"" Hicks said. ""We'd like to see Secretary Duncan be a champion for higher education.""

One in 10 recent borrowers defaulted on their federal student loans within the first two years, the highest default rate since 1995, according to the Education Department. About 100,000 borrowers with loans from the government’s Direct Loan program entered default during the three-month period ending in September, about the same number as enrolled in the Education Department’s three income-linked repayment plans, department data show.

Last December, Cooper Howes, an economist at Barclays, the U.K. bank, estimated in a note to clients that more than half of borrowers with federal student loans in 2012 qualified for lower payments under Income-Based Repayment, a plan that caps monthly payments relative to borrowers’ incomes.

Nassirian, of the AASCU, said he anticipates colleges and universities will begin ratcheting up pressure as well, as schools begin to feel the effects of how student loans are serviced by companies such as Sallie Mae.

""Frankly, for too long, institutions have been focused too much on the front end -- getting loans out -- and have not been sufficiently engaged with what happens to former students when they leave,"" Nassirian said. ""But we have just reached a point where student loans are too ubiquitous in the lives of our students for us to be indifferent and let these kinds of sloppy practices go on.""

Duncan and his top aides need to prioritize student loan servicing, Nassirian added.

“So many young people start out life with the equivalent of mortgages wrapped around their necks like anchors,” he said. “It is getting serious enough that we need some really high-level attention paid to it.”","2013-12-24 17:00:10","1","34.0","2.0","0.0","3.0","16.0","0.0","127.0","91.0","0.0","228.0","0.0","59.0","19","1502","96.76","70.30","8.73","14.69","26.82","35.09","81.09","39.48","6.26","2.46","0.00","0.67","0.40","0.47","0.93","3.79","7.59","15.85","3.86","2.66","4.79","0.47","8.46","4.06","2.73","1.13","3.13","2.40","3.13","1.13","1.93","0.33","0.40","0.33","6.79","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.53","6.32","1.13","1.60","0.80","1.20","0.47","2.06","1.66","0.33","1.20","0.20","0.40","0.07","0.33","0.00","0.00","14.98","2.06","1.46","10.59","0.80","0.67","3.00","5.46","0.87","10.92","1.73","5.79","3.33","15.18","0.07","0.13","7.32","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.13","0.07","0.07","0.00","15.45","3.93","5.19","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","1.40","2.53","1.73","0.13","0.27","8017","8.89","31.122448979591837","2521","1486","57","36.52","16.4","14.6","15.44","17.9","373","8.7","22.480376850605655","660","27.69","10","0.39","0","46","39","130","0","185","93","9","6","7","240","148","8","161","0","0","29","27","42","2","1","9","54","0","48","53","42","41","41","38","10","4","0","10"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/as-the-wedgie-turns_b_4243436.html","Friday Talking Points -- As The Wedgie Turns","Half a year ago, we decided it was time to coin a new political term. We did so in these pages, as a matter of fact, in our ""Friday Talking Points [257]"" column. But while the concept is indeed now being noticed more and more by others, our neologism doesn't seem to be catching on nearly as well. So we'll repeat the definition we gave it, back in May (once again helpfully pointing anyone who is not aware of the literal, non-political definition of ""wedgie"" to ask your local sixth-grader to explain and demonstrate, if necessary):

Wedgie: When a political party's ""wedge"" issue turns on them and instead of dividing the other party, begins to divide their own. Usage: ""Boy, the Republicans are really getting a giant wedgie on immigration, aren't they?""

This week, that example would have read: ""Boy, the Republicans are really getting a giant wedgie on gay rights, aren't they?""

I speak, of course, of the Senate passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (or ""ENDA"") on a bipartisan vote of 64-32. That's pretty impressive, since it's a perfect 2-to-1 split. Ten Republicans voted for the bill, as well as every Democrat who voted. Astonishingly, when the floor debate happened, not a single Republican rose to speak against the bill, even though 32 of them voted ""nay."" Speaker of the House John Boehner is so far saying he's not in favor of the bill, meaning it likely won't be coming up for a vote any time soon.

Let's just deconstruct what is really going on for a moment, shall we?

Pretty much ever since gay rights became a national political issue (say, the 1980s or so), Republicans have been working overtime making political hay out of it. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Republicans were downright eager to put anti-gay ballot measures up for popular vote, and were outspoken (to put it mildly) in their scorn for advancing any gay rights whatsoever. It was a reliable Republican wedge issue of enormous proportions, in fact, for over two whole decades.

Now this wedge has turned. Not only is marriage equality now winning at the ballot box (as well as, this week, in both the Hawai'i and Illinois legislatures), but the public has finally gotten disgusted with the Republican position on the issue of gay rights. The younger the voter, the more this is true. Harry Reid summed this up brilliantly this week, explaining this generational shift in memorable fashion:

I have three adult grandchildren now, in addition to my adult children. For me to feel any different about [gay rights and ENDA in particular], they wouldn't be proud of their grandfather. It's just with my five children, it's a non-issue. But for my three adult grandchildren, it's a non-non-issue. They can't imagine why anyone gives a damn.

But the real turn of the wedge can be seen in the dog that didn't bark on the floors of Congress. When the Senate called for those who wanted to speak out against ENDA, not a single senator stood up to speak. Now that the bill has been handed off to the House, John Boehner will not even bring it up for debate. A Salon article pointed this out this week, ending with: ""Yes, gay rights have officially become a wedge issue -- that Democrats leverage against Republicans.""

In short, a political wedgie. Republicans are now scared to even bring the issue up, for the most part. That is a downright tectonic shift in their political platform. They're still just as anti-gay-rights, but they would prefer not to talk about it now -- because they are fully aware that it is now a losing issue for them (especially among young voters). This is after essentially creating the issue as wedge way back when, because Democrats used to shy away from even wanting to discuss such things.

There's a larger picture to see here, too. Democrats (especially in the Senate) have -- astonishingly, to some longtime political observers -- suddenly seemed to have learned a basic ""Politics 101"" lesson: in times of divided government, push your best issues hard and hold the votes and pass the bills that you can -- in order to embarrass the other side. This way, you force one of three possible outcomes, all of which are good for you and your party. Pushing the issue could force the other chamber of Congress to hold an open a debate on the merits and then a vote. This rarely happens, but it is a remote possibility. The second possibility is that you force the other party to capitulate, embrace your position, and pass the bill you want to see made into law. This is even rarer (at least, without an intervening election to goad such behavior). But even the third possible outcome is a good one -- you pass the bills you can, and then your party uses it as a rhetorical iron-studded club to beat the opposing party's candidates about the ears, in the upcoming election (and, being Washington, there's always an upcoming election for them to worry about).

Republicans have been expertly wielding this political weapon for decades now. But for the first time in quite a while, Democrats are discovering the tactic on their own. The Senate has now passed -- in true bipartisan fashion, mind you -- a big bill on immigration reform and a big bill on non-discrimination for gay people in the workplace. The House is ignoring both. Salon pointed out (in a different article) that, in addition, ""Democrats want bills pertaining to minority voting rights and equal pay for women on Boehner's desk before election season."" To this list might be added a big raise in the minimum wage, which President Obama just explicitly endorsed.

The Republican Party's 2014 campaign strategy can be summed up in two words, really: ""Obamacare bad."" That's really all they've got left to work with. Democrats, on the other hand, are lining up a much better platform which sees a brighter future -- ""This is what we'll do if you give us control of the House: immigration reform, equal workplace rights for all, protecting voting rights, equal pay for women, and a minimum wage hike.""

This ain't exactly rocket science, folks. As mentioned, it's really just Politics 101. But for much too long, Democrats haven't really played this game very well. Increasing the pressure on John Boehner and the House Republicans is the smartest thing Democrats could do right now. Much to everyone's surprise, this appears to be exactly what they are doing right now. The delicious irony is how many of the things on that campaign platform list can be classified as wedgies -- issues that Republicans used in elections past to whip up the public in the opposite direction. Wedgies that are digging deeper and more painful each day, relentlessly dividing the two sagging, elephantine hemispheres of the Republican Party.

Well, OK, maybe that was a bit too graphic a metaphorical leap. We apologize for the mental image, really we do. Ahem. Let's just quickly move along to the awards, shall we?

Both Senators Ted Kennedy and Jeff Merkley deserve at least Honorable Mention awards this week. Kennedy, for being the original champion of the ENDA legislation (he introduced the bill in 1994), and Merkley for stepping in when Kennedy asked him to (when Kennedy knew he wasn't going to live to see it passed). Both deserve praise for an effort that spanned two decades.

But we also had an election this week, even if it was an off-off-year contest with no overwhelming national implications (no matter what the inside-the-Beltway chattering class thought).

We have to say, New York City Mayor-Elect Bill de Blasio's win on Tuesday was beyond impressive. He won a whopping 73-to-24 percent victory over the sacrificial Republican candidate. That's almost a 50 percent margin!

De Blasio ran an unashamedly liberal class-conscious ""two cities"" campaign, and won big time. New Yorkers are tired of the Bloomberg era, and they made their feelings crystal clear. Progressivism won, liberalism won, and for racking up such an outsized victory margin, Bill de Blasio is the clear winner of this week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award. Congratulations are definitely in order!

[Congratulate Mayor-Elect Bill de Blasio via his campaign page (for now), to let him know you appreciate his efforts.]

This doesn't qualify, being in another country, but it's at least worth mentioning that somewhere Marion Barry must be laughing long and hard. America's own original ""crack-smokin' mayor,"" Barry can now be seen as a real trend-setter now. America's late-night comics turned their political attentions this week to our northern neighbor -- specifically, Toronto's mayor, Rob Ford. Ford has been the gift that keeps on giving, at least to the professional comics, all week long. No more really needs be said, to be honest.

Looking a little closer to home, though, the biggest disappointment this week was, strangely enough, also a victory on election night. Virginia voted Terry McAuliffe in as governor, but they obviously weren't very excited about doing so. McAuliffe was polling much higher than the 2.5 percentage points that he won by, and even though he ran a relentlessly lefty campaign, he almost lost the race to a fire-breathing Tea Partier. This election was supposed to put a nail in the coffin of Tea Partyism, giving Establishment Republicans leverage over the Tea Party by showing how ultra-Tea Party candidates fail badly at the polls.

Now, though, they can't really make that case. In the first place, the polls showed McAuliffe up by something like 6-to-9 points, which did not turn out to be the case Tuesday. Secondly, there was a third-party Libertarian challenger who garnered 6 points of the vote, meaning that McAuliffe fell short of the combined Libertarian and Republican vote totals.

All in all, a disappointment. While Democrats can celebrate taking Virginia's governorship, it would have been a much bigger celebration if a better Democratic candidate had crushed a Tea Party candidate by 10 or 15 points. That didn't happen. Which is why Terry McAuliffe -- while we still do congratulate him on his narrow win, mind you -- is our choice for Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week. The good news is that there weren't any other disappointments in an election week -- to find a winner for MDDOTW, we had to consider someone who actually won his race. That's a good thing, in the larger-picture sense.

[Contact Governor-Elect Terry McAuliffe on his campaign page (for now), to let him know what you think of his actions.]

Volume 281 (11/8/13)

For the first time in a number of weeks, we're not going to have any Obamacare talking points. The subject has reached overload, and if any Democrat is asked, they should respond with something along the lines of:

""Obama apologized, the tech guy responsible is quickly retiring from his job, and now they're even blaming traffic problems on Obamacare. I mean, really, let's wait until the end of the month to see how things work out, OK?""

But we've got plenty of other things to address this week, especially since there was an election involved. So without further ado, let's get to the talking points of the week, designed for Democrats everywhere to freely use, from your workplace's water cooler to the interviews of politicians on Sunday morning.

Tea Party losses



While it's easy to find opinions all over the map about ""who won"" and ""trends"" from Tuesday's election, there is one clear lesson to arise from it. If asked for election analysis, this needs to be pointed out.

""It's clear that whatever you think of the winners of this week's election, the losers are pretty obvious. The Tea Party ran their candidates -- pure Tea Partiers, mind you, not a hint of impurity to be found among them -- and they lost. They lost the races for governor and lieutenant governor in Virginia, and they lost against an Establishment Republican candidate in Alabama. So whether they were running against Democrats or against other Republicans, it was a clear loss all around for the Tea Party this year. Hopefully, more and more Republicans will figure out how poisonous Tea Partiers are to more and more voters across the country. But probably not before they lose some other big elections with the purest-of-the-pure Tea Party candidates, that's my guess.""

Republicans vote to condemn Republican votes



Sounds like a tongue-twister, but instead the literal truth. [Note: scroll down to number 4 if you follow the link, to see the reference.]

""Remember when Republicans taunted that John Kerry was 'for the bill before he was against it'? Well, just recently we had the spectacle of Republicans in the Senate voting to denounce the vote that they had just cast, almost immediately afterwards. To end the debt ceiling showdown, 27 Republican senators voted with Democrats to pass a bill. Then they turned around -- all 27 of them -- and voted for a resolution condemning the bill that they had just voted for. That's how terrified Republicans are of the Tea Party right now -- they're trying to provide political cover with this flip-flop, even though anyone with half a brain can see through such naked political gymnastics. One week, 27 Republicans vote for a bill, the next week, they vote their disapproval of themselves for voting for it. They've truly gone down a rabbit hole, folks.""

Rand Paul says...



This one is just too easy a shot. But it's also too tantalizing to pass up, really. Can be used by just about any Democrat, in response to just about any question. As long as your comedic timing is good enough to pull it off, that is.

""Well, as Rand Paul said... or, rather, as Rand Paul plagiarized someone else, who said... "" [pause for laughter]

Don't let up on ENDA



Democrats have to bring the pressure to John Boehner on ENDA. So far, they're doing a pretty good job (at least, on the Huffington Post blogs), from President Obama to Al Franken. But Harry Reid's been outdoing himself on the issue. In fact, we've got two (for the price of one!) comments from Reid to highlight this week. The first came in response to the Senate passing ENDA, where he absolutely dares Boehner not to take action:

I think the House is going to have to capitulate, if they have any hope of having a president that can be a viable candidate or they think they can elect some Republicans and they want to hang onto the House.

Pretty snarky, eh? But that wasn't the snarkiest thing from Reid this week. After Boehner predicted a flood of ""frivolous lawsuits"" if ENDA passed, Reid shot back on Twitter:

Speaker Boehner opposes ENDA for fear of frivolous lawsuits? He led a frivolous lawsuit defending DOMA that cost taxpayers over $2 million!

Give 'em hell, Harry!

Seriously, though, it's about freedom and liberty



In a more serious vein, Senator Jeff Merkley proudly described what the win for ENDA really means.

Today's vote was a historic vote for equality and freedom. Deeply embedded in the Constitution are notions of freedom and liberty, and discrimination is the antithesis of those founding values. Everyone should have the right to work hard and earn a living. No one should be fired for who they are or who they love. The Senate said today in a strong bipartisan voice that discrimination is just plain wrong. We are one step closer to equality for our LGBT friends and family.

Someone take the Cheetos away from Hickenlooper, please



Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado -- a man who made his fortune selling mind-altering drugs to adults (he was a mini beer baron) -- simply has got to put down the Cheetos metaphors.

""Democrats ignore the growing acceptance of marijuana use by the American electorate at their peril. We saw not only the first city on the East Coast to legalize recreational marijuana use in this week's election, we also saw Colorado pass a tax measure for its own legal recreational marijuana marketplace. Colorado's governor responded by once again joking about, quote, Cheetos and Goldfish, unquote, on Twitter. Sooner or later Democratic politicians need to realize that they should begin following where the people are clearly leading on responsible marijuana use by adults, and stop treating the whole issue as a big joke.""

Wedgies all around!



OK, this one's just purely selfish of me, I fully admit. I'm attempting to push the meme. Make it go viral. Or are there more up-to-date hip internet terms I should be using? Heh.

""Have you heard the new term for a wedge issue which turns against the party which created it? It's now a political 'wedgie' when the wedge turns ugly on you. Republicans scapegoating immigration to win votes? Now it's a wedgie the Democrats are using against them at the ballot box. Want another one? Republicans used the wedge of gay rights for years, but now all they've got left to show for it is a big old wedgie. And it couldn't have happened to a more deserving party, don't you think?""

Whatever the intention, whatever the venue, whomever the person, attacks or comments on anyone's ethnicity are wrong & patently unacceptable — ashley judd (@AshleyJudd) February 26, 2013

On Tuesday, Democratic-aligned group Progress Kentucky drew charges of ""race-baiting"" from McConnell's campaign after repeatedly suggesting that his wife Elaine Chao's Chinese roots have led him to embrace anti-American policies.

Progress Kentucky later sought to distance themselves from the offending tweet. Shawn Reilly, the group's executive director, denied the allegations from McConnell's campaign while maintaining that the senator's relationship with his father-in-law posed a ""conflict of interest.""

Judd's decision to weigh in on the controversy comes as she appears to be taking steps to lay the groundwork for a move to politics. Earlier this month, Judd held meetings with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and top figures in Kentucky Democratic politics. While Judd has said she'll decide if she's running for Senate by the Kentucky Derby on May 4, Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), the only Democrat in the state's congressional delegation and a vocal Judd cheerleader, is already convinced that she's decided to enter the race.

Judd isn't the only McConnell critic who has spoken out against Progress Kentucky's tweets. Dan Logsdon, chair of the Kentucky Democratic Party, told Talking Points Memo that the attacks were ""deplorable and have absolutely no place in Kentucky, and frankly are just the kind of divisive politics that Sen. McConnell himself has used for too long.""","2013-02-26 17:18:59","0","13.0","3.0","0.0","2.0","16.0","0.0","119.0","91.0","0.0","226.0","0.0","59.0","19","278","94.42","80.59","13.52","15.63","25.27","35.61","72.30","39.93","7.91","3.60","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.24","0.36","4.32","8.63","13.31","5.76","2.52","3.24","0.72","12.23","3.96","2.16","1.44","1.08","0.72","3.60","1.44","2.16","0.00","1.44","0.00","11.51","1.44","0.00","2.52","1.80","8.27","2.52","1.44","0.36","2.16","0.72","2.16","1.44","0.72","0.72","0.00","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.36","14.03","2.88","2.16","8.99","0.36","0.36","4.32","7.19","1.08","13.31","2.52","6.83","4.32","4.32","1.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.36","0.36","0.00","0.00","23.38","4.68","5.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.52","2.16","5.76","2.16","0.72","1485","9.64","32.888888888888886","445","274","13","50.06","13.5","11.5","15.78","16.0","86","13.375","22.994744525547446","185","29.33","3","0.41","0","7","3","26","0","40","20","0","0","0","42","59","0","15","0","0","8","2","11","2","0","1","8","0","7","19","8","4","4","8","1","1","0","0"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ashley-judd-senate-campaign_n_2727069.html","Ashley Judd Takes Further Steps Toward Kentucky Senate Run With Key Meetings","Actress Ashley Judd continued to stoke speculation about a potential Democratic Kentucky Senate run over the past week, holding meetings with key political players on both the national and state level.

Politico reports that Judd sat down with officials from the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee for a private meeting in Washington, D.C. earlier this week. A source told Politico that it was her first official meeting with the DSCC since expressing interest in challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and a strong sign that she was serious about laying the groundwork for a 2014 campaign.

Judd has also reportedly attempted to strengthen her ties to Kentucky, making an appearance at a well-attended dinner late last week featuring the state's top Democratic politicians and operatives.

Judd, a Kentucky native and active supporter of President Barack Obama, has been a fascination in the Bluegrass State since first being floated as a possible contender shortly after the November elections. Recent rounds of polling have shown McConnell to be highly unpopular and particularly vulnerable as he seeks a sixth term, though a February survey testing a McConnell-Judd matchup showed the Republican leading the actress by nine points.

While she's received support from some political operatives and elected officials in the state, not all Democrats are excited at the prospect of Judd's entrance into Kentucky politics. Her skeptics have expressed concern that her status as a strong advocate for liberal policies and a current resident of Tennessee could damage her viability. Others claim that she would be a divisive presence in the state, and could damage Democrats' broader chances in state and local elections.

Republicans aren't waiting around for Judd's official decision to go on the offensive. Earlier this month, Karl Rove super PAC American Crossroads released a $10,000 web ad attacking Judd as a ""Hollywood liberal."" Rove later promised that the group would continue to ""make fun"" of Judd as long as she was part of the discussion. McConnell's campaign followed suit earlier this week with a web ad of his own, throwing jabs at Judd and a number of other Kentucky Democrats who have been mentioned as possible challengers.

On top of whichever Democrat emerges to challenge McConnell, the longtime senator could also face a potential challenge from his right. A spokesman for Louisville businessman Matthew Bevin confirmed this week that the conservative had been in discussion with local Tea Party groups about serving as an alternative to McConnell.","2013-02-20 16:00:51","1","13.0","1.0","0.0","2.0","16.0","0.0","125.0","91.0","0.0","225.0","0.0","58.0","19","412","96.20","69.49","10.13","75.34","25.75","33.25","73.54","41.50","6.80","2.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.91","0.00","3.88","9.95","15.05","5.58","2.43","5.34","0.49","8.74","7.77","4.13","0.49","1.70","1.46","5.83","4.13","1.46","0.24","0.49","0.00","7.04","0.00","0.00","2.18","0.73","6.55","0.49","1.46","1.21","1.46","0.73","1.46","0.73","0.49","0.24","0.00","1.70","0.24","0.49","0.00","0.97","10.92","0.73","3.16","7.52","0.24","0.24","4.13","3.88","0.73","15.53","1.46","7.28","7.04","5.83","1.46","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.24","0.00","11.65","4.37","3.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.73","0.97","1.70","0.49","0.24","2131","9.52","27.866666666666667","644","407","17","47.22","14.2","12.6","14.22","15.9","121","6.916666666666667","23.45189189189189","242","26.07","7","0.4","0","10","4","46","1","60","38","1","0","5","63","64","4","19","0","0","7","6","13","3","0","1","8","0","11","16","13","10","7","6","0","2","0","0"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ashley-judd-senate-run_n_2758500.html","Ashley Judd Senate Buzz Has Some Democrats Convinced: 'I Would Be Surprised If She Doesn't Run'","Actress Ashley Judd has yet to announce a final decision about challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in 2014, but the ongoing speculation -- as well as her early maneuvers -- have already put some Kentucky Democrats on the bandwagon.

""I would be surprised if she doesn't run at this point,"" Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), the only Democrat in Kentucky's congressional delegation, told ABC News in an interview published Monday. ""My impression is this is something she wants to do, and she is now taking the time to make the contacts she needs to make throughout the state to try and generate commitments of support and in some cases fundraising.""

Yarmuth has been an ardent supporter of Judd since her name was first floated as a potential opponent to McConnell, and his latest display of optimism appears to have been fueled by the movie star's recent moves.

Judd recently took a number of steps to lay the groundwork for a Senate campaign. In the past month, she's attended a dinner with top Kentucky politicos and held her first official meeting with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

""She is certainly acting like a candidate, a potential candidate,"" Yarmuth told ABC News. Other Democrats, including Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, have also praised Judd for shaping up to be a ""serious candidate.""

But others remain highly skeptical of Judd's chances should she decide to enter the race, claiming that her record of liberal advocacy and current Tennessee residency could pose serious problems among rural Kentucky's more conservative electorate. Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine summarized the concerns on Monday:

Let me translate this. Democrats are going to lose the Senate race pretty much regardless. But Ashley Judd would raise a ton of money across the country and spend it bolstering turnout across the state, which would help other Democrats, most of whom would be distancing themselves from Judd like she was George Clooney. You know Ashley Judd’s evil husband in Double Jeopardy, who seduced her and then exploited her for an insurance scam? The campaign to lure her to run is kind of like that.

Other Kentucky Democrats fear that Judd's candidacy would instead nationalize state and local elections, allowing conservatives to rally in opposition the actress and ultimately vote out other Democrats around Kentucky. Democratic consultant Jim Cauley told ABC News that some Democrats were so resistant to the idea of a Judd campaign that they'd encouraged him to use his position as President Barack Obama's campaign manager for his 2004 Senate race in Illinois to get the White House to ask the actress to step aside.","2013-02-25 10:29:03","1","14.0","2.0","0.0","2.0","16.0","0.0","121.0","91.0","0.0","225.0","0.0","58.0","19","435","90.58","72.49","2.50","46.99","22.89","28.05","73.79","44.60","9.89","5.75","0.69","0.00","0.23","4.37","0.46","4.14","7.59","14.94","7.13","2.53","4.83","0.23","13.56","4.37","2.99","0.69","1.15","1.84","4.14","2.53","1.38","0.23","0.00","0.23","8.97","0.23","0.23","3.45","1.15","10.34","1.15","1.38","2.76","2.99","0.46","2.30","0.69","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.23","8.74","0.69","2.30","5.29","0.92","0.46","2.99","8.74","1.15","12.18","2.07","5.75","4.37","2.99","1.15","0.46","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.23","0.00","14.94","4.37","3.68","0.23","0.00","0.23","0.00","1.38","1.84","2.30","0.92","0.00","2162","8.71","26.235294117647058","651","434","20","57.91","12.9","10.6","12.65","13.7","110","7.5","20.81824884792627","263","23.59","6","0.42","0","13","2","40","0","49","32","0","2","7","58","75","7","12","0","0","17","8","16","1","0","2","19","0","28","19","10","8","7","11","1","2","0","0"

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/assurant-forced-placed-insurance_n_2927091.html","Assurant To Compensate Victims Of Abusive Force-Placed Insurance Tactics","NEW YORK -- An insurance company with close financial ties to JPMorgan Chase agreed Thursday to pay a $14 million fine to New York's top financial regulator to settle allegations that it grossly over-billed distressed homeowners who were forced to buy its policies. The agreement, known as a consent order, also requires the company, Assurant, to compensate homeowners who suffered financial harm as a result of its policies and to lower rates.

The legal agreement is the most significant regulatory action to date meant to change practices in the market for ""force-placed"" insurance, which homeowners and their advocates -- and now regulators -- have described as blatantly abusive.

""This is the first major move to end all of these practices and we hope it will become a nationwide trend,"" said Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, which oversees insurance companies and state-chartered banks. ""Prices should not be pushing up and up, pushing borrowers over the foreclosure cliff.""

Practically everyone who has a mortgage must carry home insurance. If not, the company or bank that services the mortgage will buy a policy on the homeowner's behalf and send the bill to the homeowner. This is done to protect the ""investor"" that actually owns the loan. But rather than an arms-length transaction, with banks purchasing the most affordable policy, they instead often purchases very expensive policies sold by insurers with close financial ties. This arrangement has pushed premiums into the stratosphere. Some policies cost 10 times the price of traditional insurance, and in some cases have been imposed on borrowers who do not require insurance.

Costly premiums have meant big profits for the industry, and for its banking parkers. Through a complex arrangement, banks have managed to put themselves on both sides of these transactions, purchasing policies with an inflated premium on behalf of homeowners, then reaping 75 percent of those gains back through a reinsurance agreement. For example, JPMorgan Chase has made $600 million since 2006 by taking 75 percent of the profits from the business it gave Assurant, according to a press release that accompanied the consent order.

Ultimately, either the homeowner or the investor, including entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, end up paying the cost of the premiums.

“The force-placed insurance industry has for too long been plagued by an intricate web of relationships between insurers and banks that pushed distressed families over the foreclosure cliff,” said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a statement accompanying the announcement of the settlement. “Today’s agreement starts us on the road to reform, which will clean up this industry and truly protect working people.”

In a statement, Gene Mergelmeyer, Assurant's chief executive, did not directly address the ongoing controversy over force-placed mortgage insurance. “[W]e look forward to filing our next generation lender-placed product as we continue to meet the needs of our clients and customers in New York with outstanding service and support,"" he said.

JPMorgan Chase did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is also investigating the industry, though it has not announced any findings. Last year, Assurant agreed to reduce premiums as part of a deal with the California Department of Insurance.

There is perhaps no one better suited to help the UN sharpen this focus than U.S. Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice.

A Rhodes Scholar with a doctorate from Oxford University, Rice was a foreign policy wunderkind. Before age 30, she joined President Bill Clinton's National Security Council in 1993, eventually serving as one of the youngest assistant secretaries of state under her mentor Madeleine Albright. She is the first African American woman to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the UN, and one of President Obama's most experienced and revered foreign-policy advisers.

With a reputation for being charming, witty and funny in person, Rice is known for being candid and persuasive at the United Nations. In the Security Council, her unique blend of direct but effective diplomacy has successfully facilitated resolutions, delivering harsh sanctions against North Korea and Iran and military intervention in Libya. Her outspokenness even extends to Twitter, where she has been known to call out leaders and raise humanitarian concerns.

She responded by email to interview questions posed by The InterDependent.

How do you view the reelection of President Obama in terms of U.S.-UN relations? What messages did it send to the international community?

From the president's very first day in office, he made clear that we would pursue a new era of engagement abroad that would enable us to more effectively tackle global challenges that require U.S. leadership but cannot be solved alone. Here at the UN, we've worked hard over the past four years to rebuild the U.S.-UN relationship and put it on solid footing. This has meant taking concrete steps to improve the way the United States conducts business at the UN in both substance and style.

On issues ranging from women's rights to climate change, non-proliferation to development, we've proven ourselves to be a reliable partner for the international community. We've repaid hundreds of millions in dues that accrued during the past decade. We've invested in relationships in New York with a diverse group of countries, big and small, rich and poor, North and South. Where the United States was in the past, often isolated on the outside, we are at the heart of the UN's work, demonstrating leadership, collaborating with others, and fighting for America's interests.

Our approach has led to real results: the stiffest UN sanctions ever against Iran and North Korea; an unprecedented mandate and action to save lives in Libya; the historic and peaceful independence of South Sudan; effective backing for a democratically elected government in Cote d'Ivoire; the long overdue completion of a political transition in Somalia, to name a few.

Taken together, I think the international community appreciates this renewed U.S. commitment to multilateral diplomacy and leadership at the United Nations, and the American people can see that our engagement has yielded real results for them.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/campaign-finance-reform-citizens-united_n_4046135.html","After Citizens United, Campaign Finance Reformers Look For A Bold New Approach","COLUMBIA, Md. -- The 2014 election is over a year away, but even so Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) found himself standing in late July in the recessed living room of two supporters, Mary and David Marker, addressing a room full of potential donors to his reelection campaign. In this day and age of astronomical political spending, it's never too soon for a lawmaker to gear up for the next campaign. And yet this was no ordinary fundraiser, and Sarbanes was making no ordinary pitch.

""I want to thank you all for coming,"" Sarbanes said. ""I want to thank you for being interested. I want to thank you in advance for becoming a grassroots donor tonight. Remember, $5 is enough to state your commitment.""

Five dollars might not seem like enough, not when donors can contribute up to $2,600 for each primary and general election, and politicians typically spend their time asking people to do just that. But this was a small-donor fundraising party -- an event Sarbanes plans to repeat across his district as he attempts to fundamentally change the way political candidates raise money.

In the past two years, Sarbanes, a four-term congressman and the son of former five-term Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.), has emerged as a leader in a new vanguard of campaign finance reformers. These politicians and activists are pushing to empower small donors and to fight back against the rising tide of big money in politics and the increasing pressure congressional candidates face to raise money for their campaigns, peers and parties.

Rep. John Sarbanes speaks at a small-donor fundraiser in Roland Park, Md.

""I just woke up one day and -- I just can't keep doing this the same old way,"" Sarbanes said in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""I can't keep going to the same donors with the same story. There's got to be something more innovative here.""

Sarbanes has room to innovate. The seat he occupies, which stretches between Baltimore and Washington, is safely Democratic. So before the 2012 election, he stockpiled a half-million dollars in donations that could be unlocked only after he raised contributions of $100 or less from 1,000 first-time donors in his district -- a goal that he ultimately achieved. The arrangement provided the large pool of money needed to run a successful campaign. But it also offered something more: an incentive to reach out to new small donors, the ones who usually get ignored come election season.

The experiment was invigorating, Sarbanes said. It freed him from the tedium of calling the same wealthy donors he dialed every year asking for maximum contributions. It also allowed him to talk to more of his constituents. He used those conversations, along with discussions with reformers and organizations both inside and outside Washington, to craft what he calls ""a meaningful bill to reform the way we fund campaigns.""

Sarbanes introduced the proposed Grassroots Democracy Act earlier this year in the House of Representatives. After months of negotiations, it is poised to become the basis of a new piece of legislation around which Democrats will organize support for congressional campaign finance reform over the next few years.

Sarbanes' original bill would match every $1 in donations of $100 or less with $5 in public matching funds and provide a $50 tax credit to every American voter to use as a contribution to the political candidate of his or her choosing. By being tied to a large pool of funds, small donors become as valuable as big ones. The bill would also bar participating candidates from accepting contributions larger than $1,000.

The push for a campaign finance reform bill comes at a critical moment. The Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision opened the political spending floodgates and ushered in the era of the super PAC. This week, the court is hearing arguments in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, which challenges the aggregate federal two-year contribution limit for individual donors. Without this limit, big donors would be able to spread their wealth further throughout Congress, gaining more influence in the process.

While it may seem quixotic to push for campaign finance reform while previously set restrictions are falling left and right, ordinary citizens are rallying around the issue of money in politics in a way not seen in many years. What had once been a cause limited to a niche group of good-government types in Washington has grown into a broad coalition. The Sierra Club, the NAACP, Greenpeace and the Communications Workers of America -- four of the largest membership groups in the country -- have begun to invest time and resources in supporting campaign finance reform for the first time. And a new breed of reformers are pushing new arguments to highlight the issue and bring conservatives and disaffected voters into the fold.

More than anything else, however, reformers believe they have finally cracked the code for changing the way politicians raise money. The key, they say, is to encourage candidates' political activity and increase the voice of small donors in the fundraising system.

""The notion that we're simply going to regulate the big money out by establishing limits has faded,"" said Nick Nyhart, president and CEO of Public Campaign, one of the groups rallying around this new effort. ""People are saying, well, you might need those regulations, but that alone is not going to do what you need to get people in. So there has been a big shift in that.""

*****

The increasing pressure on lawmakers to raise campaign cash is not simply a result of the rise of special interests in Washington. The Republican takeover of both the House and Senate in 1994 sparked a reordering of fundraising priorities, as power on Capitol Hill finally came up for grabs after 40 years of Democratic rule in the House. Holding just a small majority in the House through the 1990s and early 2000s, Republican leaders put heavy pressure on their members to raise larger and larger sums of money in order to protect incumbents and go after vulnerable Democratic seats.

Republican leaders also placed term limits on committee chairmanships and chose leaders based on how much money they could raise for the party. Democrats, while not adopting the term limits, responded by increasing pressure on their safe incumbents to raise money for their party.

""If you were trying to become a ranking member or, if you're in the majority, the committee chair, if you don't raise tons of money for the party you've got no chance,"" said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), another campaign finance reform leader in Congress. ""No matter how loyal you may be, no matter how much work you do, no matter how smart you may be, you've got very little chance of getting one of those positions.""

""It's implied,"" said Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a freshman Democrat from Texas who supports the Sarbanes bill. ""If you do not participate in this [fundraising], you diminish your ability to be influential. Whether it's gaining a committee assignment, whether it's getting the help that you need on legislation that you want to carry, whatever it is, you're just seen as not a team player.""

The current system of fundraising basically requires members of Congress to devote huge amounts of time to calling and meeting with donors able to provide maximum contributions. On Nov. 16, 2012, little more than a week after the election, House Democratic leadership gathered freshman members together for an introduction to life in Washington. This included a PowerPoint presentation given by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (and revealed by The Huffington Post in January) explaining time management on Capitol Hill.

The presentation laid out a nine- to 10-hour workday with three to four hours devoted solely to ""call-time,"" or the practice of calling donors to ask for campaign contributions, and another one to two hours spent going to fundraising events.

""There was the expectation that you would spend half your day calling for money [and] generating new leads by going to after-work get-togethers, meet-and-greets,"" said O'Rourke, who attended the meeting.

Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), himself a former DCCC chairman, said when asked about the recommended three to four hours per day of call-time, ""It's exactly why we need to change the system.""

Other members of Congress similarly voiced concerns about the constant pressure to raise money. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) described call-time as ""soul-crushing."" Yarmuth told HuffPost that it was ""an experience I quickly grew to abhor.""

Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), who represents a suburban swing district around Denver, said raising money comes with the territory, particularly when you're in a competitive seat.

""I know that's part of what is required of me in a swing district,"" Perlmutter told HuffPost, ""to raise money so that I can get up on the air, so that I can conduct the field program, do the parades, put out the yard signs, do the voter-to-voter contact that is required to win a swing district.""

He begins fundraising for his next race about a week after an election.

This constant race for money has made Congress dependent on a select donor class that is not representative of the American public. In the 2010 election, .05 percent of the U.S. population made at least one then-maximum contribution of $2,500 to a political candidate. Yet these donors accounted for 37 percent of all contributions to candidates, parties and PACs, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the 2012 election, these max-out donors -- there were slightly over 241,000 -- accounted for 51 percent of all contributions.

A host of recent political science research has found that Congress is most responsive to the concerns of the wealthy, while hardly registering the opinions of lower-income Americans.

Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, one of the new leaders of the campaign finance reform movement, has been outspoken about the corrupting influence of money in politics.

""There's a fundamental economy of influence in Washington that's kind of matured over the last 30 or 20 years,"" Lessig said. ""What's striking about this story is the pathological extent of this influence is really relatively recent. So it was my view that we weren't going to solve this problem by modest reforms.""

Lessig's high profile in Silicon Valley and across the Internet has helped attract a wider audience outside Washington to the issue of money in politics. In a popular TED talk earlier this year, he argued that the enormous amount of time spent fundraising from the wealthy plays a major role in warping the institution of Congress, resulting in a ""dependence corruption"" that he called ""democracy-destroying.""

""Now, by corruption, I don't mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of Congress,"" Lessig said in his talk. ""I don't mean any criminal act. The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal.""

""Larry has been very important in getting people focused on the issue,"" said Larry Kramer, a longtime acquaintance of Lessig's and president of the Hewlett Foundation, which is examining funding campaign finance reform efforts.

Large organizations are coming to the realization that the influence of money in politics is impeding progress on their primary issues. Hilary Shelton, NAACP senior vice president for advocacy, explained that money ""plays a spoiling role in campaigns,"" by limiting the number and type of candidates who hail from lower-income and minority communities. The goal, he said, is to get those elected to ""better represent the real values of the communities in which they're running.""

""We're realizing these days that we have no chance of fighting climate change and creating a clean energy economy, much less protecting wildlife and wild land, if we can't also protect our democracy,"" said Sierra Club President Michael Brune.

The best solution to this, according to Lessig, is the legislation offered by Sarbanes and supported by other reformers, because it shifts the focus of fundraising away from big donors and toward the millions of Americans who cannot afford to make $1,000 contributions.

""I don't think the problem gets solved unless we have citizen-funded elections,"" Lessig said.

*****

The model that Lessig, Sarbanes and other reformers are championing is inspired by the public funding system that New York City adopted in 1999. That system provides a 6-to-1 match of public dollars on the first $175 of all contributions made to participating candidates. It has been hailed a big success for empowering donors in lower-income and minority neighborhoods. Observers have pointed to Bill de Blasio's victory in the Democratic mayoral primary this year as another success of the system.

Previous reform efforts sought to eliminate or severely limit private money in elections. In the ""clean money"" systems pushed at the state level in the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s, candidates would receive a lump-sum payment of public funds to cover the cost of the campaign, in exchange for renouncing nearly all private funding.

The presidential public funding system provides a 1-to-1 match on the first $250 of all contributions during the primaries and a lump-sum $91.2 million payment for the general election. Candidates are required to abide by spending limits in both the primary and general elections to receive the public funds.

But a series of Supreme Court decisions between 2008 and 2011 gutted provisions in both the federal campaign finance laws and clean money systems, and the Citizens United decision ensured that outside money could not be kept away from elections. The lump sum provided in the presidential system eventually became too small for general election candidates. In 2008, Barack Obama became the first candidate to not participate in the program during the general election, and in 2012, neither Obama nor Mitt Romney took part.

Unlike other campaign finance reform efforts, the New York City model accepts the role of private money in elections. In 2001, progressive writer Mark Schmitt called the city's system ""an evolutionary leap,"" because it acknowledges that loopholes in campaign finance laws will always exist and that there is no way to completely prevent private money from finding its way into elections.

Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer, the dean of the Washington-based reform community, embraced the New York City model as an answer to the broken presidential financing system following the 2008 election.

Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21.

""It is completely focused on the role of the citizen in financing elections in a post-Citizens United world, and it is designed to empower them and encourage their participation by making their contributions much more important,"" Wertheimer said.

Whereas the previous generation of reformers had attempted to get money out of politics, the current efforts aim to change the nature of fundraising rather than to end it completely.

""What's great about matching funds is it still incentivizes candidates to build real grassroots support in perpetuity to get more and more matching funds, and it signals to the little guy that their small-dollar contribution can make a big difference,"" Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green said.

Lessig simply rejects the basic premise behind previous reform efforts. ""I just think it's terrible to think about creating a First Amendment that says that money is not speech,"" he said. ""That's just crazy.""

Not everyone in the reform community agrees, however, that the Sarbanes bill represents the full realization of the small-donor empowerment model created in New York City.

Veteran reform groups in Washington, led by Wertheimer, back competing legislation put forward by Reps. David Price (D-N.C.) and Van Hollen, which would provide a 5-to-1 match on the first $250 of any contribution up to $1,250 for congressional candidates. It would also provide a similar small-donor matching system for presidential elections and clarify the law restricting coordination between super PACs and candidates.

Other progressive groups argue that the Price-Van Hollen bill would continue to empower big donors more than small donors. Green called the bill ""weak and ineffective.""

""It just doesn't solve the problem and really just creates subsidies for big-dollar donors,"" he said.

Wertheimer disagrees, saying that the Price-Van Hollen bill is ""the closest"" to the New York City model ""of any of those bills around.""

The Sarbanes bill, Wertheimer argues, is not true to the New York City model because it only matches contributions of $100 or less and places low contribution limits on participating candidates. The New York City system matches the first $175 of any donation.

""It's very difficult for me to understand how groups that are supporting and advocating strongly the same kind of system in New York that exists in the Price-Van Hollen proposal can then credibly turn around and say, 'Well, that's just too objectionable for us,'"" Wertheimer said.

Other supporters of the Price-Van Hollen bill, however, find the protest by some progressives unnecessary.

""It's not worth spending a whole lot of time fighting about any of this stuff,"" said Meredith McGehee, policy director of the Campaign Legal Center. ""There's always a tendency within any coalition to gather around in a circular firing squad and shoot each other.""

Though they've welcomed the new crop of campaign finance reformers, longtime activists believe the focus of reformers should be on building political support for their ideas in Washington.

""A lot of times it's the down and dirty how-do-you-win-this in politics,"" McGehee said.

But those pushing to upend the way campaigns are financed say that they need to look beyond the machinations on Capitol Hill and embrace a bigger, bolder vision.

""Nearly everyone in the movement and outside of it accepts the fact that we are going to need to build a huge grassroots movement if we have any chance of doing anything,"" said Josh Silver, CEO of Represent.Us, a new reform group organizing around its own bill to empower small donors and reform lobbying laws.

To do that, Silver said, there needs to be a significant shift in how reformers talk about the issue.

""You have to shift to corruption and away from democracy and campaign finance reform and getting money out of politics,"" Silver said, echoing the language Lessig has used. ""The top-line message has to be corruption. The simple reason is if you go to a Walmart or you're at a campground or you're at church and you talk to somebody about campaign finance reform or even democracy, their eyes tend to glaze over. If you talk to them about political corruption, they get fired up and start talking about how much they agree with you.""

*****

Instead of looking to the traditional reform effort's backers -- typically large foundations like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which tend to dole out small amounts of cash for isolated projects -- the new class of reformers are looking to an alternate source of capital.

""It's going to need money on a completely different order of magnitude than anybody is talking about,"" Lessig said.

McGehee agrees. ""If you look at the traditional funders on the reform side, they dole out little teaspoons at a time. What's your deliverable? What's your conference? You're never going to have societal change when you approach it like that.""

To back their bold vision, the new crop of reformers are looking to funders who similarly embrace societal change: Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.

""These are people who think about taking risks in order to produce world-changing results,"" Lessig said. ""This is the venture capital mindset. It's, 'OK, I'm going to sink $50 million in this and maybe nothing comes of it, but if something comes of it, it's world-changing and that's the kind of game I'm interested in. I'm not interested in on-average 3 percent return. I'm interested in radical change in the way the world is.'""

Silver said that much of Represent.Us funding has come from Silicon Valley, including from current and former employees of Google and Facebook.

""I found this really, really resonates with a wide variety of people,"" Ethan Beard, former social media director for Facebook and a board member and funder of Represent.Us, said. ""It's been getting great support from people here in Silicon Valley.""

Another group, the Fund for the Republic, is working to raise $40 million over the next five years for the numerous new and old groups working to reform campaign finance law.

""The funding is way too programmatically focused and way too focused on short-term returns, and we have to take a play out of the conservative playbook and think about funding for structural issues, which means we have to think in a longer time scale and be less concerned with specific programs initially and more with the overall strategy and health of the field,"" said Nick Penniman, president of the Fund for the Republic.

The large membership organizations that have recently joined the reform effort note that their members are ready to be mobilized.

""The thing that we bring to this whole fight has always been our greatest strength, whether it be us or the Sierra Club or the NAACP, which is our members and getting them engaged in the process,"" said Shane Larson, legislative director for the Communications Workers of America.

Given the partisan gridlock in Washington, any chance for success also relies on motivating conservatives as well as liberals.

""I think that actually the right is a natural base,"" Lessig said. ""We're never going to get a majority of Republicans in Congress, but I do think we can get a majority of outside-the-Beltway Republicans to agree with this point, absolutely.""

Richard Painter, a former ethics counsel to President George W. Bush, agrees. ""I'm of the view that there's no way you're going to limit the size and scope of government unless you deal with the money in the campaigns, because all these people do, who want to soak off the government for more contracts, is hire lobbyists, put a little campaign money, and then you get enormous leverage from it,"" he said.

Painter is a proponent of the concept of tax credits or vouchers for contributions, which would give all Americans the means to take part in the money election that precedes the general election.

""Some would call that government subsidy,"" Painter said. ""I don't. I think that's a taxpayer's money. It's not the government's money. And my view is that if you pay taxes, you ought to be able to designate some of that money for the process of choosing who is going to spend the money.""

All the new energy around campaign finance reform notwithstanding, the effort still faces an uphill battle.

""I think it will probably take some critical issue or scandal or monumental event to move Congress to actually act on this, because the record low approval rating, all the other frustrations voiced by the American public, really doesn't seem to be moving this,"" Rep. O'Rourke said.

Indeed, Congress created much of the current campaign finance regulatory system after the Watergate scandal, and the McCain-Feingold reform legislation passed immediately following the Enron scandal in 2002.

""It's not an implausible final step,"" said Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, referring to waiting for a moment of public outrage. ""It's probably the easiest step of all.""

But sometimes even scandal isn't enough to facilitate change. There was, after all, a push for reform in 2009 and 2010 as well, following a global financial meltdown that many traced back to the financial industry's influence in Washington. That effort came up short.

This is where the divide between the new and old reformers comes into stark relief. While the new class of reformers are focused on selling a ""bold"" bill to grassroots Democrats and Republicans, veteran reformers talk about the end game in Washington.

""In the history of campaign finance reform battles going back to the Watergate reforms, they have never been won without bipartisan leadership and support, because someone has always got 41 votes out there, unless some things change,"" Wertheimer said, noting the number of votes needed to maintain a Senate filibuster.

Wertheimer worries that the Sarbanes bill's low matching fund threshold would not prove attractive to Republicans and would not provide enough money for candidates looking to compete in elections that feature super PACs lurking around the corner.

Time is also a concern for groups seeking to reform the system. Big membership groups now engaged on the issue envision a 10-year plan to organize support for a reform bill, and new groups focused on building a movement similarly take a long view.

Lessig believes, however, that reformers need to strike while Americans are still outraged by the Citizens United decision and before they accept the new levels of spending and sink into cynicism.

""This 10-year movement, I guess, I don't buy it,"" he said. ""And I don't buy it because I think it's got the physics of reform wrong."" Lessig advocates finding the ""Saturn V equivalent"" to blast the reform effort ""into orbit.""

Reform veterans point out that there will never be a final fix for campaign fundraising. ""Nobody ever says, 'Pass one tax bill and you're done,'"" McGehee said. ""Why should there be one campaign finance bill and then you're done? So it's kind of this constant struggle.""

The new reformers are not blind to the challenges of passing campaign finance legislation, particularly given the current partisan divide in Congress. But they still want to think big and bold.

""I'm not naive on that point, but what's the alternative to trying to press for something different here?"" Sarbanes asked.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chief-justice-roberts-and_b_3503768.html","Chief Justice Roberts and the Right-Wing Majority's True Colors","When John Roberts came before the Senate in 2005 for confirmation as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, many scribes penned encomiums to this undeniably conservative, but seemingly eminently reasonable and restrained judge. Writing in the New Yorker, Hendrick Hertzberg expressed concerns about Roberts views once he reached the high court. But he also allowed that Roberts was ""not, it appears, a hater; nor is he even a particularly rigid ideologue. Unlike Justices Scalia and Thomas, Roberts does not project a sense of resentful beleaguerment.""

Roberts, of course, worked assiduously to cultivate that image, famously insisting during his opening remarks before the Senate that he was merely an umpire calling balls and strikes and enforcing the rules of the game, not making them up. Then-Senator Biden did point out to Roberts that different umps had different strike zones and it was fair to ask Roberts a little bit about what his was. Roberts, an evidently highly intelligent and polished man, sailed through those hearings.

All of this, mind you, was obvious BS even at the time, to anyone paying attention. As I wrote during the confirmation hearings:

""Roberts' career is characterized not so much by a generalized fealty to judicial restraint, but to a highly selective version thereof, one that consistently favors powerful interests over the less advantaged and that appears consistently to advance the preferred conservative agenda of the day. According to [a report by the Alliance for Justice]: ""one can discern that Judge Roberts holds a troublingly limited view of the federal government's authority to enact key worker, civil rights and environmental safeguards and a similarly troublingly narrow view of the vital role of our courts and our government play in safeguarding our individual rights, especially civil and women's rights....these views, taken together, could produce a government with less power to protect ordinary people and give ordinary people less power to protect themselves from abuse by government and other powerful interests.""

This is, of course, precisely who Roberts has turned out to be. In order to arrive at yesterday's opinion, which the seasoned legal observer Paul Campos described as a ""travesty... of basic legal reasoning,"" Roberts had to create a new legal doctrine out of whole cloth. The Chief Justice insisted that the portions of the Voting Rights Act struck down yesterday violated the ""fundamental principle of equal sovereignty of the states."" The eminent jurist Richard Posner responded by saying ""this is a principle of constitutional law of which I have never heard"" because, in fact, ""there is no such principle.""

As many have pointed out, now is an especially disturbing time to claim that, because we have made so much progress over the past half century, proven mechanisms for ensuring voting rights are no longer necessary. In fact, over the past few years, we have seen a new war on voting pushed by right-wing activists and legislators all over the country. The transparently dishonest justification for these laws is the need to rein in voter fraud and ensure the integrity of the voting process. Voter fraud, of the sort that defenders of these new laws insist must be stopped is, as has been well-established, virtually non-existent. On the eve of last year's presidential election, John McCain's former campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, described voter fraud claims as ""bogus"" and part of the Republican Party's ""mythology."" The actual purpose of such legislation is, of course, to make it much more difficult for African Americans and other less favored groups of people to vote -- because when they do, they vote overwhelmingly Democratic. Sometimes, those pushing these laws are honest about their motives. When Pennsylvania passed a particularly problematic voter ID law last year, the House Majority leader of the Pennsylvania House, Mike Turzai, didn't declare triumphantly that Pennsylvania could now ensure integrity in its elections. Instead, to wild cheers from his cronies, he thundered that the legislation had just successfully delivered the state to Mitt Romney (much of the law was later tossed out and, of course, Romney did not win Pennsylvania).

In fact, the toner cartridge was barely dry on Roberts' execrable opinion yesterday when several states announced that previously blocked voter suppression laws would go into force immediately, including in Texas -- where hundreds of thousands of voters might now be adversely affected -- and Mississippi.

Writing in the Nation, Ari Berman rightly denounced the Court's right-wing majority in a post yesterday titled, ""What the Supreme Court doesn't understand about the Voting Rights Act."" And in the piece itself, Berman quoted from Justice Ginsburg's dissent -- ""The sad irony of today's decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven so effective."" The sentiments are understandable -- and in Ginsburg's case, perhaps professionally prudent -- but the premises are wrong. The right-wing majority understands precisely how the VRA has been effective. That is why they gutted it. There is no misunderstanding, no well-intentioned but misguided application of the law. They are neither dumb nor naïve. They are merely without conscience. When Chief Justice Roberts extolled the progress of the past fifty years in justifying his decision to try to undermine that progress, the irony should have been lost on no one, since the conservative movement has worked ceaselessly to try to roll back and reverse that progress. (Remember Trent Lott, former Senate Majority leader, lamenting in 2002 how much better things would have been if Strom Thurmond's vision of a segregated America had prevailed?)

As Adam Serwer wrote yesterday, Roberts has worked hard to avoid being painted with that brush. Serwer reminded readers that during oral arguments in February in the Shelby v. Holder case -- the one the Court ruled on -- Scalia blurted out that the Voting Rights Act represented the ""perpetuation of racial entitlement."" One needs to step back for a moment to appreciate just how extraordinary and revealing that statement was. Roberts himself appears to have been a determined opponent of the VRA since he was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department in the early 1980s (so much for his claim that the long passage of time now provides a justification for gutting the law). But Roberts doesn't project an air of ""resentful beleaguerment."" And just as it's become a favored trick of the contemporary right to pretend to admire Martin Luther King while trying to undermine everything he stood for, so the clever and cunning Roberts knew enough in his Shelby opinion to pretend to extol the virtues of a law he has long wanted to bury. He's tried to put a ""moderate"" face on what has been a consistently extremist agenda, but it's that agenda, including rolling back civil rights protections to the maximum possible extent -- that animates Roberts and his cronies' jurisprudence (and see Rick Hasen's discussion about why Roberts thought it might be politically prudent to hold off on killing affirmative action for the time being). Emily Bazelon, in Slate, described Roberts as a ""stealth conservative"" who has successfully concealed his political agenda. That gig should have been up before he ever reached the high court.

But yesterday should have removed the last shred of doubt. Roberts is a Stepford judge -- the tip of the spear of the conservative movement's three decade long march through the judiciary -- a robotic ideologue ceaselessly committed to undermining legal protections for the vulnerable while further stacking the deck in favor of the already-powerful. There's no principle here -- no respect for judicial restraint, or original intent or limited government or any of the other nonsense by which right-wingers try to defend their judicial ""philosophy."" Only a remorseless attack on common decency for the sake of enriching and empowering their ideological allies.","2013-06-26 12:08:33","1","14.0","4.0","0.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","122.0","87.0","0.0","173.0","0.0","55.0","17","1287","90.55","54.34","16.16","23.34","26.27","27.74","75.84","45.92","7.46","2.95","0.23","0.39","0.08","1.48","0.78","4.51","8.86","14.61","6.68","4.35","5.52","1.55","11.11","4.27","2.18","1.55","1.01","2.18","4.66","2.25","2.41","0.47","0.93","0.39","4.90","0.00","0.00","0.08","1.63","10.88","2.56","2.41","1.09","2.10","1.79","2.33","1.55","0.85","0.31","0.31","0.23","0.08","0.08","0.00","0.08","9.63","0.85","2.64","5.44","0.70","1.40","4.35","5.59","0.23","12.51","1.32","5.75","5.36","3.96","0.39","0.16","0.08","0.00","0.23","0.39","0.16","0.08","0.00","0.16","0.00","17.25","4.20","5.21","0.16","0.08","0.08","0.00","2.56","2.41","1.79","0.62","0.16","6545","8.6","27.80851063829787","2008","1277","50","45.59","14.5","13.2","13.87","16.4","299","10.8","21.565700861393893","618","24.34","7","0.44","0","42","8","142","0","156","135","4","2","11","194","121","3","63","0","0","31","16","84","1","0","8","41","0","54","56","29","32","14","35","6","4","0","12"
"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/child-care-costs-census-report_n_3015607.html","Child Care Costs: 'Who's Minding The Kids?' Report From Census Bureau Shows Rise Since 1985","A new report from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that child care costs have risen dramatically since the 1980s.

The report, called ""Who's Minding The Kids? Child Care Arrangements: Spring 2011"" and released on Wednesday, also showed a 10 percent drop in the number of families paying for child care at all, from 42 percent in 1997 to 32 percent in 2011. Data was drawn from the Survey of Income and Program Participation.

In families of children younger than 15 where the mother was employed, average child care spending increased from $84 to $143 per week, in constant 2011 dollars, between 1985 and 2011, the report said.

That means parents today are devoting 7 percent of their average monthly income to child care -- a proportion that has barely wavered since 1986.

However, that 7-percent average masks a fairly dramatic gap; families at or above the poverty line in 2011 spent 8 percent of their income on childcare, the report found, while those living in poverty spent 30 percent.

Full-time child care workers' median wage in 2011 was $19,098; in 1990, it was actually slightly higher at $19,680, in constant U.S. dollars.

The children profiled received care from a wide variety of sources, ranging from parents, grandparents and non-relatives to daycare centers, after-school activities and self-care.

A 2012 report by Child Care Aware of America showed that while child care is expensive everywhere, there are major disparities in child care costs between states. Child care was found to be least expensive in Mississippi, where parents pay an average of $3,911 per year, and highest in Massachusetts, where the average yearly cost is $14,980.

According to the USDA, the cost of raising a child to age 17 jumped by 8.5 percent in the ten years from 2001 to 2011 (not including college), with $41,100 of parents' projected expenditure on babies born in 2011 set aside for ""child care and education"" (as opposed to $22,138.27 for babies born in 2001).

The money-management organization LearnVest offers tips for cutting child care costs by researching tax breaks, investigating nonprofit options and trying out shared care.","2013-04-05 14:27:06","1","15.0","1.0","0.0","2.0","14.0","0.0","112.0","91.0","0.0","211.0","0.0","53.0","19","362","99.00","81.16","39.07","95.50","27.85","23.48","77.90","36.74","2.76","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.55","2.21","6.63","18.23","3.31","2.49","3.87","0.28","12.15","4.42","2.21","1.10","11.05","4.42","4.70","4.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.50","3.31","0.00","0.28","0.28","4.97","1.10","0.83","0.00","1.38","0.55","1.38","1.10","0.83","0.28","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","9.67","2.49","0.55","6.91","0.00","0.00","4.70","6.91","0.00","16.85","1.38","9.67","6.35","6.63","1.38","0.83","6.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.72","4.42","7.73","0.28","0.55","0.28","0.00","2.21","1.10","0.83","1.10","2.21","1702","8.29","28.23076923076923","515","350","16","57.71","12.0","10.7","12.47","13.7","79","7.5","19.78857142857143","208","25.0","7","0.35","0","9","42","26","0","63","18","2","1","0","68","27","0","29","0","0","2","2","9","0","1","1","9","0","5","12","12","14","4","6","1","0","0","3"

""If I were to have came out and said that I was gay, which I'm not gay...back in 1996, people would have said, 'Oh, we knew,'"" Rodman, who recently launched his Bad Boy Vodka Brand, quipped.



Despite Rodman's high-profile romance with Madonna and a brief marriage to Carmen Electra, the basketball star's colorful and flamboyant style made him the frequent source of media speculation.

Still, he seemed supportive of current NBA star Jason Collins' coming out this past spring, saying he wished other players would similarly come forward.

Regarding Magic Johnson, he added, ""I was the only player to say, 'I don't give a damn [that you are HIV-positive] I just want to play you.'""

I communicate every day with dozens of people I've never met. Meanwhile, real friends never call... People beg you to 'like' their page, as if that will somehow add substance to their yearning existence.""

So writes my friend Michael Musto who sounds a teeny tiny bit disillusioned with the Internet.

Getting serious: The best, the finest, the smartest TV reporter in the world is Lesley Stahl of ""60 Minutes."" Show me anybody else on the air who can match her these days.

In a time of ""reality programming mania,"" drones and vampires and the undead... talking heads aimlessly nattering on -- Lesley still goes out to get the really big true story.

So, if you missed her last Sunday outing where she showed the building boom in China about to go bust, you really missed something. China has thrown its all into building Manhattan-type high-rise cities where people pay their entire life savings to buy space, but nobody can afford to live there -- and nobody does. There are miles of high-rise buildings with empty lobbies and empty streets around them. These incredible clusters of buildings stand now still empty.

Peasants and really poor people are seen gathering the crushed bricks, stones and sticks discarded when their villages were torn down to make room for an architectural tomorrow that seems now not to be coming.

Thinking this was the basis of a beginning building boom and the economy of a future modern China, many of these clusters display ""signs"" in their empty lobbies for the popular U.S. retail stores, cafes, fast-food and health obsessions that we see in almost every American city.

But such ""stores"" are just Chinese wishful thinking; they don't even exist.

This revelatory outing on CBS News has to be seen to be believed. Two days after Lesley aired this story, headlines yesterday read: ""Chinese Stocks Plunge on Plan to Tax Home Sales 20 percent.""

The Çhinese are going crazy over this development, a bubble burst like none other in all the history of modern construction and economics.

Also, China's billionaire real estate mogul, Zhang Xin, interviewed by Lesley for this story, told the CBS correspondent that she believes China's inevitable shift to democracy will come within -- perhaps even before, the next twenty years!

But, first -- utter turmoil?

Do you think the participants themselves enjoy or detest the Academy Awards?. (We're not speaking of the winners; they always enjoy themselves.)

Following, I am going to offer something that might hit a few entertainment nerves, but is absolutely authentic, even though I'm not going to name the person who wrote it. She has to keep working in show business.

She has walked the red carpet, attended the Oscar parties before and after, and is someone who once won an Academy award herself. Here she goes:

""I was proud of my pals Craig Zadan and Neil Meron who produced this year. It seems folks tuned in and approved more than not. It was a wonderful experience to be in the audience; such fun to see so many talented folks show off the goods... to see Charlize dancing, Catherine hoofing and singing, Meryl and Daniel together onstage,

Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas looking splendid, the 'Les Miz' cast singing, Barbra/Adele/Shirley all so out of this world. It was a treat!

""But for some of the rest of it, from the un-natural nature of putting on a big gown -- as if you are an arcade duck -- to parade in front of the armed carnival gamers.

""One is smiling at the red carpet photogs who, on any other day, hunt and harass in order to contrive moments of humiliation on which to profit. In an age where cruel, quick, unfounded presumptions become irrefutable truth -- well, I get nervous sometimes and stumble. We all do. So that is unfortunate for a gal in a culture that sees humanity-in-celebrity as buffoonery.

""Alas -- snark after the Oscars is like traffic in L.A.

There's no use reacting to it, because it's inevitable. You have to expect it and enjoy the ride anyway!""

And here, you thought most actors were stupid.



Basketball show-off Dennis Rodman revealed that he was not only naïve but downright ignorant of the realities of North Korean human-rights offenses. But this guy, with more piercings even than Mrs. Lincoln's dressmaker, his dark glasses, his usual outrageous attire -- did this make him a bad person?

No matter. Both the TV and writing press and those Harvard-Yale guys at the State Department have reacted as if Dennis Rodman slapped the Queen. (Even the perspicacious Cokie Roberts bothered to comment on his dress on the air instead of ignoring it.)

Still and all, Dennis Rodman is the only American who has been allowed to get near the young dictator Kim Jong Un. So wouldn't it have been wiser for State to quietly meet with Dennis, explain things to him, ask him questions in person about this unusual event and further information about the leader of a country, maybe prep him for more visits and further info about the grandson of a country threatening nuclear mayhem? What did they have to lose?

And who really cares about correcting Dennis Rodman's idea of Kim as ""good guy."" I'm asking you?

Instead, they all reacted with supreme superior Anglo-Saxon, Latino and African-American culture shock, exclaiming at how dumb he is. The press in print and on TV and later on the networks, on MSNBC and on Fox. It was more important to ""correct"" Mr. Rodman than to use him.

Instead of talking to Dennis about his message that the President should call Kim, they have tried to kill the only messenger we have ever had from and about North Korea.

"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dennis-rodman-nkorea-lead_n_2801197.html","Dennis Rodman: North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un Wants Obama To Call","WASHINGTON -- Former NBA star Dennis Rodman, in his first interview since returning from North Korea last week, had a message for President Barack Obama: Kim Jong Un wants the president to give him a call.

""He wants Obama to do one thing: Call him,"" Rodman said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""He said, 'If you can, Dennis -- I don't want [to] do war. I don't want to do war.' He said that to me.""

The comment follows Rodman's bizarre trip to Pyongyang, North Korea, with the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team and a camera crew from Vice magazine. During his visit, he sat next to the North Korean leader at a basketball game, attended a party at his palace and quickly became the most high-profile apologist for the dictator.

On Sunday, Rodman told host George Stephanopoulos that he considers Kim Jong Un a ""friend,"" a ""great guy"" and ""very humble.""

The North Korean government is considered one of the world's most brutal, offering its people prison camps and mass starvations. Recently, tensions have been mounting between the United States and North Korea, which in February conducted its third nuclear test. The regime has also ramped up its rhetoric against both the U.S. and South Korea, warning that U.S. forces would ""meet a miserable destruction"" if they continued scheduled military drills with South Korean troops.

That North Korea is so closed to outsiders has put Rodman in the unlikely position of cultural ambassador. ""There is nobody at the CIA who can tell you more personally about Kim Jong Un than Dennis Rodman,"" remarked ABC News military analyst Col. Steve Ganyard, ""and that in itself is scary.""","2013-03-03 10:35:40","0","9.0","1.0","0.0","3.0","10.0","0.0","113.0","87.0","0.0","173.0","0.0","56.0","17","275","87.01","87.03","12.79","4.10","19.64","18.55","76.73","41.09","10.91","5.82","1.09","0.00","0.73","3.64","0.36","5.09","7.64","11.64","6.18","1.82","4.00","1.09","12.00","4.00","2.18","0.73","1.45","1.45","3.64","0.73","2.91","1.09","1.45","0.36","14.18","0.00","1.09","0.00","4.00","6.55","1.45","0.73","2.55","1.82","0.00","1.45","1.45","0.00","1.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.82","2.91","1.09","5.82","0.36","0.36","3.64","8.36","0.73","16.36","2.18","8.36","6.18","4.00","2.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.73","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","25.09","6.55","6.18","0.73","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.82","6.55","2.55","0.00","0.73","1277","7.77","21.692307692307693","393","274","16","71.04","11.7","7.6","11.13","10.4","57","7.083333333333334","17.161167883211682","179","20.85","11","0.42","0","8","2","22","0","31","25","0","0","3","42","57","1","8","0","0","14","6","6","1","2","1","8","0","7","12","3","5","4","11","1","1","0","0"
"http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-hasten-an-end-to-police-investigating-police/wcm/ef037a4d-223e-4cc2-ab7e-c02aebd23562","Editorial: Hasten an end to police investigating police","MONTREAL — It has taken an inordinately long time, but Quebec has at last legislated the creation of an independent body to investigate cases of death and serious injury at the hands of police.

A proposed law to that effect was adopted by the National Assembly this month and came into effect May 15. It was introduced last November after many calls for a change in the long-standing Quebec practice of having such incidents involving police from one force investigated by officers from another force.

Among those calling for the reform was Quebec’s ombudsman, Raymonde Saint-Germain, who did so in a 2010 report. In it, she noted that the first such special report on police investigating police had been submitted 20 years previously. She further noted that Quebec has long had a handy model for such a body next door in the form of the Ontario Civilian Police Commission, established in 1990.

Critics of the Quebec system had long complained that public trust is severely challenged by police investigating themselves. A glaring example of such trust being shaken was the investigation into the 2008 police shooting of teenager Fredy Villanueva. It was revealed that not only were the investigators slow in questioning the officers involved, but that the implicated officers were allowed to communicate with each other before being interviewed, something denied civilian suspects.

It was also noted during hearings on the legislation that of 339 police investigations into incidents involving officers during the previous dozen years, only three had resulted in charges being laid.

So far, no steps have been taken to implement the change, even though it was evident well before the proposed law’s passage that it would be adopted. The government has yet to name a director or a deputy director, the first steps in setting up what will be called the Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes. Those two directors will subsequently recommend bureau investigators, half of whom are to be former police officers.

A case currently under investigation according to the rules of the old system illustrates the need for the government to get on with the job sooner than later.

It involves the shooting in January of last year of a mentally disturbed homeless man who was killed by police officers in the Bonaventure métro station after he had attacked them with a knife.

While the Sûreté du Québec is supposed to have exclusive jurisdiction over the investigation, it has been revealed by Gazette reporter Linda Gyulai that the Société de transport de Montréal provided surveillance video of the investigation not only to the SQ, but also to representatives of the Montreal police, which is not supposed to be involved in the investigation.

This is precisely the kind of thing that undermines public confidence in the system of police investigating police, and it highlights the need for clear rules of procedure that the new system should bring into force.

The government has said it may take a year to establish the bureau. But this latest controversial case suggests action is needed sooner than that.","2013-05-28 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","508","94.55","60.87","27.00","25.77","26.74","25.20","83.07","49.41","8.27","0.98","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.59","0.39","7.28","10.83","15.35","9.25","3.15","2.76","0.79","12.60","3.94","2.36","0.98","2.56","0.59","2.76","1.38","1.38","0.39","0.39","0.00","5.91","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.39","8.46","1.18","2.36","0.98","1.57","0.79","2.36","1.38","0.98","0.20","0.20","0.79","0.79","0.20","0.00","0.00","10.63","0.20","1.18","8.27","0.98","0.39","6.50","5.31","1.18","15.35","1.97","6.50","7.09","8.66","0.20","0.20","2.56","0.20","0.39","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","7.68","3.74","3.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.00","2492","8.85","26.894736842105264","815","508","19","44.37","14.7","13.7","12.77","16.1","125","12.375","22.52251968503937","268","23.74","5","0.47","0","8","9","64","4","77","34","0","1","5","83","32","0","30","0","0","16","0","24","3","0","1","13","0","14","25","14","29","3","17","1","4","0","0"

But as a francophone, I have a different view.

Like Matthew McCully, I am fully bilingual. I am a lawyer and I proudly serve my clients in the language of their choice, whether it’s French, English, Spanish or Danish. Like McCully, I have lived abroad, having studied and worked in Denmark, Sweden, Bolivia, Belgium and England. As a French Canadian, I learned English while studying at McGill University and in England.

I have never been discriminated against because of my mother tongue. And like many from my generation, I find English useful in order to connect with the rest of the planet.

However, I think it is necessary for French to be Quebec’s official language. And I disagree with the suggestion I sometimes see in The Gazette that my generation is uninterested in language issues. I worry about linguistic diversity and about the loss of languages in the world, and I wonder whether there will be more than 10 actively spoken languages a couple of centuries from now.

With 90 per cent of Internet pages currently being written in only 12 languages and (according to UNESCO) a language dying out every other week on average, there are grounds for concern about the loss of language diversity and the growing global power of English.

Over the past 20 years, globalization has intensified. And in the context of accelerated immigration, tourism and mass communication, English has become everyone’s common linguistic denominator, regardless of where they live or work. We see it everywhere.

Many francophones nowadays write in English on their Facebook profiles. Why? They want to be understood by their friends everywhere.

English is increasingly becoming the common linguistic denominator in Montreal, too. With large numbers of newcomers to the city, whether students, tourists or immigrants, English is inexorably becoming the standard language that allows you to be understood by everyone.

Are English-speaking Montrealers to blame for this? Not at all. They have improved in French over the past few decades, just as francophones have in English. What, then, is the problem?

The problem is that institutionalized bilingualism eventually marginalizes the weaker language. It’s like Beta versus VHS: once the vast majority has adopted VHS, it is difficult to continue with Beta.

The experiences of my family and my friends who work in the federal public service are instructive. In principle, our federal public sector is bilingual; but in practice, many meetings start with “Good morning everyone/Bon matin tout le monde,” and then the rest of the proceedings are in English only.

That is because English works, as the common denominator. By comparison, French lacks critical mass. And now we see that the federal government is calling for cuts in translation spending, and using English only.

This reminds me of many people I know who came to Montreal to learn French but didn’t: good faith was not enough. Good faith is insufficient without consistent exposure to French. This is also, by the way, the problem that the Gaelic revival is facing in Ireland.

In March 2012, L’actualité published a poll in which a large majority of anglophones respondents age 18 to 34 predicted that globalization will soon make Montreal a predominantly English-speaking city. Last month, the anglophone lobby CRITIQ wrote to elected officials at the city of Montreal to have the city charter amended to make Montreal an officially bilingual city; Mayor Michael Applebaum said no.

For many French Canadians, there’s this sense now in the city that we are drifting back to the time of Maurice Richard, when French was difficult to use in Montreal, although the reasons for the difficulties now (globalization) are different. So overall, for me, the language debate does matter — and precisely because I am a citizen of the world, concerned about diversity in the age of globalization.

St-Pierre Plamondon is vice-president of Delegatus, a Montreal law firm. He is also the president of Génération d’idées, a discussion forum for Quebecers age 20 to 35.

It is a risk that Mayor Michael Applebaum is running by moving precipitously to sue individuals and construction firms that admitted to corrupt practices before the Charbonneau Commission. He struck a righteous pose in announcing this week that the city will go after money stolen from Montreal taxpayers by crooked entrepreneurs and public servants who have avowed their misdeeds to the inquiry, but the initiative may well backfire.

Initially identified targets include former civil servants Gilles Surprenant, Luc Leclerc and François Thériault. Engineering supervisors Surprenant and Leclerc confessed to having taken $600,000 and $500,000 respectively in bribes and kickbacks from construction firms in return for inflating costs and adding false extras to contracts. Thériault, who was a city inspector, admitted only to taking hockey tickets and wine in exchange for favours, but was found on further investigation to have received unspecified “monetary advantages.”

In the effort to recoup funds, the city will try to annul dodgy real-estate transactions whereby Surprenant and Leclerc transferred ownership of their suburban homes to close relatives shortly before testifying, suggesting an intent to avoid having the properties seized in case of subsequent prosecution.

This week’s move follows an earlier announcement by Applebaum that all companies whose executives confessed to having participated in collusion and corruption in public works over the years will be barred from receiving city contracts for the next five years.

Certainly, Montreal’s greatly abused taxpayers would, understandably, like to see punishment rendered swiftly to those who abused the public trust for illicit personal gain. But in both cases, the risk involved in proceeding now is that it will dissuade further commission witnesses from coming clean with their own transgressions if they see those who have chosen to stonewall getting off without repercussions.

Applebaum dismisses this worry out of hand, but it was reported that his edict on contracts was greeted with irritation and consternation behind closed doors at the commission.

There is also the question as to whether the city is within its rights to take legal action against commission witnesses on the basis of their testimony. A key condition for witnesses appearing before the commission is that they are granted immunity from prosecution on the basis of their testimony. The mayor maintains that city hall’s in-house lawyers have assured him that civil prosecutions of the sort envisaged are not covered by the immunity provision. However, this is strenuously disputed by the lawyers of those targeted.

It is also reasonable to wonder whether the city administration is not trying to raise a smokescreen with these hasty lawsuits in order to obscure the role it played in enabling the corruption that flourished either under the noses of civic officials or, in some cases, with their participation. Commission testimony has revealed that civic authorities ignored repeated warnings of the flourishing corruption, and auditor-general’s reports suggest that chronic administrative incompetence greatly enabled it.

Whether or not this is in part the administration’s motivation here, it risks winding up with egg on its face and hefty legal bills on its hands with this rush to justice.","2013-05-31 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","530","92.08","63.29","40.94","11.21","27.89","32.64","77.17","46.04","9.06","2.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.57","1.51","6.98","6.60","16.60","6.42","2.26","5.47","0.75","11.13","2.64","2.08","1.51","0.94","1.13","3.96","1.32","2.45","1.32","0.57","0.00","7.55","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.57","9.25","2.45","1.70","0.38","2.26","0.57","3.40","1.51","0.75","0.19","0.38","1.89","0.75","0.57","0.00","0.57","9.62","0.38","2.45","4.72","1.51","1.32","2.45","6.79","1.13","14.72","2.45","8.11","4.34","4.15","0.94","0.57","1.51","0.38","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","9.62","3.58","3.77","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.57","0.38","0.94","0.00","0.38","2831","9.58","29.72222222222222","860","525","19","43.46","15.8","14.1","15.32","18.6","152","7.25","24.62095238095238","306","26.89","1","0.44","0","20","5","49","0","78","43","1","0","7","81","25","0","52","0","0","11","10","21","0","0","1","21","0","20","18","19","19","9","18","1","4","1","0"

The screaming headline on Le Devoir’s front page on Tuesday, “Applebaum at the mafia’s restaurant,” put Applebaum in the position of having to deny that he has mob ties. And while he did so quite credibly, for despite the headline the accompanying story offered no evidence of malfeasance, the media fallout may have put unwarranted suspicions in many minds.

The established facts are that Applebaum, who was only a city councillor at the time, attended a private fundraising event in 2003 along with Gérald Tremblay who was mayor at the time, Tremblay’s brother Marcel, then also a city councillor, and Frank Zampino, then chairman of the city executive committee. The event was at the La Cantina restaurant on upper St. Laurent Blvd.

It is true that the restaurant was known to be frequented by members of the Rizzuto crime family, and that its owner at the time, Federico Del Peschio, was gunned down in the establishment’s parking lot — six years later, in 2009. Beyond that, however, the restaurant was a popular venue, and its clientele for the most part consisted of eminently respectable Montrealers of a variety of mother tongues.

It is also the case that Zampino has more recently been arrested in connection with investigations by UPAC, the provincial anti-corruption squad, but in 2003 he was by all evidence a respectable municipal official. Others present were members of the local Italian business community, and the dozen donations of $1,000 and one of $500 made to the mayor’s party on the evening were duly reported. It might also be noted that such fundraising events were hardly unique to Applebaum’s former party, Union Montreal.

Last week, Le Devoir also made a splash with the report that Applebaum was under investigation by the anti-corruption squad in connection with a real-estate deal in Notre Dame de Grâce where he was previously the borough mayor. The allegation in this case was that he arranged a generous subsidy and a zoning change for a housing project by construction entrepreneur Tony Magi, who has been reported to have mob ties.

However, Applebaum, backed by N.D.G. borough urban planning director Daniel Lafond, has explained that far from doing favours for Magi, he denied him zoning changes and that the project in question, which included subsidies for the construction of affordable housing units, was overseen by Montreal city hall authorities, not by the borough.

These allegation and insinuations against Applebaum are an unfortunate byproduct of the entirely legitimate and altogether necessary anti-corruption campaign undertaken by UPAC and the Charbonneau Commission. It has resulted in people being tarred with guilt by association simply for having visited certain premises, like La Cantina and the upscale private club 357c.

It might also be noted that along with freely according media interviews, Applebaum met on the weekend with leaders of opposition parties Vision Montreal and Projet Montréal, both of whom expressed satisfaction with his explanation and reiterated their confidence in him as mayor under the circumstances.

It could yet be that Applebaum is the subject of inquiries by the anti-corruption squad and Charbonneau Commission investigators. If that is the case, they should come out and say so and declare what evidence of wrongdoing they have against him.

Better that than allowing the proliferation of anonymous and unsubstantiated allegations, which tarnish not just Applebaum, but further drag the city’s repute through the mud.","2013-01-15 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","592","92.33","71.71","12.81","41.01","28.19","29.22","73.82","47.97","7.77","2.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.69","0.51","5.57","9.29","15.37","7.77","3.04","5.91","0.68","9.97","3.21","2.03","1.35","1.52","1.69","3.21","2.03","1.18","0.68","0.00","0.00","8.45","0.51","0.51","0.34","1.86","7.94","1.52","1.18","0.68","1.69","1.35","2.03","0.51","0.00","0.34","0.00","1.01","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.84","6.08","2.87","0.84","2.87","0.34","0.00","4.90","3.89","1.01","13.01","1.69","7.60","3.72","3.72","1.86","0.51","1.01","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.84","3.89","6.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.84","0.34","1.18","0.00","0.34","2967","9.35","29.95","945","585","20","41.74","16.0","14.7","13.88","18.0","158","12.125","24.523418803418807","311","26.55","5","0.46","0","21","9","63","1","97","36","1","1","6","111","60","0","34","0","0","17","4","30","1","0","2","6","0","14","27","11","22","4","10","4","5","0","1"

MONTREAL – Since it began its public hearings last fall, the Charbonneau commission has elicited a steady stream of jaw-dropping testimony.

There was former city engineer Gilles Surprenant admitting that he took hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks from construction bosses doing business with the city. The same with another city engineer, Luc Leclerc, who admitted that along with six-figure cash hauls came hockey tickets, cases of wine and free home renovation work. In the case of another engineer on the take, the bribes included an offer of hookers’ services.

There have been allegations that former executive committee chairman Frank Zampino, the right-hand man of former mayor Gérald Tremblay, was lining his pockets. There was contractor Lino Zambito recounting how he tried to rig the civic election in Boisbriand. There was engineering-firm president Michel Lalonde’s tale of hundreds of thousands of dollars illicitly funnelled to political parties over the past decade.

More recently, there was Nicolo Milioto, who practically had a monopoly on sidewalk construction in the city, professing not to know what the Mafia is. This despite surveillance video that showed him in the back of a gangster hangout, stuffing wads of cash into his socks in company with the late notorious local mobster Nicolo Rizzuto.

But what was quite possibly the most staggering testimony to date was rendered this week, by commission investigator Guy Desrosiers, who reported that city officials had been repeatedly warned of the rot in the public-works tendering system over a period of nearly 15 years, yet had let it slide.

The series of reports, dating back to 1997, that Desrosiers presented made it clear that not only were city hall authorities made aware of the problems within the public works department, but they were provided with clear and manageable recommendations on how to correct the situation. Yet over the years, the situation only deteriorated.

In the first of the reports cited, a report by the city’s auditor-general, a warning was sounded about the emergence of cartels of contractors who were inflating bids for city contracts. Four years later, the auditor-general again prodded the city administration on the subject, complaining that his previous recommendations had been ignored.

At the time, Pierre Bourque and his Vision Montreal party were in power. But the coming of Tremblay and his Union Montreal team in late 2001 apparently made no dent in the reigning duplicity.

A 2004 report estimated that the average cost of public works was between 30 per cent and 40 per cent greater than in other cities, likely because of collusion. Another, in 2006, showed that almost 60 per cent of Montreal’s public works contracts in 2005 had been awarded to just four companies. It lamented a “notorious absence of means to prevent and detect cartels, collusion, frauds and conflicts of interest.”

Yet another report, submitted in 2010, compared Montreal costs with those of similar projects in Longueuil and Quebec City and showed Montreal paying up to 85 per cent more for sewer and aqueduct work. It, too, suggested that money could be saved by cracking down on the cartel of local firms.

And yet again, as Desrosiers testified, city hall officials continued ignoring the recommendations.

When he resigned as mayor last November, Gérald Tremblay professed himself to be the victim of an unbearable injustice. He was referring to the testimony of one of his former political operatives, Martin Dumont, whose damning testimony that the mayor was aware of illicit payoffs has since been called into question. But this week’s documentary evidence as to his administration’s scandalous negligence in responding to repeated warnings about corruption would have made his position untenable.

Correction: Due to a reporting error, Wednesday’s editorial erroneously identified a former city engineer who testified before the Charbonneau Commission as Yves Leclerc. His name is Luc Leclerc.","2013-02-26 00:00:00","0","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","646","94.71","70.61","19.27","11.68","23.07","29.72","76.32","44.12","7.89","2.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.32","0.15","5.42","8.05","15.79","5.73","4.02","3.56","0.46","9.91","4.64","3.10","1.70","3.10","1.39","2.94","0.93","2.01","0.46","0.15","0.15","7.43","0.00","0.31","0.00","2.63","7.43","1.70","1.70","0.46","1.55","0.77","1.39","1.39","1.08","0.15","0.15","0.77","0.31","0.15","0.15","0.15","7.12","0.93","1.70","3.72","0.46","0.77","7.43","2.94","0.15","15.48","1.08","7.89","6.81","5.88","1.24","0.31","2.94","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.00","4.33","5.88","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.08","0.31","1.08","0.00","0.00","3299","9.24","24.14814814814815","1034","640","28","48.23","14.8","12.2","14.05","15.2","181","6.666666666666667","22.4725","360","21.93","3","0.42","0","16","15","61","0","101","45","3","0","2","123","49","1","48","0","0","12","10","25","1","1","1","14","0","11","49","18","18","2","9","1","7","1","3"
"http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-charbonneau-commissions-mandate-must-be-confirmed/wcm/16c91abe-25b4-44e8-9b0b-99d1632e0afb","Editorial: Charbonneau Commission’s mandate must be confirmed","MONTREAL — The Charbonneau Commission resumed hearings this week, facing immediate upheaval over issues of witness credibility and publication bans.

But the larger problem with the inquiry is starting to look conceptual, having to do with what it can and cannot investigate.

Martin Dumont, a former Union Montreal staffer, was back on the stand on opening day Monday to answer to accusations that he gave false testimony to the inquiry last fall. And proceedings on Wednesday were coloured by uncertainty over whether or not a publication ban relating to information about former executive committee chairman Frank Zampino should be allowed to stand. But against this backdrop, the commission’s core mandate is emerging as a key issue that needs to be resolved.

In a three-part series of stories by The Gazette’s Linda Gyulai published last Thursday through Saturday, Jean Fortier, who was executive committee chairman before Zampino, revealed that he was the object of bribes and other illegal manoeuvring for public contracts while he was former mayor Pierre Bourque’s right-hand man. And a lot of the time, he said, the attempts to corrupt him revolved around decisions relating to real-estate sales and zoning changes and other matters — not just the public-works contracts preoccupying the work of the Charbonneau Commission.

Fortier said he made it clear in a private overture to the Charbonneau Commission that he has something to say about the history and breadth of collusion and corruption in Montreal municipal affairs. But as he told The Gazette, he has not been invited to testify, nor has he been interviewed by any of its investigators. The problem, he said, is that the commission’s mandate is too narrow. His information doesn’t fit into the mandate. The commission’s mandate, in brief, is to investigate organized-crime infiltration of the construction industry and identify illegal methods used to obtain public construction contracts. There is no provision to probe allegations of bribery and other criminal activity not strictly related to construction. That’s a problem, Fortier contends, and he is right.

Fortier says he was offered bundles of cash, extravagant gifts and the open-ended promise of favours in return for access to his political power. He claims the offers poured in from fellow city councillors, developers, lobbyists and businessmen, including at least one businessman with links to organized crime. When he rejected those offers, he said, he became the object of threats, blackmail and other forms of intimidation, as did people close to him.

It’s instructive that Fortier’s first-hand accounts of graft and bribery came before the embattled provincial Liberals were at the helm, and before former mayor Gérald Tremblay’s Union Montreal dominated city hall. They occurred when Vision Montreal ran Montreal city hall and the Parti Québécois — under Lucien Bouchard and later Bernard Landry — was in power in Quebec City.

Fortier’s revelations suggest that the Charbonneau Commission can only do so much with the mandate it has, in terms of shedding full light on collusion and corruption. Limiting the commission’s focus to the Mafia and other criminal gangs, and to contracts for sewer pipes and road paving and the like, is not enough. It is a good start, but not sufficient.

The Marois government needs to make sure that people like Fortier can get a full hearing in an appropriate public forum. The government therefore should either tweak the mandate of the commission and reorganize the way it should work, or else create some sort of side pocket to the commission for depositions pertaining to non-construction-related allegations of collusion and corruption that could be studied in some subsequent inquiry.","2013-01-23 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","601","90.07","63.67","17.85","18.42","25.04","30.12","76.21","46.09","8.15","3.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.33","0.17","4.66","7.99","14.98","6.82","2.00","6.82","1.66","11.15","3.83","2.66","0.83","0.50","1.50","2.50","1.00","1.50","0.50","0.50","0.17","8.99","0.00","0.33","0.00","3.66","11.15","3.00","1.16","1.50","1.50","0.50","3.83","2.66","1.16","1.16","0.33","0.33","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.32","0.50","1.50","3.49","0.67","0.67","5.16","6.32","0.00","13.48","1.16","7.49","5.16","5.49","0.00","0.00","1.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.81","3.99","5.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.50","0.00","2.00","0.00","0.00","3064","8.76","25.541666666666668","957","596","24","46.3","14.8","13.0","13.93","16.1","147","14.625","21.78577181208054","318","22.96","1","0.46","0","33","2","55","0","72","49","2","1","7","113","52","0","42","0","1","25","3","15","0","0","0","25","0","25","33","14","14","2","20","3","2","0","2"

It is hard to see anything amusing about this much vaunted exercise that is shaping up as a discordant mess — a looming tragedy, really, in that indications are the summit is not likely to resolve anything, least of all the steadily worsening situation of Quebec’s universities.

With not even three weeks left before the summit opens on Feb. 25, the government has still not produced an agenda, or even a list of people it has invited to participate. Nor has it identified which proposals intended to solve the problems facing Quebec universities are to be debated — and this after the government has had five months to prepare for the event, after being elected on a promise to hold it. There is no reason to suspect that the two-day exercise will produce anything likely to satisfy the parties that will have representation at the table. Not the militant student associations, not the university administrators, not the union movement, and not the business community.

What the government is essentially seeking from the meeting is validation of the PQ decision to back last spring’s “red square” protest movement against the Charest government’s imposition of what were reasonable and timely tuition increases. These would have brought Quebec fees more in line with those in other provinces, but still among the lowest in the country.

First and foremost, the government is angling to use the summit to try to placate the militant student groups who seem to feel they have licence to dictate to the government on tuition, and threaten to wreak mayhem in the streets if they don’t get their way. But while the Marois administration has scrapped the proposed Liberal increases, it is moving now toward a half-measure solution — indexation, that is unlikely to please either the students or the universities.

Universities have made a persuasive case that they are underfunded by hundreds of millions of dollars compared with their counterparts in the rest of the country, and that consequently they are being forced to skimp and are losing top-flight talent and offering less in terms of services to students. The government, in response, has attacked the very notion that Quebec universities are underfunded, and has endorsed the view of student associations that claim the universities’ money problems are the result of profligacy. In keeping with this position, the government imposed $124-million in budget cuts on universities in its budget last fall.

The most moderate of the province’s three large student associations, the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec, wants an indefinite tuition freeze, with an eye to working toward abolishing tuition altogether sometime down the road. The most radical, the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSE), is pushing for commitment from the government to free tuition — and in far shorter order.

When Pierre Duchesne, the minister in charge of higher education, sensibly declared that Quebec cannot afford free tuition, ASSE leaders pitched a fit, threatening to boycott the summit and resort back to demonstrating in the streets — something that seems to worry the government more than underperforming universities.

What the government should have done in the months since its election last fall is to sit down for quiet consultations with university rectors and leaders of Quebec civil society. It has not. The breakdown in relations that has resulted, as well as the subtle demonization of university administrators in Quebec, does not inspire confidence in Quebec’s future. It’s no joke at all.","2013-02-07 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","602","95.09","40.15","39.70","31.43","28.67","30.23","83.06","49.34","7.31","1.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.17","1.00","6.15","10.80","16.11","7.81","2.66","4.15","2.33","11.46","4.98","3.49","1.16","1.83","1.99","4.32","2.33","1.99","0.50","0.66","0.50","3.32","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","11.63","2.33","2.49","1.00","2.99","1.00","3.49","1.50","0.83","0.17","0.50","0.50","0.17","0.33","0.00","0.00","10.80","1.50","1.83","7.48","0.33","1.00","1.16","8.31","1.16","14.78","1.66","9.14","4.15","7.81","1.00","0.00","2.33","0.17","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","12.29","3.49","5.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.83","0.66","1.50","0.33","0.17","3026","9.2","30.5","967","603","21","42.34","15.3","14.5","13.88","17.7","158","13.25","23.960928689883914","325","25.65","4","0.48","0","16","7","77","0","73","33","4","2","4","114","33","0","39","1","0","12","4","29","2","2","3","26","0","30","12","15","18","12","28","7","4","0","2"

Steinmetz is quoted as saying: “It’s a failure on the part of those leaders in our society who had the responsibility to oversee this.”

Looking back, I am not very forgiving of the secrecy, double-talk, browbeating, high-handedness and contempt for opposing viewpoints that characterized the MUHC project from the very beginning, when it was under Steinmetz’s command. This lack of transparency prompted, among other things, the abrupt cancellation of a public consultation that was to have been held at the McGill School of Architecture.

In my view, the “one superhospital for all” concept was moribund from the start. Paris, with a population of 10 million, took 20 years to build one “superhospital,” and it came in way over budget in addition to way behind schedule. In Quebec, with a population of 8 million, we have undertaken to build two superhospitals — a French-language teaching facility and an English-language one — at the same time. Does that make sense? And what about the fact that the Paris hospital was hit with Legionnaires’ disease on its opening day? How lucky they were that there were other hospitals still operating in the region!

The blanket refusal to consider renovation of existing buildings instead of construction of one superhospital defied all logic and common sense, particularly in view of the continuing trend toward shorter hospital stays and the increasing miniaturization of most equipment. There was no shortage of space in existing facilities, so a phased renovation, combined with strategic new construction where required, would have all been completed by now. To no one’s surprise, the “one-project-one-site” policy was eventually overturned, slowly but surely — witness the rehabilitation of the Montreal General. What’s more, the recent Baron report predicting a shortage of space in the new Glen Yards superhospital means additional renovations to existing buildings is very likely.

They say hindsight is 20-20, but criticism of the original single superhospital idea is something that has long been on the public record. Aubin says, “Let those who criticized Steinmetz’s vision from the outset do no gloating.”

Well, OK. But Steinmetz needs to do some wondering about his contribution to the fiasco that has unfolded ever since. Not unlike the Olympic Stadium, the MUHC calamity is the natural outcome of grandiosity winning out over careful, well-considered, responsible design. This father of the superhospital concept may well wash his hands of the whole affair. But the rest of us in the community have been left holding his problem child.","2013-01-09 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","162.0","164.0","0.0","85.0","9.0","7.0","1","485","94.96","65.25","22.64","48.74","22.05","27.01","78.35","48.25","7.84","2.47","0.62","0.62","0.00","0.82","0.41","5.36","9.90","16.49","7.22","4.54","3.30","1.03","11.75","4.12","1.44","1.65","3.92","2.27","3.30","2.27","1.03","0.00","0.62","0.21","7.22","0.62","0.00","0.00","1.44","9.07","2.06","0.82","0.82","1.65","1.65","2.27","2.27","0.82","0.82","0.21","1.86","0.21","1.65","0.00","0.00","4.95","0.82","0.82","2.89","0.62","0.82","4.12","6.60","0.62","13.20","0.82","8.66","4.12","3.71","0.00","0.62","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.82","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.62","0.00","18.14","3.92","6.39","0.21","0.00","0.41","0.21","2.06","2.68","1.86","0.41","0.00","2435","8.91","25.894736842105264","765","478","22","49.45","13.6","11.8","13.52","14.4","127","13.5","21.307615062761506","282","23.05","6","0.46","0","10","17","60","0","73","37","2","1","2","91","35","0","14","0","0","10","6","21","0","0","2","11","0","11","20","17","19","5","14","4","5","0","3"

Both carry a life sentence, but a person convicted of second-degree murder can be eligible for parole after serving 10 years, while someone convicted of first-degree must serve 25 years before applying for parole.

After hearing testimony from 32 witnesses at the preliminary hearing — a process to determine whether there’s enough evidence to send the case to trial — defence lawyer Luc Leclair told Quebec Court Monday he intends to argue for a trial on the lesser charge. The Criminal Code defines first-degree murder as “planned or deliberate” and second-degree murder as those that aren’t first degree but were still intentional.

The last witness is to be heard Friday via video conference from France when the preliminary hearing resumes, Crown prosecutor Louis Bouthillier said. He said Montreal police investigators are in Europe now and because of issues with the German judicial system, a German witness that was supposed to be heard will no longer testify.

All the evidence heard so far is under a publication ban — a normal order at a preliminary hearing.

As the hearing got underway Monday after a one-week break, a close friend of the victim asked that his name not be made public during his testimony because he is “between jobs.”

But Quebec Court Judge Lori-Renée Weitzman rejected the request from Dong Dong Xu, 30, the 26th witness to testify at the hearing, saying the courts are public.

As has been the case since the hearing began March 11, many spectators lined up early in order to get one of 24 seats reserved for spectators.

Six witnesses from Vancouver, including employees from two Vancouver elementary schools, testified via video conference in the afternoon, during which Lin’s father was in the courtroom. He sat at the back of the room with his lawyer, showing no emotion as the witnesses were shown on an overhead screen.

Magnotta, 30, faces four charges in connection with the May 25 death of 33-year-old Chinese national Lin. The charges including causing an indignity to a body, producing and distributing obscene material and sending obscene material through the postal system. Magnotta was arrested in June in an Internet café in Berlin and brought back to Canada on a private flight.

Once Friday’s witness has testified, the lawyers will argue the charges for which Magnotta should stand trial and Weitzman will make her decision. A trial, by judge and jury, will likely take place sometime next year.","2013-04-08 00:00:00","1","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","165.0","167.0","0.0","88.0","8.0","7.0","1","442","98.09","70.65","25.07","3.77","26.00","24.89","71.72","41.40","3.62","2.04","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.04","0.00","1.58","9.95","16.06","6.11","1.81","4.98","0.90","11.31","3.62","2.49","0.90","4.98","0.68","2.94","0.23","2.49","0.00","1.58","0.23","8.37","0.23","0.23","0.23","2.04","7.01","1.13","2.04","0.90","1.13","0.45","2.04","3.85","0.90","2.94","0.00","0.68","0.45","0.23","0.00","0.00","6.33","0.23","1.36","4.07","0.68","0.00","4.52","5.20","1.58","16.74","1.13","7.01","8.14","3.85","0.45","0.23","0.23","0.00","1.58","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.44","3.85","4.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.26","0.90","1.13","0.00","0.00","2132","8.39","27.875","664","435","17","53.95","14.1","12.1","12.6","15.4","96","17.166666666666668","21.067586206896554","249","24.62","2","0.4","0","11","14","46","0","65","35","2","0","7","84","50","0","20","1","0","4","5","14","1","0","1","10","0","16","21","11","10","4","9","3","0","0","1"

After a brief court appearance in which the start date for the highly publicized trial was set for Sept. 15, 2014, lawyer Luc Leclair held a news conference to say his client co-operated with authorities.

Magnotta, who was arrested in June in Berlin, did not fight his extradition, Leclair said, which he had the right to do, and voluntarily came back to Canada.

“With very stringent German rules, he would have been there for four or five years and during that time, witnesses that are essential for the Crown’s case might have left the country,” Leclair said.

“The evidence would have become stale and it’s clear the Crown’s case would have been weakened. However, he decided to come back to Canada and to face the public in Montreal in particular, who will be called to judge him.”

Magnotta, 30, who is charged with the first-degree murder of Chinese national and Concordia University student Lin, 33, has faith in the Canadian judicial system, Leclair said.

Lin was killed May 25.The trial is expected to last between six and eight weeks.

After an 11-day preliminary hearing, Quebec Court Judge Lori-Renée Weitzman ruled there was enough evidence to send Magnotta to trial on the charge of first-degree murder, meaning his actions were planned and intentional.

Leclair, who had wanted his client to be tried for second-degree murder, said he is still awaiting the transcript of the judgment before deciding whether to file a motion in Quebec Superior Court to have the judgment quashed. He maintains the evidence against his client is circumstantial.

The Crown also announced Monday it will file a motion to hold a rogatory commission during the trial, in which the judge, defence and Crown travel abroad to question witnesses, then the recorded testimony is played at the trial.

After hearing arguments from both Luc Leclair and Crown prosecutor Louis Bouthillier at the end of Magnotta’s preliminary enquiry, Quebec Court Judge Lori-Renée Weitzman said she would announce her decision at 3 p.m. Friday.

Magnotta was arrested in June 2012 and charged with first-degree murder and four other crimes related to last May’s death of Concordia Unversity student Lin Jun, 33.

The judge heard from 32 witnesses and viewed exhibits throughout the preliminary hearing – all of which is protected under a publication ban – and must now decide whether there is enough evidence to commit the case to trial and if so, on what charges.

Bouthillier argued Friday there was enough evidence for Magnotta to be tried on first-degree murder, which carries an automatic life sentence with no chance for parole for 25 years. A conviction on second-degree murder also means a life sentence but parole eligibility starts after 10 years.

For the second day in a row Wednesday, Magnotta cupped his hand over his mouth, wiped his eyes and glanced only occasionally at a screen on which video evidence was projected. On Tuesday, he collapsed in the prisoner’s box at the end of a video.

Wearing an unbuttoned, short-sleeved plaid shirt with a white undershirt and white pants, a shackled and handcuffed Magnotta listened to testimony Wednesday from three Montreal police officers who specialize in extracting digital information from cameras, computers, cellphones and online.

Constable Nadine Paoliello wrapped up her testimony, which was interrupted Tuesday when Magnotta collapsed and the hearing was adjourned for the day. Sgt.-Det. Panagiotis Sarganis, a computer forensic specialist from the Montreal police force, also testified, as did Constable Frank Massa. Several videos were shown throughout the morning.

No details about the evidence can be reported because of a court-ordered publication ban, a normal procedure during a preliminary hearing — a process to determine whether there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial.

Magnotta, a 30-year-old Ontario native, was charged in June with the first-degree murder of Lin Jun, a 33-year-old Chinese national who was studying at Concordia University. Magnotta is also charged with producing and distributing obscene material, sending obscene material in the postal system and causing an indignity to a body.

He was arrested in an Internet café in Berlin less than two weeks after Lin’s May 25 murder and dismemberment.

On Wednesday, Magnotta waved and smiled at a woman sitting in the front row of the packed courtroom, but the woman refused to identify herself to the media or say what her relationship to the accused is.

The victim’s father, Lin Diran, who was emotional in court last week, has not been present this week.

Witnesses from Vancouver and Europe are to testify by video conference starting April 8, the last week of the preliminary hearing.

A letter from Magnotta’s psychiatrist was attached to the court file of his 2005 conviction for fraud in Toronto and offers a glimpse into the mind of the man now accused in the gruesome slaying and dismemberment of 33-year-old Lin Jun.

Magnotta, 30, then known by his birth name, Eric Newman, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia since at least 2000 and was hospitalized several times, Dr. Thuraisamy Sooriabalan wrote.

“The treatment consists of taking antipsychotic medications and attending (the) outpatient department for supportive psychotherapy and health education,” wrote the doctor based at the Rouge Valley Health System’s Centenary site in Toronto.

“Unfortunately Mr. Newman is not very regular in attending the outpatient department and as a result he misses his medications.”

At the time of the letter, written in May 2005, Magnotta had not seen his psychiatrist since February, despite being told to return in a month for continuation of his medication, Sooriabalan wrote.

The psychiatrist assessed Magnotta’s prognosis as “fair,” as long as he took his medication. If he didn’t, he would be prone to a relapse of his symptoms, which include paranoia, auditory hallucinations and fear of the unknown, Sooriabalan wrote.

The letter was released Wednesday after several media outlets fought for it to be made public.

A Globe and Mail reporter had been trying to obtain the letter, a public document, since July, but was rebuffed in several attempts. Various media outlets then joined together to hire counsel to make arguments to a judge for the letter’s release.

Magnotta’s lawyer Luc Leclair tried to stop the letter from becoming public, but Ontario Court Judge Fergus O’Donnell ruled Tuesday afternoon that it should be released.

It does contain sensitive and personal medical information, O’Donnell said in his ruling, but any privacy interest was foregone when the letter was filed in open court.

“Without access to the letter, the public is not in a position to engage in a meaningful assessment or debate over the appropriateness of what happened to Mr. Newman in 2005 in what is supposed to be an open and transparent court process,” O’Donnell wrote.

The letter was tendered in court after Magnotta pleaded guilty to four fraud-related charges in 2005. The judge read the letter before she imposed a nine-month conditional sentence. She said she could only order him to take his medication for the nine-month period, but hoped he would continue taking it after that.

“Sir, you have got a medical problem and you need to always take medication,” Judge Lauren Marshall said, the transcript shows.

“If you do not, your life is going to get messed up.”

Magnotta admitted to taking advantage of a young woman with a diminished mental capacity whom he had met online. He admitted that he got her to apply for credit in her name at stores such as Sears and The Brick then used it to get various merchandise. The stores were out thousands of dollars. He also got a credit card in the woman’s name.

A preliminary hearing for Magnotta is underway in Montreal, where he faces several criminal charges, including first-degree murder.","2013-04-03 00:00:00","0","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","160.0","162.0","0.0","83.0","7.0","7.0","1","550","94.44","83.24","4.08","13.47","22.92","26.55","78.73","44.91","8.00","5.82","0.00","0.00","0.73","5.09","0.00","2.18","8.55","15.82","6.18","1.45","5.64","1.27","14.91","3.82","2.18","1.09","2.18","1.45","4.00","1.45","2.36","0.91","0.73","0.36","13.09","0.00","0.00","1.27","4.55","8.18","1.27","1.45","1.64","1.64","0.36","2.91","1.45","0.36","0.91","0.00","3.82","0.18","3.64","0.00","0.00","7.09","0.55","0.91","2.91","2.73","0.36","8.00","4.73","0.91","13.09","0.55","6.36","6.00","3.64","0.00","0.00","0.91","0.00","0.55","0.55","0.00","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.55","4.91","6.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.09","2.18","2.00","0.36","0.00","2691","8.75","25.363636363636363","856","542","26","50.36","13.5","11.4","12.82","13.4","140","11.3","20.652103321033213","289","23.32","7","0.44","0","18","10","47","1","68","37","0","1","4","100","60","0","17","0","0","24","13","20","0","0","2","20","0","18","39","12","22","4","15","1","3","0","2"

Over the last nine days, 25 witnesses have testified in Quebec Court at the Montreal courthouse in the high-profile case that has also drawn numerous curious observers, including law students, a retired psychiatric nurse and tourists from Paris and Toronto. Onlookers lined up early every day in order to snag one of the 15 seats reserved for the public. Another nine seats were set aside for journalists.

Details of the testimony can’t be reported because of a court-ordered publication ban, a normal procedure during a preliminary hearing, which is held to determine whether there is enough evidence to send the case to trial.

Thursday, four witnesses from Ottawa testified, including Chantal Pombert and Theresa Kelm, detectives with the Ottawa police force, Geneviève Benoît, an inspector with Canada Post, and Jenni Byrne, director of political operations for the Conservative Party of Canada.

Magnotta, 30, faces four charges in connection with the May 25 death of 33-year-old Chinese national Lin Jun, including causing an indignity to a body, producing and distributing obscene material and sending obscene material through the postal system. He was arrested June 6 in an Internet café in Berlin and brought back to Canada on a private flight.

This week, Magnotta wiped his eyes often and collapsed in court after a video was shown. Lin’s father was in court periodically when the hearing got underway, but was absent this week.

When the hearing resumes for another week April 8, witnesses from Vancouver and Europe are to testify via video conference.

Once all the evidence has been presented, Quebec Court Judge Lori-Renée Weitzman will rule on whether the case can be sent to trial. If so, Magnotta will be tried in Quebec Superior Court by a judge and jury.

John Mahoney/THE GAZETTE

MONTREAL – The preliminary hearing for Luka Magnotta, charged with killing and dismembering a student, finished earlier than usual Monday after the relatively short testimonies of six witnesses, including a forensic pathologist, a dentist and a Canada Post employee.

The longest testimony was from Yann Dazé, a forensic pathologist who has participated in 800 autopsies in his career, followed by Catherine Lavallée, a forensic toxicologist who examines organs for traces of drugs, and dentist Sachin Paranjape. The last witness before the lunch break was Marie Josée Perron, a forensic odontologist, who analyzes dental remains.

Magnotta, 30, faces several charges in connection with last May’s death of Lin Jun, a 33-year-old Chinese national who came to Montreal to study at Concordia University.

The Ontario native sat in the prisoner’s box Monday, his eyes closed as documents were shown on a screen. By the afternoon, he was wearing a dark blue ski jacket with the collar pulled up around his neck. At times, he appeared to be dozing off.

Lin Diran, who has come to Montreal from China to hear the details surrounding his son’s death, often broke down in the courtroom last week. He didn’t attend the proceedings Monday.

Following an international manhunt, Magnotta was arrested June 6 in an Internet café in Berlin and brought back to Montreal, where he was charged with producing and distributing obscene material, defiling a corpse, first-degree murder, mailing obscene material and harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other members of Parliament.

Several people, including law students, showed up hours before the courtroom door opened to watch the proceedings, now in its second week. There are only 24 seats available, nine of which are reserved for journalists.

None of the details of the testimony can be published because of a court-ordered publication ban.

In the afternoon, Tomo Kazu Le, a Canada Post employee, as well as René Tremblay, an assistant manager from a Jean Coutu pharmacy in Côte des Neiges, testified.

Crown prosecutor Louis Bouthillier said he will call five more witnesses from Montreal, as well as some from Ottawa and Vancouver and two from Europe. The preliminary hearing, which is a procedure to determine if there is enough evidence to go to trial, is to last this week as well as the week of April 8.

The media will be able to publicize the evidence and proceedings during the trial.

"http://montrealgazette.com/news/montreal/magnottas-lawyer-wants-extra-funds-for-psychological-evaluation/wcm/51d87938-155f-41ba-b043-89ba2a4ae59c","Magnotta’s lawyer wants extra funds for psychological evaluation","MONTREAL — Luka Magnotta’s lawyer wants extra public funds in order to have his client, who is charged with the first-degree murder of Lin Jun, undergo a pre-trial psychological evaluation.

Luc Leclair is being paid by legal aid to represent Magnotta, 30, but the lawyer said in Quebec Superior Court Friday that the state’s cap of a $1,200-payment for an expert isn’t sufficient. After some negotiations with legal aid, Leclair said the amount was increased to $1,500, then, “exceptionally”, to $2,000, and finally to $3,000.

“I’ve retained two experts, but they’ve indicated from the beginning that they aren’t satisfied (with the amount),” Leclair told Superior Court Justice Michael Stober. “And legal aid isn’t prepared to budge.”

He said he wants a third expert, but it’s challenging to find an expert who is both competent in English and will accept the fees offered by legal aid.

“Some can’t write a report in English and some can’t speak English well enough to speak to my client,” he said, adding that the job of evaluating an accused and writing a report involves a minimum of 60 hours of work.

Magnotta, an Ontario native, is charged with first-degree murder, producing and distributing obscene material, causing an indignity to a body, sending obscene material through the mail system, and harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other MPs. He was arrested last June in Berlin after the May 25 murder of Lin Jun, a 33-year-old Chinese national studying at Concordia University.

Leclair tried Friday to have a publication ban placed on details of his motion requesting a temporary stay of proceedings in the case until funds could be secured. The motion won’t be heard in Quebec Superior Court until after the preliminary hearing, which is to wrap up the week of April 8.

Leclair claimed that information in the motion could harm Magnotta’s right to a fair trial by revealing that the defence might be that Magnotta is not criminally responsible for reasons of a mental disorder, the same defence used by Guy Turcotte, the former cardiologist who killed his two young children. The judge rejected Leclair’s claim.

“Any capable defence lawyer would have his client examined,” Stober said. “The defence won’t necessarily be (not criminally responsible), that’s just a defence lawyer doing his homework and examining every possible avenue of defence.”

As for Leclair’s concern that it will be difficult to find 12 impartial jurors, Stober said there are techniques to screen potential jurors to see if they are biased. And a trial, if called, won’t be heard until January 2014 at the earliest, by which time many people will have forgotten details of the case.

He ruled that the public has the right to know if its tax money is being spent on experts for the defence and denied Leclair’s request for a publication ban.

“The courts are public and your application is in respect to public money, public funds,” the judge told Leclair.

Magnotta’s preliminary hearing, which began March 17 and is now adjourned until April 8, is a procedure in which all the evidence is being presented before Quebec Court Judge Lori-Renée Weitzman, who will then decide if there is enough evidence to send the case to trial.

Julien Bernard, a lawyer from the Quebec Attorney General’s office, said the department is not negotiating with Leclair yet, but rather collecting information on the file. But there is a chance that an agreement could be reached outside of court before the motion is heard, he said.

But whether Magnotta’s answers to those and other questions asked during the two-hour interview will be made public is now up to a Quebec Superior Court judge to decide.

The University of Ottawa researchers behind the study claim that the findings must be kept under wraps because of a promise made to participants of confidentiality and anonymity. If the results are made public, their lawyer argued this week before Justice Sophie Bourque, no one will want to participate in future studies on sensitive subjects.

Crown prosecutor Alexandre Boucher conceded that there may be nothing pertinent in the interview, but asked the judge to “at least take a look” for potential evidence that may be used in a defence of not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder.

On June 22, Montreal police got a warrant to seize the audio recording and 68-page transcript of the interview after Adam McLeod, who interviewed Magnotta for the study Sex Work and Intimacy: Escorts and Their Clients, recognized his photo in the newspaper and notified police at the end of May.

Magnotta was the subject of an international manhunt after Lin’s May 25 death and was eventually arrested in Berlin in June and brought back to Canada. He faces five charges, including first-degree murder, causing an indignity to a human body and producing and distributing obscene material.

His preliminary hearing continues next week, but there is a publication ban on all the evidence being presented.

Peter Jacobsen, the lawyer representing criminologists and study authors Christine Bruckert and Colette Parent, argued this week that if the judge views the interview in private, the public oversight and scrutiny of the court system is lost. But the judge saw it the other way.

“This process is to protect the public interest,” Bourque said. “If I decide I have to do it, it’s because otherwise the document is totally hidden from society.”

Bourque didn’t say when she would render her judgment on whether she would look at the recorded interview and decide if it should be unsealed for the criminal case, or if she will order the materials be returned to the researchers without anyone seeing them.

"http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/cinema-beaubien-manager-takes-over-cinema-du-parc","Cinéma Beaubien manager takes over Cinéma du Parc","Big changes behind the scenes at the venerable Cinéma du Parc. Mario Fortin, who is director general of the Cinéma Beaubien, one of the city’s most successful independent cinemas, will take-over as general manager of the long-running Park Avenue art-house.

At the same time, seven members of the Cinéma Beaubien board of directors joined the Cinéma du Parc board.

The goal of all this is to ensure stability at the Parc and allow long-time Parc manager Roland Smith, who turned 70 last fall, to take a step back from day-to-day operations. Smith will remain as artistic advisor.

But the two cinemas will remain separate entities, stressed Fortin. One of the first things Fortin is going to do is to buy two new digital projectors for Cinéma du Parc and provide some much-needed repair to the cinema’s seats. The purchase and installation of the projectors will cost around $150,000.

Smith says with the two digital projectors, they’ll be able to snare even more premieres and also nab more classic films in digital form. Both Fortin and Smith also underlined that business is good at Cinéma du Parc and the audience has remained stable for years.

Fortin is also involved in the Cinéma NDG project, which is set to transform the old Cinema V building into an arthouse, and he argued there’s a real need for these alternative cinemas. He says there’s been a lack of screens in Montreal since the closing of the Parisien complex several years back.

“Montrealers are not well served by what’s available now,” said Fortin.

There are no plans to change the Cinéma du Parc programming.","2013-04-11 10:35:09","0","5.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","166.0","168.0","0.0","91.0","8.0","7.0","1","277","94.71","59.99","13.71","31.95","19.79","19.86","74.37","41.16","3.97","1.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.72","0.36","2.89","9.39","14.08","7.58","4.33","4.69","0.72","11.91","6.14","2.17","1.44","3.61","2.89","1.81","1.08","0.72","0.36","0.36","0.00","4.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.72","5.78","0.36","1.81","1.08","0.72","0.36","1.44","1.08","0.00","1.08","0.00","0.36","0.00","0.36","0.00","0.00","6.50","0.72","1.81","2.53","1.81","0.36","1.81","8.30","2.53","14.44","2.89","6.86","5.42","5.05","2.89","0.36","1.44","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","15.16","5.05","4.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.53","0.72","2.17","0.00","0.36","1220","7.41","20.214285714285715","390","269","14","68.91","12.3","8.4","11.26","11.3","48","7.166666666666666","16.817546468401485","167","18.36","2","0.41","0","8","9","30","0","30","26","1","0","4","41","39","1","16","1","0","3","0","11","1","1","1","9","0","15","6","1","6","3","13","1","3","0","0"

"http://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/comedy-picks-april-8-14-paula-bel-the-quinny-scratchy-show-trixx-chris-locke-franglos-knifitude","Comedy Picks: April 8-14 – Paula Bel, The Quinny & Scratchy Show, Trixx, Chris Locke, Franglos, Knifitude","Paula Bel is angry. They say she hasn’t had a good day in 10 years. Much angst, however, spells much high comedy. She’s not big into her kids. She has two grown daughters, but not even her best friends are aware. “That’s because I never brought them home from the hospital,” she says. She may not be kidding. No accident that Bel has left audiences in stitches on The Tonight Show, Last Comic Standing and at Just for Laughs last summer. She flies into the Comedy Nest, (2313 Ste. Catherine St. W.). Thursday to Saturday. The Nest presents The Quinny & Scratchy Show, Friday at 10:30 p.m. Scratchy is none other than beatbox legend and two-time Grammy winner, Scratch of Roots fame, and Quinny would be comedian Quinn C. Martin. Also on the bill are Toronto wit Matt Shury Stephen Spinola from the Big Apple. Call 514-932-6378.

It’s a double headlining bill at the Comedyworks (1238 Bishop St.). Trixx and Chris Locke share starring duties, Thursday to Saturday. Trixx is best known for his array of characterizations and for being a regular on MuchMusic’s hit series Video on Trial. He has opened for the likes of Sugar Sammy and Cedric the Entertainer. Chris Locke was named by NOW as best stand-up of 2012. The Toronto wit and writer has opened for the likes of Todd Barry, Hannibal Buress and Todd Glass. The Works stays open Sunday for the Franglos Comedy Show. This will be the last edition until the show goes to the Zoofest this summer. Mike Paterson will serve as host of the spectacle, wherein franco comics perform their shtick in English. Among those crossing the cultural frontier are Neev, Charles Deschamps, James Mannella, Renaud Lefort, Sébastien Bourgault and magician Martin Rozon. Showtime: 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $7. Call 514-398-9661.

Here’s a late-night double bill with a difference: Walter J. Lyng’s one-man Fringe fest show Pitching Knife Fight and the “sweet, morally bankrupt sounds” of Aura Turpitude (one of the best-named acts in the biz), Friday at 10 p.m. at the Mainline Theatre (3997 St. Laurent Blvd.). That’s right: death and seduction together on the same bill. Admission: $10; $7 for students. Call 514-849-3378.

Also bagels and noodles. And, oh yeah, an-all Jewish cast of comics with nowhere else to go on Christmas Eve. Jon Selig hosts this merry mayhem, while serving up chuckles are Geoffrey Applebaum, Alon Azimov, Daniel Carin, Stephanie Ein, Emery Fine, Jeff Kovac, Dan Laxer, Adam Susser, Justin Uditsky and Jason Yearow. The show is free, but organizer Rashta Kruger asks patrons to bring coats and other winter gear to pass on to the needy through the Share the Warmth Foundation. Call 514-392-7770.

There’s no stopping or silencing mullet-man Mike Paterson, who headlines Thursday to Saturday at the Comedyworks (1238 Bishop St.). It all began in a bowling alley where he toiled as a pin-setter and took one too many balls to the cranium. He was then emboldened enough to try his hand and feet at rasslin’. Comedy then came quite naturally, as did acting and singing and shilling for a variety of products. In fact, Paterson and his cronies at the Shed post-production house could be up for $1 million; their ad for Doritos has been shortlisted in the Crash the Super Bowl contest. He has also done spots for Jig-a-Loo and La Cage aux Sports and can currently be caught as Santa in a St. Hubert BBQ ad. His film credits include Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Crawler, and he even captivated on stage in Ain’t Misbehavin’. Plus, he is part of the crooner duet Dan-D-Lyons with Tim Rabnett and of the “world’s greatest lip-sync band,” Never Surrender with Rabnett and Ryan Wilner. He never fails to amuse and/or shock. Call 514-398-9661.

Home for the Holidays is the name of the comedy revue, Friday at 8:30 p.m. at Théâtre Ste. Catherine (264 Ste. Catherine St. E.). And Montreal native Bianca Yates will be winging her way into town from L.A. for the show. She has been working her comedy chops at clubs in Hollywood and has been working out the renowned Groundlings comedy school. Her co-headliner Patrick Hakeem, also a Montrealer, bolted town for Toronto last March to study with Second City and has been paying dues on the club and festival circuit. Opening is the ubiquitous and ever-droll Eman, fresh from her Kosher Jokes for the Halaladays shows last week. Host is Paul Baluyot. Tickets: $10. Call 514-284-3939 or go to http://www.theatrestecatherine.com.

Ted Bird should be in fine carving form hosting a comedy roast and toast to the year that will soon be history. Wild hunch that Ted will be targeting Rob Ford as well as some Canadian senators. Montreal wits Scott Faulconbridge, Ali Hassan and Derek Seguin will be on hand for this free-for-all, Friday and Saturday at the Comedy Nest (2313 Ste. Catherine St. W.). Call 514-932-6378.

Catherine St. W.). Hamilton has been cited by Rolling Stone as among the “5 Comics to Watch.” With his cemented aw-shucks grin, Hamilton has pointed out, quite accurately, that he looks like the resulting offspring “if Howdy Doody had a baby with Howdy Doody.” And he has stated that he looks like he could “be selling ice cream in 1953.” True, too. Also guaranteed to tickle the funny bone is Ali Hassan, Strombo Show panelist and swell cook. This New Year’s Eve show features party favours, bubbly and buffet. Tickets: $49.50. Once again, the Nest ushers in the New Year with its annual Young Guns of Comedy spectacle, Thursday to Saturday. This year’s batch of up-and-coming slingers includes Chris Sandiford, Mike Carrozza, Emery Fine, Scott Andrew Carter, Geoffrey Applebaum and Molly Brisebois. Host is high-larious highlander Darren Henwood. Call 514-932-6378.

Massimo returns to his hometown to ring in the New Year at the Comedyworks (1238 Bishop St.) on Tuesday. A finalist in the Comedy Network’s Great Canadian Laugh Off, Massimo may have taken his act to Toronto but will always remain a Montrealer at the core. Hosting the New Year’s Eve mayhem will be Massimo’s buddy and Ain’t Misbehaving co-star, Mike Paterson. Rather than return to T.O., Massimo stays put for more self-deprecating mirth, Thursday to Saturday at the Works. Call 514-398-9661.

He’s wowed ‘em on Letterman and Kimmel, and he will wow you with this sort of shtick: “I just don’t like the Kiss-Cam. It scared the hell out of me and my sister at the Mets game.” Or this: “My girlfriend said she doesn’t want

Chinese food today, because she just had it yesterday.” Pause. “Well, people in China … ” Moody flies into the Nest (2313 Ste. Catherine St. W.), Thursday to Saturday. Dropping in for support will be dynamo DeAnne Smith. Call 514-932-6378.

It’s Mike Paterson’s Fancy Schmantzy Holiday Cocktail Party, Thursday at the Wiggle Room (3874 St. Laurent Blvd.). Not just the hilarity of Paterson, but also the re-unification of the world’s great lip-sync band, Never Surrender, featuring the latter and his singing cronies Tim Rabnett and Ryan Wilner. Plus, more tunes from the one and only Massimo King Cole. And not to forget the best cocktails – try the unholy but lip-smacking Vespers – in town, courtesy of bartender Mariana. Call 514-508-WINK or go to boxoffice@wiggleroom.ca

Comedyworks (1238 Bishop St.) goes into Winter Giggles mode, Thursday to Saturday. Headliner is Toby Muresianu, who hails from L.A. and who toils for Bill Maher as a writer. Host Jeff Schouela will try to keep a handle on the seasonal mirth. Among the openers are Jimmy Cassidy, Morgan O’Shea and Jess Salomon. The Works stays open Sunday for White Christmas, wherein the stage will be taken over primarily by – as the title suggests – white comedians who aren’t cultural minorities. An idea whose time has come – again. Closer Eman and opener Jess Salomon, however, do come from cultural minorities. Call 514-398-9661.

Revel instead in the February blues of Mike Wilmot, not only one of the funniest humans from our land of frozen tundra but also one of the funniest humans on the face of the planet. Morose, yes; but if he can’t crack you up, it’s doubtful that anyone could. A serial Just for Laughs fest performer – invariably in the Nasty Show series – Wilmot has a special place in his heart for Montreal, or as he likes to describe this city: “Disneyland for alcoholics.” As popular as he is on this side of the pond, Wilmot also has a cult following in the United Kingdom and is forever bowling over fans at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Wilmot lets loose – and we really do mean loose – Thursday to Saturday at the Comedyworks (1238 Bishop St.) The Works stays open Sunday for BOOM! (Best of Open Mic), wherein seven of the past month’s best oper-micers duke it out for a weekend spot at the club. Host for this month’s spectacle is up-and-comer Bianca Yates, soon to head off to the L.A. lotusland for sunnier climes and opportunities. Also on the bill will be Lady Business, Jess Salomon and Eman. Call 514-398-9661.

He’s so hot he only needs one name: Massimo. Fresh from his auspicious acting debut in Guys & Dolls at The Segal Centre, the hirsute wit is back with a new one-man show, Massimo: Late and Loud, Friday at 10:30 p.m. at the Comedy Nest (2313 Ste. Catherine St. W.). He describes himself – quite accurately at that – as “Jersey Shore meets the South Shore.” He will be getting by with a little help from his friends as well. And back by popular demand, Thursday to Saturday at the Nest is the ever-neurotic and droll Dan Naturman, a regular on the late-night couches of Jay Leno, David Letterman and Craig Ferguson. Naturman has particularly hysterical views on re-gifting and Mexican prisons. Call 514-932-6378.

Funny fellow Pat Dussault is at the helm of a most worthy benefit for the Myriam Foundation’s Abili-T program, Wednesday evening at Théâtre Ste. Catherine (264 Ste. Catherine St. E.). The program, provides non-profit services for children with autism. The show is called Armando for Autism and features some of the city’s best improvisers performing scenes based on a Dan Bingham monologue. Bingham will be on hand to perform as well as producer Dussault and improv whiz Sandi Armstrong. Admission: $10. Call 514-284-3939.

The Privateer (1222 MacKay St.) gets into the chuckles trade on Wednesday with Mo Vee N’ Heavy T’s Kneeslapper, featuring local fave Franco Taddeo and the show’s producer Mo Vee Vartanian. Admission is a mere five bucks. Call 514-303-3822.

Though this blog focuses on events mainly in Montreal and environs, it must be mentioned that a Montreal comedy legend, the late Sean Keane, will be receiving a fine Toronto tribute, Friday at 9 p.m. at the Hirut Restaurant (2050 Danforth Ave.). Carolyn Bennett, an ex-pat Montrealer and close Keane buddy, is producing and hosting this homage to the brilliant comic/writer who passed away at 52 in December. Headliner will be Jim McAleese, with Mark Walker, Dave Hemstad, Judy Croon, Winston Spear and George Westerholm as opening acts. The show will also feature Keane’s last televised set. Almost worth a hike down the 401 for the occasion. Keane was one of a kind with a magnetic stage presence and an ability to spew some classic one-liners. He was also as devoted to animal welfare causes as he was to comedy. Admission is $20, and partial proceeds will go to Guardian’s Best Animal Rescue Foundation. Call 416-588-3804.

Lyng, Pastagate","Mark Walker can morph into Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro or even Jimmy Stewart at a moment’s notice. The Truro, Nova Scotia native is, without question, one of the best comic impressionists in the land. He couples the mimicry with some astute and witty observational insights. Celebrating 25 years in the chuckles business in this country merits more than a gold watch, for that is one impressive ride. Walker has the Just For Laughs Festival, the Halifax Comedy Festival and even the Cape Town Comedy Festival in South Africa. He lets loose Thursday to Saturday at the Comedyworks (1238 Bishop St.). Call 514-398-9661.

Arthur Simeon hails from Uganda, and he has taken full advantage of his roots to create one of the funniest and freshest and provocative routines in this land. He has made waves on HBO’s Funny As Hell series with this sort of repartee: “I was asked what I was doing here in (Canada). I said: ‘You people took my ancestors 200 years ago. They never came back. So I decided to come back here to look for them.” But Simeon points out there is really but one major difference between Canada and Uganda: “Intersections.” Evidently, Uganda doesn’t have any, which makes for quite the chaos on the country’s roads. But Simeon has had to put up with stereotypes and prejudice since arriving here: “I met this lovely lady awhile ago and in the middle of our conversation she says, ‘African guys are creepy.’ And I was like, ‘Whoa! You can’t say that. You can’t put all of us in the same boat …again…’ ” Simeon has opened for Russell Peters on tour but is destined to become a headliner in no time. He flies into the Comedy Nest (2313 Ste. Catherine St. W.), Thursday to Saturday Derek Seguin, a frequent guest on the CBC Radio show The Debaters, does an extended set at the Nest, Friday at 10:30 p.m. Call 514-932-6378.

It’s that time again: it’s the monthly show with the most unwieldy title of them all, The Laugh Pack Late Show for People Who Dig Comedy, Thursday at 10 p.m. in the ArtLounge of the . Segal Centre (5170 Côte Ste. Catherine Rd.) The show is co-hosted by its creator Keith Waterfield along with Lise Vigneault. Opener is playwright/clown Alain Mercieca. Middler is the fast-rising Léa Rondot. Headliner is Walter J. Lyng, best known for his sharp Knife Fight revue at last year’s Fringe festival and beard. Admission: $5. Call 514-739-7944 or go to www.segalcentre.org

Now this didn’t take long and was bound to happen: the United in Comedy Crew presents Pastagate, Saturday at 8 p.m. at Lunik (805 Décarie Blvd.). Michael Lifshitz, one of the organizers and performing wits, explains the rationale behind the evening: “Since hunger is bilingual, we are asking people to bring one pasta item, ideally uncooked (one smart person asked the question), as all the food we will be donated to a local food bank.” The “master chefs” – the hosts – for the evening are Richard Thomas Mullan and Paul Blanchette and sharing their comic views on pasta, life will be E.J.

Ben Roy more than held his own on the filth front at last summer’s Just for Laughs’ Nasty Show. He’s back to do a sort of solo nasty show, Thursday to Saturday at the Comedy Nest (2313 Ste. Catherine St. W.). Roy is an angry young man, and going on the wagon has far from mellowed him.

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20130508-vaste-coup-filet-affaire-braqueurs-diamants-tarmac-aeroport-bruxelles-france-suisse-interpellations","Vaste coup de filet dans l'affaire des braqueurs de diamants","Trente et une personnes ont été arrêtées dont 24 en Belgique, six en Suisse et une en France dans le cadre d'une opération pour retrouver les braqueurs de l’aéroport de Bruxelles. Fin février, 50 millions de dollars de diamants y avaient été dérobés.

Trente et une personnes ont été interpellées en Belgique, Suisse et France dans l'enquête sur un spectaculaire braquage sur le tarmac de l'aéroport de Bruxelles au cours duquel 50 millions de dollars de diamants avaient été dérobés en février, a annoncé mercredi 8 mai la justice belge.



Les policiers ont interpellé mardi et mercredi matin 24 personnes en Belgique, six en Suisse et une en France dans le cadre d'une vaste opération lancée dans les trois pays, a indiqué le porte-parole du parquet de Bruxelles, Jean-Marc Meilleur.



De son côté, la police suisse a annoncé, mercredi, que la brigade de répression du banditisme de Genève avait interpellé huit personnes soupçonnées d'être impliquées dans ce braquage.



Une quantité importante de diamants a été saisie, ainsi que 100 000 francs suisses (80 000 euros), précise le communiqué suisse qui souligne la coopération avec les autorités belges. Un avocat et un homme d'affaires sont parmi les personnes interpellées à la suite de l'attaque du 18 février à Bruxelles.



Selon Jean-Marc Meilleur, le Français arrêté, qui a de lourds antécédents judiciaires, est soupçonné d'avoir directement participé au braquage qui avait été perpétré par huit hommes lourdement armés et déguisés en policiers à l'aéroport de Zaventem, dans la banlieue de Bruxelles.



Ces braqueurs avaient attaqué des transporteurs de fonds alors qu'ils étaient en train de charger une cargaison de diamants dans un avion s'apprêtant à décoller pour Zurich avec des passagers à bord.



La valeur du butin avait été estimée à 50 millions de dollars (soit environ 38 millions d'euros).



Les perquisitions, qui se poursuivaient mercredi, ont permis de retrouver en Suisse des diamants provenant du braquage, tandis que d'importantes sommes d'argent et des véhicules de luxe ont été saisis en Belgique, selon le porte-parole belge.



""Il y a eu, depuis le début, une intense coopération avec les autorités suisses, françaises et luxembourgeoises"", a précisé M. Meilleur.



Parmi les personnes interpellées en Belgique, certaines, âgées de 30 à 50 ans, étaient ""bien connues"" de la police pour des vols avec violences, selon la justice.

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20130713-soudan-darfour-sept-casques-bleus-tues-minuad-nyala","Sept Casques bleus tués lors d'une patrouille au Darfour","Sept Casques bleus de la mission de maintien de la paix des Nations unies et de l'Union africaine au Darfour (Minuad) ont été tués lors d'une patrouille non loin de la capitale du Sud-Darfour Nyala. Dix-sept autres soldats ont été blessés.

Sept Casques bleus ont été tués et dix-sept autres blessés samedi 13 juillet lors d'une patrouille dans la région soudanaise du Darfour, a annoncé la force conjointe de maintien de la paix ONU-Union africaine (Minuad).



Il s'agit de l'incident le plus meurtrier qu'a connu la Minuad en cinq ans d'opérations. Les sept soldats ont été tués près d'une base de la mission ONU-UA, à Manawashi, au nord de Nyala, la principale ville du Darfour, alors qu'ils se rendaient vers un autre site de la Minuad, à Khar-Abeche.

Selon les premières informations, les Casques bleus ont été pris pour cible par un groupe d'assaillants qui n'ont pu être identifiés. Il y a eu des ""échanges de coups de feu prolongés"". Deux des 17 blessés sont des femmes appartenant aux forces de police de la mission mixte ONU-UA.

La Minuad n'a pas révélé la nationalité des victimes, mais les troupes tanzaniennes sont généralement en charge de cette zone.

40 casques bleus ont péri depuis la mise en place de la Minuad en 2007

La dernière attaque la plus meurtrière dans l'histoire de la mission remontait au 2 octobre 2012, quand quatre casques bleus nigérians avaient péri dans une embuscade dans l'ouest du Darfour.

La Minuad avait déjà été touchée le 4 juillet par une attaque armée, faisant trois blessés parmi les casques bleus à Lavado, à une soixantaine de kilomètres à l'est de Nyala.



La capitale du Sud-Darfour a, elle aussi, été le théâtre de violences la semaine passée. Des ""différends"" entre membres de forces de sécurité seraient à l'origine de heurts qui ont fait au moins huit morts, dont deux travailleurs humanitaires, entre le 3 et le 7 juillet.

Plus de 40 Casques bleus ont péri lors d'actions hostiles depuis la mise en place de la Minuad en 2007. Des sources à l'ONU déplorent régulièrement ne jamais avoir été informées de poursuites judiciaires à l'encontre des responsables, malgré des appels répétés des Nations unies en ce sens.

Au moins 300 000 personnes ont été tuées et 1,8 million déplacées au Darfour en dix ans, selon l'ONU. Khartoum parle de son côté de 10 000 morts.

"http://www.france24.com/fr/20130927-shebab-somalie-financement-braconnage-elephants-tues-alarme-ONG-trafic-ivoire-defenses","Le trafic d'ivoire finance les Shebab somaliens","Les Shebab de Somalie, à l’origine, selon les autorités kenyanes, de l’attaque terroriste de Nairobi se financeraient en grande partie grâce au trafic d’ivoire, selon une ONG. Chaque année, des milliers d'éléphants sont tués pour leurs défenses.





Pendant plusieurs années, Andrea Crosta, directeur de l’EAL, et son équipe, ont mené une enquête sur le trafic d’ivoire. Il y a un an, ils affirmaient dans un article publié en 2012 que ""le trafic [de l’ivoire] pouvait représenter jusqu’à 40 % des fonds"" dont jouissent les Shebab. Quel est le lien entre les éléphants africains et les Shebab de Somalie ? Rien d’évident, à première vue. Pourtant, à en croire l’ONG Elephant Action League (EAL), les premiers permettraient le financement des seconds. Plus précisément, ces islamistes venus de Somalie financeraient une grande partie de leurs actions dans la contrebande de défenses de pachydermes africains. Un fléau sur le continent, où chaque année, entre 25 000 et 35 000 éléphants sont tués par des braconniers, selon diverses ONG.Pendant plusieurs années, Andrea Crosta, directeur de l’EAL, et son équipe, ont mené une enquête sur le trafic d’ivoire. Il y a un an, ils affirmaient dans un article publié en 2012 que ""le trafic [de l’ivoire] pouvait représenter jusqu’à 40 % des fonds"" dont jouissent les Shebab.

""Mais contrairement à d’autres milices, ce ne sont pas les Shebab qui tuent les éléphants"", a-t-il précisé jeudi 25 septembre auprès de l’AFP. ""Ils font juste le commerce de l’ivoire […] Certains trafiquants au Kenya préfèrent vendre aux Shebab, non seulement parce qu’ils payent bien, mais aussi parce que ça évite les tracas et les risques pour faire sortir l’ivoire du pays.""

""Nous demandons à la communauté internationale de commencer à considérer tous les trafiquants d’ivoire (et de corne de rhinocéros), les commerçants, les acheteurs et même les gouvernements comme des complices de facto de ces massacres, d’exploitation de l’être humain et même de terrorisme"", poursuit Andrea Costa.

Selon l’ONG, l’argent de l’ivoire permet aux Shebab d’avoir la ""mainmise sur de jeunes soldats dont beaucoup n’ont pas de motivation idéologique"". Avant l’intervention kényane en Somalie d’octobre 2011, ""entre une et trois tonnes d’ivoires, vendues à environ 200 euros par kilo, transitaient chaque mois par les ports de Somalie du sud"", estime l’organisation.

90% du trafic est destiné à l’Asie

À en croire Andrea Crosta, l’intervention militaire du Kenya n’a pas mis fin à ce trafic. ""Mais les Shebab ont dû s’adapter notamment après la perte des ports de Kismayo et Merca. Ils contrôlent toujours de vastes zones dans le sud de la Somalie. Ils opèrent à travers la frontière et ont mis en place un réseau efficace au Kenya"".

Le commerce mondial de l’ivoire a été interdit en 1990 par la Convention des Nations unies sur le commerce international des espèces de faune et de flore sauvages menacés d’extinction (Cites). Mais la vente de défenses d’éléphants représente un commerce extrêmement lucratif tant la demande est forte, notamment en Asie – le Fonds international pour la protection des animaux (IFAW) estime que 90% du commerce illégal d’ivoire a pour destination finale la Chine et la Thaïlande, où l’ivoire est prisé pour la fabrication d’objets d’art, et considéré comme ayant des vertus médicinales.

Bas Huijbregts, du World Wildlife Fund (WWF) , estimait, dans une longue enquête de Jeune Afrique publiée en juillet dernier, que le marché mondial du commerce de l’ivoire représenterait entre 500 et 900 millions de dollars chaque année. Et les saisies massives (c’est-à-dire supérieures à 800 kg) augmentent constamment. ""Cela témoigne de l’implication des grands réseaux criminels, seuls capables d’organiser et de financer de telles expéditions"", affirme Tom Milliken, directeur du Système d'information sur le commerce des éléphants (Etis), également cité par Jeune Afrique.

Selon un rapport de l’ONU publié en mai 2013, les Shebab ne sont pas les seuls groupes terroristes à se financer grâce au trafic d’ivoire. Le représentant de l’ONU en Afrique centrale y assurait avoir ""été informé, lors de consultations avec les autorités locales dans la région, que le commerce illégal de l’ivoire peut constituer une importe source de financement pour des groupes armés, dont la LRA [l’armée de résistance du Seigneur, groupe rebelle ougandais, NDLR]"".

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130805-nelson-mandela-south-africa-utilities-johannesburg-health","Mandela threatened over 'unpaid' utilities bill","Authorities in Johannesburg admitted Monday they had mistakenly delivered a utilities bill to Nelson Mandela's upmarket home and threatened to cut the ailing icon's water and electricity supply.

The city authorities in Johannesburg, South Africa, were forced on Monday to apologise to ailing former president Nelson Mandela – for mistakenly threatening to cut off his electricity and water supply.

A 6,500-rand (500 euro) bill arrived at the Nobel Prize winner’s house on Saturday, threatening ""discontinuation or restriction of services"" and legal action if the 30-day arrears were not paid,

The city, which has faced a barrage of complaints from residents for bungled bills, said the notice was supposed to have been delivered to a different house.



""The address and account number stated on the notice belong to another customer and property in a neighbouring suburb, not to the Mandela residence,"" said city spokesman Kgamanyane Maphologela.

""The city wants to convey an apology to the Mandela family for any inconvenience caused by this unfortunate incident,"" it said in a statement.

It is not the first time an errant bill has embarrassed the city. Last month a bill for 3.5 million rand (270,000 euros) was erroneously sent to the African National Congress (ANC) party's headquarters.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130804-iran-president-hassan-rohani-sworn-office-ali-khamenei","Iranian president Hassan Rohani sworn into office","Iran’s new president Hassan Rohani (pictured centre) took the oath of office before parliament in the capital Tehran on Sunday, one day after he was officially endorsed by the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Hassan Rohani was officially sworn in as Iran’s new president on Sunday, a day after he was endorsed by the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

In his first speech he vowed to improve the lives of ordinary Iranians and lead a government of righteousness, honesty and trustworthiness.

""The people voted for moderation ... the people want to live better, to have dignity, and enjoy a stable life. They want to recapture their deserving position among nations,"" he said shortly after being sworn in.

US willing to work with Rohani government on Iran nuclear programme The United States said on Sunday it is prepared to work with new Iranian President Hassan Rohani’s administration to address international concerns over the country’s controversial nuclear programme, as long as Iran is willing to engage seriously on the issue.



“The inauguration of President Rohani presents an opportunity for Iran to act quickly to resolve the international community’s deep concerns over Iran’s nuclear program,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement.



“Should this new government choose to engage substantively and seriously to meet its international obligations and find a peaceful solution to this issue, it will find a willing partner in the United States,” he said. (FRANCE 24 with wires)

Rohani also called for better relations with the West and the demise of international sanctions. ""The only path to interact with Iran is through negotiations on equal grounds, reciprocal trust-building, mutual respect and reducing hostilities"" he said.

Sunday's ceremony was attended by some nine regional leaders, marking the first time the Islamic republic extended invitations to all countries, except the United States.



Challenges ahead for Rohani

Rohani, who won the country’s June 14 presidential election by a landslide, has been widely portrayed as a moderate.

But he has inherited a number of challenges as Iran experiences its worst political and economic isolation in two decades.

He faces the enormous task of attempting to rescue an economy weighed down by sanctions and the profligacy of the previous government.

He also has to try to balance the demands of hardliners who dominate parliament and the officially sidelined reformists whose support helped him win the election.

Cabinet nominations

After taking the oath, Rohani unveiled his proposed cabinet.

Rohani nominated veteran diplomat Javad Zarif as foreign minister and Bijan Zanganeh as oil minister.

The cabinet nominations have to be reviewed by parliament, then approved by Khamenei.

Clashes between Islamist rebel forces and Kurdish fighters spread to a second Syrian province on July 20, activists said, as factional tensions rose in the north of the country.

People’s Defense Units (YPG), the militant wing of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), and al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front have been engaged in a fight for almost a week in the Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn, near the Turkish border town of Ceylanpınar.

The new round of fighting broke out in Tel Abyad, a border town near Turkey in the rebel-held Raqqa province. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said clashes began after Kurdish fighters in the area discovered fighters from an al Qaeda-linked rebel group trying to rig one of their bases with explosives.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130706-bolivia-venezuela-nicaragua-snowden-asylum","Bolivia third country to offer Snowden asylum","Bolivia on Saturday joined its allies Venezuela and Nicaragua in offering to grant asylum to US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden. The fugitive who has been in legal limbo at Moscow airport since June 23.

NSA leaker Edward Snowden has yet another place to go, if only he can get there.

Bolivian President Evo Morales says Snowden is welcome in his country. He said Saturday he is making the offer as a protest against the U.S. and European nations he accuses of temporarily blocking his flight home from a Moscow summit because they suspected it might have Snowden on board.

Morales follows Presidents Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela and Daniel Ortega in making the offer. He’d earlier said he was willing to consider asylum for Snowden, the same position taken by Ecuador, which is another of Bolivia’s leftist Latin American allies.

Morales did not say if he has received a formal petition for asylum from Snowden.

The presidents of Nicaragua and Venezuela made their offers during during separate speeches in their home countries on Friday, one day after leftist South American leaders gathered to denounce the rerouting of Bolivian President Evo Morales’ plane over Europe amid reports that the American was aboard.

Snowden, who is being sought by the United States, has asked for asylum in numerous countries, including Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Venezuela’s Maduro made the offer during a speech marking the anniversary of Venezuela’s independence. It was not immediately clear if there were any conditions to the offer.

Nicaragua’s Ortega said he was willing to make Maduro’s same offer “if circumstances allow it,” although he didn’t say what the right circumstances would be when he spoke during a speech in Managua.

He said the Nicaraguan embassy in Moscow received Snowden’s application for asylum and that it is studying the request.

“We have the sovereign right to help a person who felt remorse after finding out how the United States was using technology to spy on the whole world, and especially its European allies,” Ortega said.

The offers came one day after Maduro joined other leftist South American presidents Thursday in Cochabamba, Bolivia, to rally behind Morales and denounce the incident involving the plane.

Spain on Friday said it had been warned along with other European countries that Snowden, a former U.S. intelligence worker, was aboard the Bolivian presidential plane, an acknowledgement that the manhunt for the fugitive leaker had something to do with the plane’s unexpected diversion to Austria.

It is unclear whether the United States warned Madrid about the Bolivian president’s plane. U.S. officials will not detail their conversations with European countries, except to say that they have stated the U.S.’s general position that it wants Snowden back.

President Barack Obama has publicly displayed a relaxed attitude toward Snowden’s movements, saying last month that he wouldn’t be “scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.”

But the drama surrounding the flight of Morales, whose plane was abruptly rerouted to Vienna after apparently being denied permission to fly over France, suggests that pressure is being applied behind the scenes.

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told Spanish National Television that “they told us that the information was clear, that he was inside.”

He did not identify who “they” were and declined to say whether he had been in contact with the U.S. But he said that European countries’ decisions were based on the tip.

France has since sent a letter of apology to the Bolivian government.

Meanwhile, secret-spilling website WikiLeaks said that Snowden, who is still believed to be stuck in a Moscow airport’s transit area, had put in asylum applications to six new countries. He had already sought asylum from more than 20 countries. Many have turned him down.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130704-sarkozy-exceeded-campaign-spending-limits-france","Sarkozy 'exceeded campaign spending limits'","France's top constitutional court said Thursday that former president Nicolas Sarkozy exceeded legal spending limits during his 2012 presidential campaign. The ruling confirms the findings of the country's electoral finance watchdog.

France's top constitutional court said Thursday that former president Nicolas Sarkozy exceeded legal spending limits during his 2012 presidential campaign, confirming the earlier findings of the country's electoral finance watchdog.

The ruling means Sarkozy is no longer eligible to be reimbursed for the 47.5 percent of his campaign spending that he was entitled to under election financing laws and will lose out on an estimated €10 million ($13 million).

Sarkozy will also need to refund the €150,000 he received from the state for his campaign.

The Constitutional Council said in a statement that it was confirming an earlier decision by France's electoral finance watchdog that Sarkozy had declared expenses of nearly €23 million, which exceeds the spending limit by 2.1 percent.

Sarkozy responded by “immediately” resigning from the Constitutional Council, on which all former French presidents are allowed to serve. As France's highest legal body, the council reviews the legality of proposed legislation.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130705-sarkozy-mobilise-campaign-finance-france-ump","Sarkozy vows to 'mobilise' over campaign finance row","Ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy urged supporters to ""mobilise"" on Friday, a day after France's Constitutional Council said Sarkozy had exceeded legal spending limits in the 2012 presidential campaign and denied his party an €11 million reimbursement.

Nicolas Sarkozy made a dramatic return to the French political scene on Friday, slamming a decision to deny his right-wing UMP party millions of euros in campaign reimbursements and issuing a call to arms to his supporters.



Sarkozy, defeated by Socialist Francois Hollande in last year's presidential vote, denounced the ""unprecedented"" decision to deny his party campaign funds and vowed to ""take on my responsibilities"".



With his party stuck in a divisive leadership battle and now facing financial chaos, the 58-year-old Sarkozy appeared to be positioning himself for the political comeback many have been predicting since his defeat.



Party sources said Sarkozy would attend an extraordinary meeting of the UMP leadership on Monday.



An enraged Sarkozy on Thursday took the unexpected step of resigning from the Constitutional Council, France's top constitutional body, after it upheld a decision by election auditors to deny the UMP a reimbursement of about 11 million euros ($13 million) because it breached campaign spending limits.



In a statement on his Facebook page, Sarkozy said the council's decision ""threatens the political party that must prepare the so-necessary alternative to Socialism"".



""I have to take on my responsibilities by committing myself to guaranteeing the freedom of democratic expression in our country,"" Sarkozy said.



""I ask you to help me by mobilising, as I will, to this end,"" he said, urging supporters to make donations to the party.



The council, which former presidents join automatically, concluded that the UMP had breached the spending ceiling by 2.1 percent so was not eligible for the reimbursement of 47.5 percent of total campaign spending it had been due.



'Hard blow' to Sarkozy's party



It was the first time a candidate reaching the second round of a French presidential election was not reimbursed for campaign expenses.



Right-wing newspaper Le Figaro said the decision dealt a ""hard blow"" to Sarkozy's party and ""threatens to exacerbate the UMP's already very-difficult financial situation.""



Popular daily Le Parisien said Sarkozy's resignation from the council marked the first step in his comeback attempt.



""War has been declared,"" the paper wrote, quoting Sarkozy aides saying they believed the council's decision was orchestrated by the government to damage Sarkozy and the UMP.



The UMP has been struggling since Sarkozy's defeat, with party leader Jean-Francois Cope and ex-prime minister Francois Fillon embroiled in a bitter public leadership battle that has hurt its reputation.



Sarkozy remains the favourite choice of UMP supporters to be the party's candidate in the next presidential election in 2017, with 87 percent in a recent poll hoping he will run.



Sarkozy has stayed out of the political spotlight since his loss, resuming his corporate law practice and lecturing on the international circuit, but has suggested he could return out of a ""duty"" to the French people.



Hollande meanwhile has seen his popularity ratings plummet after unemployment hit record highs, the economy slid into recession and government spending cuts began to bite.



A recent poll put Hollande's confidence rating at only 27 percent.



Still, few expect a political return for Sarkozy to be easy. Outside of right-wing circles, Sarkozy was a deeply unpopular figure going into last year's election, criticised for his flashy style and abrasive personality.



He is also at the centre of a series of ongoing criminal investigations, including accusations his 2007 campaign accepted envelopes stuffed with cash from France's richest woman, Liliane Bettencourt, when she was too frail to know what she was doing.



Prosecutors have recommended that the charges against Sarkozy in the Bettencourt case be dropped, but a number of other probes are continuing, including into allegations that he accepted up to 50 million euros from former Libyan strongman Moamer Kadhafi for the 2007 campaign.



Sarkozy could also see his name dragged into the investigation into a 400 million euro state payout to controversial tycoon Bernard Tapie in 2008, when Sarkozy was president and current IMF chief Christine Lagarde was his finance minister.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130705-ump-financial-hardship-sarkozy-campaign-overspending-cope-fundraising","Sarkozy woes push UMP party to brink of bankruptcy","France’s main opposition UMP party has edged closer to bankruptcy after France’s top court confirmed Thursday that presidential nominee Nicolas Sarkozy exceeded spending limits in 2012 and would not be receiving 11 million euros in state subsidies.

France’s 2012 presidential election has returned to haunt the main opposition Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party. Not only did the hard-fought campaign end in defeat for outgoing president Nicolas Sarkozy, but spending beyond legal limits has now burned an additional 11-million-euro hole in the right-wing party’s finances.

Sarkozy angrily resigned from his lifetime post on France’s Constitutional Council on Thursday, after the body rejected his presidential campaign’s financial accounting. The decision effectively means the UMP party will be denied 11 million euros the state would have otherwise reimbursed.

UMP President Jean-François Copé reacted by saying the party would launch a fundraising appeal among party members and sympathisers to lift the party out of the economic red zone, and convene a meeting of top party officials to discuss “all the implications” of the court’s decision.

“I have started to hear people raise the possibility that, financially strangled, the UMP will not be able to express its ideas for the benefit of French people,” Copé told reporters on Thursday, “that it will not be able to denounce the politics of the left, which now holds all the power [in government].”

The Constitutional Council said Sarkozy’s campaign had spent 22,872,615 euros, or exceeded authorised limits imposed by election authorities by 2.1% (466,118 euros).

Rather than set off a budgetary headache for Sarkozy’s party, the court’s ruling has worsened an existing hardship.

After losing the 2011 presidential elections, the UMP was trounced in the 2012 parliamentary poll, ceding 125 MP seats to France’s Socialist Party and Green Party.

According to state funding rules for political parties, the UMP’s reduced representation in parliament meant it received 13 million euros less in 2012 than it did compared to the previous year.

The UMP was 44 million euros in debt in 2011 and French media have reported that the party took out a 55-million-euro loan for five years in January, putting up its party’s headquarters as collateral.

Thomas Guénolé, a professor of politics at Sciences Po university, said the UMP was bankrupt. “It’s important to realize how serious [the court’s ruling] is for the UMP… it’s going to need a second bailout plan, just like Greece.”

The fallout from the successive financial setbacks is glaring when considering the party’s annual operating budget, which was 54 million euros in 2009 and 50 million euros in 2010.

The constitutional council’s slap could hardly come at a worse time as the country gears up for municipal elections in 2014, a ballot that will be significant for UMP as it attempts to claw back political territory lost to the Socialist Party in 2008.

Swiss voters have overwhelmingly backed proposals to limit executive pay. More than 2 thirds of Swiss chose to give shareholders a veto over compensation for bosses, as well as payouts for managers leaving their jobs. The move comes only days after the EU approved measures to cap bankers' bonuses and is being watched with interest from other European countries such as Germany, where some politicians hope to introduce similar measures.","2013-03-04 21:44:05","0","89.0","0.0","6.0","2.0","31.0","0.0","127.0","127.0","0.0","208.0","0.0","9.0","1","87","97.44","54.57","8.19","98.62","29.00","31.03","73.56","33.33","2.30","1.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.15","1.15","3.45","18.39","3.45","4.60","4.60","0.00","11.49","10.34","9.20","1.15","4.60","2.30","8.05","6.90","1.15","1.15","0.00","1.15","3.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.90","0.00","2.30","1.15","2.30","0.00","2.30","1.15","1.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.94","1.15","3.45","9.20","3.45","0.00","1.15","8.05","1.15","11.49","3.45","3.45","4.60","13.79","0.00","0.00","9.20","0.00","0.00","1.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.15","0.00","10.34","3.45","2.30","1.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.30","0.00","1.15","0.00","0.00","458","10.24","29.0","137","85","3","42.75","14.6","14.3","15.84","19.4","28","14.333333333333334","26.496470588235294","74","26.67","1","0.34","0","1","4","4","0","11","8","1","0","0","10","6","0","17","0","0","0","1","4","0","0","0","4","0","4","2","2","2","3","2","0","0","0","1"
"http://www.france24.com/en/20130228-eu-officials-agree-historic-cap-banker-bonuses","EU officials agree to historic cap on banker bonuses","The European Union struck a historic deal on Thursday to cap bankers’ bonuses, which critics say played a major role in feeding the financial crisis. New rules require banks to improve their stability in order to withstand future economic crises.

The European Union has reached a deal to cap bankers' bonuses, which critics say played a major role in driving the financial crisis, officials said on Thursday.



The deal was struck early on Thursday, with the European Parliament and the EU's current Irish presidency agreeing on how to implement new rules for the banking sector.



""For the first time in the history of EU financial market regulation, we will cap bankers' bonuses,"" said MEP Othmar Karas, the negotiator for the parliament.



The new regulatory framework is known as Basel III, an internationally-agreed set of rules which tighten up bank capital requirements.



The negotiations on Basel III implementation in the EU have dragged on for some 10 months, in part because of the European Parliament's desire to peg back banker bonuses which critics blame for helping drive the speculative approach in the lead-up to the 2008 global financial crisis.



Basel III was supposed to have been implemented from January this year but the timetable has slipped, with the United States announcing in November that it too would not make the deadline.



The accord reached overnight will now go forward to EU finance ministers when they meet next week in Brussels.



Kras said the provisions on banker bonuses were ""not the most important part of the new rules,"" the key point being the new capital regulations for the banks.



""The essence is that from 2014, European banks will have to set aside more money to be more stable and concentrate on their core business, namely financing the real economy, that of small- and medium-sized enterprises and jobs.""



Basel III notably requires the banks to build up their capital buffers and reserves so that they will be better able to withstand any new crisis.



Full details of the EU accord will be released at a press conference in the European Parliament later on Thursday.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130301-switzerland-referendum-executive-pay-shareholders-ubs-novartis-minder","Who should decide how much a CEO is paid? The shareholders, of course!","Swiss voters decide on Sunday whether to approve a referendum giving shareholders real power over the boards where their money is invested. If voters say ""Yes"", it would be nothing short of a revolution in business-friendly Switzerland.

At the UBS general meeting of 2008, one outraged shareholder jumped onto the stage, and tried to give then-CEO Marcel Ospel a copy of Swiss company law. Millionaire Thomas Minder was outraged that the bank's management had lost so much money from risky investment in the subprime crash. ""You are responsible for the biggest write-offs in Swiss corporate history!""

UBS had to write off 60 billion Swiss francs in assets, and ask the Swiss government for a bailout. On that day in 2008 in Basel, Thomas Minder was frogmarched out of the UBS meeting by security guards. But two months later, he handed in the 100,000 signatures needed to force a vote and impose some of the tightest controls on managerial compensation in the world.

What, exactly, would the vote change?

If it passes, the referendum would

give shareholders a binding vote on total pay to the board;

force annual elections to the board;

oblige pension funds to vote ""in the interest of their members"" and make their vote public;

prevent golden goodbyes or ""parachutes""

infringement of these rules could be punished by three years in jail or a fine equivalent to six years of compensation.

But this change in the constitution doesn't specify a limit - there's no question of say, stopping salaries or bonuses at the 5 or 10 million franc mark. Swiss people are pragmatic, and overall, happy for business to be left alone, as long as it brings value to Switzerland. UBS broke that pact when it risked the house on the sub-prime crisis.

It has taken five years of campaigning to get to Sunday's vote. In that time, the economic crisis that has hit the world has also come to Switzerland - albeit here it's more of a gentle slap, pushing unemployment up by one point to 5%.

Still, it's made Swiss people more open to Minder's argument of reining in excessive executive pay. Fifty-seven percent of people think they will vote for the change, according to the last survey before the poll.

Support across the board

""You could have the same quality of people, probably an even better quality of people, if money and greed were not so much of an issue in the top ranks."" The former Vice-President of UBS, Hans Zuberbuehler, has come around to the Minder way of thinking. He wrinkles his nose in disgust when he thinks about recent pay packages and bonuses awarded to Swiss CEOs. ""You have a pool of high-level managers who give big salaries to themselves. They cross each other as chairman and in boards, and so everyone is interested in giving each other high salaries because they get it back too.""

Would Mr Zuberbuehler have been happy to let other people vote on his salary? After all, that is what a “Yes” vote would amount to, albeit for the company's top layer of management. ""Well, my money always had a link with the work I was doing. I had 300 people and good results.""

UBS awarded 242 million francs to its board in 2006, just before the financial crisis hit. Opposition was muted at the time, but got much louder two years later when the bank had to write off so many assets.

Even Swiss pharma giant Novartis was hit with hefty criticism just this year, when it announced that former CEO and chairman Daniel Vasella would get a 72 million franc severance package. In Switzerland, they don't mind people being rich - after all, one in ten households have more than a million francs. But that wealth has to be discreet - and deserved.

Last month in Zurich, France 24 attended the quarterly results presentation of Credit Suisse, another banking giant. CEO Brady Dougan got 70 million Swiss francs in a bonus at the start of 2010, even though the economic crisis was already biting. His compensation has varied with the bank's performance, going from 19 million francs in 2009 to 6 million in 2011.

France 24 asked Mr Dougan: would Credit Suisse still be an appealing place to work if the referendum went through? ""Whether the Minder initiative gets through is something for the Swiss people to decide on."" A sort of hedge your bets, no comment then.

Dougan did point out ""We have already adopted, voluntarily, a shareholder vote, a consultative vote, on compensation. That is something we have been doing for a number of years."" Consultative votes on pay may be useful, but they are not binding. Forty-nine out of Switzerland's top 100 companies already offer them.

We've seen time and time again how images captured by ordinary citizens then uploaded onto the Web can change history, or at least shift the balance of power. This week, we take a look back at some of those moments.

Story 1: Russia

We begin today with a young man who is brave to show his face. His name is Andrei Nasonov. He is openly gay, in a country - Russia - where that can be dangerous. There's a law making its way through the Russian parliament right now that will make it a crime to display ""homosexual propaganda"" such as kissing or holding hands. The law is backed by the Orthodox Church, and when Andrei and some of his comrades tried to demonstrate against it, they were met by a crowd of nationalist and religious thugs.

Story 2: United Kingdom

Next stop, London, for more religious intolerance, this time from young Muslims in the East End borough of Tower Hamlets. The borough has one of the highest populations of south Asians in Britain, mostly Muslims of Bangladeshi origin. Some of these young Muslims have posted videos online showing them hassling passers-by, telling them they're entering a ""Muslim area"" and should act according to sharia law.

Police have arrested two young men in connection with the videos, and have reinforced their presence in the area.





Story 3: World

Now for our weekly roundup of stories and images sent in by our Observers.

First stop Iran, and a grim machine - specially made to cut off fingers. It's well-known that theft is punishable by amputation in Iran, but it's rare for the authorities to draw attention to it. In this case one of Iran's official news agencies published photographs of the amputation machine. Our Observer Mahmoud follows human rights in Iran. He said he'd never seen such a device before, and wondered if its publication was a way of intimidating potential protesters ahead of the presidential election in June.

Now further north, to Azerbaijan. The country’s oil wealth has made many people rich, but many more have stayed poor and tensions sometimes fray. That’s what happened in the central city of Ismailli, when a young hotel owner crashed his Chevy Camaro sports car onto a sidewalk. No-one was injured, but there was an argument. A crowd gathered, and turned on the driver, torching his hotel and the luxury cars parked outside. Our Observer Rashad says they were angry because they believed the hotel owner was a relative of the governor. The next day several hundred people came out to call for the governor to resign, but he refused.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130104-brigitte-bardot-threatens-follow-depardieu-russia-save-elephants","Bardot threatens to follow Depardieu to Russia","French screen icon Brigitte Bardot on Friday threatened to follow compatriot Gérard Depardieu to Russia, who was granted citizenship for tax exile, unless two elephants who are in danger of being put down, are spared.

French cinema legend Brigitte Bardot on Friday threatened to follow Gerard Depardieu to Russia unless two elephants under threat of being put down are granted a reprieve.



In a surreal twist to the saga over Depardieu's move into tax exile, the veteran animal rights campaigner said she would emulate his request for Russian nationality unless authorities intervened to save Baby and Nepal.



The two elephants face being put down because they have been diagnosed with tuberculosis and have been deemed a threat to the health of other animals and visitors to the Tete d'Or zoo in Lyon.



City authorities ordered the elephants to be put down last month but a petition organised by their original owner, circus master Gilbert Edelstein, resulted in them being granted a temporary reprieve over Christmas.



Bardot said in a statement she would be leaving France if the reprieve was not made permanent.



""If the powers that be have the cowardice and the shamelessness to kill Baby and Nepal... I have decided to take Russian nationality and quit this country that is nothing more an animal cemetery,"" Bardot said.



Bardot, 77, has been a high-profile supporter of Depardieu in his spat with the French government over his decision to take up residence in neighbouring Belgium for tax reasons.



She said last month that her fellow actor, who was branded ""pathetic"" by Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, had been the ""victim of extremely unfair persecution"".

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130103-sudan-south-ethiopia-oil-bashir","Blighted economies force Sudans to negotiating table","Motivated in large part by the fragility of their respective economies, the presidents of Sudan and South Sudan meet in Ethiopia January 4-5 to try to resolve oil and border conflicts.

After months of stalemate, a resolution to the crisis gripping the two Sudans could be in sight.

Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir met his South Sudanese counterpart, Salva Kiir, in Ethiopia on Friday, January 4, at the urging of the African Union. The two countries, which signed a peace deal in 2005 after a long civil war, were expected to discuss the possibility of establishing a demilitarised buffer zone along the disputed border separating them.

The resumption of oil flows will also be one of the most pressing issues on the table.

Since the two Sudans separated on July 9, 2011, Khartoum has been deprived of 75% of its oil resources, located in the south. Meanwhile, Juba, the capital of landlocked South Sudan, has had to rely on the north’s pipeline, refinery and export terminal at Port Sudan on the Red Sea.

Tensions reached a head in January 2012, when a spat with the north over transit fees prompted South Sudan to halt its oil production entirely.



Sudan faces economic consequences of split

South Sudan accuses Sudan of incursion Sudanese troops clashed with South Sudanese forces along their restive border, South Sudan's army said Thursday, a day ahead of planned talks between the presidents of the two rival nations.



Sudanese planes also dropped bombs as the rival forces clashed on Wednesday in South Sudan's remote north Raja region of Western Bahr el-Ghazal state, said the South's army spokesman Philip Aguer.



""They attacked on Wednesday, and the fighting continued until late in the afternoon... It is a remote region so we are still awaiting updates on casualties,"" he said.



United Nations peacekeepers could not confirm the reports and the claims could not be independently verified. (AFP)



“It’s the economy that is forcing the two sides to sit down together at the negotiating table,” explained Benjamin Augé, a researcher on African affairs at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI). “Without the oil revenue it used to have, the north is economically asphyxiated, while the south – which doesn’t yet have a well-established economy – is struggling to dig up funds. Their short-term strategy of fighting each other and creating instability along their border cannot last.”

According to Augé, the north did not prepare sufficiently for the economic fallout from the separation from the south. “The leaders in the north should have put in place some kind of policy to compensate for the loss of three-quarters of their oil resources – notably by investing in the exploration of new oil deposits or beefing up the industry,” he noted. “But they waited too long.”

Now, with rebel attacks becoming more frequent, Sudanese are becoming increasingly angry with their political leaders. “The rise in prices coupled with enormous inflation has made the cost of living unmanageable for many inhabitants,” Augé said.

Shaky administration in south

In the south, things hardly look more promising. “Now that the civil war is over, there is a population of 10 million to oversee – people with legitimate expectations from their government,” Augé explained. “Many countries contributed, either financially or with technical support, to the construction of South Sudan’s government – particularly the US and Norway – but there’s still much to be done.”

Without solid infrastructure and a functioning administration, South Soudan, which produced 350,000 barrels of oil per day before gaining its independence, is currently overwhelmed. “In Juba, there are not enough people working in the government, and many of the employed civil servants are far from competent,” Augé said. “It will take several years to get things up to standard. Some people who received their training in South Africa or the US have returned home but don’t necessarily have access to the highest-ranking positions, and are not always accepted by those who stayed during the civil war.”

At the same time, the economic interdependence that has weakened both Sudan and South Sudan is precisely what has pushed them toward a possible resolution. In his vows for 2013, President Salva Kiir of South Sudan announced that he would temporarily withdraw forces from the border areas in order to facilitate the creation of an “operational” demilitarised border. Such a zone would nevertheless likely be monitored by soldiers from both Sudans, as well as UN forces.

Still, the outcome of the upcoming meeting in Addis Abeba is uncertain. “There is so much mistrust from both sides that has built up over the past 50 years, that it’s extremely difficult to predict whether these talks will be fruitful,” Augé assessed.

Aside from oil and border issues, Augé noted, there is the still-unresolved matter of contested regions like Abyei, as well as the thorny question of Sudan’s debt, which it is asking South Sudan to help pay off.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130109-venezuela-chavez-inauguration-postponed-cancer","Venezuela rules delayed Chavez inauguration ‘legal’","Venezuela’s Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in favour of the government’s decision to postpone President Hugo Chavez’s inauguration until after he recovers from cancer surgery, despite criticism from the opposition.

Venezuela’s top court endorsed the postponement of Hugo Chavez’s inauguration this week and ruled on Wednesday that the cancer-stricken president and his deputy would continue in their roles, despite a cacophony of opposition complaints.



Critics had argued the 58-year-old’s absence from his own swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 10 meant a caretaker president must be appointed. Chavez has not been seen in public nor heard from in almost a month following surgery in Cuba.



“Right now we cannot say when, how or where the president will be sworn in,” Supreme Court Chief Judge Luisa Morales told a news conference.



“As president re-elect there is no interruption of performance of duties ... The inauguration can be carried out at a later date before the Supreme Court.”





FRANCE 24 speaks with Venezuela expert Natalia Brandler

The decision opens the door in theory for Chavez to remain in office for weeks or months more from a Cuban hospital bed - though there is no evidence he is even conscious.



It leaves the South American country in the hands of Vice President Nicolas Maduro, as de facto leader of the government.



The opposition say that is a brazen violation of the constitution, and that Maduro should leave office on Thursday when the current presidential term had been due to expire.



They say National Assembly boss Diosdado Cabello, another powerful Chavez ally, should take over the running of the country while new elections would be organized within 30 days.



Maduro would be the ruling Socialist Party’s candidate.



Government leaders insist Chavez, 58, is fulfilling his duties as head of state, even though official medical bulletins say he suffered complications after the surgery, including a severe lung infection, and has had trouble breathing.



His resignation or death would transform politics in the OPEC nation, where he is revered by poor supporters thankful for his social largesse, but denounced by opponents as a dictator.



Rally planned for Thursday



Moody’s Investors Service warned on Wednesday that Venezuela’s sovereign credit rating, already at junk status, faces short-term risks over any political transition.



Prices of Venezuela’s widely traded bonds have soared lately on Chavez’s health woes, but dipped this week as investors’ expectations of a quick government change apparently dimmed.



The president has undergone four operations, as well as weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, since being diagnosed with an undisclosed type of cancer in his pelvic area in June 2011.



He looked to have staged a remarkable recovery from the illness last year, winning a new six-year term at a hard-fought election in October. But within weeks of his victory he had to return to Havana for more treatment.



The government has called for a huge rally outside the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas on Thursday, and allied leaders including Uruguay’s Jose Mujica and Bolivia’s Evo Morales have said they will visit - despite Chavez’s absence.



Argentine President Cristina Fernandez, a close friend, has announced plans to visit Chavez in Cuba on Friday.



The unprecedented silence by Chavez, who is well known for his hours-long rambling speeches, has convinced many Venezuelans that his 14 years in power may be coming to an end.



Unlike after his previous operations in Cuba, no photographs have been published of him recuperating, and social media in Venezuela is buzzing with rumors he is on life support.



Cabello, the pugnacious head of the National Assembly, has repeatedly ruled out taking over as caretaker president to order a new presidential election, saying Chavez remains in charge.



“Tomorrow we will all go to the Miraflores palace,” he told a televised Socialist Party meeting on Wednesday. “The people will be invested as president. We are all Chavez!”

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130927-poaching-funds-somalia-al-shabaab-activists-kenya-elephants-westgate-nairobi","Poaching funds Somalia's al Shabaab, activists say","Somalia’s al Shabaab militia, responsible for the Westgate mall siege in Nairobi, is being partly financed by the illegal ivory trade, a wildlife group said Thursday. The trade could be supplying up to 40% of the Islamist group’s funds.

Somalia's al Shabaab militia, which carried out a deadly attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall, is partly funded by the poaching trade, wildlife activists said Thursday.

""Over the last 18 months, we've been investigating the involvement of al Shabaab in trafficking ivory through Kenya,"" Andrea Crosta, executive director of the Elephant Action League told Agence France-Presse.

The trade “could be supplying up to 40 percent of the funds needed to keep them in business,"" Crosta said, though she specified that al Shabaab are not involved in the actual killing of elephants or rhinos.

The Islamist group has been the centre of attention after claiming responsibility for a four-day siege at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi which left scores people dead by the time it ended Tuesday.

The Elephant Action League added that there has been evidence of ties between the poaching trade and militant groups like Uganda’s Lord’s Resistance Army or Darfur’s Janjaweed, cited in a UN report published in May.

Activists hope that emphasizing the links between groups that commit violence and the illicit trade may encourage governments to crack down on the practice.

""We're asking the international community to start considering all the ivory (and rhino horn) trade's stakeholders, ivory consumers, ivory shops and even governments, de-facto accessories to manslaughter, human exploitation and even terrorism,"" Crosta said.

Illegal ivory trade driven by Asia and Middle East

According to sources within al Shabaab, one to three tons of ivory pass through the ports in southern Somalia every month, sold for an estimated $200 per kilo.

Al Shabaab's ability to profit off the trade was undermined when it lost control of southern ports in Kismayo and Merca, but the group still controls other hubs.

The illegal ivory trade, worth roughly between $7 billion and $10 billion (5.37 and 7.67 billion euros) a year, is mostly driven by demand in Asia (particularly China and Thailand) and the Middle East, where elephant tusks and rhino horns are used in traditional medicine and to make ornaments.

Ivory trade has been banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) since 1990.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20131012-africa-nations-african-union-attacks-unfair-icc-international-criminal-court-trial-Kenyatta-Ruto","African Union says ICC cannot prosecute sitting leaders","African nations slammed the International Criminal Court on Saturday for putting sitting head of states on trial and called its handling of Africa “unfair.” African Union ministers demanded that cases against Kenyan and Sudanese leaders be deferred.

African leaders called on Saturday for the prosecutions of Kenya’s and Sudan’s presidents by the International Criminal Court to be halted, amid complaints the body has only ever pursued Africans.

An African Union summit in Addis Ababa was held to discuss Africa’s relations with the court, which has convicted just one man, a Congolese warlord, and has only charged Africans.

It said the U.N. Security Council should defer the trial of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta under article 16 of the court’s Rome Statute, which allows for an initial delay of a year, or it would seek an alternative means of postponement.

“If that is not met, what the summit decided is that President Kenyatta should not appear until the request we have made is actually answered,” Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom told journalists in Addis Ababa after the meeting.

Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, have been accused of orchestrating large-scale violence after a disputed 2007 election, charges they deny. Kenyatta’s trial is due to start on Nov. 12, while Ruto’s began last month.

The African Union stance challenges the Hague-based court in its most high-profile case to date - its first trial of a sitting president.

Without an agreed legal delay in court proceedings, any decision by Kenyatta not to attend could prompt an arrest warrant, a step Western nations have wanted to avoid as it would complicate already tricky relations with a regional ally.

Until now, both Kenyans have said they will cooperate to clear their names and both have attended hearings. There was no immediate comment from the two politicians or their lawyers.

“It’s a good outcome,” Kenyan Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed told Reuters shortly after the summit closed. “We have been given instructions by the AU summit on what we should do next. We will work together with the African Union.”

African nations say the court has ignored earlier demands that the cases be delayed while the men are in office or moved closer to home.

Defiance



“We would like our concerns to be heard loud and clear,” Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, whose country chairs the African Union, told the closing session.

A group led by the AU chair with representatives from Africa’s five regions will press the U.N. Security Council to defer proceedings against Kenya’s leadership and the Sudanese president, Omar Hassan al Bashir, who faces charges of genocide.

Unlike the Kenyan politicians, Bashir has long defied an arrest warrant, deepening his nation’s alienation from the West.

“We have agreed that no charges shall be commenced or continued before any international court or tribunal against any serving head of state or government, or anybody acting or entitled to act in such capacity during his or her term of office,” Hailemariam said.

Such a rule would exempt Ruto, who is required to stand in on behalf of Kenyatta when he is out of the country.

Africans say the court has “double standards”, saying laws in other nations mean top leaders are immune from prosecution.

However, ministers did not call for a mass walk-out from the court’s jurisdiction, after officials previously said such a proposal would be on the agenda. The idea did not win broad support among Africa’s 34 signatories to the court’s statutes.

In his opening remarks, the Ethiopian prime minister said African states were not on a ""crusade"" against the court.

Rights groups had urged African nations not to turn their backs on the court, which they say is vital to ending what they see as a culture of impunity in African politics.

""Calls for immunity of the highest-level officials run counter to justice for victims,"" said Elise Keppler of New York-based Human Rights Watch. ""No one should be above the law when it comes to the gravest crimes.""

Sudan, which has not ratified the court statutes, said it was still pushing for other Africans to quit the organisation.

""What has been decided is good now, but we were working for more than that, like calling for AU member states to pull out of the ICC,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Karti told Reuters, describing The Hague-based body as ""a court for activists"".

Some Africans, including officials from heavyweights South Africa and Nigeria, had indicated there was no broad backing on the continent for a walk-out.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130903-federer-crashes-out-us-open-shock-defeat-robredo-tennis","Federer out of US Open after shock defeat to Robredo","Five-time US Open champion Roger Federer crashed out in the fourth round Monday in a shock defeat to 19th seed Tommy Robredo of Spain 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, 6-4 while Rafael Nadal secured his 19th consecutive hard court victory to reach the quarter-finals.

Roger Federer crashed out of the US Open in the fourth round on Monday while Rafael Nadal captured his 19th hardcourt win in a row to reach the quarter-finals without having allowed a service break.



Federer suffered a stunning upset at the hands of Spanish 19th seed Tommy Robredo, whose 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, 6-4 shocker was his first victory in 11 matches against the 17-time Grand Slam champion and five-time US Open winner.



""I'm going to feel like I beat myself,"" Federer said. ""It was up to me to make the difference and I just couldn't.



""I self-destructed, which is really disappointing. When things came to the crunch I just couldn't do it. It's frustrating.""



Federer's failure, which came on the heels of a shock second-round Wimbledon exit, thwarted a potential quarter-final match with 12-time Grand Slam winner Nadal in what would have been their first meeting on the New York hardcourts.



""If I'm playing like this, I'm not going to beat Rafa,"" Federer said.



This was the first year since 2002 that Federer has not made a Grand Slam final.



Instead, it will be Robredo in his first US Open quarter-final against second-seeded countryman Nadal, who dispatched Germany's 22nd-seeded Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 6-3, 6-1.



""It was very tough conditions, very humid. I sweat too much,"" Nadal said. ""But the opponent was great. Lucky to be through I think. I fought a lot to get through this match.""



Nadal leads the ATP with nine titles this season and a 56-3 record since ending a seven-month injury layoff last February, his sore knees having kept him out of last year's US Open.



Nadal has won all six career meetings with Robredo, but Federer was 10-0 against Robredo before being sent home.



""He will come to my match with big confidence,"" Nadal said. ""I hope to be ready for that.""



Robredo suffered seven prior fourth-round US Open defeats and matched his best Grand Slam performance with the dramatic upset.



""To beat Roger, it's something amazing,"" Robredo said. ""It's like a dream. I am so happy. It was a great day.""



Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer reached his eighth consecutive Grand Slam quarter-final, beating Serbian 18th seed Janko Tipsarevic 7-6 (7/2), 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/3).



Ferrer will face French eighth seed Richard Gasquet, who outlasted 10th seed Milos Raonic 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 7-6 (11/9), 7-5 after four hours and 40 minutes and despite the Canadian's 39 aces, the third-most ever in a US Open match.



Ferrer is 8-1 all-time against Gasquet, whose only prior fourth-round Slam win in 17 attempts came on his way to a 2007 Wimbledon semi-final.



In taking as many sets off Federer as he had in 10 prior losses combined, Robredo also raised questions about the future of the former world number one, who had not missed the US Open quarter-finals since a 2003 fourth-round exit.



Federer, 32, won only two of 16 break-point chances.



""I'm delighted. Today the difference is I won the break points and he did not,"" said Robredo.



Federer, whose seventh seeding at the US Open was his lowest at a Grand Slam event since 2002, hit 45 winners but also made 43 unforced errors and managed only five aces.



""I started badly,"" Federer said. ""But I struggled throughout, which is not very satisfying. I missed so many opportunities. Rhythm was off. When those things happen, clearly it's always going to be difficult.""



Federer had made 36 consecutive Grand Slam quarter-final appearances before being upset by Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky in the second round at Wimbledon, having not departed a major before the last eight since the 2004 French Open.



A rain delay of more than four hours pushed his match from Arthur Ashe Stadium to Louis Armstrong Stadium, his first match there since 2006. He had not lost there since suffering his first US Open loss back in 2000.



Federer had made eight career comebacks to win after dropping the first two sets but he failed on five break points in the fourth game of the third set and there was a sense a comeback chance had been squandered.



Robredo, 31, broke at love in the seventh game for a 4-3 edge and they held to set up the final game, fans chanting, ""Let's Go Roger"" in vain hopes of willing the wilting once-king to a rally for the ages, only to watch as Robredo held again to win in two hours and 24 minutes.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130904-us-senate-panel-approves-syria-intervention","US Senate panel approves Syria intervention","The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee gave its backing on Wednesday by a 10-7 vote to a resolution which authorises the use of military force in Syria, clearing the way for a full Senate vote, likely next week.

The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a resolution on Wednesday authorizing a limited U.S. military intervention in Syria, setting the stage for a debate in the full Senate next week on the use of military force.

The committee voted 10-7 in favor of a compromise resolution that sets a 60-day limit on any engagement in Syria and bars the use of U.S. troops on the ground for combat operations.

The compromise is more limited than President Barack Obama’s original proposal but meets the administration’s goal of punishing Syria for what the U.S. government says is the use of chemical weapons on Syrian civilians, killing more than 1,400 people.

The authorization still faces significant resistance in Congress, where many lawmakers fear it could lead to a prolonged U.S. military involvement in Syria’s civil war and spark an escalation of regional violence.

Report: Syria's parliament urges French MPs not to back strike

The full Senate is expected to vote on the resolution next week. The House of Representatives also must approve the measure.

Obama and administration officials have pushed Congress to act quickly, saying U.S. national security and international credibility is at stake in the decision whether to use force in Syria to punish President Bashar al-Assad’s government for chemical weapons use.

“If we don’t take a stand here today, I guarantee you, we are more likely to face far greater risks to our security and a far greater likelihood of conflict that demands our action in the future,” Secretary of State John Kerry told the House Foreign Affairs Committee at a separate meeting on Wednesday.

“Assad will read our silence, our unwillingness to act, as a signal that he can use his weapons with impunity,” Kerry said.

The committee vote came after the two panel leaders - Democratic Chairman Robert Menendez and senior Republican Bob Corker - crafted a compromise to meet concerns from some lawmakers that Obama’s resolution was too open-ended.

Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona had objected to the more narrow wording. But the committee adopted amendments proposed by McCain with policy goals of degrading Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons, increasing support for rebel forces and reversing battlefield momentum to create conditions for Assad’s removal.

Many lawmakers have said they are worried the resolution could lead to U.S. ground troops, or “boots on the ground,” in Syria - which administration officials said would not happen.

“It’s very clear on the House side there is no support for boots on the ground,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce told Kerry at Wednesday’s hearing, which also featured testimony from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Kerry answered flatly, “There will be no boots on the ground. The president has said it again and again.”

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130909-assad-cbs-interview-warning-obama-syria-air-strikes","Assad warns 'everything possible' if Syria attacked","Syrian President Bashar al-Assad warned the United States of repercussions if his country was targeted with air strikes, in an interview broadcast on US television Monday as US lawmakers consider measures authorising force against his regime.

President Bashar al-Assad has warned Washington it “should expect everything” if the US carries out military strikes against his war-torn country, in an interview with American television in which he repeatedly denied using chemical weapons on civilians.

“You're going to pay the price if you're not wise. There are going to be repercussions,” Assad told CBS television in an interview recorded in Damascus and broadcast on Monday. “It's an area where everything is on the brink of explosion. You have to expect everything.”

“The government's not the only player in this region. You have different parties, different factions, different ideologies. You have everything in this decision now,” Assad said, adding repercussions “may take different forms,” including “direct and indirect.”

The White House and other Western powers have accused Assad of using lethal sarin nerve gas near the capital of Damascus on August 21, killing more than 1,400 people, and have threatened to target the Syrian government with strikes in retaliation.

The Syrian president also took issue with US Secretary of State John Kerry, saying America’s top diplomat was spreading lies about the August 21 tragedy.

“How can you talk about what happened if you don't have evidences?

“In this case, Kerry didn't even present any evidence. He talks, 'We have evidence,' and he didn't present anything, not yet. Nothing so far... not a single shred of evidence,” Assad said in the interview, which he gave in English.

US vote looms over Syria

Assad’s dire warnings were aired on the eve of a planned television address by President Barack Obama to discuss possible intervention in Syria, as US lawmakers prepare to vote on authorising military force against Damascus later this week.

Obama was expected to present the case for precision strikes against government targets in an intervention to major US news networks and cable channels on Monday, ahead of an address to the nation on Tuesday.

Americans appeared to be reluctant to intervene in Syria, with recent public opinion polls showing that only 29% to 36% of people supported air strikes.

Assad told CBS that “any strike will be a direct support to al Qaeda offshoot” in Syria.

But many worry this latest development merely delays the inevitable. FRANCE 24 reports from Damascus.

Ever since Syrian President Bashar al-Assad allegedly unleashed chemical weapons on his own people on August 21, locals in Damascus have lived under the constant fear of being caught in the crossfire of US-led reprisals.

But Russia’s recent proposal for Syria to hand over its chemical weapons for dismantlement has offered a potential alternative to military action that just a few days ago seemed inevitable.

And on Tuesday US President Barack Obama announced that he had asked US lawmakers to delay a vote on whether to authorise military action against Syria as the new potential for a diplomatic solution is explored.

The news has allowed the residents of mostly pro-government Damascus to breathe a collective sigh of relief as they enjoy an unexpected reprieve.

“For the last few days we've been feeling that Syria was going to be destroyed,” says Damascus resident Muslih Saleh. “Our children have been crying every day because of the situation in our country.

“Of course I was relieved because the strike seems less likely.”

US 'won't do what's best for us'

However, after two years of war, Damascus’s citizens are sceptical of the promises made by political leaders and many believe this latest development only delays the inevitable.

Among them is Nawar Awad, a Damascus resident and political analyst.

He thinks that the security and wellbeing of Syria’s citizens will have little bearing on America’s ultimate course of action.



“Their response will have nothing to do with how the initiative affects Syria but instead its implications for America's role in the world,” he says.

“That worries me, because I know what they do won't depend on what's best for me as a Syrian citizen, as they're claiming.”

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130909-syria-france-asylum-seekers-refugees-war-europe","Syrian asylum-seekers face a tough path in France","Nearly two million Syrians have fled the conflict in their homeland, heading mostly for neighbouring countries. The lucky ones manage to make it to West European countries such as France. But the struggle is not over when they arrive.

From her new home in central France, Lina K. has been obsessively monitoring the situation in her homeland. “When we see what’s happening in Syria, we thank God everyday for our good luck, for the chance to be in France,” she says.

The 42-year-old mother of three left the northern Syrian city of Aleppo in early 2012 as the conflict between supporters and opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was turning into a brutal civil war.

Along with her husband and kids, Lina – who did not want her real name revealed – fled her comfortable home in the bustling Syrian commercial capital, abandoning family, friends and cherished memories of a lifestyle that has all but disappeared these days.

Since the Syrian uprising broke out in March 2011, the death toll has mounted to a staggering 110,000. In late August the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR ) sounded the alarm, announcing that nearly two million Syrians have left their country. The majority of them have found refuge in neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Jordan, which are struggling to cope with the massive population influx.

Lina’s family is in the lucky bracket of refugees who have managed to reach a West European nation.

""We thought about France because we have many family members who have been living here for many years,"" said Lina. But having family in France was no guarantee for obtaining a French visa. When they did get their visas, “it was a miracle for us,” she explains, her face breaking into a weak smile. ""Despite our broken dreams in Syria, we are pleased that France has welcomed us and has allowed us to raise our children in safety,” she said.

Building new lives

As a lawyer for the Paris-based refugee NGO, CAAR (Comité d’Aide Aux Réfugiés), Mathilde Schroeder has worked with many people like Lina over the past few months.

“We help them and accompany them when they arrive in France,” explained Schroeder. “Often, some of the new arrivals do not even speak Arabic – they only speak Kurdish. We are in contact with organisations that help them translate their documents and do the administrative work required to obtain a refugee status in France. We even work with them after they have obtained their refugee status,” said Schroeder.

Many of the refugees are not as fortunate as Lina and her family. ""We meet people who have fled for their lives. Some of them are traumatised, they don’t speak French and they have difficulties even finding a street. We try to find them a home or host them in centres for asylum-seekers,” she said.

The Paris-based NGO Revivre – which means “relive” in French – was founded in 2004 to aid Syrian political refugees. Sabreen al-Rassace, a volunteer at Revivre, has also witnessed the difficulties new arrivals face adjusting to a strange new life in France.

Following an increased flow of asylum-seekers since May 2012, Revivre has come up with a list of volunteer host families who house applicants for a week or up to 10 days, so new arrivals can take their cues and learn lessons from their hosts.

Al-Rassace notes that asylum seekers coming from Syria are “a real reflection of Syrian society: all the religious communities are represented and all social classes, Syrian regime deserters and well-known opposition figures, doctors, traders and professionals.”

A long wait for refugee status

While a visa to a West European country may seem like a godsend for people fleeing a deadly conflict, the difficulties do not end once they’ve landed in countries such as France. That’s when they confront their next challenge: a cumbersome administrative process that al-Rassace calls “inhuman”.

“It’s just outrageous that there are no special measures, even temporary or exceptional ones, to facilitate the process,” she complains.

But officials at OFPRA (French Office for Refugees and Stateless Persons) – the state body charged with processing asylum cases – say they are doing “everything possible to make things easier for Syrians”.



In an interview with FRANCE 24, OFPRA director Pascal Brice insisted that “the path of any asylum seeker is in itself terrible”.

""Concerning Syrian asylum-seekers, we want to have as short a response time as their situation permits,” he says referring to the time required for applicants to be granted refugee status in France.

According to Brice, the average response time for asylum-seekers is between six months and two years. “It’s now only three months for Syrian applicants,” he notes.

In 2012, 650 Syrians filed asylum application with OFPRA. “We have exceeded this figure with about 700 applications in the first seven months of 2013 alone,"" notes Brice. “Nearly 95% of Syrian applicants get a positive response. This is significant given that the average acceptance rate is 24%.”

'Syria has become like a big prison'

But for many refugee aid groups, France’s response is still insignificant. “Yes, the figures are on the rise in the rest of Europe, where 25,000 Syrians have been received. But this is ridiculous,” said Pierre Henry, head of the Paris-based NGO, FTA (France Terre d’Asile) in an interview with FRANCE 24.

Henry called on European leaders to ""unlock the doors to the EU’s borders,” adding that, “Symbolically, France cannot sit back on this issue. We have to take political responsibility. We need to make a move – like countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland or Sweden,” he said.

Earlier this month, Sweden became the first EU country to announce it will give asylum and permanent resident status to all Syrian refugees who apply.

But while some EU countries have been speeding up their asylum processing measures, for the refugees the real challenge lies in making it to Europe.

“It's simple: no visa, no future,” explained Razan M., a 22-year-old architectural student who did not want to provide her real name.

After several unsuccessful attempts to get a visa from the French Embassy in Damascus, she finally got a German visa.

""I took a plane to Berlin and then came to Paris by train since my visa is valid throughout the Schengen area,” she said. France was her destination of choice since her older sister has been living here for many years. ""Syria has become like a big prison for young people,"" she told FRANCE 24.

""I have many friends who have tried to get visas, but it’s almost impossible for young people,” she explains. The only choice, she adds, is an expensive, dangerous clandestine trip to a European country.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130907-syria-usa-europe-diplomacy-kerry-france-intervention","Kerry attempts to sell Syria intervention in Europe","US Secretary of State John Kerry landed in Lithuania Saturday at the start of a four-nation European diplomatic trip aimed at boosting international support for a military intervention on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

US Secretary of State John Kerry meets with his European counterparts Saturday in a bid to boost support for military strikes against Syria after last week’s G20 summit exposed a bitter international divide on the issue.



Kerry is holding talks with the European Union’s 28 foreign ministers in Lithuania, which currently holds the EU’s rotating chair. Later on Saturday, he flies to France – the only European country ready to cooperate in military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime following the British parliamentary vote against military involvement in Syria.





The US secretary of state’s European trip was originally scheduled to bolster European and Arab support for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. But one of the most intractable Middle East issues has once again taken a backseat as the Syrian crisis dominates international attention.



Syria also overshadowed the G20 summit, which ended Friday in St. Petersburg with the host, Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that a military intervention in Syria without UN approval would be ""outside the law "".



Putin also said Russia would ""help Syria"" if the US were to strike, pointing to existing military, economic and humanitarian cooperation.



Moscow’s veiled warning is likely to be carefully scrutinised thousands of miles away in the US, where US President Barack Obama has been attempting to sell a military intervention to a sceptical, war-weary nation ahead of next week’s Congressional vote.



Addressing reporters at the end of the G20 summit Friday, Obama said the world could not ""stand idly by"" after the Assad regime allegedly killed more than 1,400 people in a chemical weapons attack in the eastern suburbs of Damascus on August 21.



But Obama admitted he faced an uphill battle convincing the international community and Congress on the need for punitive strikes against the Assad regime. “I knew this was going to be a heavy lift,” he said.



Hollande backtracks, catches his foreign minister off-guard



The extent of the challenge was highlighted in St. Petersburg when French President François Hollande – Obama’s staunchest supporter on Syria – appeared to reverse his charge-ahead position on Friday, saying that before committing France to military action, he would wait for UN weapons inspectors to issue their report.



“There was never a question that France would intervene by itself,” Hollande told reporters at the end of the summit. “It makes sense to wait for Congress and the inspectors’ report. Once those pieces of information are in hand, I will address the nation and I will make a decision.”



Hollande’s reversal was significant since the publication of the UN report is likely to take weeks and will not assess whether Assad’s forces used chemical weapons.



The French president’s announcement appeared to catch even his foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, off-guard. Earlier on Friday, Fabius told EU foreign ministers meeting in Lithuania that there was no need to wait for the UN report since it would simply confirm what was already known – that chemical weapons attack had occurred – but would not say who was responsible.

No unity within the G20 or the EU



France was one of four European nations – including Britain, Italy and Spain – that signed a statement at the G20 meeting calling for a ""strong international response"" to the August 21 chemical attack.



The statement said the response would ""send a clear message that this kind of atrocity can never be repeated"".

Eleven nations signed the statement – including Australia, Canada, France, Britain, Italy, Spain, South Korea, Japan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.

All but Spain are members of the G20. That left 10 G20 member nations who did not sign up to the statement – including the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries.

The only European G20 nation not to sign the statement was Germany, an omission that highlights the lack of unity within the EU – a discord Kerry is set to address during his meetings in Europe in the next few days.

Following his visit to Paris, Kerry will make a stop in London, where he is expected to meet with British Foreign Secretary William Hague as well as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday before returning to Washington for a crucial week in the Obama administration’s build-up to a possible military intervention in Syria.

"http://www.france24.com/en/20130909-syria-usa-crunch-week-congress-obama-assad-media-blitz","Obama and Assad take to airwaves as Syria vote looms","US President Barack Obama and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad take to the airwaves in the US on Monday in an attempt to sway a sceptical nation as Congress returns from a summer recess to debate a military intervention in Syria.

The international community braced for a public relations blitz at the start of a decisive week on the Syria conflict as the US Congress gears up for a vote on a military intervention against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

US President Barack Obama is taking his case for an intervention to major US news networks and cable channels ahead of an address to the nation on Tuesday.

Not to be outdone, Assad has also attempted to sway US public opinion by granting a weekend interview to US journalist Charlie Rose in Damascus, which will be aired on primetime Monday on the public broadcast station, PBS.



In pre-broadcast interviews, Rose revealed that Assad denied the Obama administration’s assertion that he had deployed the lethal nerve gas sarin against his own people. But Assad would not say whether he has access to chemical weapons.

The US accuses Assad's forces of killing 1,429 people in a chemical weapons attack on August 21 in the eastern suburbs of Damascus.



In his interview with Rose on Sunday, Assad said it was up to the US to prove that his forces were behind the Damascus attack.



""There has been no evidence that I used chemical weapons against my own people,"" he told the network.



Assad also ""suggested that there would be, among people that are aligned with him, some kind of retaliation if a strike was made,"" PBS revealed.

US lawmakers return from their summer recess on Monday to start debating Obama's plan to launch a ""limited, narrow"" strike. Both the Senate and House of Representatives could vote on the issue as early as Wednesday.

Despite public backing from leaders of both political parties for a military intervention, many lawmakers have said they remain undecided as opinion polls show intense scepticism amongst the American public about another Middle Eastern engagement.

An ABC-BBC poll found more than one-third of Congress members were undecided about an intervention - and a majority of those who had made a decision said they would vote against the president.

Working the phones, TV networks and briefings



The media blitz moved into full gear over the weekend, with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough doing the rounds of five Sunday talk shows on major US networks. “An extremely busy day, appearing on all the TV talk shows here and repeating the same message that this is not, the White House argues, a test of President Obama’s credibility, but it’s a test, they say, of the US Congress and the broader world community, ” said FRANCE 24’s Simon Marks, reporting from Washington.

US lawmakers returning from their summer recess faced packed schedules with briefings set with top Obama administration officials, including Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel and US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power ahead of Wednesday’s vote.

Behind the scenes, Washington has been abuzz with town-hall meetings, dinners and urgent phone calls, said Marks. “President Obama was working the phones, calling members of Congress from both parties in an attempt to twist arms and secure support for his proposed military strikes in Syria,” he explained.

US Secretary of State John Kerry returns from a four-nation European diplomatic shuffle to a packed schedule of briefings with US lawmakers early this week.



Kerry’s European trip included a stop in France, where he attempted to convince a sceptical French public to support President François Hollande’s commitment to join a US intervention in Syria.

The US secretary of state also met with key Arab foreign ministers in Paris on Sunday, a day after holding meetings with his EU counterparts in Lithuania.



At a press conference in Paris after meeting with Arab foreign ministers, Kerry revealed that they were leaning towards supporting the G20 statement calling for a strong international response.

The EU issued a joint statement on Saturday blaming the Syrian government for the August 21 chemical weapons attack, but noting that any military action against Assad’s regime should be held off until UN weapons inspectors have published a report on their findings.

The pipeline burst caused a lot of inconvenience to the passers-by and vehicles as the road and adjacent areas were submerged in water.

It was only after 3 hours that workers of an underconstruction building nearby informed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), following which the main water supply valve was closed. The local corporator of the area also visited the spot.

The protest was due to her tweet on Wednesday that suggested Mumbai to be cut away from Maharashtra.

With the new state of Telangana getting the green signal, De's tweet received a lot of flak.

MNS chief Raj Thackeray expressed his anger at the tweet suggesting Mumbai should be a separate state by saying it's not quite as easy as getting a divorce.

The Shiv Sena also slammed Shobhaa De saying she should delete her tweet and apologise for her tweet.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-of-corporate-cronies-and-kids-1874245","Of corporate cronies and kids","It was an interesting week for corporate India. The long pending companies bill was passed by parliament. It’s enactment into law is only a presidential assent away. This the first comprehensive change in over a century for law that governs organised private enterprise.

It is a actually a tribute to Indian entrepreneurs that they took India to the global stage despite being hobbled by archaic laws.The passage of the bill happened only a few days apart from news that the co-promoter of a nearly $ 1 billion mobile phone company was arrested for allegedly bribing a municipal official.

While this does not have anything to do directly with the company Micromax, it does give an insight into the mind of the people who run it. Many other companies and promoters are being probed for dodgy behaviour that has hurt investor interests.

These two events this week lead to the question of whether corporate governance in India will transform for the better after the new law?

Will promoters of public and private companies care for the interests of all stakeholders including consumers, retail investors, financial institutions? Or will they still try to enrich a few owners at the expense of everyone else?

The turning point for India was the collapse of Satyam Computers. Nobody thought that a company operating in the celebrated IT sector with high standards of transparency and audited by global auditors would have been prey to promoter-led embezzlement.Satyam’s collapse hastened the changes in the companies act event though parliamentary hold ups delayed it.

The new companies bill forces promoters to have one third independent directors on their board with fixed terms and limits on numbers. Equally importantly, companies will have to rotate their auditors to prevent conflict of interest. Individual employees will be able to file class action suits in a case of criminal behaviour by corporates.

Industry leaders have been talking of reforms but are yet to take a cue and apply improved corporate governance to themselves.

Most boards are still full of promoter cronies masquerading as independent directors.

Hostile takeovers where investors remove non-performing management are still largely unknown in India. Whistleblowers are harangued and virtually no one is allowed to question the leadership. Promoters of even listed companies are bringing in their inexperienced kids into positions of importance.

If promoters don’t lose love for their cronies and kids, they may soon find themselves as easy fodder for takeovers. The new law will aid that. Its time for corporate India to grow up.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-aarushi-talwar-murder-case-of-swinging-talwars-on-all-of-our-heads-1925230","Aarushi Talwar murder case: Of swinging Talwars on all of our heads","The entire case of the Talwars has caused discomfort in the pit of my stomach from day one. The horrendous murder of a 14-year-old girl in the comfort of her own home was just the beginning.

This case is probably the last in recent history to have such public outcry for the accused. It was incredible to see the investigative journalism machinery digging high and low for material which would exculpate the accused, while the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) – by all means an overworked institution, originally meant to look into cases of corruption by public servants – was fighting tooth and nail to seek the conviction of persons against whom it had admitted there was “insufficient evidence”.

A closure report came to be filed, which as a then-practitioner of criminal litigation, I could never quite understand. It sought to close the case as one which was “true, but undetected” – it gave a “clean chit” to everyone but the parents, but even then stated that in its opinion, they could not be prosecuted. In my opinion, back then, a trial was really the only way to get to the bottom of things, whichever way you looked at it. Why the CBI wanted to file a closure report was beyond me; chargesheets on flimsier grounds have made their way to trial, surely.

I’m not quite sure I agree with the decision of the Talwars to challenge the closure report, which so obviously named them as the only possible perpetrators, in the mistaken belief that an order from a magistrate for reinvestigation might just miraculously convince the CBI to completely change its point of view. No argument with the magistrate though, who read the closure report and ordered trial to commence against the Talwars.

Now while we are all so appalled with the abysmal rates of conviction in India and about how our judicial system is “so pro-accused”, we sometimes forget how loopholes work both ways. I present to you, Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act:

“106. Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge – When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.

Illustrations:

(a) When a person does an act with some intention other than that which the character and circumstances of the act suggest, the burden of proving that intention is upon him.

(b) A person is charged with traveling on a railway without a ticket. The burden of proving that he had a ticket is on him.

Section 106 is the not-so-secret weapon of all Indian prosecutors when dealing with cases of circumstantial evidence. Did the murder happen inside a car? If the accused was proved to be in that car, he is supposed to explain – nay, prove – how the person died, if not by his hand. A woman ended up dead an hour after she left a restaurant with you. If you are accused of the murder, you need to prove where you parted ways while she was still alive. In short – the prosecution must prove everything in the chain of circumstances of evidence – except what can only be proved (or rather, disproved) by an accused.

So what can an accused do? He or she can present alternate evidence which causes the chain of circumstances to break. Once the prosecution finishes its case, all incriminating evidence is placed before the accused to explain. This is not done on oath, and the accused can say what they think best explains the circumstance, or admit or deny it. After that, they have the option of examining defence witnesses, which may even include themselves, by forsaking the constitutionally guaranteed right against self incrimination.

The Talwars sought to reexamine the evidence which was set forth against them, and perhaps produce all the interesting facts brought to light by various journalists. And it was here that they encountered yet another reason why the criminal procedure isn’t as accused friendly as it is commonly believed to be.

While prosecutors are supposed to be officers of the court, nothing in the code of criminal procedure actually says that the prosecution is obliged to disclose all evidence collected in a case. It is only required to produce those documents which it seeks to rely upon at the stage of trial. In the United States, the Brady clause states that failure to disclose favourable material evidence to an accused is a violation of due process clause. In such circumstances, the right of the accused to produce possible assistive material is important. Unlike the unbridled right of the prosecution to produce documents and evidence, however, the right of the accused to do so is subject to the permission of the court. Similarly the monopoly over government forensic laboratories exists mainly with the prosecution, and it is only in limited cases, especially under the drugs and narcotics laws, that the accused can take second opinions on lab tests.

In this case, right up to the Supreme Court, applications made by the accused to examine defence witnesses, reexamine forensic material or requisition documents have been rejected, mainly on the grounds of excess time being taken to do so (in a case which has already been in progress for 5 years, mind you). While the point of possible “vexatious proceedings” is well taken, the maxim of ensuring that justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done, is also extremely important. If the court's view of wasting time is the issue here, let’s remember that we've already spent all this time and taxpayer’s money on a case which the investigative authorities themselves wanted to close.

This isn’t trying to solve the whodunit, but rather the angst of a moviegoer, exiting a theatre, not quite convinced of the ending. I take some comfort in the fact that this case proves a point to those arguing for reversal of the burden of proof, speedy trials and the like when talking about reforming the criminal justice system. This is an anomaly of a case where no one except the Hon’ble Sessions Judge actually believes that the accused are guilty. Where an accused has no public sympathy and no one in the media wishes to uncover the “other side of the story” – are we sure we are really doing the right thing?

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-unsettling-settlements-of-the-multinationals-1920962","Unsettling settlements of the multinationals","It takes very long to build trust, but only a moment to lose it. Patients and their families all over the world feel cheated as one of the major pharmaceutical global giants, Johnson & Johnson, which pleaded guilty of promoting drugs in the last two decades for unapproved uses which could have been harmful to the patients, has this month agreed to pay $ 2.2 billion in a settlement with the Justice Department in the United States. What is more shocking is that the company has almost agreed to a $ 4 billion settlement for the faulty design of metallic hip implants.

There are two questions that need to be answered — first, what is the liability of a company in case it knowingly continues selling a product proved to be designed in a faulty manner, and, secondly, what is the realistic scenario considering the fact that most of the cutting-edge technology, particularly related to human health, may be risky, or, in other words, can never be said to be without any risk whatsoever. The company, quite obviously, is raising the second question in its favour and emphasising that settlement with law enforcement agencies would allow it to focus on innovative research for the benefit of mankind, rather than wasting its resources in unpredictable litigation.

Background of the two settlements would help us understand the situation better.

Talking about the second settlement of hip implants first, the company sold the all metallic artificial hip known as Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) for almost 10 years and when first introduced, it was offered as a new and better substitute to the existing hip implants made of plastic and metal. It was presented to be far more superior to those available in the market, but later there were serious complaints about the product design — primarily of the metal ball and the metal cup shedding metallic debris, which damaged tissues or caused other injuries. It also led to high concentration of metal ions in the blood stream of patients which resulted in a very high failure rate, 40% in five years, as opposed to a span of 15 years before any replacement was needed for other hip implants.

The high failure rate and severe criticism of the product compelled the company to recall the product in 2010. But evidence showed that though the company knew about fault in their product design, it decided to continue selling the product and clear the inventories. There was discontentment all over the world, however, almost one third of the patients who received the all metallic implant were in the United States, and knowing fully well the high level of damages which can be awarded by the American courts, the company in its wisdom decided to go ahead with the settlement proposal of $ 4 billion, which as a matter of procedure will need court approval.

The first settlement was regarding the unapproved use of certain antipsychotic drugs which could have been life-threatening for elderly nursing home patients. The US Attorney General termed the company’s conduct as reckless indifference, abuse of public trust, and blatant disregard for systems and laws designed to protect public health.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-the-rise-of-digitally-influenced-consumers-1867814","The rise of digitally influenced consumers","The wonderful aspect of change is that no one actually controls it. Even as leaders across the political spectrum are busy hurling churlish abuses at each other, the Indian consumer is coping with falling income and rising prices.

Conspicuous consumption in India is seeping deeper and deeper into the country. FMCG giants, consumer electronic companies and telecom service providers find higher growth coming from towns and habitats with population between 10,000 and 100,000.

This is a significant shift from the time when leading brands preferred metros while small towns remained dependent on unbranded or low-quality branded products. Media has played the role of a great leveller. Consumers in Mumbai and Delhi see the same ads on TV as do the residents of towns like Indore or Itanagar.

While media took messages to all parts of the country, the delivery of products was often uneven. Consumers also did not have direct access to detailed information and price comparisons of products. These hurdles are crumbling with the rise of online shopping. Consumers from across the country have access to identical products that can be bought online. Moreover, they can compare prices, products and features without trudging to several shops.

Not surprising then is the creation of a new generation of consumers. A recent study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) calls this group the “Digitally Influenced” consumers.

These consumers don’t just shop online. But they use the internet to sharpen their decision-making. “Although online purchases are just a small portion of commercial activity today, the internet’s influence on buying decisions is growing rapidly,” says the BCG report.

This digital influence affects $30 billion of consumer spending in India, more than five times of actual e-commerce. BCG expects it to reach $150 billion in India by 2016.

The inventive Indian consumer uses the internet for both research and actual purchase. The consumer has built a seamless model that combines online and offline consumption of information and product. Consumers surf the net relentlessly for the right product and price. Then they home in to the preferred retailer for the actual purchase.

Post-purchase online engagement like trouble shooting and renewal of services are low but growing.

BCG’s research shows that 34 per cent of internet users are from tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and 25 per cent are from rural areas. For these consumers discounts, convenience and variety are important.

While increasing access of internet through mobile devices is the obvious enabler of digital consumption, lower cost of telecom services will help too.

As always, some government and corporate policies are behind the consumption curve. Ideally, the digital influence should convert into online commerce. But the conversion rate remains low. Several issues continue to handicap the explosion of online commerce.

Electronic payments are still not considered safe and consumers still find it tough to hold online retailers accountable for bad deliveries. Patchy internet connections add further fear of faulty online payments for consumers.

Change will continue. Consumers and retailers will find inventive ways of efficient purchases. Higher accountability in the entire purchase chain will boost the confidence of online shoppers. Industry and government will have to actively collaborate to ensure that change is hastened not hobbled.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-financial-inclusion-is-the-key-to-a-robust-indian-economy-1831859","Financial inclusion is the key to a robust Indian economy","There is tremendous anticipation and excitement about Reserve Bank of India’s policy review. After a long wait the central bank reduced the interest rates by quarter of a per cent. To some extent the media hype and industry frenzy about interest rates is justified.

But a key aspect of growth is usually neglected in the periodic drama we see around announcement of interest rate changes.

Interest rates are important for institutional and individual borrowers. To use an archaic economic phrase, these are the “haves”. All of them are in the financial mainstream.

Simply put, all of them have a bank account. A simple facility most of us take for granted.

What about the “have-nots”? What about the hundreds of millions that still don’t have a bank account? These millions struggle to manage the little earnings they have. Only two-fifths of India has a bank account.

No economy can move from emerging to emerged status without ensuring that all its citizens are part of the financial mainstream.

RBI took the lead in the matter in 2010 and launched a dedicated programme to enhance financial inclusion. India has 6.5 lakh villages, out of which 2 lakh have now been financially included. They have at least one branch of a commercial bank in the village.

RBI has now asked banks to submit a plan for financial inclusion for the next few years.

The pace of growth of financial inclusion is painfully slow. Private sector banks are loath to open branches in rural areas where costs are much higher than profits. Public sector banks move too slowly to make a significant impact.

Prominent para-banking institutions, chit-funds, daily collection schemes have tried to bridge the gap but have more often than not duped the depositors.

The RBI and finance ministry must place this as their top priority. Bringing millions more into the formal banking sector may not benefit the banks in the short term but will add a big boost to the economy. Extra savings will help the government. Consumers will spend more since they will be secure about their money. This can boost the move towards higher growth.

RBI is planning to issue additional licenses for private banks with conditions that will force the players to have rural branches. This is a great idea but it will not be enough.

Government must work towards encouraging mobile banking and look at every technology option to enable financial empowerment of each citizen.

The direct benefit transfer scheme that hands out cash to people instead of subsidizing products can’t succeed without millions of new bank accounts.

Corporate India has to cheer and participate in this exercise. It has to throw away its perspective on short-term profit and opt for long term gains. A few hundred million more people with bank accounts and money to spend can only be good news for companies struggling with tepid demand.

It is time for government and industry to raise their interest in financial inclusion.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-farmers-don-t-benefit-from-rising-food-prices-they-need-minimum-support-prices-to-survive-1942492","Farmers don't benefit from rising food prices. They need minimum support prices to survive","Several years back, the late Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug had shared an interesting insight into the way Nobel prizes are awarded. At the peak of the solidarity movement in Poland, when Lech Walesa was leading a popular workers’ uprising, the Nobel prize committee decided to find out whether Lech Walesa deserved a Nobel Peace prize or not.

Borlaug told me that he was asked to lead a small team to Poland. After visiting a number of places, and meeting a cross-section of the stakeholders and others, he realized that the workers’ solidarity movement was actually fighting for cheaper food prices. But at no stage Walesa and other leaders of the popular movement showed any concern for the millions of farmers who were being asked to produce cheaper food for the workers. “What would happen to the livelihoods of those millions who produce food? If these farmers were expected to produce cheap food year after year, how would they and their families survive?”

For this reason alone, Borlaug said that Walesa didn’t deserve a Nobel Prize. But despite his team’s recommendation, the fact remains that Walesa was bestowed with the Nobel Peace Prize.

Now you will ask me what has Lech Walesa’s Nobel Prize to do with the rising food inflation in India. Well, there is a strong correlation. There is hardly a day when I don’t find newspaper articles and comments on the need to do away with the procurement prices for farmers. Corporate economists and free market lobbyists have been repeatedly telling us of the dire need to do away with the MSP for cereals like wheat and rice. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) too has been vociferously demanding the dismantling of the price support system for farmers, and letting the markets reign.

So when the RBI governor Raghuram Rajan blamed the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act for the rising food prices, I wasn’t surprised. Unable to control the runaway inflation, propped up more by rising food prices, the easier option is to shift the onus to the little understood role agricultural markets play in providing an assured price support to farmers.

At 7.2 per cent, the wholesale price index rose to its highest in the past 14 months ending November. The increase in inflation is being attributed mainly to the 15 per cent rise in food prices. Prices of vegetables had earlier shot up by 18.4 per cent in September, and the sharpest rise was seen in onions which had jumped by 323 per cent on a yearly basis. No sooner had the prices of onions come down, when the prices of eggs and meat shot up. For the average consumers, rising food inflation is a more cruel form of indirect taxation.

Every year, the CACP recommends a minimum support price for about 24 crops. Out of these, primarily two cereal crops — wheat and rice — are procured by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and on its behalf by some state agencies. This serves two purposes. First, the foodgrains that are procured by FCI serve as a buffer stock against any emergency and at the same time help in meeting the food security needs of the poor. Whatever grain that comes into the mandis is first made available to the private trade to buy. It’s only when there are no buyers left that the FCI steps in to purchase it at the support price announced by the government, which in reality becomes an assured price for farmers.

What is little known is that only 30 per cent of Indian farmers get the benefit of procurement prices.

These are the farmers who have a marketable surplus which they are able to bring it to the nearest mandi. It is only in Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu (and now of course Madhya Pradesh) that a strong network of mandis operates. In the remaining 70 per cent of the country, farmers have to depend upon private trade.

And it is in these areas that farmers are ruthlessly exploited. For instance, while the paddy farmer in Punjab gets an MSP of Rs1,310 per quintal, his counterpart in Bihar, where the private trade dominates, is able to sell at a distress price of around Rs800 per quintal. Withdrawing price support for Punjab farmers will automatically bring them down to the level of Bihar farmers.

A second explanation is that it is primarily because the farmer is not able to sell his produce directly to the trader (and routes it through the APMC mandi) that he doesn’t get a better price. This is an absurd argument considering that 70 per cent farmers have no access to mandis and, therefore, do not fall under the APMC Act. Isn’t it time to ascertain why the prices of cereals/vegetable/fruits are ruling high in areas where the farmers do not get the benefit of procurement prices? And as I said earlier, 70 per cent farmers are outside the ambit of the procurement system.

Not only vegetables, prices of eggs and milk have also been on an upswing. More recently, prices of eggs have shot up in Mumbai market to about Rs60 per dozen. Milk prices too have been steadily rising. Since APMC Act has nothing to do with eggs and milk, why are the prices rising?

The organized retail units like Reliance Fresh, Big Bazaar, Metro are allowed to purchase directly from farmers. Why were these retail chains unable to supply onions for instance at a cheaper price? Similarly, if I may be allowed to cite an example of a non-food sector, why are the air fares of airlines going up. You click three times on an air route and ticket price goes up. It is cheaper to fly to Bangkok and Kuwait than to go from Delhi to Goa.

The answer is simple. Whether it is food, egg prices or airline tickets, prices are being freely manipulated by strong cartels. In the case of onions too, a very powerful cartel of a handful of traders had made a killing when there was only a 4.8 per cent shortfall in production. The APMC too is riddled with cartels. As past experience shows, even organized retail chains form cartels.

Replacing one set of middlemen, therefore, with another is not the answer. The answer lies in breaking these cartels.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/sports/analysis-it-s-time-bcci-is-brought-under-the-rti-act-1843420","It's time BCCI is brought under the RTI act","Cricket enthusiasts may not have slept well on Saturday night, thinking what would unfold the following day. BCCI officials hinted that something significant would happen in Chennai.

But the worst fears of 1.2 billion cricket lovers came to pass as the BCCI continued to be a close knit circle of friends.

Let me elaborate on how the entire operation was carried out: Like in hockey and football, three players were left unmarked by the media. The three musketeers chose to teleconference from Delhi, part of the BCCI’s brotherhood plan.

Earlier, word was that the Maharashtra lobby would take over. It was suggested that Shashank Manohar would be a compromise candidate should Srinivasan step down. This was a clear strategy to confuse the West lobby as to what the North was planning. The plot went a bit awry after secretary Sanjay Jagdale and treasurer Ajay Shirke resigned.

Srinivasan also had a ready excuse at the meeting had anyone demanded his resignation: why should Rajeev Shukla stay on? Wasn’t he the IPL president?Shukla, on the other hand, had been defending Srinivasan. He suddenly realised that he could put himself on a moral high ground by stepping down. He knew that his IPL term was ending in September. This was his chance for a perfect character-projection exercise.

Wasn’t it Shukla who was constantly saying that ‘Srinivasan should step aside till the probe was over’?

The video conferencing charade was planned well in advance. Niranjan Shah and Jagmohan Dalmiya had been sounded out. It was clear that Srinivasan would not accept Shah’s candidature since he would be deemed as a west zone prop. Dalmiya was considered to be a safe bet.

It is another matter that the BCCI has no provision for interim president, and the meeting, in the absence of notice of 72 hours, was unconstitutional.Why did they form such a cosy club despite having several top politicians among them? It’s a simple answer. There is a lot of money available in the BCCI. Why else would a busy politician spend months being associated with the IPL if it were only a gratis activity? And how can a minister in the union government work under a board president?

According to a senior journalist, a lot of these office bearers have stakes in various franchises. When Lalit Modi started to reveal it all, he was dumped. So why does no one act against the board president? It’s primarily because the state associations have a lot to answer. Mismanagement of funds that the BCCI disburses every year is endemic in the system.

At least six state associations are battling charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Obviously, these associations cannot think of opposing the board president. And Srinivasan, once the president of a chess federation, obviously knows his moves.

In a note dated 14/12/2011 submitted by the Union Ministry of Sports before the Central Information Commission, the government wanted the BCCI to be a public authority and come under the RTI act.

Given the sheer mockery of the board meeting in Chennai, it’s high time the Union government, through an ordinance, takes over the BCCI affairs and safeguards the money that is unsafe in the hands of a few selfish individuals. Remember the interventions by both Union and state governments to manage Tirupati and Vaishnodevi because of the high amounts of money offered to these shrines.

The Prime Minister himself owes an answer to the country. His statement that ‘politics and sports should not get mixed up’ needs to be demonstrated on the ground.

I’m shocked at the events in Chennai. But I promise I will lead the crusade in the parliament on behalf of 1.2 billion cricket lovers. The last on this subject hasn’t been heard yet.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/sports/report-chelsea-hang-on-longer-to-beat-arsenal-1790797","Chelsea hang on longer to beat Arsenal","Chelsea enjoyed some much-needed home comfort with goals from Juan Mata and Frank Lampard securing a 2-1 victory over Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday. Arsenal staged a second-half revival with Theo Walcott halving the deficit at a snowy Stamford Bridge but Chelsea hung on for only their second win in six home league games since Rafa Benitez was hired as interim manager. Victory lifted third-placed Chelsea to 45 points from 23 games, 10 behind leaders Manchester United whose game at Tottenham Hotspur will go ahead later in north London despite heavy snow putting the fixture in doubt.

Mata scored after six minutes after Cesar Azpilicueta's lofted ball put him through on goal, although Arsenal were seething at the referee's failure to award a free kick their way in the initial stages of the move. Lampard made it 2-0 from the penalty spot after 16 minutes after Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny escaped a red card for bringing down Ramires in the area.

The midfielder's calm finish was his 195th goal for the club and he is now just seven behind Chelsea's all-time record goalscorer Bobby Tambling. Walcott's superb finish just before the hour gave Arsenal hope and Chelsea enjoyed a nervy final half hour as the Gunners pressed for an equaliser but the hosts held on. Arsenal remain in sixth place with 34 points.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-telangana-a-state-is-born-1867800","Telangana: A state is born","There was a case to make Telangana a state within the Indian Union earlier; its urgency today is undeniable. At this moment different political parties, and political leaders may have their own calculations on the utility of this move for themselves, and various organised interests may be affected in one way or the other, but the legitimacy of conceding this demand is irreducible to such immediate calculations. It is not to the edification of any when a dozen young men set fire to themselves crying-out Jai Telangana, and hundreds of youth commit suicide in its name.

There have been various justifications that have been advanced favouring Telangana: they have come from perceptive observers of the socio-economic dynamics of the region, commission/committee reports and political leaders. One of the commendable endeavours in this regard is the Justice SriKrishna Committee Report (2011), which while suggesting the various options, eventually left the choice to the concerned political leadership, and rightly so.

Much of the literature and observations suggest the relative deprivation of this region compared to coastal Andhra, and the domination of the latter over the former through umpteen ways: how opportunities and resources tend to favour the rest of Andhra; how jobs and employment in Telangana are cornered by people from outside; how there is a gross mismatch between the revenue collected and expended in the region; how the water-table in Telangana region is depleting further down while the large catchment area within the region feed the Krishna and Godavari that water the irrigation network of the rest of Andhra Pradesh etc.

While this regional imbalance can be an interesting take, and has led to an acrimonious debate between the supporters and opponents of a separate Telangana state such imbalances exist elsewhere as well, and one cannot easily imagine the prospect of rectifying them by recourse to carving out new states. In other words, rectification of regional imbalances is not an adequate justification for crafting a separate state. At the most, it can be a reinforcing argument.

However, there are three issues which I feel have a compelling force and they, in an order of priority are: First, Telangana is a region unlike other regions in India. It has sustained a distinct cultural terrain, made of deep diversities, which have commingled together and sustained a distinct way of life. In many ways it has been the meeting place of beliefs and mode of living. While, occasionally, there have been some extreme expressions of this diversity as in the communal flare-ups in Hyderabad, there is a much thick shared life, informed by diversity, that binds people of this region together. As a result language, festivals, food, religious beliefs and other elements of everyday life attain a specific attenuation markedly different from coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema.

This does not mean, the region does not share bonds of language and history with the rest of the present day Andhra state, but to stress a distinction that has been widely invoked by the people on the scene. The second reason, is the specific relation of this region to modes of militancy such as the great Telangana Movement (1946-1951) and later to Maoism that argued for a revolutionary transformation through protracted struggle with the peasantry as its social base of support. Thousands of young people from this region joined the Maoist outfits in 1970s and 1980s, seeking a just order. The great inequalities of wealth and entitlements and widespread social discrimination prevalent in this region, added fuel to the fire.

While strategic experts might credit the Greyhounds for successfully hunting the Maoists in the region, those in the know-how of the spread of Maoism in this region easily concede that it is the movement for a separate Telangana state that took the wind out of the sail of revolutionary zeal. In other words, if there is one issue that has drawn the youth away from Maoism in the region it has been the agitation for separate statehood, that has thrown up a different imagination of establishing a just order. The pronounced stress on democracy and development replete in the movement can be understood in this light.

Third, and what seems to me as the most pertinent reason, is the near universal agreement in this region among all articulate sections in support of the demand for a separate state. There is a specific historical memory that has been constructed in support, poring over documents, sayings, and preceding movements in corroboration that has come to be widely accepted. Attempts to puncture such memory have been feeble, and increasingly being forcefully rejected.

This widespread demand cutting across social cleavages has made political leaders desert their parties, students give up their studies, and public discourse to become partisan. Even in such parties as YSR Congress, strongly committed to a united Andhra, its representatives from Telangana speak in a voice very different from the rest of the representatives of the existing state. In other words, elected representatives today, as the rest of the populace, are literally divided into being flag-bearers of Telangana or united Andhra, due to the groundswell of partisan support.

Those who defend a unified Andhra defend themselves not on grounds of democracy, or support from below but by appeal to a shared culture, common language, public institutions forged following the unification of this region into a distinct state from 1956 , and on grounds of strategic, economic and corporate interests. Admittedly, the present Andhra Pradesh is a compact cultural region with much that is common, but this commonness has not succeeded in forging a political unity based on a shared sense of inclusion and fairness.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-shobhaa-de-and-death-by-mwah-mwah-1863657","Shobhaa De and death by mwah mwah","I have been meaning to write this for a while, but today is as good a day as any. The Aarushi-Hemraj murder trial — a trial I follow closely — has entered a decisive phase. On Friday, the Allahabad High Court allowed the accused, Aarushi’s parents Dr Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, access to crucial DNA reports and related documents so as to enable them to mount a fair defence. (The trial court had earlier rejected this prayer). The High Court’s order comes about three months after the case was thought of as “over”. This was when the CBI’s investigating officer, AGL Kaul testified for the prosecution and told, as they say, the whole sordid story.

In court, Kaul sounded as if he was an unblinking eyewitness to the murders. Dr Talwar had discovered his teenage daughter in a “compromising position” with the servant Hemraj (45, teetotaller, grandfather). This was a matter of family honour, and grave enough provocation for him to fetch a golf club and bludgeon both to death, before surgically slitting their throats with a scalpel to make sure. An elaborate clean-up followed.

The media, such as it is, bought the story as ‘full and final’. It didn’t matter that Kaul’s testimony didn’t have a shred of material evidence: except Kaul’s word, we have nothing that suggests Hemraj was in Aarushi’s room in the first place. Kaul relied instead on the persuasive power of perception: the story wasn’t new, it had been disseminated and ‘bought’ by reporters and writers all over the country. On the day Kaul testified, the khulasawalas of Indian television made the “revelation” yet again, packaging it with ‘reenactments’ during which you were tempted to wipe the saliva off the screen.

This is what they do night after night (and it appears to work) so good luck to them. But it is sometimes forgotten in the din of breaking news that one of the early adopters of the tripe the CBI was dishing out was Shobhaa De, the influential celebrity columnist. No sooner had Kaul told his story in court, De reminded us of this herself. Patting herself on her elegant back, she blogged: “I wrote this on January 4 2011.... at the time, there was much outrage at what I had suggested — that Aarushi’s parents were the culprits. I received a lot of hate mail and a few nasty phone calls asking me to back off and zip up. “Well the startling revelations by the CBI officer today insist that it was Ramesh Talwar (sic) who clubbed and killed both Aarushi and Hemraj and then slit their throats. His wife helped him to dress up the scene of the gruesome crime. What sort of monsters are these parents??” She then republished the 2011 article under the heading “Aarushi’s Monster Parents”.

I read the piece with interest and once I got past all the exclamation marks, what I was left with was a sense of Ms De’s staggering unfamiliarity with her subject. This continues in 2013: The accused is ‘Rajesh’ Talwar, not Ramesh. Perhaps some poor fact-checker will now be fired, but I think it’s fair to say that if you’re going to call someone a monster, it makes sense to get his name right.However, let’s set this one aside. Ms De’s piece outlines, with some authority, how grieving parents ought, or ought not to, behave. She calls the reactions of the Talwars “puzzling”, “bizarre”, “too calculated”; grief-stricken parents behave “differently”. According to Ms De, they are normally “rendered incoherent”.

Upon reading the piece, I wondered if Ms De had lost a loved one (I sincerely hope not): her incoherence was striking. She says “the media has been conducting its own trial night after night, pretty much stating: the dad did it”, as if to make for herself a little perch for independent observation. And then she goes on to say — before the trial has even begun, that the dad did it. Before it’s over, she says it again. She adopts the voice of the Talwars, asking, sometimes within quotes, sometimes without: what proof do you have? what evidence do you have?

I have a simple question here: if I were to accuse Ms De of murder, what would she say? Take me to the gallows? Or would she ask for evidence? Ms De’s unfamiliarity with the case possibly extends to her lack of knowledge of the investigating officer whose testimony warranted that pat on the back she gave herself. This officer was the one who created the macabre e-mail-id ‘hemraj.jalvayuvihar@gmail.com’ to conduct official business with the Talwars at the time of investigation. (This was exposed, much to the embarrassment of the CBI). Witnesses have testified that he beat them in his office. Clear proof that he tampered with evidence — the golf clubs, no less, whose seals were broken when brought to court, because they had been opened in his office — has emerged during the trial.

Ms De is probably not interested in the details, but here are a few more that may help her better understand the story she’s bought and is now reselling. One of the prosecution’s arguments is that erections can be sustained two days after death. (Hemraj’s penis was swollen: science says this is due to putrefaction). The CBI has produced as witnesses, people who take 56 km morning walks; cops who cannot smell; and a doctor who realises after two years that Aarushi’s vagina was unusually dilated.

This is the quality of evidence. But in this country, perception trumps proof. I wouldn’t dare threaten Ms De with a “zip up”. (I would no doubt be given the harshest sentence in South Bombay: death by mwah mwah). I ask her only to consider that freedom of speech isn’t just a right. For those of us writing in newspapers, it is a privilege. It comes with the responsibility of having to know what you’re talking about.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-religious-polarisation-in-rural-bengal-is-a-grim-reality-1856887","Religious polarisation in rural Bengal is a grim reality","The turmoil in West Bengal over the panchayat elections is only to be expected. The support that the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool government once enjoyed in the state has weakened. However, the outcome of the panchayat elections, though considered an acid-test of her popularity, may not reflect the level of disenchantment of the electorate.

What it does indicate is the level of desperation of the ruling dispensation. Long before the preparations for the panchayat elections were initiated, the state had witnessed widespread violence.

This is not unprecedented in West Bengal. Previously, under the Left Front government in 2003, the state had been through a similar turmoil. In the absence of opposition candidates, the CPI(M) had won more than 10,000 seats. This time the Trinamool Congress has steamrolled other parties, winning almost 6,500 seats unchallenged. The Left Front, Congress and the BJP couldn’t field enough candidates. The muscles of the ruling party were at work. In the panchayat elections in 2003, from the time of filing nominations till the date the poll results were declared, 45 people were killed in political violence. This year, the death toll is already 12. In this conflict, the poor are killing the poor.

By May 2008, rural Bengal had begun dumping the Left Front, especially the CPI(M). The Congress votes were confined only to Malda and Murshidabad. The results of the 2011 assembly elections in eight districts of the state in which minority voters were the determining factors, showed the miserable performance of the CPI(M).

When chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya’s government began to forcibly acquire agricultural land for industries, the farmers’ disenchantment with the Left was complete.

The overwhelming majority of the Muslims in the state, who constitute 27 per cent of the total population, are dependent on agriculture. With Banerjee spearheading the movement against land acquisition, she became the obvious choice of the community.

However, after coming to power, Banerjee began indulging in tokenism instead of setting long-term goals for improving the lot of the state’s backward minority class. What the community, largely dependent on agriculture, needed was education, land reforms and job opportunities. Banerjee could only come up with an allowance of Rs1,500 to the imams. Curiously, out of 30,000 imams in the state, 50 per cent has not applied for the allowance.

In the days to come, Bengal will witness the increasing assertion of identity politics. The BJP, taking full advantage of Banerjee’s minority-appeasement politics, is trying to consolidate the Hindu votebank in rural Bengal.

The minority community, fed up with tokenism, is now looking at the possibility of floating political parties to safeguard their interests. Since Muslims will decide the fate of 140 out of 294 seats, they are trying to use this power to their political advantage.

This can already be seen in Birbhum’s Nalhati constituency’s assembly by-election where the vote shares of both the TMC-Congress alliance and the Left Front had gone down. Those who gained were the BJP and Muhammad Siddiqullah Chowdhury’s People’s Democratic Conference of India (PDCI) party, attracting 10 per cent and 7 per cent votes, respectively.

Post Babri Masjid, the BJP had witnessed a similar rise in Bengal in the late Nineties’ general elections, managing to secure two parliamentary seats. Though it was later wiped out, it’s now trying to stage a comeback. The state unit of RSS claims it has enjoyed 11 per cent growth in the last one year.

The violence in panchayat polls may have halted the growth of religious parties for now, but polarisation at the grassroots in rural Bengal is a reality that cannot be wished away.

We are out here (filming on an island) with our own opinions. We get the episode together, edit it and put it out. The biggest pay-off is when viewers say they really liked it. And what is the worst part?Honestly, I don’t like being away from home. Compared to others (the contestants) I am away for the least amount of time — only three months, while they are there for five months. That’s the hardest part, but I guess, everybody has something they don’t like about their jobs!

Having hosted 25 seasons, do you recall any contestants who have impressed you?Yes, there is this basketball player Jeff Kent, who is part of season 25 that you will see soon. He didn’t complain about anything, even losing. For him surviving on the island was like solving a puzzle. He did not steal.. he showed a lot of sportsmanship. Many people are either abrasive or too shy on the show. However, if you don’t know how people see or perceive you, it creates road blocks. Self-awareness is the key.

What prompted you to write a book (Stranded)?The idea was floated by my wife. She came into the marriage with two kids. She suggested that I write something about blended families. Also, several kids would come to me and ask when I would make a Survivor for them. When I asked them if they will really be able to do it —stay on an island, make fire etc, — they would with their big eyes say yes. That’s when I thought I should write an adventure book based on the series for kids.

The book is a triology — in the first part, the kids were shipwrecked on an island, the next book Trial By Fire, which has just released, is about how they face the situation and start living in the harsh conditions, the third one will trace a big dramatic rescue. I am also toying with the idea of making a movie based on Stranded.Have you seen the Indian version of Survivor? Yes and I liked it. I am aware that the show didn’t do well. But the big difference between your show and the American one is the budget. This kind of a show requires a lot of money to look epic. I wish you guys would try it again. Indian culture is different from the American culture. One doesn’t have to know the language to understand it, it’s evident from the way people behave – someone is a hero, another a comedian etc.

Any plans of visiting India?Not in the near future. However, I have some friends in California who keep inviting me to India. I have been told that Indians are very friendly in the sense that they always make enough food for you and an uninvited guest. In America, it’s much harder for a stranger. Survivor Season 25 will air on BIG CBS PRIME from June 24.","2013-06-15 12:22:02","1","65.0","22.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","504","60.26","75.02","27.77","47.81","14.40","15.87","89.29","55.56","15.87","9.33","3.37","0.60","1.98","1.19","2.18","6.55","9.72","12.10","10.91","5.56","4.76","1.59","19.05","3.17","2.18","2.58","2.38","3.57","3.77","2.38","1.19","0.20","0.00","0.20","12.90","0.60","0.79","0.60","0.99","12.30","2.38","1.98","1.59","3.37","0.60","3.77","4.17","2.18","0.60","0.99","0.79","0.40","0.20","0.00","0.20","6.15","1.79","2.58","1.19","0.79","0.40","2.58","11.71","1.59","10.71","0.99","6.15","3.77","2.18","2.38","0.40","0.60","0.00","0.00","0.79","0.00","0.00","0.60","0.20","0.00","16.87","6.94","4.56","0.00","0.00","1.19","0.20","0.40","0.00","2.38","1.19","0.00","2109","6.67","15.147058823529411","663","501","41","84.47","8.8","4.5","7.35","5.4","77","4.444444444444445","13.027704590818367","276","14.12","17","0.53","0","11","9","55","0","58","30","0","5","9","72","25","1","26","0","0","52","5","25","0","0","2","8","0","20","16","11","10","32","16","4","6","0","6"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-back-in-the-bhatt-fold-emraan-hashmi-1826396","Back in the Bhatt fold: Emraan Hashmi","Emraan Hashmi had moved away from the Bhatt camp. He did three films without them — The Dirty Picture, Shanghai and Ek Thi Daayan. It was reported that after Raaz 3 he had ended his association with the Bhatts and was now looking at big banners to reposition his profile. Perhaps he felt he had moved into a bigger league, after being wooed by Ekta Kapoor and Karan Johar or he simply wanted the experience of working with other banners, whatever the reason, he has now realised that with the Bhatts he has a ‘hit’ record and wants to come back ‘home’.

According to an insider, Emi will again be working with his uncles Mukesh and Mahesh after Raaz 3. The hush-hush project will go on floor in January 2014. Vikram Bhatt directing the film was a huge deciding factor for the actor to sign on the dotted line. It is learnt that Emraan gave bulk dates for the same. This at a time when his dates diary is choc-a-bloc. He had kept aside those dates earlier for Karan Johar’s Gutkha starring Akshay Kumar. Arjun Kapoor has now been signed for the part.

Vikram, who has directed Emraan in Footpath and Raaz 3 confirms, “Yes, we will be working together again.” Mahesh adds, “We are planning to do a film with Vikram and Emraan. Emi didn’t want to be a part of the Murder franchise and we respected him for that. His love, affection and respect for me is unquestionable. I would never force him to do a film that he didn’t like. He wanted to do a certain kind of cinema that gave him respect.

He did Ek Thi Daayan and Shanghai which weren’t commercial money spinners so now he’s back with us. The film he’s doing won’t be a part of any franchise or a sequel but a fresh concept. Of course, it will have all the ingredients of films Emi has been associated with — erotica, glamour and thrill.”

Emraan confirms, “Yes, I am doing Vikram’s film with the Bhatts. In principle we are working together but the concept is being finalised.” About moving away from the banner, he adds, “There was no shifting of loyalty to outside banners or any fight. I was never supposed to do Murder 3. It was always planned without me as they wanted the entire brand re-vamped. I wanted to work with everyone and got busy doing a lot of films for other producers. Also, the Bhatts and I were waiting for a good script to come along. Now with Vikram, we finally have the right script.”","2013-04-24 10:45:58","0","65.0","22.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","437","66.80","65.15","3.45","60.47","15.61","15.10","79.63","54.46","12.59","8.47","1.60","1.37","0.00","5.03","0.46","4.12","8.24","13.50","12.13","4.35","5.03","2.06","18.54","2.52","1.60","0.92","1.37","2.29","3.20","2.52","0.69","0.00","0.69","0.00","8.92","0.23","0.00","0.00","5.26","9.15","0.92","0.92","1.60","2.06","1.83","2.75","1.37","0.46","0.46","0.23","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","6.86","2.75","1.60","1.60","0.92","0.00","7.55","8.47","1.60","11.44","1.37","4.58","5.95","3.66","2.52","0.23","0.69","0.00","0.46","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.00","16.25","6.41","4.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.92","2.29","2.52","0.00","0.00","1849","7.2","17.84","587","436","28","81.02","8.7","5.8","8.06","7.2","77","13.25","15.30422018348624","222","16.88","5","0.52","0","18","6","42","0","49","18","2","0","5","56","51","0","14","1","0","36","5","24","1","0","0","12","0","18","26","17","15","10","15","2","1","0","1"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-commercialising-non-violence-trivialising-the-mahatma-1892824","Commercialising non-violence, trivialising the Mahatma","Gandhi has often been used by political leaders as one of the safest and easiest means to achieve nefarious ends. But using Gandhi’s name and teachings is not the fiefdom of political leaders; corporate leaders also apparently have no qualms in blatantly using, or rather misusing, Gandhi’s name, statue, charkha – the spinning wheel, teachings, etc. in a manner, which can best be described as profiteering at its worst.

Last week while catching a flight at the Ahmedabad airport, I noticed a new shop in the departure area and was immediately attracted towards it as it displayed a huge statue of Gandhi with the spinning wheel. The display board mentioned ‘Eternal Gandhi:

An initiative of Aditya Birla Group’. It also displayed prominently ‘Non-violence: Bravery at its Peak’ written in a circular manner with ‘ahimsa’ — meaning non-violence — written in the centre in Hindi.

“Shashwat Gandhi” – meaning eternal Gandhi – was also written in Hindi in bold letters.

Curious to know what was on offer, I stepped inside and interacted with the salespersons to know about the purpose and idea of the new establishment. I was told that the basic purpose of establishing such an outlet was to propagate the teachings of Gandhi and spread the message of non-violence. I was impressed. But, sadly the impression didn’t last long.

I was shocked to see that most of the merchandise on offer – kurtas, pens, CDs, books, gift items, etc. – were priced on the higher side, even higher than what would be expected in any up-scale market. The shop was no different from any other ordinary commercial establishment. The only difference may be, as was obvious and apparent, the overwhelming presence of Gandhi’s statue and the lingering thought that by buying any item from the shop one may be doing his or her bit towards making this world a better place to live in through non-violence.

But it is difficult to comprehend as to how buying an overpriced product can contribute to Gandhian principles, primarily non-violence, or for that matter other principles for which Gandhi lived and died — living within one’s means, self-reliance, and above all truth.

Then, what is the real purpose of such a shop? Is it just a gimmick to earn a rupee more by shamelessly using Gandhi’s name and principles, or the company has reached this stage of intellectual bankruptcy and erosion of all creativity that it has to resort to one of the best models – Gandhi – for selling its wares, which it might have been finding difficult to sell in the otherwise stagnant market even after using the finest of the management techniques and formulation of highly competitive strategies?

Should the people of India remain silent at such gross and shameful commercialisation of non-violence and una bashed effort by a corporate group – immensely big and with deep pockets – to trivialise Gandhi? Is this something which can be put under the name of corporate social responsibility, or doing service to the nation in the name of the Father of the nation, or spreading the message of non-violence, or doing it considering it to be their sacred duty to make the younger generation know Gandhi as the apostle of peace and non-violence, or making it a point to make the common man know that the company cares about these ideals and would leave no stone unturned to practise them while implementing its business plans?

It is ironical that a large corporate house like Aditya Birla Group, which has so many other business interests, had started this initiative.

It would not have even befitted any small business house struggling to find its feet. Surprising is the fact as to how the airport administration approved of it. Even if any person or company had liked to make its business plan work in this manner, it is the bounden duty of the administration to exercise discretion and not to permit it.

In case the airport administration, or any other local administration, finds its hands tied and expresses its inability to stop it as it has been proposed in the name of Gandhi, the Legislature needs to make unambiguous laws so that the executive while implementing them doesn’t find any difficulty in arriving at the right decision, in letter and spirit.

It is a matter of serious concern for every Indian that a man, who always stood for non-profiteering, is today being used for flagrant profit-making. It is high time we stopped allowing Gandhi’s name and principles to be used for either moneymaking, or befooling people, or both.

There is no denying the fact that non-violence can be said to be bravery at its peak, however, commercialising non-violence – whether for direct monetary profit or gaining political mileage – is not acceptable. Gandhi’s name need not be sullied by miring it in lucre.

Given that the amended Companies Law now provides for 2% expenditure on corporate social responsibility, there is going to be a lot of grey area which could be interpreted either this way or that regarding the target group or purpose towards which the expenditure could be made.

Spending money in the name of social and public good – and, of course, Gandhi comes handy in such an exercise – would really be a metaphorical ‘Open Sesame’ for companies looking for an opportunity to divert funds or spend them in a manner which will be far away from that stated in the account books.

It would surely be a challenge for the legal and regulatory bodies to monitor that the 2% is not misused. The least the political masters – most of them donning the Gandhian khadi – can do is to see to that Gandhi and his principles are neither commercialised nor trivialised.","2013-09-23 13:26:30","0","77.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","957","86.40","46.66","20.67","42.85","29.00","23.30","84.22","50.16","8.67","1.46","0.52","0.10","0.00","0.31","0.52","7.21","8.57","15.05","8.36","3.03","7.21","1.46","14.00","5.22","3.13","1.57","0.52","2.51","5.54","3.24","2.30","0.42","0.00","0.21","5.54","0.10","0.00","0.10","0.52","13.69","2.19","2.82","1.46","3.45","1.25","4.49","1.15","0.84","0.21","0.10","0.94","0.31","0.52","0.00","0.10","8.88","1.15","2.61","4.28","1.36","0.84","3.55","7.84","0.94","10.66","0.84","7.00","2.72","6.79","1.04","0.21","2.82","0.21","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.12","3.03","4.70","0.21","0.10","0.42","0.00","1.46","0.63","1.36","0.00","0.21","4524","8.45","29.272727272727273","1472","961","33","50.4","14.3","13.5","11.62","16.1","205","13.5","22.172778355879295","428","25.03","5","0.48","0","46","6","110","2","120","99","5","8","18","161","42","0","41","0","0","31","13","39","0","0","0","33","0","46","26","37","30","9","28","8","4","0","2"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-irresponsible-advertisements-who-is-to-be-blamed-1889595","Irresponsible Advertisements: Who is to be blamed?","Horrifying is the otherwise legally acceptable practice of showing the warning on the television screen in such tiny size that even with large screen LCD and LED monitors, one feels the need of either zooming in or using a magnifying glass.

There are a number of television commercials, quite successful and popular in connecting with the viewers and may be resulting in an increase in the sale of the advertised product. Stunts like running faster even than Bolt, riding bikes even better than the professional riders, swimming, diving, et al performed by highly-trained and experienced persons leave lasting impact on the viewers.

Advertisements which are meant for adults and performed by adults can, of course, be given the benefit of doubt that even without the warning on the screen, no reasonable and prudent adult would be expected to imitate the same.

But it doesn’t remain the same the moment we are talking about advertisements showing children and targeting the children. Children of impressionable age are highly vulnerable to the visuals and may also try to imitate the stunt as seen on the screen, despite the disclaimer.

Here comes the importance of the warning on the screen: Many a time, the warning on the screen, which advertisers are forced to show due to statutory requirements, are shown in extremely tiny font size and also for a very short duration. It doesn’t serve any purpose except that of fulfilling the statutory requirement in letter, and definitely not in spirit.

Of late, an advertisement by Hero Cycles is being shown, which, to my understanding, should not have been aired. The commercial shows a child riding a bicycle and using the bicycle tyres to make a wall painting. We clearly understand that this is impossible, and it has just been shown to get the attention of the children of that age group.

There is a disclaimer on the screen, which is difficult to be read. Even if it can be read, how many children would be able to read that, understand the message and the legal implications? Despite such a disclaimer, chances are high that some children may try to do the same.

There is another advertisement for an extremely popular and successful biscuit brand – Parle G – which, without doubt, falls into the category of the most irresponsible advertisements I’ve ever seen. The advertisement, surprisingly, doesn’t have to do anything with the biscuits; it simply talks about learning from experiences, and that the life is a school in itself.

The message is fine, but the way it has been tried to be conveyed to the target viewers, is unacceptable. It shows a child inflating a balloon using the exhaust fumes from the exhaust pipe of two-wheeler. It is a bit too much to be shown about experimenting and self-learning.

Who is to be blamed – the company selling the product; or, the advertising company making the advertisement; or, the channels telecasting it; or, the advertising regulators; or, all of them; or, someone else?

It would be rather unbelievable that each and all of them mentioned above do not know that the exhaust fumes are harmful to be inhaled, and also that the exhaust pipe is so hot that if touched it can immediately cause serious burn injuries. The argument may be put forward, “Oh! Come on. No one will do that after watching it.”

But, that’s not true. Such is the impact of visuals that even highly reasonable and prudent persons may believe some of the things as they watch on the screen and not exercise discretion to separate the real from the artificially created and depicted situations.

After all, ‘seeing is believing!’ And, the indirect effect may be that such irresponsible depiction may give innovative ideas to fertile minds to experiment without supervision and caution. Or, it may be just to achieve something knowing fully well the consequences.

In April this year, the well-known car manufacturer, Hyundai, while promoting its new car, which used certain latest technology that ensured that the exhaust pipe would emit only water vapour and no poisonous gas, used a highly irresponsible advertisement in the UK.

It showed a man, depressed and dissatisfied with life, trying to commit suicide by shutting himself overnight in the garage with the car engine on. And, lo and behold, he didn’t die as the exhaust pipe emitted only water vapour. But, after seeing this advertisement, a depressed man really used a car, which emitted poisonous gases, as most of the cars do, in the same manner as shown in the advertisement, to end his life. Unfortunately, he was successful.

If an adult can try to imitate an advertisement, there are much higher chances of children trying to imitate what they watch on television screens. By merely paying lip service that the children are the future of the nation and we need to be responsible citizens and companies, it is far more necessary that such irresponsible advertisements are dealt with due seriousness.

Irresponsibility, which may immense harm, cannot be permitted in the garb of creativity and intellectual ingenuity. Law-makers and law enforcing agencies must act with a sense of urgency to work towards the real purpose. Only then the menace of irresponsible advertisements can be tackled.","2013-09-16 12:20:37","0","77.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","875","84.90","49.09","11.24","13.41","22.44","25.03","86.17","52.80","7.77","1.49","0.23","0.34","0.00","0.46","0.46","6.29","11.20","13.49","9.71","4.80","6.63","1.83","14.74","5.03","2.63","1.26","0.34","2.06","5.71","2.40","3.31","0.34","0.69","0.23","5.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.69","14.51","2.29","3.09","1.60","4.11","1.49","4.00","3.77","2.97","0.00","0.46","1.94","0.34","1.49","0.00","0.23","8.00","0.69","2.97","3.09","1.03","1.03","1.83","9.83","1.49","9.26","1.94","4.91","2.74","4.46","1.26","0.11","0.34","0.23","0.23","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","13.94","4.00","6.97","0.11","0.69","0.23","0.23","0.57","0.34","0.80","0.00","0.00","4219","7.9","23.83783783783784","1331","874","38","56.59","13.4","11.1","12.07","13.7","173","16.333333333333332","19.11762013729977","405","20.95","5","0.49","0","42","2","116","0","108","76","1","2","21","141","19","0","49","1","0","28","3","52","2","1","0","27","0","48","8","33","33","23","29","10","2","0","1"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-is-china-adopting-a-new-maritime-security-policy-1849031","Is China adopting a new maritime security policy?","Several countries are concerned about China’s growing sensitivity and assertiveness on issues of sovereignty and territorial — including maritime — integrity, especially in the past five years. China’s actions have heightened tensions in the South China Sea and with Vietnam, the Philippines and Japan. China has neither hesitated to warn off Indian Navy and survey ships while they are in Vietnamese territorial waters.

Interesting in this context is a recent (May 28, 2013) article in the People’s Daily, written by Mian Yang, dean of the Shanghai Institute of International Studies (SIIS) and younger brother of Chinese state councillor and former foreign minister Yang Jiechi. Written prior to the recent summit (June 7-8, 2013) between Chinese president Xi Jinping and US president Obama, he quite candidly stated that the increase in China’s comprehensive national strength had given its “new leaders” more confidence in dealing with the international community.

Mian Yang emphasised that this “self-confidence” has enabled China’s leaders to be “very firm” in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity while simultaneously being flexible in dealings with smaller countries. He revealed that China’s new leaders will focus more on the neighbourhood and travel oftener in the region.

Reflecting this firmness on sovereignty and territorial issues, Chinese president Xi Jinping, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun (June 12), used the term “core interests” at the recent summit with Obama while referring to the dispute with Japan over the sovereignty of the Senkakus, which China calls the Diaoyu islands. China had referred to the islands as its “core interest” for the first time this April during a routine weekly news conference by a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson. The US has, incidentally, briefed Japan on the talks at the summit.

Earlier this January, China’s National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation (NASMG) announced that Sinomaps Press had published new maps of China. These identify more than 130 islands and islets in the South China Sea, most of which have not featured on previous official Chinese maps. The earlier maps featured only some of the larger islands. The new maps also have an enlarged inset of the Diaoyu (or Senkaku) islands.

Predictably, the new map shows the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh and a large chunk of Jammu and Kashmir, mainly comprising Aksai Chin, as part of China. Pages of China’s new passports contain similar maps.

A major irritant for Beijing is, however, the maritime and aerial surveillance regularly carried out by US ships and aircraft inside China’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and along China’s air-space off its coast. China has voiced its objections and in recent years intermittently shown its ire by confronting US aircraft and vessels, probably becoming the only country to do so.

A major accident was averted in April 2001 when a Chinese Air Force J-8 jet brushed wing-tips with a US Air Force EP-3 spy plane which was flying near China’s secret submarine base at Sanya on the southern tip of Hainan Island. The US pilot crash-landed his aircraft, but the Chinese pilot lost his life. Since 2009, several close confrontations have been reported between Chinese submarines, frigates and US navy vessels like the USS Impeccable and USS Victorious and the unarmed hydrographic vessel USS Bowditch. Chinese fishing ships reportedly harassed the USS Bowditch at least half a dozen times in China’s EEZ.

After one such incident ‘hawkish’ retired People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force senior colonel Dai Xu, who is a regular commentator on Chinese TV channels and author of a book from which Xi Jinping often quotes, told the Chinese media that “concrete military actions should be taken.” He said “First warning, second expulsion. And if that does not work, the invading vessels can be directly surrounded and sunk.” Chinese military officers have also raised the issue at international conferences and on the sidelines of sessions of the National People’s Congress — China’s version of a parliament.

The issue resurfaced this May at a working session on maritime security during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.

Articulating long-held objections to the surveillance of China’s coastline and EEZ by US aircraft and ships, PLA senior colonel Zhou Bo disclosed that China had “thought of reciprocating” by “sending ships and planes to the US EEZ”, and had actually done so “a few times”. This is the first occasion when a Chinese military official has confirmed reports in circulation for some time that PLA Navy (PLAN) vessels had been detected around Okinawa and Guam.

The disclosure is significant for countries in the region as it suggests that Beijing’s maritime policy is set to shift towards increased assertiveness. It implies that as China’s military might rises and its economic and strategic interests expand, China will copy US behaviour. It will accord to itself the right to carry out surveys and gather intelligence inside the EEZs of other countries. China’s actions will initially affect South Korea, Japan and countries with competing claims in the South China Sea. As China’s navy extends its reach and capabilities, this policy will directly impact countries like India.

Ni Lexiong, director of the Sea Power and Defence Policy Research Institute at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, confirmed that the PLA senior colonel’s remarks reflected the “changing concept of maritime affairs” of China’s leaders “following the rapid development of China’s maritime industry and rising strength of its naval force in the past decade”.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-march-of-red-terror-and-state-sponsored-violence-1843996","March of Red terror and state-sponsored violence","May was a politically hot month ranging from terror in Bastar to the politics of cricket. The massacre in Chhattisgarh was waiting to happen. Over the last few months, P Chidambaram crowed over the alleged massacre of 14 adivasis only to apologize within hours. There was no adequate compensation for the 14 adivasis who died. But this is common in Chhattisgarh which also made it fertile land for the rise of Maoism.

Nothing happened for a while apart from stray encounters until a few days ago, when Maoists struck back. Their main target was Mahendra Karma, the inspiration behind the Salwa Judum’s forced militarization of adivasis to fight Maoists, bunching villagers together, moving them away from their earlier homes and fields so that they could be watched at all times.

While Mahendra Karma along with the BJP advanced Salwa Judum, other Congress leaders like Ajit Jogi vehemently opposed it. Despite Karma’s fierce personality, the steady attrition of civilians by paramilitary and police made the situation dangerous. The skills that the Maoists, originally from Andhra Pradesh learnt in making improvised but deadly mines, made the security forces move with extreme caution.

This was to culminate in the recent bloody events. On May 27, not only the Congress but even the BJP went on tour of particularly dangerous areas in Chhattisgarh. The bulk of the security was with the BJP and no quick standby security forces were placed on alert.Infuriated with civilian casualties and the killing of their cadre, the Maoists prepared an invincible attack. They had been listening regularly to the police radio and mapping where the security forces were, an experience they had acquired in Andhra Pradesh.

As is well known, Mahendra Karma was brutally attacked, and even the Congress state president and his son were killed. Despite severe injuries VC Shukla survived. But the sequence of events raises serious questions. Why were there two motorcades at the same time knowing the dangerous deployment of Maoists and their intimate knowledge of the terrain?

Senior leaders like Karma must have known the extent to which the Congress rally was undermanned. What were the CRPF, police and others doing? If they could not provide adequate security, they should have categorically told Mahendra Karma and others that they needed more reinforcements.

The Congress plaint that their rally was under staffed and poorly armed is perplexing. People like Mahendra Karma and a number of the forces were battle hardened. They had previous experience of fighting Maoists. Secondly, even if they were understaffed, why were they under-armed? Many members of the security force had 9 mm pistols, which are only a side arm compared to what the Maoists had in terms of Kalashnikovs, ISAS rifles, self-loading rifles, apart from other arms and plenty of ammunition and landmines.

The motley cavalcade with its prime Maoist target Mahendra Karma could only have driven to its massacre.

Post this horrific massacre the blame game is on. Rajnath Singh who earlier savaged the Congress, is now praising the Chhattisgarh model. It is difficult to imagine what this model is: massacre of adivasis on the grounds that they are Maoists? Salwa Judum was knocked out by an order of the Supreme Court. One question in all this diatribe has not been answered. Why have the Andhra Maoists flourished in Chhattisgarh? The special police, interestingly termed as Greyhounds, have chased most of them out of the state.

What explanation has been given by the CRPF battalion which was too slow to reach the killing fields?

One thing that politicians and police have not fully realized is that the adivasis go to the Maoists because they have no other support. Therefore, the real struggle between the Maoists and the State rests on the basis of bonds of trust and the supply of basic necessities to adivasis. The Maoists are brutal killers but they are also fierce supporters and protectors of adivasis. The latter, however, must be quaking now having had previous experience of being punished for sins committed by the Maoists.

Some might wonder: does the discussion on Maoists really amount to much? But the kinds of weapons the Maoists have got together and their networks in other states are matters of concern. It is ridiculous for uniformed forces to say that they will kill all Maoists and their sympathizers. More than Maoism, the problem is of poverty, of lack of access to forest produce, lack of jobs in the modern sector, speedy justice and health — all the requirements for a decent daily life.

Rajnath Singh’s self-serving praise for the Chhattisgarh model is obscene. How many more deaths will it take before the militarist elements in the BJP, Congress and other parties realize that political problems cannot be solved by the gun. And what about the Maoists? While armed forces will be required to protect people in Chhattisgarh, if daily life improves markedly, many adivasis will move away from the Maoists.

When the Northeast was in flames, knowledgeable and astute bureaucrats helped in putting the fire out. There is still major ethnic conflict going on in Manipur. The state police forces should not have an eye-for-an eye policy. In the entire discourse on this issue, the exchange between Mahatma Gandhi and the Naga rebels is still relevant, now that the problem is moving towards solution. Development and not bullets will be the answer.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/academy/column-educate-india-1939913","Educate India!","It is needless to repeat the role of education in individual and social life. It enables an individual to understand things better; makes him well-informed and helps to participate in the democratic process of the country. Depending upon the level and quality of his education, enhances his social status and improves his employment opportunities. From the society’s point of view, a literate, well-informed, vigilant and, economically more efficient and productive labour force is a greater asset in; making democracy participative and also making the rulers accountable and accelerating the overall pace of socio-economic development.

Good quality elementary and secondary education, as also higher, vocational, technical and professional education has played a critical role in making countries economically and industrially advanced. It needs to be specially mentioned that the Gross Enrolment Ratio ( or GER is the ratio of children to total college-age going, say, 18-22 age group) joining higher education institutions in the developed countries is about 70 per cent, while for the developing countries it is about 35 per cent. Even for China, it is now about 28 to 30 per cent.

In India, real educational development as such began only after Independence. For the British were not interested in mass but in class education, to serve their colonial interests. Thus, though India’s achievements in the field of education of all kinds, compared to the conditions prevailing at the time of independence cannot be described as stupendous, it also cannot be considered unsatisfactory: be it literacy rate, gross enrolment ratio at the elementary and secondary level, or the spread of higher, technical and professional education. Our GER in the higher education has improved from about 11 per cent in 2004-05 to about 18 per cent now. Still it is certainly low vis-s-vis what it ought to be in view of the technologically fast changing globalising economy.

Nevertheless, our education system continues to suffer from fundamental problems that need urgent attention of both Central and more importantly,the state governments. First, the much-quoted Kothari Commission, in 1966, recommended six per cent of the national income to be spent on education. But despite huge increase in the expenditure on education during the Eleventh Plan (20 per cent of the total Plan outlay), the total expenditure (Centre and States put together) has not crossed even four percent.

But the reinsurance company clearly has its task cut out, asserts A K Roy, chairman and managing director. In an interview with Amol Dethe of Zee Business, he lets out how to navigate this path and the company’s efforts to take its footprint far and wide.

After Japan, it seems Uttarakhand is going to be the biggest claim for you. We had three sets of meetings with the insurance companies. There are challenges of documentation. Claims have started pouring in, these will further go up since people are not fully out of the traumatic situation. So, far GIC Re has reported 400 claims. Apart from motor vehicles, property, personal and cattle claims have also been reported. But the big chunk has come in from hydro power projects. Till date, we have reported worth Rs 1,400 crore claims.

Any expansion plans?They are going on schedule. Expansion takes some time for various factors. But I see our operations starting in Bhutan first. We will start the company operation there by the end of this fiscal.Progress on TPA?We are working on the final business plan. A new company will be formed in July itself. GIC Re has deployed 5% equity to form the new company.

You were in discussions with Lloyds to enter the world market.We are rigorously working with Lloyds. It will give us the biggest access in the world market. We will get ratings from S&P as well, if we work with them. We are exploring all the options, it’s work in progress.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-nda-never-raised-sarabjit-issue-with-pakistan-when-in-power-congress-1830401","NDA never raised Sarabjit issue with Pakistan when in power: Congress","Seeking to blunt BJP critcism of ""inaction"" by UPA government in Sarabit Singh case, Congress today released a paper documenting actions taken by the government in the matter and accused NDA of ""never raising the issue"" when the opposition alliance was in power.

The 3-page document released by AICC said ""it started in 1990. Sarabjit was in jail all through NDA rule but never did the NDA government ask for consular access to him.

""They did not ever raise the issue with Pakistan authorities nor during the then Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's visit to Lahore or during Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's visits to Agra or subsequent visits by any other digntaries.""

The document was released on a day when an NDA delegation led by LK Advani met President Pranab Mukherjee on Sarabjit issue.

""What distresses us very greatly is the inaction of the Government of India, the Ministry of External Affairs and the officials concerned of not having constantly monitored this case... We are persuaded to emphasise this because we hold that our government's inaction in this case cannot be condoned. They owe the country an explanation and an apology,"" Advani said after the meeting with the President.

Sections in Congress believe the murderous attack on Sarabjit in a jail in Pakistan leading to his death could be a ploy to inflame passions in India and create a fertile ground for fanning fundamentalism.

In the document, the party has listed a series of actions taken by UPA government on the issue of Sarabjit since it came to power in 2004 and more specifically the actions taken since the attack on Sarabjit there on April 26.","2013-05-03 22:17:52","0","67.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","50.0","0.0","148.0","201.0","0.0","284.0","0.0","2.0","3","277","98.11","64.11","40.08","20.32","27.70","27.80","72.20","47.65","5.78","2.89","0.00","1.44","0.00","0.72","0.72","2.89","11.19","18.05","4.69","3.25","4.69","2.17","9.39","1.08","0.72","1.08","1.44","1.44","2.89","1.08","1.44","0.36","1.08","0.00","7.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.72","9.03","1.08","2.17","0.36","1.08","2.17","2.89","0.72","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.36","0.36","0.00","13.00","2.53","1.08","8.66","1.44","0.00","5.05","3.61","0.36","16.61","3.25","7.22","6.14","5.42","0.36","0.00","0.36","1.08","0.72","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.47","4.33","1.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.36","3.25","1.08","0.00","0.00","1335","9.07","31.11111111111111","430","276","10","43.46","13.7","14.1","11.96","15.9","71","12.875","23.32985507246377","159","26.0","9","0.46","0","9","4","36","0","44","7","0","0","1","49","41","1","9","0","0","8","2","10","1","0","0","8","0","8","14","6","11","4","3","0","1","0","2"

"http://www.dnaindia.com/business/column-us-govt-reduced-to-live-on-borrowed-time-1904647","US govt reduced to live on borrowed time","Governments spend more money than they earn and finance the difference through borrowing.

The government of United States (US) is no different on this front. The trouble is that it cannot borrow beyond a certain limit. This limit, known as the debt ceiling, was set at $16.69 trillion.

This ceiling should have been breached in May 2013, a little earlier this year. Since then, Jack Lew, the American treasury secretary, has taken a number of extraordinary measures like delaying public employee pension fund payments, in order to ensure that the government expenditure remains under control. Lesser expenditure meant lesser borrowing and hence, the government managed to keep its total borrowing below $16.69 trillion.

Today i.e. October 17, 2013, the government would have run out of the extraordinary measures that it has been taking. Given this, the treasury department would have exhausted its borrowing authority.

Hours before this would have happened, the leaders of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in the American Senate stuck a deal, suspending the debt ceiling. This will allow the US government to borrow beyond $16.69 trillion, till February 7, next year. The will also end the current government shut-down in the US and keep the government running along till January 15, 2014.

This is not the first time that the US government came close to its borrowing limit, given that the debt ceiling has been in place since 1939. Since 1960, the debt ceiling has been raised 78 times by the American Congress. But this time around the Democrats and the Republicans left it too late, each waiting for the other to blink first.

If the ceiling had not been extended the short-term repercussions would have been terrible. The treasury secretary Lew had said in early October that the US government “will be left...with only approximately $30bn” come October 17. This would not be enough to meet the expenditure of the government, which can be as high as $60 billion on some days, Lew had pointed out.

Interest payments of around $6 billion are due on US government bonds before the end of this month. Along with that, bonds worth between $90 to $93 billion need to be repaid between October 24 and October 31 (Source: www.thefinancialist.com) Governments issue bonds to borrow money.

The US government has reached a stage wherein it does not earn enough to repay the money it has already borrowed by issuing bonds. Hence, it has borrow more money by issuing fresh bonds to pay off the older bonds. If the debt ceiling had not been extended, it would have become very difficult for the US government to repay the money it had already borrowed.

More importantly, the US government bonds are deemed to be the safest financial security in the world. If the US government defaulted on paying interest on its bonds or repaying the principal, there would have been mayhem in financial markets, all over the world, including India. It has even been suggested that the crisis that could have unfolded would have been bigger than the crisis that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Investors would have sold out of US government bonds driving up global interest rates.

The US government would also have had to prioritise its expenditure. Does it make pension payments? Does it pay its employees and contractors? Does it pay interest on its bonds? Does it repay maturing bonds? These are the questions it would have had to address. Also, there are no legal provisions guiding the government on who to pay first. Hence, any prioritisation of payments could have led to a slew of lawsuits against the US government.

Given the negative repercussions of the debt ceiling not being extended, the markets were positive that a deal reached would be reached. Stock and bond markets around the world have been stable. And gold, looked at as a safe haven, is quoting at levels of around $1280 per ounce (one troy ounce equals 31.1grams).

The trouble is that the US government will cross its debt ceiling level again in February, 2014.

What happens then? How long can the American Congress keep increasing the debt ceiling? The basic problem is that the US government has borrowed too much money, and continues to do so, and if it doesn’t default today, it will default in the years to come.

"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-all-eyes-on-supreme-commander-1895852","All eyes on supreme commander","While the so-called Rahul Gandhi bombshell, apropos “ordinance is nonsense”, has seized the national discourse and has long-term implications for the political scenario that will shape the governance of the country, the more damaging issue in relation to national security that merits objective scrutiny is what may be termed the General VK Singh controversy.

It may be recalled that a national daily (Indian Express, September 20) made a dramatic revelation about a confidential report submitted by Army HQ to the Ministry of Defence in March this year which inter-alia alleged that former Army Chief, General VK Singh, had misused secret intelligence funds to de-stabilise the elected government in Jammu and Kashmir.

In the following days, there has been a series of public statements and clarifications offered by the former Chief, which, in turn, has led to an explosive debate in the national audio-visual media by his well-wishers and detractors that has only served to vitiate the discourse and, thereby, caused both embarrassment and damage to India’s image and security interests.

At the heart of this controversy is a statement made by VK Singh, who, while defending himself, alleged that Army funds were used to pay certain politicians in J&K to ‘stabilize’ the region — and furthermore, that this was a practice that dates back to the dawn of Indian independence. The enormity and preposterous import of this statement — for those who heard it live on TV — is self-evident. To characterize this as a jaw-dropping revelation is an under-statement.

Some correction was attempted by VK Singh who sought to clarify the content and context of his remarks but the damage was done. Was the allegation made by the former Army Chief true? If so, has India been guilty of the most heinous and hypocritical charge of nurturing a sham democracy in J&K — and the extrapolation is that Kashmir was indeed under the jackboot of the Indian army. This, incidentally, is the core of what India has long maintained in relation to Pakistan — namely that it is Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) that is still under the tight control of the Pakistan Army.

Mercifully, this allegation has been refuted by every former Indian Army Chief and in a joint statement (September 27), eight former Generals asserted that ‘no funds were ever provided by the Army, to any politician, political party or NGO in their tenures and nor would they have allowed that’. They further added to allay any anxiety that “the Indian Army is completely apolitical and that they do not dabble in politics and the Army takes great pride in this time honoured tradition.”

While this latest statement by the former Army Chiefs may offer some palliative, the VK Singh controversy needs to be reviewed in its entirety for it reveals certain abiding institutional infirmities in the higher defence management of the country. Civil-military relations in India have been less than appropriate and this is a trait that goes back to the Nehru years. The run-up to the 1962 war with China is a case in point.

At the time, the political direction to national security was less than objective and the most undesirable form of factionalism within the Army was nurtured by the then Defence Minister Krishna Menon. Consequently, negligence to an unfolding challenge to national security was the leitmotif of that decade. The debacle of October 1962 followed and it compelled the then President S Radhakrishnan to chastise PM Nehru for rank ‘negligence and credulity’. The Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces made the appropriate post-facto intervention within the Constitutional framework and encouraged a shattered PM to apply the corrective to the higher defence matrix.

One could argue that a similar situation currently prevails, in that the challenges to national security have become complex and urgent and the VK Singh episode is symptomatic of the systemic inadequacies that need to be objectively reviewed and corrected. The need for a radical overhaul of India’s higher defence management was palpable in the aftermath of the 1999 Kargil war and it is a shame that 14 years later, little substantive progress has been made. Both the NDA and UPA governments are culpable of having neglected this issue and in many ways, the VK Singh episode is a result of this negligence.

What began as a totally avoidable date-of-birth controversy soon snowballed into an ugly situation wherein the Army Chief was petitioning the Supreme Court for redress since the political executive was unable to deal with the matter. At the time there were unseemly insinuations about factions within the Army and selective leaks to the media about shaping the line of succession to the post of Army Chief.

In early 2012, more leaks in the media followed that hinted at General VK Singh attempting a coup by moving military formations towards Delhi — again a preposterous charge — and the matter was allowed to fester without any firm resolution by the political establishment. More turbulence was in store, for towards the end of his tenure in mid 2012, a secret missive from General VK Singh to the Prime Minister found its way into the public domain and a slew of charges and counter-charges filled the air. Again, the matter remained suspended and an aggrieved VK Singh went into retirement.

The nation was hoping that this matter had been buried but, regrettably, the latest mid-September revelations about VK Singh seeking to topple an elected government, amongst other grave charges that have deep import for national security, have opened the Pandora’s Box again. Given the uncertain political environment within the country — and the ordinance fiasco has only served to exacerbate matters — is there a case to review the role of the President? Should all eyes be upon the Supreme Commander only on the ceremonial occasion of January 26? The present incumbent of Rashtrapati Bhawan has an unmatched insight into the challenges to national security and could perhaps burnish the track record of his illustrious predecessor of 1962.The author is former director of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses","2013-09-30 09:11:42","0","72.0","11.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","1020","96.33","61.58","19.70","30.75","32.90","26.96","77.45","46.96","6.27","0.88","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.39","5.39","11.86","14.41","7.55","2.65","4.80","0.39","10.29","5.98","2.55","0.78","1.18","1.96","5.20","2.75","2.45","0.69","0.39","0.39","4.31","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.49","8.92","2.45","1.76","1.18","1.47","1.47","0.98","0.78","0.39","0.29","0.10","0.69","0.39","0.29","0.00","0.10","9.31","0.59","0.98","6.47","0.39","1.08","5.00","5.10","0.78","14.12","0.88","8.24","4.90","3.53","0.39","0.00","0.49","0.49","0.39","0.39","0.00","0.20","0.29","0.10","0.00","10.29","2.75","3.63","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.00","1.57","0.69","0.59","0.59","0.20","5032","8.97","34.1","1624","1010","32","39.4","16.8","15.6","13.01","18.5","241","25.0","24.184554455445546","467","29.37","24","0.46","0","39","12","146","0","129","94","8","2","7","167","119","1","44","0","0","10","7","30","0","2","0","34","0","25","38","11","35","12","35","9","6","0","0"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-government-likely-to-blink-first-in-lbt-standoff-1835281","Government likely to blink first in LBT standoff","Faced with a shutdown by traders opposing the local body tax (LBT), the state government may soften its stance. It might agree to amend crucial provisions like those on tax assessment to break the impasse.

Chief secretary Jayant Kumar Banthia and senior officials met traders’ representatives on Wednesday, but failed to break the deadlock. However, a senior state government official told dna that they were likely to agree to some “constructive improvements” regarding the LBT.

The account-based LBT has been levied in 25 of the 26 municipal corporations in Maharashtra in place of octroi. Mumbai may start levying LBT from October. “We are considering some constructive improvements like those on assessment. But, it is wrong to say that there must be no local tax like the LBT,” said an official.

He added that the provisions on the type of cases where the assessment was to be carried out could be changed. “We are examining the changes which are possible,” said another senior bureaucrat.

He added they would examine the traders’ demands like doing away with registration for establishments which did not import goods and not allowing local municipal bodies to do the assessment and agree to what was doable.

State government officials said a solution to the deadlock was likely to be arrived at through negotiations. Traders’ representatives said they were not amenable to LBT even with amendments and to assessment powers being given to local municipal bodies, which they said would cause harassment and corruption.

Arun Doshi, senior vice-president, Federation of Associations of Maharashtra (FAM), demanded that the LBT be replaced by a local or development tax to be assessed and collected by the sales tax department. “The state government is not firm on one stand,” he said.

The FAM said they had expected that a joint committee of trade representatives and government officers would be formed to resolve the issue.","2013-05-16 09:00:00","0","68.0","11.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","151.0","202.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","314","91.50","64.90","5.62","43.15","19.62","25.80","78.34","47.45","7.96","3.18","0.00","0.64","0.00","0.96","1.59","4.78","8.28","14.97","10.19","1.27","3.50","1.59","15.61","0.32","1.27","1.59","0.96","1.59","2.87","1.91","0.96","0.00","0.32","0.32","7.32","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.96","10.19","1.59","1.91","1.91","2.87","0.32","2.55","2.55","0.00","2.55","0.00","0.96","0.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.83","1.91","1.59","6.69","0.64","0.64","7.32","5.10","1.27","10.19","1.59","5.73","2.23","9.24","0.00","0.00","3.82","0.00","0.00","1.59","0.00","0.64","0.96","0.00","0.00","14.01","5.10","3.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.64","2.55","0.96","1.27","0.00","1573","8.15","19.625","487","312","16","51.68","14.0","10.9","13.05","13.0","70","7.0","18.774358974358975","168","18.06","9","0.43","0","10","3","32","0","33","24","0","0","8","43","22","0","25","0","0","12","1","7","0","0","1","16","0","23","20","8","14","3","3","3","1","0","1"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-third-arrest-made-in-chetna-ajmera-murder-case-1804521","Third arrest made in Chetna Ajmera murder case","In a major development, the Mumbai crime branch sleuths on Monday arrested one Hemant Maneria for his alleged involvement in the murder of Ajmera Group chairman Jayant Ajmera’s wife Chetna and stealing Rs1.50 crore from their residence.

Maneria is the third person to be arrested in this case and was part of the murder conspiracy.

Earlier, the crime branch had arrested Mahendra Rathod and Shyamlal Soni. Mastermind of the said conspiracy Ashok Purohit alias Maharaj is absconding and a manhunt has been launched to nab him.

According to the police, in May, last year, Chetna was murdered at her residence and cash were stolen from her residence. After crime branch had taken over the investigations, they had first apprehended Rathod from Worli.

On the basis of his interrogation, the police had later arrested Soni, a Rajasthan-based jeweller. The police had also recovered some of the stolen booty from Soni.

Maneria and Purohit had fled after the murder and were absconding since then. Ahmedabad police had on Monday apprehended Maneria and during questioning he revealed about his involvement in Chetna Ajmera murder case.

The Ahmedabad police had then alerted their Mumbai counterparts, after which a crime branch team went to Ahmedabad and took Maneria’s custody.

“As per our investigation Maneria was with Purohit on the day of the incident. Purohit worked as a cook for the Ajmeras, and had committed the murder with the intention of theft,” said a crime branch officer, requesting anonymity.

The police had also released photograph of Purohit and Maneria asking citizens to pass any information about them to the police.","2013-02-25 23:52:47","0","56.0","5.0","2.0","0.0","50.0","0.0","145.0","197.0","0.0","274.0","0.0","1.0","1","266","96.48","81.66","3.56","2.51","19.00","25.19","69.92","44.74","5.26","4.51","0.00","0.38","0.00","2.63","1.50","0.75","10.15","15.79","7.89","1.50","6.39","0.00","12.03","2.63","2.63","0.38","1.50","1.50","2.63","0.00","2.63","0.00","2.26","0.00","8.65","0.38","0.00","1.13","1.88","4.51","1.13","1.88","0.00","1.50","0.38","0.00","1.50","0.75","0.75","0.00","0.75","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.38","9.02","1.50","1.50","4.89","1.13","0.38","9.02","1.88","1.13","11.65","1.50","4.14","6.02","4.89","0.75","1.13","1.13","0.00","2.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.65","5.26","4.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.75","0.75","0.00","0.00","1336","7.86","19.142857142857142","409","264","15","62.07","12.6","9.0","12.82","12.1","56","6.916666666666667","17.524848484848487","139","18.07","0","0.44","0","11","2","30","0","36","6","0","0","0","55","44","0","6","0","0","4","8","6","0","0","1","6","0","3","23","7","16","0","3","1","0","0","0"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-will-rajan-fight-inflation-leave-rupee-to-market-1871429","Will Rajan fight inflation, leave rupee to market?","Milton Friedman was the most famous economist of the second half of the twentieth century. He believed that inflation is a monetary phenomenon. As he wrote in Money Mischief – Episodes in Monetary History: “The recognition that substantial inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon is only the beginning of an understanding of the cause and cure of inflation.”

This line of thinking has influenced many economists over the years, ‘particularly’ those who work and teach at the University of Chicago, where Friedman was based for 31 years between 1946 and 1977.

Raghuram Rajan, currently the chief economic advisor and is scheduled to take over as the next governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is one such economist. In fact, Rajan has clearly pointed out in his earlier writings that the RBI should simply concentrate on managing inflation.

As Rajan wrote in a 2008 article, along with Eswar Prasad: “The RBI already has a medium-term inflation objective of 5%... But the central bank is also held responsible, in political and public circles, for a stable exchange rate. The RBI has gamely taken on this additional objective, but with essentially one instrument, the interest rate, at its disposal, it performs a high-wire balancing act.”

And given this, the RBI ends up being neither here nor there. As Rajan put it: “What is wrong with this? Simple that by trying to do too many things at once, the RBI risks doing none of them well.”

Hence, Rajan felt that the RBI should ‘just’ focus on controlling inflation. As he wrote in the 2008 Report of the Committee on Financial Sector Reforms: “The RBI can best serve the cause of growth by focusing on controlling inflation and intervening in currency markets only to limit excessive volatility... an exchange rate that reflects fundamentals tends not to move sharply, and serves the cause of stability.”

The trouble is that the RBI has moved on from a single-minded focus on inflation since the days of Bimal Jalan and tends to follow what experts refer to as the ‘multiple indicator approach’. The central bank now looks at a range of indicators from inflation to capital flows and even the exchange rate. Though at times the objectives the RBI is trying to achieve, are at odds.

This is what is happening currently. The RBI is trying to control inflation, accelerate economic growth and stabilise the value of the rupee, all at the same time. Something which is not possible. Rajan understands this well enough. “The RBI’s objective could be restated as low inflation, and growth consistent with the economy’s potential. They amount to essentially the same thing! But it would let the RBI off the hook for targeting the exchange rate. And that is the key point,” Rajan wrote in the 2008 article cited earlier.

Rajan’s writing suggests that he believes in letting the currency finding its right value. This puts him at odds with the current RBI policy of defending the rupee at around 60-61. If he allows the rupee to fall and find its right value, it would make him terribly unpopular with the political class. Also, do nothing might be a good theoretical strategy, but an RBI governor needs to be seen doing something to defend the rupee.

A weaker rupee would mean higher oil prices, for one. These higher prices would have to be passed on to the consumers in the form of higher price of petrol, diesel, cooking gas etc. With the Lok Sabha elections due in mid 2014, this would be politically disastrous for the Congress-led UPA.

Also, it’s worth remembering that there is not much a central bank governor can do about high consumer price inflation in India, given that most of it has come about from increased government expenditure, which more than doubled (gone up by 133%) to Rs 16,65,297 crore between 2007-2008 and 2013-2014.

In fact, inflation might only go up once the food security scheme is in full swing. A tough test lies ahead for Rajan. But given his impeccable credentials, he might just be the best man for the job. As Turkish-American economist Dani Rodrik put it: “In Rajan, India gets a superb economist as its central bank governor.”

Rajan himself realises the challenges and the fact there are no “magic wands” to cure the problems. He also realises the limited power of a central banker. As he wrote in an October 2012 column for Project Syndicate, “Central bankers nowadays enjoy the popularity of rock stars, and deservedly so... But they must be able to admit when they are out of bullets. After all, the transformation from hero to zero can be swift.”","2013-08-08 07:17:29","0","73.0","10.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","788","93.43","51.02","14.76","36.97","18.33","21.95","79.70","49.37","7.49","2.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.65","0.51","5.33","10.28","16.12","7.49","4.31","5.46","1.02","13.07","4.95","3.30","1.02","3.81","1.65","3.30","1.90","1.27","0.13","0.13","0.13","3.05","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.78","9.77","1.90","1.65","1.52","1.78","1.52","1.78","0.63","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.38","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.25","7.74","0.13","1.90","4.44","1.02","0.89","2.92","8.38","0.63","14.21","2.41","8.12","3.68","6.73","0.38","0.00","4.57","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","16.88","5.96","4.95","0.63","0.00","0.13","0.13","1.02","2.41","0.89","0.51","0.25","3641","7.86","21.405405405405407","1159","779","43","61.56","12.3","9.2","10.73","10.6","164","8.3","17.661052631578947","387","19.24","18","0.46","0","26","23","92","0","111","59","4","2","15","125","67","0","30","1","0","22","6","43","2","1","4","19","0","31","15","20","15","11","37","3","4","0","2"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-who-s-your-money-management-adviser-1932010","Who's your money management adviser","Most of us know how to change a light bulb. We also have a fair idea of how to set up a decorative table lamp and connect it to an adjacent plug point. However, when it comes to installing an air conditioner, we leave that to a specialist, because the task requires a much higher level of experience and expertise.

Similarly, most of us know how to save money – basically just spend less than you earn – and rudimentary investing in fixed deposits or national saving certificates is also something that is generally manageable by all. However, when it comes to identifying relevant financial goals and outlining the investments necessary to achieve them at each stage of life, we should leave that to a specialist as well, because of the experience and expertise required.

According to the Financial Planning Association, a qualified financial planner helps you do the following:

1. Set realistic financial and personal goals.

2. Assess your current financial health by examining your assets, liabilities, income, insurance, taxes, investments and estate plan.

3. Develop a realistic, comprehensive plan to meet your financial goals by addressing financial weaknesses and building on financial strengths.

4. Put your plan into action and monitor its progress.

5. Stay on track to meet changing goals, personal circumstances, stages of your life, products, markets and tax laws.

Why call an expert?You may not have the expertise, the time or the desire to actively plan and manage certain financial aspects of your life. You may want help getting started. You may benefit from an objective, third-party perspective on what are often emotional, difficult decisions. And in today’s hectic world, it can be beneficial to have a financial planning expert make sure you stay focused and follow through with your financial plans.

If you have the time and knowledge — and your financial situation is not too complicated — you may be able to do a lot of it on your own. However, there are some situations where you may find you need a financial planner, such as:1. You have little or no experience with finances;

2. You don’t have the inclination to do it;

3. You want an objective, outside perspective;

4. You have a complex financial situation; or

5. You don’t have the time

Some aspects of financial planning may be too complex for most people, such as calculating how long your retirement capital will last or maximizing tax strategies. A good financial planner will work with other professionals, such as stockbrokers, accountants, and insurance agents, to coordinate their efforts with your overall financial needs.Identifying a plannerThink about all the money you have saved till date and the amount you will earn till retirement. Now ask yourself very honestly, ‘Can I trust this person with it?’ Do not opt for someone just because you meet on the train every day and feel comfortable talking to him or are impressed by his oratorical style. Ask friends who have retained a financial planner. Your chartered accountant may also be able to recommend a specialist.

Verification aspectsWhile qualifications and track record are quite important, the most essential question that you need to ask is, where does he earn his money from? If it is from commissions on financial products sold, your needs are going to be the least of his priorities. Pick a planner who makes a living based on the retainer for consultancy. Get clarity on aspects like access, plan reviews and reminders. Pay for professional advice - the returns will be worth it.

Expert Speak: How to get optimum resultsSumeet Vaid, CEO Ffreedom Financial Planners1. Review your finances: Financial planning is essentially a translation of life’s dreams in financial goals and developing a time bound path to achieve the same. So now that you have decided to approach a financial planner for managing your finances, get a hold of your financial statements and review them. Take some time to think what it is that you wish to accomplish and when do you want to accomplish it.

2. Check for a credible financial planner: With a clear goal in mind, you can now begin interviewing different financial planners based on your requirements. Make sure the person you meet is the same person who will be your adviser and is either a CFP or a CPA-PFS. (For list of CFPs in India, you can check the FPSB website)

3. Check your compatibility: While hiring a planner based on a friend’s reference is desirable, one must always remember that their friend’s needs might be different than their own and so might be their planner’s expertise. Always choose your financial planner according to the compatibility between your needs and the planner’s expertise and feel free to ask for client references and sample case studies. While hiring a planner with a fine experience is vital, it is advisable to judge him purely on his skill set rather than on the basis of returns.

4. Personal touch: With breakthrough in technology, most of the financial planning companies have automated software that is used to create a plan based on your data. While creating a mere template of the whole financial plan using software is perfectly fine, one should make sure that the plan is then customized based on their personal needs.

5. Be inquisitive: The key to finding the perfect financial planner is doing a proper background check while asking the right questions along the way. While curiosity might kill the cat, it will certainly increase your chances at finding the right financial planner.

6. Do your part: Last but not the least, remember that your planner is not a magician. Fixing your finances takes time. Also there are risks to every investment. Have faith in your planner and plod along the path he has shaped for your financial freedom!","2013-12-09 10:56:58","0","82.0","21.0","2.0","0.0","51.0","0.0","150.0","201.0","0.0","286.0","0.0","2.0","3","970","72.66","91.95","6.83","77.08","16.72","26.19","86.60","48.56","11.13","7.73","0.10","0.52","5.57","0.82","0.72","3.40","7.73","11.86","8.25","4.12","7.32","0.82","15.05","4.33","2.37","1.65","1.86","2.37","4.23","3.30","0.52","0.10","0.10","0.00","11.55","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.82","14.85","3.09","2.99","2.06","3.71","1.86","2.68","1.13","0.31","0.10","0.31","0.62","0.00","0.62","0.00","0.00","8.97","1.44","3.81","2.06","2.58","0.41","0.62","11.75","4.85","9.07","1.55","4.33","3.40","9.90","0.31","0.00","6.08","0.10","0.10","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.10","0.00","13.71","5.77","4.64","0.93","0.41","0.31","0.10","0.31","0.10","0.93","0.21","0.00","4672","7.79","17.157894736842106","1480","969","52","61.06","13.2","9.4","11.78","11.5","198","10.7","17.6133746130031","443","15.91","7","0.47","0","38","16","86","0","93","108","2","6","22","156","38","1","62","1","0","51","38","39","0","1","1","33","0","56","1","25","18","39","28","3","4","0","10"
"http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-the-poverty-of-choice-1889779","The Poverty of Choice","Jamie Oliver, the celebrity chef, recently got himself in a bit of a pickle by proclaiming to be confused by his observation that while the typical British working class family claimed to be unable to afford the incorporation of healthy, nutritious food into its diet, it nevertheless could afford to own a large LCD television set or two. Predictably, Jamie's comment engendered a maelstrom of criticism among numerous observers. I, however, could not help but feel slightly guilty at Jamie's predicament. I remembered numerous past instances where I had thought similar thoughts of my lesser-privileged compatriots. Like that time when I discovered that the poor in India (and other countries) spend a substantial portion of their meagre income on tobacco and alcohol. And that other time, when Lakshmi, our domestic help, told us how she had splurged on a beautiful and expensive-looking sari for Diwali.

Maybe you have had similar thoughts too. Some of these are common enough observations and have even been immortalised on the silver screen. You may remember the heavily indebted farmer who decides to borrow money from the usurious moneylender and risks losing his do bigha zamin (two acres of land). Or perhaps you may remember the urban poor hero[in]es who hatch hare-brained, sloppy, get-rich schemes that land them in tight scrapes (Hera Pheri and Delhi Belly, for example)?

But why do poor families spend on alcohol and tobacco instead of on better nutrition for their children? Or splurge on expensive non-essentials instead of saving for future exigencies? Economists have long sought to answer this question; to address why the poor tend to behave in ways that promote the reinforcement of the poverty that traps them.

Is this behaviour unique to the poor alone?

We, in the middle class, have likely faced financial adversity in our lives at some point or the other. We may even have battled through periods when our mental faculties became overwhelmed by a temporary ""in-between-jobs situation”, an expensive medical emergency or a catastrophic closure of that popular ""chit fund"" company.

But the level to which financial stress affects our brain only recently became clear. US economists discovered that thinking about money issues makes people focus intensely on immediate problems while neglecting others, particularly those in the seemingly distant future. In another experiment, over a 100 random shoppers in a New Jersey mall were asked to imagine themselves in various situations of financial adversity including expensive car repairs and large salary cuts at work. They were subsequently tested on their puzzle-solving abilities. Surprisingly, people placed under high amounts of (even entirely fake) financial stresses performed badly on standard tests of cognitive ability.

Our cognitive ability directly affects our ability to make decisions in our daily life. From our choice of work clothes to the type of lunch we pick up at the cafeteria. From the colour of the curtains for the bedroom to choosing between Sony TV or Sun TV to watch at home. What may be surprising is that each of these decisions comes at a price. A physical price we pay in mental energy.

As it turns out, we may only have a finite store of mental energy or willpower. A recent New York Times article describes how after a long day of making decisions or resisting temptations, “decision fatigue” sets in. We then either make decisions impulsively without thinking through the consequences or avoiding making decisions altogether (remember those irresistible impulse buys of chocolates or chips at the supermarket on your way back from work?). But, just as physical energy can be topped up with a quick shot of glucose, so can our mental stores. A 4PM snack at work could have prevented you from giving into temptation at the supermarket counter.

Now, for a moment, think of that woman working 12 hours in the fields of India, having eaten barely one full meal in the day. There is a good chance that while she is monotonously but carefully planting our rice, she is thinking about her unpaid debt with the moneylender, about the looming school fees of her children and the sudden price rise of dals in the market. Any fiscal choice she makes has to be constantly weighed against numerous competing choices. If she chooses to go to the doctor to treat her debilitating TB, she’d probably have to forfeit that day’s wages. If she decides to buy the prescribed medicines, she might not have enough money left over to buy food at the market. On those rare days when she does have some money tucked away in her pallu, so many different temptations test her limited willpower. Sometimes it's just easier to give in to the nutritionally useless but oh-so-tasty packet of chips than to get some extra dal.

I shudder to imagine having to live life like that. When expenses that wouldn't even register as a tiny blip on our middle-class budget radars can literally have life-or-death consequences. Our relative affluence insulates us to many of the really hard and mentally exhausting choices faced by a third of the world’s population today. But for those times when our choices can and do get hard, we can always eat a KitKat and soldier on.

There is a common perception that the poor remain mired in poverty because of their own bad life choices. They don’t bother to educate themselves! They don’t save enough for the future! Or even that they are too lazy and don't work hard enough! However, the new research into this major and hitherto ignored factor of their lives, allows us to gain some clarity into the daily mental struggles of the poor.

In this fast-paced, dichotomous world of extreme poverty and myriad choices, it is clear that a poor [wo]man’s life is a very hard life. Poverty weighs heavily on the mind. It blocks out thoughts of all but the most pressing concerns. The financial stress that forces the poor to carefully consider the cost of each and every decision, also takes a significant emotional and energetic toll on them. This in turn affects subsequent decisions and slowly a vicious cycle forms.

Our newfound clarity - it is not an all-explaining clarity by the way; as a friend wryly observed, The complexities of Life cannot be curve fitted into a single economic equation - behooves us, as a society, to empathise with our not-so-privileged brethren. I am reminded of a story about a beggar that my wry friend recounted recently. Routinely ignored by many passers-by, this beggar wearing tattered clothes and lying sprawled on the sidewalk slowly accumulated a few sympathetic coins. One person who stopped by the begging bowl, made to remove a Rs5 note from his wallet. His friend, mildly affronted, cautioned him that the beggar would likely waste that money on cheap liquor. To which he replied, ""That is fine. I know Rs5 will not get him any food anyway. Better to buy that liquor and kill his hunger with it.""

We need to acknowledge this perverse dichotomy in the lives of the poor and the larger forces that influence the choices that they make. At the very least, we should pause for a moment before rushing to judge the Lakshmis of this world on their spending decisions.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/ct-elizabeth-restaurant-review-phil-vettel-story.html","Review: Elizabeth's new menu format puts the focus back on food","Elizabeth, the restaurant, is not quite a year old, but recent changes by chef/owner Iliana Regan have made the dining experience drastically different. And I like every single change she has made.

Most notably, Regan has revamped Elizabeth's seating, a source of contention among critics and customers. Gone are the eight-seat communal tables and the prospect of dining among six or more strangers, an experience that some embraced and others groused about. Elizabeth's 24 seats now are distributed among two- and four-seat tables (which can be rearranged to accommodate larger parties), so if you're annoyed by your dining companions, well, whose fault is that?

The old Owl, Deer and Diamond menus, which varied in price and number of courses, have been merged into a solitary menu, whose components are unknown to you (unless you peek at online postings) until they arrive. The current menu consists of 20 courses, most of them very small, and it is extremely improbable that you will finish feeling hungry or overly stuffed. Prices still vary depending on the day and even the hour, but they are lower than before; now you can dine for as little as $85 (the previous low was $65, for half as many courses) and no more than $165 (the previous high was $205).

And finally, the single menu, though large, enables Regan and her staff to whittle down the length of the meal, which often lasted more than four hours. The goal now is 31/2 hours or less for a party of two; that goal isn't always met — my meal lasted longer — but less than a month into the new format, the kitchen staff is getting there. And to be fair, the night I visited, the chef was not in the kitchen (enjoying a very brief honeymoon), and in her absence, the smaller staff was no doubt sweating the details more than usual.

This is perhaps the ideal time to visit Elizabeth; Regan is well-known for her foraging and sourcing abilities, and the Midwest bounty doesn't get any better than an August following a rainy spring.

The menu is divided into The Farm; Ponds, Lakes and Seas; and The Woodlands sections, delineating a sensible, even predictable sequence of courses. The surprise is that each third of the menu is its own mini-tasting, starting with an amuse and growing in complexity until the next section, with its own amuse, hits the culinary reset button. The Farm section, for instance, opens with white chocolate and hibiscus spheres filled with tomato water, a blanched garden tomato over burrata and Worcestershire pudding and a tableside-brewed tomato tea accented by shallots and lemon thyme, a virtual garden in a teacup.

A few courses later you'll encounter an elote-inspired bowl of corn puree, inset with tiny squares of Mexican white cheese, lime and grilled potato and sitting next to caviarlike beads of fortified ham stock. Spanning the bowl's rim is a buttermilk breadstick, on which bits of candied lime, trout roe and lime basil sit precariously.

In the middle grouping you'll find shrimp noodles, the shrimp actually incorporated into the noodle, with crisped kale, lemon rind, toasted quinoa and Parmesan; followed by crispy smoked sturgeon alongside asparagus vichyssoise, surrounded by fresh, geleed and pickled cucumber. Best of the group is the crab dish, featuring nori-wrapped crab over compressed watermelon infused with soy and togarashi, crab salad amid watermelon foam, and a grouping of pickled watermelon-rind roll-ups. The black and clear dots alternating on the plate are, respectively, nori pudding and geleed rice-wine vinegar.

The meaty third of the menu includes bacon-wrapped rabbit as part of a deconstructed Cobb salad (I liked the juxtaposition of rabbit and rabbit food); the return of Regan's ""white rabbit"" mushroom consomme (a highlight of last fall's Deer menu) flavored with chamomile and cocoa nibs; and a hunter's-stew composition of venison, venison sausage, mushroom gnocchi and chanterelles, set amid a forest floor of mosses, reindeer lichen and birch bark.

Regan would be the last person to lay claim to much pastry-chef cred, but her desserts have gotten better and more substantial. The sweet progression begins with blackberry puree in a miniature pie-crust shell, served in a ginkgo-leaf dish; segues to honeydew melon balls with baby profiteroles, honeydew sorbet and house-made mascarpone cheese; and ends triumphantly with chocolate-mushroom brownies with porcini caramel, hazelnut-raspberry crumble and raspberry curd. Topping each brownie piece is a tiny piece of mushroom-shaped meringue. Just beautiful.

Beverage choices consist of beer and wine by the glass, wine by the bottle and wine pairings; the pairings are $100 (regardless of day or time). It's possible to get by for considerably less, but sommelier Ben Aviram's beverage picks are so spot on, and his descriptions so exquisite, that I can't imagine passing them up.

On the whole, I'm a fan of Elizabeth 2.0. The rearranged dining room has a nice flow, the tables close enough that you still get a sense of community from the space, and the one-on-two (or one-on-four) interactions with the servers, cooks and Regan herself feel more personal.

This isn't a full re-review, as I only visited once to see how Elizabeth's changes were panning out. But I have no trouble affirming the rating I hung on the place in December.

Kelly -- who took maternity leave in July as the host of ""America Live"" -- is expected to grab the plum time period right after ""The O'Reilly Factor"" when she returns to the network this fall, according to the Drudge Report.

The 42-year-old host had been expected to get a promotion to prime time, but many TV veterans assumed she'd get the 10 p.m. slot now occupied by Greta Van Susteren. Shoving aside Hannity -- the conservative host of Fox News' No. 2 show - counts as a major reworking of the evening lineup and carries considerable risk.

PHOTOS: Cable vs. broadcast ratings

For now, the network isn't saying much.

""We will neither confirm nor deny any programming scheduling changes,"" a Fox News spokeswoman said in a statement. ""As previously stated, the network has signed long-term deals with Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier, Shepard Smith, Bill O'Reillly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren.""

One possibility is that Hannity could move to 7 p.m., with Van Susteren remaining at 10 p.m. O'Reilly would keep anchoring the night at 8 p.m.

Interviewed at an investors' conference Thursday, Fox News chief Roger Ailes said, ""All of our stars will be back,"" but did not address specifics of the new lineup.

What do you think of the possibility that Kelly will get a 9 p.m. berth?

According to Forbes, Cowell and Stern each earned $95 million between June 2012 and June 2013. In a bizarre coincidence, some of Stern's money is coming from Cowell (or at least a show Cowell owns a piece of).

Stern, known mostly for his satellite radio show on Sirius, is also a judge on NBC's ""America's Got Talent,"" a competition series of which Cowell is an executive producer.

In fact, Cowell owns a stake in the global ""Got Talent"" franchise, which includes ""Britain's Got Talent,"" ""Australia's Got Talent"" and even the upcoming ""Afghanistan's Got Talent."" Although he no longer appears on Fox's faltering juggernaut ""American Idol,"" he owns a piece of Fox singing competition ""The X Factor.""

Just below them on the list is Glenn Beck, another personality whose fortune comes from diversification, with his own Internet TV station, website, books and a radio program. He earned an estimated $90 million in the last year.

Rounding out the top 10 are Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Phil McGraw, Rush Limbaugh, Donald Trump, Ryan Seacrest, Ellen DeGeneres and ""Judge"" Judy Sheindlin.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/la-et-st-critics-notebook-cbs-20130806-story.html","CBS, Time Warner Cable dispute is unseemly","CBS, the TV network, and Time Warner, the cable company, are at loggerheads over money. The former, describing itself as ""the most-watched television network with the most popular content in the world,"" would like the latter to pay more than it currently does to carry its shows; the latter thinks the former has set the price too high.

The most visible, or rather invisible, result of the dispute is this: If you live in Los Angeles, New York or Dallas (or one of the other five markets with a station owned by the mothership CBS Corp.) and get your TV through Time Warner, you will have noticed that CBS is missing. (Independently owned stations affiliated with CBS are not affected.) In L.A., at least, Time Warner has tracked other content into the analog and digital channels the network usually occupies (with an occasional news crawl directing the disgruntled viewer to a Time Warner-friendly website).

Showtime, which it also owns, and where ""Dexter"" is in its last season, and the local KCAL, have also gone dark.

PHOTOS: Cable versus broadcast ratings

It all seems tiresome and unseemly to me: ""A plague on both their houses"" is the phrase that pops to mind.

Press releases to the contrary, neither party occupies any sort of moral high ground; they are just a couple of warring corporations, dinosaurs with their teeth in each other's necks, too evenly matched to do one another lasting harm but trampling the underbrush while they tangle.

Both parties are large and privileged entities that have been allowed to control a great portion of the cultural landscape without giving back all that much. (CBS does not own that spectrum it acts like it owns; you do.) Still, much of their dispute is taking place in public, in counteroffensive news releases and open letters, each side attempting to create sympathy for itself and to put pressure on its opponent.

Time Warner calls CBS' behavior ""abhorrent"" and ""beyond the pale,"" and offers to carry the network as a premium channel, like HBO. CBS, telling the world its ratings have been little affected by the blackout, calls the proposal ""a sham, a public relations vehicle designed to distract from the fact that Time Warner Cable is not negotiating in good faith.""

Though it is conceivable that they will never come to an agreement, it is more likely that they will, in some way allowing each side to be able to claim a measure of victory. Possibly your cable bill will be a little higher.

We tend to think of television — which we are born with and grow up watching and, unless we are very clever, can hardly avoid — as an inalienable human right, like liberty and cheap gas. Some will be angry at being so denied. But August is as slow as things ever get on television, and most viewers will find solutions according to their actual desire to find a solution.

September, when the new shows come on, will be a different story. But it's hard to believe that CBS would withhold them from the two cities most responsible for their existence.

New shows aside, this won't even be an issue for me until the return of ""The Good Wife,"" the only CBS show I actively follow (though I certainly respect others). Of course, I am also in a position, professionally, to see whatever I need to see — until this piece is published, anyway.

But we all have options.

You could, for one thing, switch to satellite television, which would not guarantee a future free from such disputes, but would get you through this one. You can keep up with ""Under the Dome"" on Amazon — CBS, while barring Time Warner customers from viewing episodes on its own site, provides an Amazon link — free, if you're a Prime subscriber, and for the price of a cup of coffee if you're not.

For ""Dexter,"" you could be patient and wait for the DVDs to arrive. For sports, you could go to a sports bar. You could buy an antenna for your television and watch CBS over the air, the way Grandma used to.

Or you could just watch that much less television and see how that feels.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/la-fi-mo-fhfa-mel-watt-demarco-fannie-freddie-20130501-story.html","Obama to nominate Democratic Rep. Mel Watt to head housing agency","WASHINGTON -- President Obama will nominate Democratic Rep. Mel Watt to head the federal housing agency that oversees taxpayer-owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a White House official said Wednesday.

Watt, an 11-term congressman from North Carolina, would replace Edward J. DeMarco as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Watt, a longtime member of the House Financial Services Committee, has been an advocate for affordable housing.

Obama is expected to announce the nomination Wednesday afternoon at the White House.

DeMarco, a career bureaucrat who has been the agency's acting director since 2009, has drawn the ire of Democrats and liberal activists for not allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce the principal on mortgages it backs to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.

But Republicans have praised DeMarco for acting in the best interest of taxpayers, who have pumped more than $187 billion into Fannie and Freddie to keep them afloat after the government seized them in 2008.

Quiz: How much do you know about mortgages?

Senate Republicans are likely to block Watt's nomination in order to keep DeMarco in the position.

In 2010, Obama nominated Joseph Smith, then North Carolina's top banking regulator, to replace DeMarco, but Senate Republicans prevented a confirmation vote.

On Wednesday, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), an influential voice on housing finance, criticized Watt's nomination.

""I could not be more disappointed in this nomination. This gives new meaning to the adage that the fox is guarding the hen house,” Corker said. “The debate around his nomination will illuminate for all Americans why Fannie and Freddie failed so miserably.”

Corker said that before any nominee is considered to replace DeMarco, the Obama administration should propose specific plans for shutting down Fannie and Freddie.

But some Democrats and housing advocates praised the nomination, in part because Watt would replace DeMarco.

""Congressman Watt is a thoughtful policymaker with a deep background in finance and a long record as a champion for working families,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). ""The Senate should confirm Congressman Watt soon so he can get to work stabilizing shaky housing markets and helping struggling homeowners.""

She said it was time to remove DeMarco.

""Under DeMarco’s leadership, the FHFA has refused repeatedly – often with cold indifference – to work with families struggling to save their homes,"" Warren said.

In March, California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris and attorneys general from eight other states publicly urged Obama to replace DeMarco with someone who would do more to help reduce foreclosures.

DeMarco has said reducing the amount of principal owed by some homeowners could end up costing taxpayers money and encourage more defaults. He has argued that he has ordered Fannie and Freddie to take several other steps to reduce foreclosures, particularly by modifying the terms of mortgages.

The government seized Fannie and Freddie in 2008 to keep them from going bankrupt. As of March 29, the companies have received a combined $187.5 billion in bailout money.

The overall tab is less because Fannie and Freddie have paid a total of $65 billion in required dividends back to the Treasury. And the finances of both companies have improved, with both recently reporting they were profitable in 2012 for the first time in six years.

Obama's proposed 2014 budget for the first time projected a net profit to taxpayers of $51 billion through 2023 on the investments in Fannie and Freddie.

There is wide agreement in Washington that the government needed to shut down Fannie and Freddie and replace their large role in the housing finance system. But Democrats and Republicans are at odds over how much of a role the government should have.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-0516-nate-silver-20130515-column.html","Nate Silver: In Hollywood, 'Nobody knows anything'","Predictability and the arts-and-entertainment world have an uneasy relationship. Predictability is a given — like the mouthfeel of a Big Mac — when it comes to, say, the punch lines on ""Two and a Half Men"" or the beats of your average romantic comedy. Predictability is a boon to Hollywood when it comes to the box-office might of ""Iron Man 3"" or other similarly surefire superhero movies. But the notion that you can engineer a hit by combining the right ingredients has led to an unfortunate predictability in the bland output of major movie studios and record labels, among others. Unpredictable members of the $100-million-plus-domestic-box-office club such as ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (romance among the mentally ill!) and ""Life of Pi"" (Indian boy on a boat with a tiger!) are exceptions in a business ruled by sequels, franchises and blowing-up-the-White-House formulas. Then again, if the movie industry were so predictable, Disney wouldn't have had to take a reported $200 million write-down on last year's sci-fi flop ""John Carter,"" and Warner Bros. might have made back its supposed $200million production budget on this spring's dud ""Jack the Giant Slayer."" So on one hand, the entertainment world has access to more information and technology than ever before. On the other, what screenwriter/author William Goldman (""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" ""Adventures in the Screen Trade"") said decades ago still applies: ""Nobody knows anything."" Since Nate Silver began crunching baseball numbers in Chicago before becoming the nation's most respected political stat-head, he has made an art out of making the previously unpredictable appear predictable. After graduating from the University of Chicago in 2000 with an economics degree, Silver, who is speaking Sunday at 1 p.m. at the Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership on his book, ""The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail — But Some Don't,"" came up with the influential baseball statistic predictor PECOTA, and his ""FiveThirtyEight"" political blog, now a part of The New York Times, has been uncanny in forecasting the past two presidential elections. The 35-year-old writer/analyst also has handicapped the past few Academy Awards races and has done … OK: He called four out of six winners in the top categories this year. In addition, he recently had a consulting gig with a cannot-be-named entertainment company that wanted to apply his predictive thinking to its output. Can his brand of analysis work where art meets commerce? We decided to pick his brain on this topic — as well as the notion of whether art itself can be predicted — in a recent phone conversation, with Silver speaking from New York City, where he now lives. The following is an edited transcript. Q: How much can statistical analysis apply to the entertainment world? A: I think probably more than is taking place. I did a consulting project a couple of years ago for a big Hollywood company. In that company, you had some people who were very data driven and very progressive in their attitudes and some people who said, ""This is art, you can't boil it down to science. We don't want to use math"" kind of thing. So really it ran the whole gamut between those two polarized views. At the same time, I think you have some of the same issues that you might have in a lot of industries, which is there's a tendency to think in the short term a lot. You have more and more films that are marketed toward your typically 22-year-old male audience, which is pretty likely to go out and see the films on opening weekend but may not give the film as much longevity. You have more and more sales made outside of the movie theater environment, and with social media, I think the buzz tends to matter a lot more, and films that are getting poor Twitter reaction, for instance, will have very, very sharp drop-off in their box office gross, not even from one week to the next but from the Friday night to the weekend even. So this environment is changing. Statistics don't provide all the answers; you have to measure the uncertainty in a problem. But if you're not doing the stuff at all, then sooner or later your competitors will, and you really put yourself at a disadvantage. Q: What are the statistics that people are paying too much attention to, and what are the ones that they're not paying enough attention to? A: There maybe still is a somewhat old-fashioned fixation on opening weekend numbers, where that might not be all that large a part of the revenue pie and might not be as predictive as it used to be. … One analogy I sometimes make is what happened to the sport of boxing, of all things, where when they started having more and more of their bouts on pay-per-view, (they) kind of milked the revenue cow while they could, and you didn't have people growing up with boxing as a sport in their lives anymore, and it really kind of harmed the long-term audience. Q: That's similar to the Blackhawks, who generated a lot more interest when more of their games became accessible on TV again.

A: Yeah, people are used to getting open access to things. For anyone in the media, this is a big challenge, where you have an audience that's used to having things on demand and not paying very much for them necessarily, which is obviously a threat to the industry in a lot of ways. But it also means you have to cater to it, and that means you have opportunities to distribute your product very, very cheaply, cut down on distribution costs and help build your brand. I really think the way things are now, differentiation is the key. People think, well, it's so easy to transmit information out there and distribute that it's a volume business. I think the reverse is true: that people have so much choice that they gravitate toward companies that are doing it well, and you'll have kind of a winner-take-all type environment in some fields. Q: Which could be seen as a pro-art argument. A: Yeah. The way I see it is, make the best film that you can, right? And then figure out how to market the hell out of it. Let your creatives be creative and do what they do best, and then find ways to reach your audience based on that. I think oftentimes there's kind of a co-mingling of different things, where you have studios who are trying to time minute by minute what the audience's reaction will be if you cut a scene in a different way, how that will change things. Those tactics I tend to be a little skeptical of. Q: That reminds me of those test-audience squiggles that CNN runs during presidential debates. I feel I'm getting a lot of data that's more distracting than relevant. A: One thing I kind of preach in the book is that in theory more data should always help you, though you might encounter kind of diminishing returns. In practice probably more data gives people more of an opportunity to get confused, more of an opportunity to cherry-pick the results they're looking at. Q: Studios make calculations along the lines of ""Bradley Cooper means X amount at the box office, and Mark Wahlberg means Y,"" but they don't necessarily calculate whether the movie will be any good. A: What's also difficult in the motion picture business is it's hard to separate out the marketing budget from the film's success, by which I mean if you take a mediocre product and you market the hell out of it and you give it a good time slot, it's going to do relatively well, although that's (changing). If you'd taken a different film and invested the same resources and production and marketing behind the other film, which might have been inherently a better product, then it would have done as well or better instead. So separating out the cause and the effect is often very challenging, especially when you have people who are in essence acting on their predictions of what will work or what won't ahead of time. You can have self-fulfilling prophesies or self-denying prophesies in other cases. Q: And people who will benefit if they can fulfill their prophesies. A: Why are egregiously terrible films put out? It's because (there are) a lot of people whose careers would be in jeopardy if those projects were killed, so it's hard to stop that inertia sometimes toward a bad project once the ball gets rolling. Q: Quentin Tarantino has talked about directors being like boxers and having peak periods before they go downhill. Bands are like this too; many put out a certain number of good albums before they lose it. Shouldn't there be a way to calculate which filmmakers or musicians will continue to put out worthy material? A: You could look at Pitchfork (reviews) and how they evolve over time, or album sales, or something. But people who are in the arts, once they kind of achieve success, then it can be a tricky thing. You don't become as hungry anymore. Look, there are a lot more people who have one or maybe two great ideas and really do market themselves well — and by ideas I mean that very liberally in terms of a sound or a film or anything else. But it's a lot easier to have one great idea than be someone who has the aptitude to consistently be a genius. I have become a foodie of sorts, but even restaurants have, like, a sweet spot that sometimes lasts for only a year or two, when the chef is really invested in it — and when that chef becomes well-known and famous and wants to scale up and opens another venture and the concept becomes kind of played out and it might become dumbed down, you see a decline in quality there. I think part of the problem, too, is basically in all of the arts — and I even encounter this a little bit myself in terms of what I do — there's always a demand in kind of a capitalist system to grow, let's grow, let's grow, and a lot of things when it comes to creativity are really hard to scale up. Q: In your Oscar predictions, you had Christoph Waltz (who won best supporting actor for ""Django Unchained"") coming in third and Steven Spielberg (""Lincoln"") ahead of Ang Lee (best director winner for ""Life of Pi""). A: Yeah, you talk to people who are getting tired of Spielberg now, but that was such a weird category this year because the nominations were all screwed up (with Ben Affleck not getting nominated for best picture winner ""Argo""). Q: This was yet another illustration of William Goldman's ""Nobody knows anything.""","2013-05-15 15:43:00","0","41.0","24.0","0.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","56.0","21.0","0.0","88.0","4.0","15.0","0","1839","68.35","64.84","41.34","54.43","25.19","18.54","87.17","54.05","12.23","5.11","1.14","0.22","2.18","0.49","1.09","7.12","8.70","13.27","9.84","5.27","7.29","1.14","15.55","5.06","3.37","2.83","1.41","3.26","4.46","2.94","1.41","0.22","0.38","0.11","7.72","0.05","0.00","0.00","0.76","13.54","2.61","2.18","1.09","4.46","0.92","3.86","1.69","0.76","0.54","0.33","0.98","0.22","0.33","0.05","0.33","6.47","0.92","2.07","2.72","2.39","0.54","2.61","10.98","2.39","13.65","1.52","7.07","5.11","4.46","2.77","0.27","1.41","0.38","0.11","0.76","0.16","0.05","0.22","0.33","0.00","17.78","3.70","4.84","1.25","0.11","0.33","0.11","1.90","1.96","2.12","1.20","0.27","8183","7.59","26.6056338028169","2568","1823","72","62.72","12.4","10.8","10.1","13.2","312","13.875","18.96585847504114","734","23.25","44","0.52","0","80","22","188","0","212","117","18","3","32","285","119","1","104","2","0","102","23","115","5","2","16","49","0","78","36","41","32","82","62","17","21","1","19"
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-mandela-long-walk-20131129-story.html","Review: Nelson Mandela's involving 'Long Walk to Freedom'","Katniss Everdeen, it turns out, is not the only person catching fire this fall. She's matched flame for flame by Nelson Mandela and his wife, Winnie, who burn with formidable fury in the sturdy biopic ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.""

It is the incendiary work of British actors Idris Elba and Naomie Harris as the couple in question that elevates our involvement in this authorized film version of Nelson Mandela's autobiography. That, and the astonishing course of Mandela's life.

For though it's a story we've heard so often that we perhaps take it for granted, seeing all the events of this remarkable journey laid out for us in a two-hour and 21-minute feature underlines its not-to-be-believed qualities.

PHOTOS: Movie Sneaks 2013

It's not just the trajectory that took Mandela from 27 years in prison — most of them in a tiny cell on an isolated island he was never expected to leave alive — to the presidency of South Africa and becoming one of the respected statesmen in the world that makes this story so dramatic. It's the remarkable psychological journey that went along with it.

As detailed in William Nicholson's solid screenplay, Mandela changed several times over. He went first from being concerned only with being a successful lawyer to the leader of an ambitious political party. Then he embraced violence as necessary to achieving political aims before renouncing violence and making it stick. That is a long walk indeed.

Making this passage even more intriguing is that it was made at great personal cost, especially in terms of marriage and family. Nelson and Winnie went from ecstatic soul mates to really not speaking the same language. One of the most poignant lines in Nicholson's script has Mandela saying, referring to the actions of the country's apartheid government against him, ""What they did to her was their only victory.""

Directed by Britain's Justin Chadwick, who had extensive TV experience before his breakout features ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and ""The First Grader"" (also starring Harris), ""Mandela"" does fall into the illustrated history style of filmmaking. That means a good-looking film with detailed re-creations (Lol Crawley was the cinematographer), including vintage township locations and significant incidents such as 1960's Sharpeville Massacre. It also means that the film's tone is inevitably celebratory — but given the trajectory of this man's story, how could it be otherwise?

PHOTOS: Behind the scenes of movies and TV

South African producer Anant Singh tried to make this film for so long that almost every black actor you can name was considered for the role, but it's hard to imagine any of them doing a better job than Elba.

Beyond memorable as ""The Wire's"" cool, calculating Stringer Bell, Elba just about defines charisma in a performance that capitalizes on the actor's innate dignity and strength. When he speaks, his words have the same kind of power we've heard from Mandela himself.

After a brief, obligatory section on his childhood, ""Mandela"" takes us to 1942 Johannesburg, where Nelson is a successful lawyer, natty in three-piece suits and a favorite with women. He is aware of being a second-class citizen in his own country but thinks success will erase those barriers.

Radicalized by events, Mandela joins the African National Congress and comes to understand that in unity there is strength. The time he gives to the movement, plus his frequent womanizing, destroy his first marriage to the God -fearing Evelyn Mase (Terry Pheto), which leaves him single when he meets Winnie.

It is not easy holding the screen with Elba's Mandela, but Harris' strong, confident Winnie does exactly that, even in the early days of their relationship. ""I heard you have a lot of girlfriends,"" she tells him provocatively. ""I'm different.""

Things change for the Mandelas after the Sharpeville Massacre, a key manifestation of out-of-control government violence. Deciding that nonviolence is over, Mandela goes underground, participates in bombings of power stations and is finally captured, put on trial and sentenced to life without parole on Robben Island.

Though its attempts to break Nelson's spirit prove futile, the state has better luck with its systematic abuse of Winnie, and some of ""Mandela's"" best sequences come, courtesy of Harris' fine performance, in showing how this tortured woman came to be consumed by justifiable anger and what that led to.

Mandela is over 70 when he finally gains his freedom, and though Elba is imprisoned a bit by his aging makeup, the film is good at detailing what was perhaps his greatest feat, using his political skills, convictions and strength of personality to keep the country from splitting into violent factions. This may be a familiar story, but it is one worth experiencing again and again.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-the-purge-ethan-hawke-box-office-theaters-20130610-story.html","'The Purge' and the low-budget genre revolution","Back in 2010, shortly after Paramount Pictures’ ""Paranormal Activity"" became a mega-hit on a micro-budget, executives at the studio decided to launch a label dedicated to making more movies of this kind.



InSurge, as it was known, would produce films for less than a million bucks -- much less, as the mil was earmarked for no fewer than 10 movies -- going high on concept and short on dough (and costly big stars).



Such ambitions proved more attractive in theory than in practice. The label has yielded few movies, though those it has produced (for example, 2012’s horror flick “The Devil Inside”) have been hits.

PHOTOS: Billion-dollar movie club

But unlike most Hollywood flavors of the moment, the notion has turned out to have some staying power. Low-budget horror under studio auspices seems to work more often than not. This past weekend we saw the latest, and perhaps most shocking, example. “The Purge,” a futuristic horror thriller starring Ethan Hawke that was released by Universal Pictures, cost just $3 million to make. But its $36.4 million easily outpaced far starrier and better-funded rivals, most notably the Owen Wilson-Vince Vaughn extravaganza “The Internship,” which had the cooperation of Google and seemed to run an ad in every third postseason TV sports minute.



As with many trends, some of the more successful executions come largely from one company: Jason Blum’s Blumhouse, who is behind the ""Paranormal"" franchise, its spiritual heir ""Insidious"" and now ""Purge"" (more from him shortly). So it would be unfair to say that low-budget genre has swept Hollywood. Still, the fact that another studio has gotten in on the action is notable. Low-budget horror is a model that Lionsgate helped pioneer and that Paramount took to a new level and which has now spread around town to competitors like Universal, which has a first-look deal with Blumhouse.

PHOTOS: Movies Sneaks 2013

Within Hollywood circles, much is made of the fact that these movies come cheap. They do (though not as cheap as they sound once marketing costs are factored in). But that's not primarily why they work. Moviegoers, generally, don’t care how much a film costs.

Or do they?

In the cyclical world of Hollywood, sometimes the best thinking goes against the grain. And the grain in recent years has been to make big spectacles. Many of them, of course, become big hits. But it's also no surprise that there would be a backlash, or least that commercial audiences, peppered as they are with Hollywood sound-and-light shows, might like something with a hand-made quality once in a while too. (Of course, it still helps to make a satisfying movie. “The Purge” garnered a weak C CinemaScore, which will make for a tougher climb next weekend.)

It’s been nearly 15 years since “The Blair Witch Project” became the first of the modern hand-made genre phenomena. We’re a lot savvier about low-budget horror movies and found footage that often accompanies them. But the lessons of ""Blair Witch"" haven't gone anywhere: In this outsized era, movies that feel small just keep resonating.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-47-ronin-review-keanu-reeves-20131225-story.html","Review: '47 Ronin' doesn't quite cut it as a samurai fantasy","There's the kind of movie that comes riding into theaters on such a prolonged wave of bad buzz — changed release dates, backstage whispers of production troubles and a swelling budget — that the film itself starts to seem beside the point, something to just get out of the way. That's the case with ""47 Ronin,"" an overlong, underwhelming movie now hitting theaters that certainly wasn't worth the wait.

The story opens with a stentorian voice-over announcing that ancient feudal Japan, as history buffs will no doubt be happy to learn, was a time of witchcraft and demons. Kai (Keanu Reeves) — referred to throughout the film as a ""half-breed,"" though it is somewhat unclear if that is half-Anglo or half-demon — lives in exile in the woods, protected by the benevolent Lord Asano.

After Asano is forced to commit seppuku by the ruling shogun following an incident in which he was bewitched, his faithful samurai, led by Oishi, are cast adrift as masterless Ronin. The evil Lord Kira has eyes on Asano's daughter, Mika, and eventually Kai, Oishi and the Ronin attempt to save Mika and avenge Asano's death.

PHOTOS: Best films of 2013 | Kenneth Turan

The ad campaign for the film is focused on Reeves, understandably, so one could be forgiven for spending time during the film wondering ""Where's Keanu?"" and ""Who are all these other people?"" Though Reeves does have a key role, the storytelling and screen time is also very much focused on such performers as Hiroyuki Sanada as Oishi, Tadanobu Asano as Kira, Kô Shibasaki as Mika and Rinko Kikuchi as a treacherous witch. Those expecting all Keanu all the time will be left feeling off-balance.

The film comes at something of a transitional moment in Reeves' career, as he has been on a run of unexpected, seemingly passion-driven projects such as producing the engaging documentary ""Side By Side,"" about shooting on film versus digital moviemaking, as well as his directing debut with ""Man of Tai Chi."" That film, in which Reeves played the villainous leader of an underground fighting circuit, pulsed with the enthusiasm of a martial arts film fan.

""47 Ronin,"" which is directed by Carl Rinsch, has no such feelings behind it. For a film whose story is so steeped in honor, there is something dutiful but uninvolved about it, respectful without really understanding the deeper traditions — a student faking it through a quiz. Though based on history, the movie is hung up on creating a fantasy-world version of Japanese feudal life. (Japanese filmmaker Takashi Miike's recent ""Hara-Kiri"" and ""13 Assassins"" both created more vibrant, lived-in variations on similar themes.)

PHOTOS: Best films of 2013 | Betsy Sharkey

Rinsch, making his feature debut, shows the shortcoming of someone coming from the image-based world of commercials and advertising. There are moments of genuine beauty and a few terrifically eye-popping effects, but no feel yet for storytelling.

The film becomes something like the punch line to an old ""screw in a light bulb"" joke: What does it take to make a samurai fantasy film? More than ""47 Ronin.""

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0115-last-stand-20130117-story.html","'The Last Stand' a (mostly) welcome return for Arnold Schwarzenegger ✭✭ 1/2","The question with ""The Last Stand,"" Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen (not counting ""The Expendables 2"") after being the governor of California and at the heart of a messy marital scandal, is this: Does he pick up where he left off as an action hero or is it an embarrassment, hurtling him down the road to cinematic obsolescence?

The answer falls somewhere squarely in the middle. For sure, ""The Last Stand"" is no ""Terminator"" but it is a fun, if predictable, action-thriller that has no problem gently reminding you how old he is — 66 — while simultaneously having him give the world's most dangerous drug-cartel kingpin a brain-banging beat-down.

Schwarzenegger is Sheriff Ray Owens, who presides over his small, sun-baked Arizona border town like a caring dad. So when it seems most of the city takes off for a high school football away game, Owens is expecting a quiet weekend, leaving what little there is to do to his well-meaning but inexperienced deputies: work-shy Mike Figuerola (Luis Guzman); newbie Jerry Bailey (Zach Gilford, ""Friday Night Lights""); and no-nonsense Sarah Torrance (Jaimie Alexander).

Little does he know that, miles away in Las Vegas, Mexican gangster Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) has made a daring, highly choreographed escape from federal custody. He is on the lam in a modified Corvette ZR1, reaching speeds of up to nearly 200 mph as he races toward the border. Cortez, with the help of some his cronies, plans to smuggle himself back into Mexico over a secret bridge his associates have been constructing near Owens' town.

Angry federal agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker), who seems to have had a long obsession with capturing the slippery Cortez, calls to warn Owens that the dangerous felon is headed his way. So it's up to Owens and his ragtag, ad hoc crew — which also includes well-armed town eccentric and comedic relief Lewis Dinkum (Johnny Knoxville) and ne'er-do-well Frank Martinez (Rodrigo Santoro), the only occupant in the town's tiny jail — to keep Cortez from making his escape to Mexican soil.

South Korean director Jee-woon Kim (""The Good, The Bad, the Weird""; ""I Saw the Devil""), working from a script by Andrew Knauer, Jeffrey Nachmanoff and George Nolfi, keeps things moving quickly in his Hollywood debut. Cortez's breakout on the streets of Vegas at the film's start and a car chase through a cornfield near the end show off a keen visual eye.

That helps distract viewers from the story's outbursts of improbability. (No one even suspects that a large bridge, not hidden by foliage and easily seen from the air, is being built by a criminal gang near their town? Really?)

Certainly, Schwarzenegger moves a bit slower than he used to. There are a couple of moments when you almost hear the bones creaking. But he can still deliver the hurt to some bad guys.

That's the main thing anyone going to see this film cares about. With ""Terminator 5"" announced and a fleet of other Schwarzenegger movies in the pipeline, those afraid ""The Last Stand"" indeed would be Arnold's last stand can breathe a sigh of relief.

He'll be back.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0129-stand-up-guys-20130131-column.html","'Stand Up Guys' a criminal waste of Walken, Pacino, Arkin ★","A writer must eat, which is why most playwrights eventually try their hands at screenwriting. ""Stand Up Guys,"" starring Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin, comes from the stage-trained Noah Haidle, whose story premise sounds like a sure (if derivative) thing for a trio of well-worn, well-liked mugs.

We know these mugs well enough to call them by their first names. After a 28-year prison sentence, small-time hoodlum Val, played by Al, and Al's nutty hair, is greeted at the gates by old friend Doc, played by Christopher and his nutty hair. Doc's been hired, under threat of execution, to kill his pal Val at the behest of a venal mobster.

But first, some would-be fun. Val takes a fistful of Viagra, which lands him in the ER. The lads pay a visit to their former getaway driver, Hirsch, played by Alan. Misadventures, sex with sweet Russian hookers, nostalgic sentiment for the trio's glory days, and retribution upon the hides and groins of a gang of rapists fill out the dance card.

As written by Haidle, and directed in an eerie, static no-man's-land atmosphere of urban desolation by Fisher Stevens, ""Stand Up Guys"" settles for criminally little. Arkin in particular can barely hide his lack of enthusiasm for the material. Some of the looks he shoots his co-stars appear to contain a secret code of some kind, deciphered as: 'Well, at least I'm in 'Argo.'""

The gents are meant to be gallants as well as courtly, movie-type thugs with a sense of honor. Addison Timlin as a charming coffee shop waitress and Julianna Margulies as Hirsch's daughter do what they can to humanize an almost inhumanly formulaic enterprise. But this is strictly a boys night out, and rather than flying by, it feels like three months in the movie slammer.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0724-wolverine-20130725-column.html","'Wolverine' is mutant who plays to balconies ★★★","Every time Hugh Jackman's up there on screen, dining out on the rage stew that is the Wolverine, I think back to his Tony Award-winning performance as entertainer Peter Allen in ""The Boy From Oz."" It was a terrible musical but a wonderful Broadway turn, flamboyant exuberance personified. Each strand of this performer's DNA is about giving the audience a great time. He's a strutter, and in ""The Wolverine,"" Jackman's sixth and most dominant appearance as the Marvel Comics character, the immortal mutton-chopped loner looks as if he has been spending all his time up in the Canadian wilderness with a personal trainer, waiting for his close-up.

Logan/Wolverine is not the only mutant in ""The Wolverine"" — Svetlana Khodchenkova slinks around as Viper, with her flicking tongue of death — but the film is largely quasi-human, and it burrows into its own tunnel, a long way from the previous ""X-Men"" pictures, which always risk overcrowding.

This time Logan returns to Japan at the behest of a mysterious red-haired woman (Rila Fukushima). Decades earlier, Logan survived the atomic bombing of Nagasaki while saving the life of Japanese soldier Shingen Yashida (played by Hiroyuki Sanada). The soldier became a powerful and corrupt industrialist. On his deathbed, the dying man is looking to his old savior for one last favor. But the Japanese gangsters known as yakuza intrude, and Logan has sworn to protect Yashida's daughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), and there's your plot, distilled from the four-part 1982 Marvel saga written by Chris Claremont and penciled by Frank Miller.

The screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie concocted the adaptation of ""The Wolverine"" that got this project going. Rewrites ensued by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank; James Mangold took it before the cameras in Australia and Japan. The results are quite good — the same old angst and grandiosity writ smaller than usual, and better for it.

The X-Men crew's intersections with real-life wartime horrors have long been signposts of the serious aspirations of the material. Watching ""The Wolverine,"" one may resist the leveling and seared flesh of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki as fodder for another superhero picture. But Mangold handles it well: ""The Wolverine"" keeps its characters front and center, and only near the end does it turn into a routine, grinding action movie. Along the way there's a swell battle atop a speeding bullet train, the film's highlight. Also we get the occasional lyric interlude between Logan and the dream/memory of the woman he loved and lost (Famke Janssen), the source of all his undying grief.

The last couple of Wolverine movies provided their share of undying grief as well, the wrong kind, the mediocre movie kind. ""The Wolverine"" won't change anybody's mind about the character, or about what Jackman can do with it. It's simply a more focused scenario than usual, full of violence done up with a little more coherence and visceral impact than usual. Mangold doesn't bring tons of personality to ""The Wolverine,"" but he does bring a reasonable and honorable sense of craft, trading in iconography borrowed from Westerns and Easterns and all sorts of movies. Marco Beltrami's musical score likewise carries echoes of previous movie themes, but it's evocative and lower-keyed than the usual Marvel bash. Who needs thundering music when you have Jackman glowering and raging and doing everything except tap dancing with those retractable claws?

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0326-from-up-on-poppy-hill-20130328-column.html","Goro Miyazaki follows in his father's path in 'Poppy Hill' ★★★★","Is any animated feature produced by the Japanese treasure known as Studio Ghibli, responsible for ""Spirited Away,"" ""Ponyo"" and others, capable of capturing a mass American audience's attention? Good question, especially in a box-office cycle dominated by ""The Croods."" So let's get it out of the way. The answer is, maybe not. There. Now we can talk about ""From Up on Poppy Hill,"" one of the shimmering highlights of the year.

Like ""Ponyo"" and last year's ""The Secret World of Arrietty,"" ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" has arrived here in a slightly revised English-language edition. The voices are provided by a cast including Gillian Anderson, Aubrey Plaza, Jamie Lee Curtis and, more central to the narrative, Sarah Bolger and Anton Yelchin. Hayao Miyazaki adapted the script from the 1980 manga, or graphic novel. Miyazaki's son, Goro, directed ""Poppy Hill,"" and in the story's realistic setting (Yokohama, 1963) and absence of supernatural elements, it's a marked departure for the studio. And yet the glide and flow of the story feel not quite of this world.

The heroine, Umi, lives in and manages a boardinghouse overlooking the harbor. Her mother is away studying in the U.S.; her father was a casualty of the Korean war, lost at sea. Each day Umi raises flags wishing seafarers safe passage. A boy at her school, Shun, writes a poem for the school paper about her. The ragtag all-male newspaper staff resides in joyously messy surroundings in a dilapidated but marvelous building, also housing the archaeology club and the philosophy club and a few others, known as the Latin Quarter.

It's scheduled for demolition, and one aspect of ""Poppy Hill"" deals with how Umi and Shun mount a save-the-dump-we-love campaign among their fellow students, while they gradually become friends, then innocently smitten, and then ... well, then, the girl and the boy learn that they may be half-siblings. (One of them reacts: ""It's like a cheap melodrama!"") And Shun, wrestling discreetly with his tangled feelings, says there is only one way to combat their heartache: ""I guess we stop feeling how we feel.""

The way this potentially tragic plot development is handled, you know ""Poppy Hill"" has the surest of touches. Screenwriter Miyazaki acknowledged this tricky revelation in his initial proposal, reassuring his future audience that ""there won't be any shinju (double suicide) pacts."" There's something wonderful and sane in the way ""Poppy Hill"" allows Umi and Shun their mixed-up feelings for each other; the film, like its key characters, is at once childlike and grown-up. There's a similar paradox at work in the visual design's blend of modernity — Tokyo's imminent hosting of the 1964 Olympics sets the tone — and the timeless appeal of tugboats chugging on the water, and flags flapping in the breeze.

Like some of the nuttier Shakespeare romances, ""Poppy Hill"" revels in coincidence, dawning sexuality and an ardent belief in the power of goodness. It's pure of heart, in other words. It's also extremely winning in its depiction of a student population discovering its collective freedom. The Miyazakis' picture, which makes lovely use of the chart-topping early '60s hit ""I Shall Walk Looking Up"" (known in the U.S. as ""Sukiyaki""), takes everything it should take seriously. It does so with a light touch — another paradox, and another reason I liked it even better than the last couple of formidable Studio Ghibli efforts. Gary Rydstrom oversaw the English-language version of ""Poppy Hill,"" with evident care and love. Your kids may well fall in love with it, if you help them find it.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0508-peeples-20130509-story.html","'Peeples' takes the Fockers' formula for an African-American spin ★★ 1/2","""Peeples"" is an African-American ""Meet the Parents"" that slips funnyman Craig Robinson into the Ben Stiller role. Casting the musically minded Robinson in this formula comedy about screwing up your first encounter with your potential in-laws is like replacing Stiller's Greg Focker with Jack Black.

Yeah, that might work. And here, formulaic or not, it's funny.

Robinson plays Wade, an entertainer for kids who sings about learning to ""use your words"" and not mess your pants. How he ended up with stunning United Nations lawyer Grace (Kerry Washington) takes a bit of imagination.

Until you meet her parents. Not that she's anxious to let Wade meet ""the Chocolate Kennedys."" She does her family weekends in Sag Harbor without her live-in lover.

But Wade, egged on by his ""doll doctor"" brother (Malcolm Barrett, hilarious) decides to follow her to the Hamptons and surprise her and her folks with a proposal.

The moment he meets her father, ""The Judge,"" he realizes the folly of his plan. Judge Virgil Peeples is played by the criminally underemployed comic David Alan Grier. His patriarch is a prickly martinet who so intimidates his family of overachievers that they all lie to him rather than upset his notion of family.

Daphne, his wife (S. Epatha Merkerson in a rare comic turn), is a retired, vampy soul-singer with substance abuse issues. Young son Simon (Tyler James Williams of ""Everybody Hates Chris"") is a genius and a social misfit who acts out by stealing.

Daughter Gloria (Kali Hawk) is a TV reporter who won't tell Dad she's in love with her camerawoman (Kimrie Lewis-Davis). And Dad has his own secrets, which Wade stumbles into as he blunders his through a domestic situation fraught with peril.

Robinson (""The Office,"" ""Hot Tub Time Machine"") is in his ease, here, surrounded by funny people so that he doesn't have to carry the movie. But in reacting to every new discovery about the Peeples, and about his girlfriend's secret past, he's a stitch.

She's dated a lot of rich, older men in Sag Harbor. How'd he find out? At the market.

""I met Uncle Ben and Bojangles up in here. Who else did you date? George Washington Carver? W.E.B. DuBois?""

Writer-director Tina Gordon Chism earned her directing debut with pretty good scripts for ""Drumline"" and ""ATL."" She packs this one with amusing characters in awkward, if obvious, situations and makes the most of them. Tyler Perry produced ""Peeples,"" and he could take notes on how to make a lowdown, broad farce that's never too low or too broad.

The laughs follow an overly familiar path, but it's great to see Grier, one of the bright lights of the seminal TV sketch comedy ""In Living Color,"" button down this judge and find ways to break formula and make him hilarious.

And if these Peeples don't make Robinson a comic leading man, they at least predict a comic franchise that Perry can produce without having to don a dress.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0618--monsters-u-20130620-story.html","Director Dan Scanlon's 'Monster' career move","What's a guy gotta do to get a shot at directing his first Pixar film? In Dan Scanlon's case, he may have had to kill somebody.

Granted, that somebody was fictional — and a '70s children's TV host, to boot. But thanks in part to whacking a live-action character, Scanlon got his first crack at heading up, ironically, an animated movie.

The Pixar film that proved his reward is ""Monsters University,"" the first prequel in the Oscar-larded history of the studio that brought moviegoers the beloved hit ""Monsters Inc."" a dozen years ago. Scanlon, a master of story, has worked on Pixar's ""Cars"" and ""Brave"" and the short ""Mater and the Ghostlight."" But he thinks it was his low-budget, self-written/directed/starring live-action 2009 mockumentary, ""Tracy,"" that helped him get the ""Monsters University"" gig. Directing the film marks a personal career leap and, as a happy coincidence, it opens June 21, his 37th birthday.

""Making 'Tracy' on my own may have made a difference — for me and them,"" Scanlon says by phone from Oakland, not far from Pixar's headquarters in Emeryville, Calif. ""It's not the same as an animated story, but it is an attempt to tell a feature-length story with heart and humor.""

(To round out his cast for the wry, Christopher Guest-esque ""Tracy"" — which centers on plumbing the mystery surrounding a wacky TV host's death — Scanlon recruited such Pixar pals as Ronnie del Carmen and ""Brave"" director Mark Andrews. And the film is dedicated to late Pixar legend Joe Ranft, the mentor who taught Scanlon so much about story.)

Having a pitch-perfect ear for such heart and humor was crucial to making ""Monsters University,"" in which the odd couple of scaremongers — small, mouthy Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) and hulking, mellow Sulley (John Goodman) — are returned to college, back when their differing styles made them rivals. The movie's fresh energy comes from plugging into the formation of that prickly-before-fuzzy friendship.

""John and Billy had to reinvent these characters while keeping them familiar. Mike is still funny and confident, but he's also more idealistic and naive and passionate than what we saw before,"" Scanlon says of his little cyclops-eyed live-wire.

""Sulley is the same way: He's so lovable in most instances, but we wanted to give John somewhere to go, so we made Sulley cocky.""

Scanlon says they even tried to center the story on Sulley. But thanks to the director's well-trained instinct, he could tell that wasn't what best served this monster origin story.

""Mike's story was the heart of the movie,"" Scanlon says. ""No matter what we did with Sulley's narrative, it didn't hold a candle to Mike's.

""We like that in telling Mike's underdog story, it's helpful to know that his dream is not going to work out. He had to work hard for everything.""

And when it came time for Mike and Sulley to be given new life — springing from page to pixel — Crystal (65) and Goodman (60) brought the vocal energy of considerably younger men, Scanlon says.

""Whenever we get them together, they play off of each other,"" says the Ohio-bred Scanlon, noting that they often performed together in the sound studio — hardly standard practice for animation. ""They make each other better. The emotional scenes are better. Recording together doesn't work with every actor, but these guys have a charisma and a chemistry. ... It was a great experience the days they were together.""

Besides his returning actors, Scanlon could also rely on the famed Pixar brain trust — such animation greats as John Lasseter, Andrew Staunton, Brad Bird and Pete Docter — to help detect creative issues during the film's three-year process. Then again, they'd already taught him so much.

""I spent so much with the brain trust in other films, I didn't see a barrier to break through"" as a director, he says. ""I saw it as a moment of trust.

""And when it came time to get help, I saw how their gut instinct is always right. It's not always the right solution, but they're right when pointing out the problem.""

So after all those years working in the story department, what was the best part of helming a Pixar project?

""As director, I had a front-row seat to see how these movies are actually put together.""

Scanlon sounds fully and utterly enthused — like a man who, on his birthday, looks forward to letting the world unwrap his gift.","2013-06-20 11:18:00","0","25.0","2.0","0.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","42.0","21.0","0.0","78.0","4.0","14.0","0","750","77.91","76.02","12.62","84.54","19.23","19.07","77.87","45.33","11.47","6.00","0.93","0.80","0.00","2.67","1.60","5.33","8.00","12.13","6.00","4.00","7.20","1.20","13.87","5.20","2.93","2.13","1.20","1.60","4.80","4.00","0.67","0.00","0.27","0.13","11.47","0.00","0.67","0.00","3.20","8.00","0.53","1.47","0.93","1.33","1.07","2.93","3.20","1.20","1.60","0.40","2.00","1.33","0.53","0.13","0.00","8.00","2.00","2.53","2.53","1.87","0.53","4.93","8.00","0.80","13.33","1.60","6.53","5.33","3.47","2.40","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.40","0.40","0.13","0.13","0.00","0.13","0.00","25.60","5.33","6.67","0.13","0.00","0.27","0.00","2.13","5.87","3.60","1.33","0.27","3394","7.81","20.36842105263158","1041","744","39","69.01","10.3","8.4","11.02","11.1","152","6.428571428571429","17.81204301075269","393","19.18","7","0.45","0","30","6","71","1","68","67","2","3","4","132","82","0","21","1","0","43","14","38","1","0","5","25","0","28","38","22","11","15","28","6","6","0","6"
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ott-0118-brandy-20130117-story.html","Another chance for Brandy","It's OK if you call it a comeback: Until recently, Brandy Norwood, teen R&B sensation and former star of the beloved '90s sitcom ""Moesha,"" had been having a rough couple of years. There was the death of her mentor Whitney Houston, a fatal car accident (Norwood's car struck another on a Los Angeles freeway; the driver died), a painful breakup and album sales that consistently disappointed.

But Brandy's new album, ""Two Eleven,"" debuted in the Billboard top five, she got engaged over the holidays to record industry executive Ryan Press and she appears in both the upcoming Tyler Perry film ""Temptation"" and the BET show ""The Game.""

In a recent phone interview, the singer, 33, who plays the Venue at Horseshoe Casino on Saturday night in a show to benefit the anti-violence group Project HOOD, discussed her engagement, her struggle with depression and her semisecret life as rapper Bran'Nu, who appeared on a '09 Timbaland disc and was never really heard from again. Here is an edited transcript of the conversation.

Q: Congratulations on your engagement. Was it a surprise?

A: Oh, yeah. You have your moments where you think it's going to happen, but the imagination does the real moment no justice. Even if you're expecting it, you're still surprised.

Q: Between this and the album doing well — I don't want to call it a comeback, but are you calling it a comeback?

A: I don't feel disrespected if you call it a comeback. I know I've been gone for a while. I was trying to get myself together and figure my way. Now I'm in a place where I feel connected to my fan base again and really feeling these amazing emotions of doing what I was born to do and doing it full time. It's a great feeling.

I do call it a comeback, I'm gonna be honest with you. … When you feel like you don't have your purpose intact, you can get off balance. But it wasn't about proving myself to one particular person, it was about proving it to me. Once you prove it to yourself, proving it to everyone else is easy.

Q: What made you doubt yourself?

A: I think different struggles in your life, not knowing how to deal with certain things that have happened in my life. Painful moments in your life can cause you to go into a state of depression where you don't believe that you deserve anything good in your life.

You forget what you were created for. I was not only created to sing and share but also to be a mom and a friend and a daughter.

All these people in your life, to have (lost) that connection with everyone around me, including my fans, it was tough. But after a while I just got tired of feeling like that.

Q: Did you feel as if this album was your last chance?

A: I did. What you believe is what you manifest, so it's kind of dangerous to believe something like that. But for me it was a good belief, because I was able to push myself to give 150 million percent. … When you feel like these are the last songs you're gonna sing, you want to make them the best songs you've ever sung.

Q: You had talked about possibly rapping on this album. Did you think the better of it?

A: It seems like I'm the only one who believes in my rap (abilities). I'm not as confident in my sharing that side of me with everybody. I tried it; people responded the way they responded. I don't think people really want to hear me rap. They just want to hear me sing.

Q: Do you feel like people expect you to be nice, polite Brandy who was on ""Moesha""? How much can you break out of that box?

A: I think I'm already out of the box of being this perfect little angel. I mean, if you Google me, there's a whole bunch of stuff that comes up.

Q: Did you get a lot of push-back from fans about your collaboration with Chris Brown on the ""Two Eleven"" hit ""Put It Down""?

A: People pretty much accept it, what we did. When something is good, of course, people have to have their opinions about it and judgments, but they start to accept it. …

There's things we've all done that we haven't been proud of, or things that if we could turn back the hands of time, we would probably do a little bit different. I'm in no position to judge anyone, and neither is anybody else. … Even though a person has a past or whatever, that shouldn't hinder you from working with people that can make a great song. That's just silly. Especially when the person is really trying to change and get better.

Q: ""Two Eleven"" refers to both your birthday and the day Whitney Houston died. What do you think of when you think of her now?

A: I definitely think of good times. I think of things she's taught me, shared with me. She was a phenomenal lady that shared so much of her life, her talent and her time. She went through her own struggles and trying to pull out of that. There's so many layers, so much inspiration to her life, so much people can learn from her. … She is the bar, you know? There will never be another.

Q: Who comes close to her these days?

A: I don't think anyone comes close to Whitney. That's a disrespectful thought. I'm not saying you're being (disrespectful), I'm saying for me (to say it). …

Artists like Frank Ocean or Bruno Mars, they don't come around every day. … That's the type of artist that Whitney was. But to compare her voice? I can't do that. I would have to put myself on a timeout if I did that.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-paul-mccartney-20131014-story.html","Review: Paul McCartney sounds revitalized in 'New'","Great, just what the world needs: more enthusiasm for something Beatles-related.

It's a little tiresome, after all, this relentless fawning. Seems like every fiscal quarter something else pops up: an anniversary, reissue, Cirque du Soleil production, documentary, or surprising new solo album.

Can't we give it a rest and focus on, say, the Kinks, James Brown or Pulp for a while?

PHOTOS: The Early Beatles Collection

Not while a Beatle's still making records as consistent and well-crafted as ""New."" With peaks as high as any music he's done this century and nary a valley as low as ""Silly Love Songs,"" ""Let 'Em In,"" ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" or his oft-treacly last record of standards, ""Kisses on the Bottom,"" Paul McCartney's latest studio album is pretty damned good — damn it.

Thirteen songs (a dozen plus a hidden track) that move from hard rock to gentle balladry to new wave-inflected pop-rock, McCartney at age 71 balances past and present, memory and the future, distortion and clarity, notions of new and old, on ""New.""

Tinged with nostalgia, the songwriter has made a record that sounds contemporary but not desperately so, one that suggests his work with the Beatles but not reductively so. That's in large part because of his choice of producers: Paul Epworth (Adele), Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse), Ethan Johns (Laura Marling, Ray LaMontagne) and Giles Martin (Beatles ""Love"" remix) bring four sets of young ears and highlight McCartney's many moods.

At one extreme are the rockers, which roll with classic momentum worthy of ""Jet"" or ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" and suggest McCartney perhaps held a seance or two to connect with his riskier past. In an earlier, less fragmented landscape, the title track would be as big a hit as anything in Macca's voluminous arsenal. A joyful ode to crushes and the ways in which they rewire life, it features not only a singalong chorus but also, as a coda, a nod to the Beach Boys and classic doo-wop.

PHOTOS: Unexpected musical collaborations

""Alligator"" delivers background harpsichord and a guitar line worthy of ""Day Tripper,"" with the singer expressing a desire for ""someone who can save me when I come home from the zoo/ I need somebody who's a sweet communicator I can give my alligator to.""

A sneaky synthetic rhythm drives ""Road,"" a song rich with mesmerizing landscapes of twinkles, strums, bass and harmony. ""Queenie Eye"" rolls with piano-bouncy momentum suggesting ""Lady Madonna,"" with elaborate arrangements. Produced by Epworth, the song offers structural adventure worthy of ""Band on the Run,"" weird in that uniquely McCartneyian way.

At the other end of the spectrum are the softer ballads on ""New."" ""Early Days,"" produced by Johns, to me suggests another Beatle's work, at least musically: George Harrison's ""All Things Must Pass."" With a delicate minor-key strum, McCartney sings of flipping through records, ""hair slicked back with Vaseline like the pictures on the wall of the local record shop,"" discovering rock 'n' roll with John Lennon by ""hearing noises we were destined to remember.""

RELATED: Best albums of 2013 so far | Randall Roberts

McCartney's weakness has long been a certain cloyingness, a sense that he's telegraphing positivity. He's an optimist, which can be annoying for us cynics not either melodic geniuses or worth hundreds of millions of dollars. His sing-song phrasing too can get a bit tiresome; ""On My Way to Work"" is set in his youth while riding a ""big green bus"" and looking at a nudie mag and features some pretty rocky wording but offers instantly hummable melodic beauty.

Cynicism, though, is no match for an inspired McCartney. ""Looking at Her,"" a midtempo ballad about the power and perils of beauty, lands in that sweet spot between the personal and universal that typifies the composer's best songs.

And given his body of work, that's saying something.

Oh... Ah..."") of Showtime's ""Homeland.""

Scapegoated in a CIA misinformation campaign, Carrie is determined to clear her name and save the life of Nick Brody (Damian Lewis), the target of a global manhunt after the Langley explosion.

""I'm under attack,"" Carrie exclaims to a skeptical newspaper reporter (Fiona Choi). But divulging spy secrets puts Carrie in the cross hairs of CIA black ops leader Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham).

""She's out for blood. I'm going to stop her,"" Dar vows.

PHOTOS: Hollywood Backlot moments

Carrie's newspaper interview is cut short when police arrive with a psychiatric detention order. Soon she's handcuffed to a hospital bed and evaluated by Dr. Harlan (David Aaron Baker).

""I'm standing down,"" Carrie assures the psychiatrist, meaning there's no need for the CIA to silence her. But Harlan is concerned that Carrie no longer takes Ritalin to control her mood swings, opting instead for a regimen of running and meditation.

""I can't do the meds anymore,"" says Carrie, grandiosely believing she would have prevented the bombing if her head was clear.

Worried about this erratic behavior is acting CIA Director Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), who reluctantly betrayed Carrie to protect his agency from Congress. Saul tries to win over Carrie's father Frank (James Rebhorn) and sister Maggie (Amy Hargreaves).

""I know both of you hate me right now but I'm on her side,"" says Saul, who wants Carrie placed in her family's care.

Believing everyone has turned against her, Carrie flees the detention hearing and is promptly committed. When Saul visits the psychiatric facility he finds Carrie drugged, listless and bitter.

""I'm so sorry,"" he says.

Back at CIA headquarters, Fara (Nazanin Boniadi), a young Muslim hired as an analyst, scrutinizes data from a terrorist's laptop.

""There's nothing there,"" she says to Saul, who angrily berates her for wearing a head scarf while Islamic terrorists gloat about the Langley bombing.

""You better be the best analyst we've ever seen,"" Saul demands. So come up with a plan ""or don't say anything.""

""I have a plan,"" Fara says, choking back tears.

Her strategy involves questioning bankers about suspicious money transfers. Fara believes they illegally partnered with an Iranian trading company, garnering huge profits by trafficking in human misery.

When the bankers refuse to cooperate, CIA operative Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend) confronts one of them (Robert Newman) outside an upscale restaurant. The banker's colleague was just killed in Venezuela, Peter warns, so watch your back.

Fara quickly receives her requested information.

""It's all pointing to Iran,"" she says after analyzing the data. ""Not just the country -- inside the government.""

What's more, $45 million in bank fees is unaccounted for, she tells Saul, who cautions her to keep this finding ""between us for the time being.""

Finally, Brody's rebellious daughter Dana (Morgan Saylor), back home after a suicide attempt, goes from sexting to sex with new boyfriend Leo (Sam Underwood).

But Leo is confined to the recovery center where Dana was treated, and mom Jessica (Morena Baccarin) wants to keep the troubled teens apart.

""He's not what you need right now,"" Jessica insists. Dana disagrees, saying Leo gives her a reason to carry on during the bombing aftermath.

""At this moment I want to be alive,"" Dana says as Jessica bursts into tears.

Later Dana reminisces about happier times as she browses through family photos. Then she carefully unfolds her father's Islamic prayer rug and reverentially bows down.

Like father, like daughter?

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/ct-hoy-8304043-tweeting-mccain-compares-ahmadinejad-to-monkey-story.html","Tweeting McCain compares Ahmadinejad to monkey","WASHINGTON - Outspoken US Senator John McCain raised eyebrows online Monday when he compared Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to a monkey that the Islamic republic recently launched into space.



So Ahmadinejad wants to be first Iranian in space - wasn't he just there last week? ""Iran launches monkey into space"" news.yahoo.com/iran-launches-… - John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) February 4, 2013

The comments by the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, a strong advocate for tougher sanctions on Tehran for its nuclear program, followed Ahmadinejad's claim earlier Monday that he is ready ""to be the first man in space"" under Iran's ambitious program which aims to send a human being into orbit by 2020.

The slur by McCain, the senator with by far the most Twitter followers, with nearly 1.8 million, elicited swift condemnation on Twitter.

""Wow, way to elevate political discourse,"" tweeted @heyitsurban to McCain.

Another user, @manolo_loop, wrote: ""@SenJohnMcCain is racism funny?""

About 50 minutes after his original ""monkey"" tweet, McCain posted a follow-up.

""Re: Iran space tweet - lighten up folks, can't everyone take a joke?""

The episode was the second off-color attempt at humor by the veteran US senator in as many weeks.

On January 22, he joked at a press conference about the prospect of a Senate colleague being held hostage in Afghanistan, just days after a hostage drama in Algeria left dozens of hostages dead including three Americans.

Minutes later he quipped he was looking forward to interrogating Senator John Kerry in his confirmation hearing to be the next secretary of state, saying US authorities would use ""waterboarding to get the truth out of him.""

I. Start slowly and with an increasingly broad audience. (0:56 to 1:08)

Obama has been compared to a preacher. He began his address as many preachers do by speaking slowly and gradually acknowledging the audiences to whom he was speaking. He started with his Vice President, moved to Chief Justice John Roberts and the members of Congress before turning to his fellow citizens. By doing this he respected the power of the political offices and made it clear that he is part of the citizenry.

II. Ground the address in the founding documents and religions and the promises they contain. (1:12 to 2:22)

The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States are arguably the most important documents in American political history. Obama explicitly drew on them when he read the opening sentence of the Declaration of Independence, spoke about the affirmation of the Constitution by holding the inauguration and repeatedly said, ""We, the people,"" which are the first words of the Constitution's preamble. Obama also asserted the Americans' allegiance to the idea of democracy makes us exceptional.

III. Insert religion into the speech. (2:47 to 2:53)

Although there is constitutionally-mandated separation of Church and State in the United States, political leaders of both stripes often ground their speeches in mentions of God at the beginning and ending of their addresses. Obama was no different, saying that freedom is a gift from God and closing by asking God to bless the people who attend and the country as a whole.

IV. Refer to political hero Abraham Lincoln. (3:10 to 3:16, 3:30 to 3:41)

Obama's positive regard for the 16th President, another lawyer from Illinois, is no secret. In his address, he twice referred to him. First time alluded to closing of the Gettysburg Address, the second time he quoted directly from Lincoln's 1858 House Divided speech, which he delivered at the Illinois State Capitol.

V. Place the current moment in an historic context and introduce a central metaphor. (3:24 to 4:26)

Obama placed the current moment in an historic context of Americans' acting to make the promises of the nation real and meeting the challenges set before them. He talked about coming through the Civil War as a free nation, building a modern economy and deciding to care for the poor and vulnerable in the society. These are the earlier stages of the never-ending journey he describes. The image of the journey provided coherence for the earlier actions and set Obama up for his later assertion that the journey is an incomplete one.

VI. Emphasize the task's collective nature. (4:47 to 5:41)

Obama did this in several different ways. He specifically said that preserving individual freedom takes collective action and said that the nation's challenges can only be met if we act as one nation and one people.

VII. Use repetition.

This is another preacherly device that Obama used throughout his speech. He used ""You and I"" two times, ""Together, we"" three times, said ""We, the people"" four times and declared that our ""Our journey is not yet complete"" five times. These phrases reinforced the underlying message and built emotional momentum.

VIII. Dispute assumed contradictions. (8:24 to 8:53, 11:27 to 11:38)

Obama has done this throughout his career, perhaps most famously where he said in the 2004 Democratic National Convention that there are no blue or red states, but only the United States of America. Here he said that the nation does not have to choose between caring for the previous generation and investing in young people and that lasting security does not require perpetual war.

IX. Articulate a combination of beliefs and specific issues. (10:02 to 11:24)

This is a reciprocal process of pointing to specific issues like climate change with a statement of belief, in this case that we are have a responsibility to posterity. By talking about both Obama sought to avoid being overly technocratic and policy oriented on the one hand, and excessively ungrounded on the other.

X. Mention key social movements as an illustration of We the People. (13:46 to 14:23)

Obama made it clear that he considers people whose rights were not initially granted during the constitution an integral part of the people who have ennobled the nation through their struggles to have it be true to the common creed. This list includes the women's rights supporters who gathered at Seneca Falls, the civil rights marchers who protested and were beaten in Selma, Alabama, and the gay and lesbian people who protested their abuse during the Stonewall riots in 1970. Obama also paid tribute to the ordinary people who participated in the March on Washington in 1963, specifically mentioning Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He used the same line about coming to hearing ""a King"" in his presidential announcement in February 2007.

XI. Build to an emotional crescendo and define the task of the moment. (14:30 to 16:16)

Obama started speaking with more energy and volume and emotional force as he progressed. By saying our journey is not complete, Obama asserted that there is still more work to be done that is our generation's task. He said that it is our generation's task to carry on what those pioneers began before identifying the specific tasks that need to be accomplished and then making the broader point that the ultimate goal is to make the rights and values that Jefferson articulated in the Declaration of Independence real for every American.

XII. Acknowledge humility. (17:13 to 17:38)

Obama says openly that the work will not be completed, but rather will be imperfect and taken up by subsequent generations. But it must be undertaken now.","2013-01-23 11:39:18","0","37.0","15.0","3.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","29.0","15.0","0.0","73.0","1.0","14.0","0","1039","93.11","82.72","12.02","35.88","16.76","24.54","77.19","46.39","9.91","5.29","0.19","1.25","0.10","2.98","0.77","4.62","9.82","14.24","5.10","2.50","5.29","0.96","10.11","4.81","2.12","1.25","6.64","1.44","3.46","2.02","1.44","0.29","0.77","0.00","10.88","0.00","0.19","0.19","3.27","7.41","1.83","1.44","0.38","0.77","1.92","1.64","3.08","0.87","2.12","0.10","0.38","0.10","0.10","0.19","0.00","6.83","1.92","1.25","3.27","0.48","0.19","3.95","5.87","0.67","13.67","2.12","5.77","5.77","3.08","0.19","0.67","0.48","1.15","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.07","6.06","3.08","2.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.19","1.15","0.96","2.12","0.00","4904","8.44","17.16393442622951","1557","1011","49","59.03","13.1","10.1","12.13","12.8","242","6.285714285714286","19.81467853610287","500","14.98","13","0.45","0","41","66","121","0","127","79","3","0","5","118","101","6","59","0","0","42","18","39","2","2","2","39","0","22","50","30","17","15","25","4","8","1","2"
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/ct-hoy-8318698-daily-roundup-unos-continuing-problems-story.html","Daily Roundup: UNO's Continuing Problems","The Sun-Times has continued their impactful coverage of the procurement processes of influential Latino non-profit the United Neighborhood Organization, or UNO.

The latest development is that Miguel D'Escoto, UNO's second-ranking executive, resigned on Tuesday.

D'Escoto's resignation came eight days after the Sun-Times revealed more than one-fifth of the $25 million in taxpayer money spent on the UNO Soccer Academy Elementary Charter School went to four contractors owned by family members of UNO's political allies and a top executive of the group.

The Sun-Times reported the following:

A company owned by a brother of Miguel d'Escoto , UNO's senior vice president of operations, was paid more than $600,000 as the ""owner's representative"" for the project.

Another d'Escoto brother landed a $4.4 million contract that included installing the school's windows and distinctive metal exterior panels.

State grant money that was used to guard the construction site went to a security firm run by two brothers of state Rep. Edward Acevedo, a Chicago Democrat who voted to approve the UNO grant.

Two deals for plumbing work went to the sister of Victor Reyes , a lobbyist who helped UNO obtain the grant money to build the school.

In a statement on the organization's website UNO CEO Juan Rangel said he was confident UNO had acted legally, but said its procurement processes were outdated. He added that UNO is undertaking a complete review of those processed that they expect to be completed within 45 days and that it would cease doing business with D'Escoto, Inc., a construction firm owned by Miguel D'Escoto's brother.

The revelations and ensuing fallout came after parents advocacy group PURE called for an investigation of UNO's financial practices and use of Illinois grant money by Inspector General Ricardo Meza.

The group took aim at UNO's financial practices, saying that shows that each successive transaction has led to higher debt-per-student costs as UNO has nearly no other source of revenue other than public transfers via direct subsidies, publicly issued bonds and government contracts.

""If UNO fails to secure more buildings and more students, the growing financial burden will likely have an adverse impact on its students as per-pupil classroom spending will suffer due to an increasing portion of the network's income being diverted to cover debt payments,"" said a statement on PURE's website.

The statement also criticized UNO's receiving so much at a time when more than 100 Chicago public schools are slated to be closed.

""Our school has never gotten the programs and supplies our children need. Now CPS is planning to close a lot of schools, supposedly to save money. At the same time, UNO keeps getting millions of dollars to pull students from our school and put us in danger of being closed,"" said Rosemary Sierra, local school council president at Pilsen Community Academy. ""We thought the state had a budget crisis, but they seem to be able to find millions for the politically-connected people at UNO. Meanwhile, some of UNO's schools have the lowest rating in CPS.""

UNO could have received $35 million had Senate Bill 24 been passed, but the likelihood of getting that money has diminished markedly, according to Rich Miller of Capitol Fax. He quoted a source who told him, ""That cash was omitted from the supplemental approp bill which passed this week. There's just too much heat on UNO right now.""

Part of the heat may be coming from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, an erstwhile staunch UNO supporter.

He struck a decidedly different tone after learning about UNO's procurement practices.

""I know what the United Neighborhood Organization does - both as a neighborhood group and as an education group. And I know they're gonna have to hold themselves accountable because I believe in being held accountable to the public,"" the mayor said in the Sun-Times. ""They're getting public resources. The people [who] are the proper people will look into it and be held accountable so dollars aren't misspent.""

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/ct-hoy-8350231-miami-reacciona-con-furia-y-aplasta-a-spurs-story.html","Miami reacciona con furia y aplasta a Spurs","Miami Heat le devolvió a San Antonio Spurs la dosis de humillación que recibió en el primer partido de la final de la NBA, y con desenfrenada ofensiva le aplastó 103-84 la noche del domingo en el segundo partido de la serie, que la empató 1-1.

Pese a la paliza, la más grande que reciben en la postemporada de este año, los Spurs cumplieron su objetivo de irse de Miami con un triunfo, tras ganar el primer encuentro la noche del jueves 92-88.

Ahora la serie al mejor de siete encuentros se traslada a San Antonio, donde se jugarán tres juegos el martes, jueves y domingo venideros.

Esta vez, los del Heat tuvieron un trabajo ofensivo mas parejo, con cuatro titulares en dobles dígitos y una banca que le aportó 40 puntos, 13 de ellos del veterano Ray Allen, quien encestó 3 de 5 triples.

El astro LeBron James estuvo 'discreto' con 17 puntos, 8 rebotes, 7 asistencias, 3 robos y 3 bloqueos, y encontró más ayuda de sus compañeros Chris Bosh (12 puntos y 10 rebotes), Dwyane Wade (10 puntos) y el armador Mario Chalmers (19 puntos).

Por San Antonio, el escolta Danny Green fue el mejor con 17 puntos, (5 de 5 en triples), seguido de Tony Parker con 13 puntos y Gary Neal 10. El ala-pivot Tim Duncan se quedó en 9 puntos y 11 rebotes, y el argentino Manu Ginóbili salió de la banca para terminar con 5 puntos en 18 minutos de juego.

""No jugamos fino con el balón, no triangulamos, y ellos jugaron con la desesperación, la urgencia de ganar a como sea. Esa fue la historia del partido"", resumió Ginóbili.

El Heat, que quebró el marcador en el último cuarto con un tremendo parcial de 28-5, tuvo mejor efectividad en porcentaje de tiros de campo (49 a 41), dominó la pintura 46 puntos a 38 y cometió sólo seis pérdidas de balón, casi las mismas que tuvo (5) en el fatídico último tramo del jueves, cuando San Antonio le dio vuelta a la pizarra para asegurar el primer triunfo de la serie.

Los Spurs fueron la cara contraria al cometer 17 'turnovers', que le costaron 19 puntos.

El partido se mantuvo parejo, con dominios alternos en la pizarra, hasta que un triple de Mario Chalmers y bandeja de Wade en el minuto final, le aseguró a los de casa irse al descanso con ventaja de 50-45.

En el tercer periodo, LeBron siguió bien vigilado, pero Ray Allen y Mike Miller salieron de la banca para reforzar la artillería de largo alcance de Miami.

Fueron precisamente sendos triples de Allen y Miller, y el despertar de Mario Chalmers, los que permitieron a Miami facturar un margen de 10 puntos para adelantarse 75-65 al cierre del tercer periodo.

Miami comenzó a jugar una defensa más activa por toda la cancha y los Spurs perdieron el aro de tal forma que el DT Greg Popovich optó por mandar a la banca a sus estrellas Duncan y Ginóbili.

Con el campo despejado, el Heat corrió una racha de 22-3 para despegarse hasta por 17 cartones y poner ventaja de 82-65, ante la algarabía del repleto graderío del American Airlanes Arena de Miami.

Luego de que Popovich pidiera un tiempo técnico, las cosas no cambiaron para los Spurs y los locales siguieron con su faena de desgaste hasta colocar un lapidatorio 94-69 en el pizarrón.

Ante esto, el 'Coach Pop' decidió replegar sus fuerzas en previsión a un lesión de sus titulares y sacó a la duela a sus reservas, mientras Miami cargaba todas sus baterías con LeBron, Bosh, Wade, y un Ray Allen que parecía tener un contrato a destajo con el aro.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/ct-hoy-8262304-aprueban-en-illinois-las-licencias-para-indocumentados-story.html","Aprueban en Illinois las licencias para indocumentados","SPRINGFIELD - Luego de un acalorado debate en el pleno de la Cámara de Representantes de Illinois, donde el tema migratorio se impuso al de la seguridad en carreteras, la propuesta de ley SB 957, que dará licencias de conducir a los indocumentados, fue finalmente aprobada.

La votación fue de 65 votos a favor por 46 en contra. La medida fue aprobada ayer en el Comité de Seguridad de Transportes y Vehículos también bajo un fuerte debate, en el que algunos jefes de policía del estado se opusieron a la medida.

La licencia a la que tendrán acceso ahora unos 250,000 indocumentados en el país es la que se otorga a visitantes temporales, conocida como Temporary Visitor's Driver's License.

Para que se convierta en ley, el gobernador Pat Quinn, quien ya había expresado su apoyo a la medida se ofreció también a firmarla para que así sea ya que el Senado la aprobó el mes pasado.

El documento será válido por tres años y para obtenerlo el solicitante deberá demostrar que ha residido en Illinois por al menos un año, algo que podrá comprobar con facturas de servicios, contratos de compra de vivienda o de renta de inmuebles.

En un comunicado de prensa, la Coalición de Illinois pro Derechos de Inmigrantes y Refugiados calificó el hecho como histórico y resaltó que, desde 2003, Illinois es el primer estado en aprobar una medida que otorga licencias a indocumentados, algo por lo que ""hemos luchado desde hace 13 años"".

Para obtener la licencia, los solicitantes deberán aprobar recibir entrenamiento y aprobar el examen de manejo, además de que les exigirá obtener un seguro para el automóvil. Así, los ""indocumentados podrán ir a trabajar, a la escuela, a la iglesia o de comprar sin temor a ser deportados"", agregó ICIRR en su comunicado.

El documento, sin embargo, no podrá ser utilizado como identificación oficial para abordar un avión, comprar un arma o votar.

Lograr que la propuesta de ley se aprobara no fue fácil. En sus argumentos finales, el representante estatal Edward Acevedo, patrocinador de la medida, señaló que el propósito de la medida era dar prioridad a la seguridad de los conductores en las carreteras del estado.

Sin embargo, representantes estatales como Dennis Reboletti, un republicano de Elmhurst, señaló que quedaban varios puntos pendientes y, junto con otros que se oponían a la medida, dijo que el tomar huellas dactilares debió ser parte de la propuesta. Su colega Randy Ramey, del Condado de DuPage, comentó que ""muchísima gente va a tener acceso al documento"" y que eso dará lugar ""al fraude"" y ""el abuso"".

Pero Tom Cross, líder de los republicanos en la Cámara Baja, apoyó la medida bajo el argumento de que Illinois debe dar la bienvenida a los inmigrantes que ""quieren trabajar y ser parte de nuestras comunidades. Debemos trabajar con ellos, no contra ellos"".

Para Toni Preckwinkle, presidenta de la Junta de Comisionados del Condado de Cook, la propuesta responde al ""sentido común"", sobre todo porque se permitirá que manejen de forma legal quienes ya lo hacen y además reducirá costos para el condado en cortes y cárceles.

Su oficina indicó que el año pasado se emitieron 40,000 infracciones a conductores sin licencia, correspondientes al 10% de todos los casos que fueron a la corte de tránsito.

Jesse White, secretario del Estado, señaló que su oficina estará lista para atender la demanda de solicitudes que se presente luego de que la medida fue aprobada.

Por su parte, Rahm Emanuel, alcalde de Chicago, comentó en un comunicado que la medida permitirá que ""la ciudad y el estado sean más amigables con los inmigrantes, al tiempo que nuestros caminos son más seguros"" al hacer que quienes conducen en el estado estén entrenados y asegurados.

Artemio Arreola, director de Política de ICIRR, comentó por su parte que la aprobación de la medida es ""un paso adelante para seguir la lucha por la reforma migratoria"".

Reforma al plan de pensiones

Uno de los temas que quedó pendiente en la legislatura que esta tarde concluyó fue la reforma al plan de pensiones del estado.

El plan, presentado por el gobernador Pat Quinn, quien buscaba de alguna manera resolver el creciente problema financiero que representa el sistema de retiros de los empleados gubernamentales, indica el diario Chicago Tribune.

El plan discutido esta tarde buscaba formar una comisión de ocho miembros nombrado por cuatro líderes legislativos, el cual se encargaría de reportar los cambios al sistema de pensiones y que se convertirían en ley a menos de que la Asamblea General votara para derogarlos.","2013-01-08 13:01:20","0","26.0","3.0","3.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","33.0","17.0","0.0","69.0","1.0","13.0","0","759","94.35","54.71","1.00","18.04","31.62","28.59","9.09","3.29","0.40","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","1.32","0.00","1.32","0.40","0.92","0.00","0.26","0.00","1.19","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.92","0.26","0.26","0.13","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.13","1.58","0.00","0.66","0.79","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.53","0.53","0.13","0.00","0.40","1.45","0.13","0.13","0.66","0.53","0.00","0.92","0.00","0.92","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.18","3.16","7.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.13","2.37","0.26","0.00","0.13","3202","10.39","31.708333333333332","1244","757","24","39.5","17.1","15.6","12.43","18.0","249","12.25","27.757199471598415","370","26.92","4","0.05","0","2","10","22","162","34","67","1","0","0","286","84","0","32","0","0","0","0","6","0","0","0","0","0","0","8","0","0","31","16","0","0","0","0"

Yuna

De Malasia, la carismática Yuna--quien nos recuerda a Feist, Adele y Norah Jones- ha sido la primer artista de su país que ha incursionado con éxito al mercado musical de Estados Unidos. Empezó a llamar la atención primero, hace dos años cuando fue nominada al puesto de Mejor Artista Internacional Nueva por MTV Iggy, y luego el año pasado con su original interpretación de Here Comes the Sun en la película ""Savages"" de Oliver Stone. Valdrá la pena verla en Schuba's para gozar en un ambiente íntimo la irresistible combinación de pop, folk acústico y soul con blues de la bella joven cantautora.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/ct-hoy-8354044-incendio-en-arizona-mata-a-19-bomberos-story.html","Incendio en Arizona mata a 19 bomberos","En una de las mayores tragedias en la historia de los cuerpos de rescate de Estados Unidos, 19 bomberos perdieron la vida en un incendio forestal en Yarnell, al noroeste de Phoenix.

Reportes del diario Arizona Republic indican que además la mitad de las 500 casas del pequeño poblado del Condado de Yavapai habrían sido destruidas por fuego.

En una actualización ofrecida el lunes por la mañana, las autoridades informaron que las cuadrillas de bomberos continúan trabajando para combatir el fuego. También advirtieron que las temperaturas en esa zona podrían llegar a los 100°F.

También se dijo, según el Arizona Republic, que la expectativa es que el fuego se desplace de forma errática, con algunas brisas estables y la posibilidad de monzones.

Los bomberos trabajarían para contener el flanco este del fuego con la esperanza de proteger las viviendas y otras estructuras.

Por aire, aviones cisterna lanzarán retardante de fuego y cinco helicópteros lanzarán agua en los puntos más críticos para ayudar a los bomberos.

Los primeros reportes del fuego se dieron el viernes por la tarde y para ayer el fuego se había extendido a 8,000 acres.

El diario agrego que todos los vecindarios del Peeples Valley y Yarnell fueron evacuados.

Sobre la muerte de los bomberos, Dan Fraijo, jefe de ese departamento en Prescott, indicó que ""estamos devastados. Perdimos a 19 de nuestros mejores hombres y atravesamos en este momento por una terrible crisis.

En comentarios recopilados por el diario Chicago Tribune, Fraijo dijo que ""enseñamos a nuestra gente a estar segura, a tomar precauciones. En ocasiones, desafortunadamente, simplemente no funciona"".

Jan Brewer, gobernadora de Arizona, comentó en un comunicado que ""este es uno de los peores días que recuerdo"". Agregó que habrá que esperar a que la investigación determine ""cómo ocurrió esta tragedia"" y dejó en claro que ""lo único que sabemos con certeza es que el ser bombero es un trabajo peligroso"".

En declaraciones al programa ""Today"" de ABC, Wade Ward, portavoz del Departamento de Bomberos de Prescott, comentó que ""es inimaginable que algo así pueda ocurrir"" dado el nivel de conocimiento y entrenamiento que hay en ese departamento.

Fraijo en tanto comentó que un elemento más de la cuadrilla de 20 bomberos que fueron destacados en diferentes puntos para combatir el incendio sobrevivió, pero no ofreció detalles sobre su estado de salud, aunque está hospitalizado.

El último contacto que se tuvo con la cuadrilla fue el domingo a las 4:30 pm, indicó Steve Skurja, portavoz de la oficina del alguacil de Yavapai.

En declaraciones a Los Angeles Times, Skurja indicó que todos los elementos hicieron sonar su alarma, una medida de emergencia cuando se encuentran sin salida.

""El incendio fue muy agresivo y los rebasó"", añadió.

El mismo diario indica que el presidente Barack Obama calificó a los bomberos como ""héroes, gente altamente calificada que, como muchos otros en el país, arriesgan sus vidas para proteger la vida y pertenencias de gente que quizá nunca conozcan… Michelle y yo nos unimos a todo el pueblo estadounidense para enviar nuestras condolencias"" a las familias de los bomberos.

Las causas del incendio, según reportes de prensa, se acreditan a la caída de rayos el viernes, y hasta este lunes había consumido 2,000 acres de pastizales.

Un funcionario de la división forestal, Art Morrison, dijo que los bomberos fallecidos trabajaban en crear un cortafuegos.

""Normalmente, te aseguras una salida y creas una zona de seguridad. Evidentemente, su zona de seguridad no era lo suficientemente amplia y el fuego los atrapó"", dijo Morrison en declaraciones citadas por CNN.

El incendio coincide con la intensa ola de calor que el fin de semana ha abrasado los estados del suroeste de EEUU como California, Nevada o Arizona, que ha llevado a los termómetros a superar los 113°F y ha provocado centenares de hospitalizaciones, informa EFE.

En Las Vegas la temperatura en el aeropuerto alcanzó su récord histórico de 116°F y los servicios meteorológicos pronosticaban que en el Death Valley de California se iba a superar los 122°F, cerca del hito de 127°F de 1913.

El Servicio Meteorológico de Estados Unidos no prevé que bajen las temperaturas hasta el martes.

Equipo élite

Los 19 bomberos que el domingo perdieron la vida en el incendio forestal de Yarnell, la mayor tragedia en una situación similar en 80 años, pertenecen a un grupo élite llamado Granite Mountain Hotshots, establecido en 2002.

Son elementos altamente entrenados con exigencias físicas muy altas. A los bomberos se les exige un entrenamiento de 80 horas en situaciones críticas y deben reentrenarse cada año y ofrecer cursos sobre seguridad, indica The Daily Courier.

Cada bombero debe pasar una prueba que incluye cargar una mochila con hasta 70 libras, correr 1.5 millas en 10 minutos y completar 40 sentadillas, 25 flexiones y siete flexiones en la barra.

La edad promedio entre los integrantes del grupo es 22 años, deben poder escalar siete o más millas y trabajar hasta 14 horas seguidas. Sus asignaciones pueden durar hasta 21 días antes de que obtengan dos días de descanso.

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/la-et-mn-obama-race-movies-20130915-story.html","Amid Obama presidency, films take major leap in facing race head-on","TORONTO — Watching Steve McQueen's achingly brilliant ""12 Years a Slave"" at the Toronto International Film Festival, I was struck by many things. The film's artistry — script, performances, imagery — is significant. The movie is beautifully, painfully wrought at every turn.

But in a larger sense, it stands as a striking testament to how much the texture and tenor of conversations about race have changed through the prism of film in the years since Barack Obama took office.

Quite simply there are more movies that specifically address black-white friction in modern terms — the many shades of human interaction more starkly framed by the color of one's skin.

WATCH: Toronto Film Festival trailers

No niche movies these. Filmmakers are seeking to touch, and turn, the heart, mind and conscience of mainstream audiences using language that is raw, candid, confrontational. For all the truth-telling, the subtext is concerned with illuminating the dynamics of the discord, then unifying.

Where in the past there might have been a single prestige film about race in the equation, this year in addition to ""12 Years,"" certain to be a major factor in the Oscar race, there is ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,"" ""Fruitvale Station,"" ""The Butler"" and ""42,"" among others.

This is not to dismiss the legacy of earlier films. ""Do the Right Thing"" in 1989 and others in Spike Lee's rich library, Steven Spielberg's ""The Color Purple"" in 1985, ""Mississippi Burning"" in 1988, 2004's multicultural racial clash in ""Crash"" and nearly everything in Sidney Poitier's oeuvre all made powerful statements. But no sweeping traction was achieved.

Instead, Hollywood continued with business as usual. There was the occasional A-list film. Studios were also quick to draft exceptional African American talent for mainstream movies, making stars of Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Samuel L. Jackson, Halle Berry, Eddie Murphy and many others in the process. And there were ""black"" films targeted to appeal to ""black"" audiences. Tyler Perry's Madea has pretty much owned the genre in recent years.

The seeds of this latest change germinated in Obama's very visible presence on the campaign trail. As his face dominated the images of the day, week after week, and the idea that he might lead our country took hold, the gears in Hollywood began to shift. Much of the movie industry's success, after all, is tied to making the right bets, predicting what moviegoers will want to see. Will pay to see.

Often independent filmmakers get to the right conclusions before the studios. For me, the demarcation line begins in January 2009, when director Lee Daniels' powerfully acidic ""Precious,"" adapted by Geoffrey Fletcher from Sapphire's novel, rocked the Sundance Film Festival. It is not a pretty picture — Precious was an obese teen, pregnant by rape, her mother's boyfriend the father. In her mother, an Oscar-winning performance by Mo'Nique, Daniels exposed all the rage that entrenched poverty can churn up, all the self-loathing.

It's the kind of movie Hollywood would never make, would never believe might succeed. And yet it did. Critical acclaim, six Oscar nominations, two wins, a strong box office run that kept it in theaters far longer than anyone had expected. It sparked a great deal of debate within studios about the prospects for other challenging projects.

The conversation began to intensify, the texture of the stories on screen began changing. Later in 2009 ""The Blind Side,"" which earned Sandra Bullock an Oscar, looked white guilt right in the face. But black faces were still supporting players, race the backdrop. Whatever its flaws, the race-based story had audiences filling theaters, and the economic upside made the industry take notice.

In 2011's ""The Help,"" a story of segregation's last gasps, Emma Stone's Skeeter was central, but the villains were white and the voices of dissent and empowerment raised belonged to African American maids. Octavia Spencer won an Oscar for her performance.","2013-09-12 16:00:00","0","39.0","7.0","0.0","0.0","25.0","0.0","73.0","21.0","0.0","81.0","4.0","16.0","0","654","95.97","54.86","15.80","66.30","18.17","24.92","75.23","40.37","5.35","1.22","0.31","0.15","0.00","0.76","0.00","4.13","9.94","13.15","5.81","3.36","3.67","0.92","10.24","4.28","2.45","0.92","2.14","2.45","5.05","3.52","1.38","0.15","0.92","0.00","4.13","0.61","0.15","0.92","0.61","9.33","0.92","2.29","0.61","1.83","1.83","1.83","4.74","3.36","0.15","0.76","1.83","0.76","0.76","0.31","0.31","5.81","1.07","1.68","3.06","1.99","0.00","4.13","4.74","1.53","13.30","1.22","6.73","5.35","3.36","3.98","0.92","1.07","0.15","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","22.78","5.50","8.56","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.92","4.59","2.75","0.00","0.00","3238","8.63","19.142857142857142","951","652","36","61.56","10.8","9.2","12.82","12.3","169","11.1","19.608098159509204","405","17.57","6","0.39","0","17","14","74","0","71","59","4","1","7","107","92","0","45","3","0","9","6","25","1","0","2","16","0","19","34","13","15","8","15","5","1","0","3"
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/ct-prj-0217-garry-wills-20130215-story.html","Garry Wills: a devout critic","A political conservative turned liberal, lifelong Roman Catholic and world-class curmudgeon, Garry Wills has called President Barack Obama a disappointment and Pope Benedict XVI irrelevant — and that was before the pontiff announced his resignation.

In his latest book, “Why Priests? A Failed Tradition,” the former seminarian turned historian goes after priests.

But hey, it's just history. Nothing personal.

“I have nothing against priests,” Wills says at the start of the book, ticking off the names of mentors, most of them Jesuits. “In fact, I tried for a time to be one. ... It should be clear, then, that I respect, and am often fond of, the many priests in my life.”

This piece first ran in Printers Row Journal, delivered to Printers Row members with the Sunday Chicago Tribune and by digital edition via email. Click here to learn about joining Printers Row.

Wills has written nearly 50 works exploring a wide range of historical figures, including James Madison, Richard Nixon, Jack Ruby, St. Augustine and John Wayne. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for ""Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words That Remade America."" Now at 78, challenging modern-day interpretations of his own church's teachings has become his trademark.

""Popes don't pay attention to me because I'm not a priest, and I didn't teach in a Catholic institution,"" Wills said in his characteristic acerbic tone, in an interview. ""If I had done either of those things I would be in trouble with the church. But they can just shrug me off.""

In ""Why Priests?"" Wills asks why a dependence on the priesthood arose in a religious tradition that didn't need it and, in fact, succeeded wildly without it during the time of Peter and Paul.

For the reform-minded, Wills articulates a call for change. But he doesn't want any part of the reform effort. He is quite content doing his own thing, worshipping in what he deems a historically accurate way and writing and writing and writing. So, one might ask, how did he become such an icon among liberal Catholic intelligentsia? In other words, why Garry Wills?

""He's not a theologian, representing the official Catholic view. He expresses views Catholics are discussing,"" said the Rev. Ken Simpson, Wills' former pastor at Northwestern University's Sheil Catholic Center, where Wills has worshiped for 32 years. ""He speaks to views many Catholics have and captures what they're thinking.""

***

Sitting on the couch inside the Sheil Center one recent snowy afternoon, a cane within easy reach, Wills talked about the journey that led him to his most recent book.

""This has been gestating for a long time,"" he said.

Wills wasn't always fond of priests, describing his childhood priest in Adrian, Mich., as ""an ogre, an Irish tyrant."" But the ordained and aspiring Jesuit priests who ran his high school set a different example, introducing students to the classics, music, theater and debate. It was also in high school that Wills discovered ""The Confessions of St. Augustine,"" an autobiography written in the fourth century that examines the saint's conversion to Christianity. It was the Jesuits and St. Augustine, not the ogre, who inspired Wills to pursue a path to the priesthood.

It didn't take long for Wills to grow incredulous of the rules that governed seminary life and the lengths administrators would go to to get around them. For example, when secular books were forbidden during the first two years, author G.K. Chesterton and poet William Wordsworth were granted exceptions with a wink and a nod. Wills also wasn't permitted to get published himself.

After more than five years, a pile of unpublished articles and a severe bout of depression, the prospect of celibacy finally drove Wills to drop out. While pursuing a doctorate in the classics from Yale University, he wrote his first book on Chesterton, whose accounts of overcoming suicidal thoughts and depression had heartened young Wills.

While in graduate school, he also launched a career as a journalist, working alongside the late conservative columnist William F. Buckley, who founded National Review. The two went separate ways when Wills' coverage of the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War and the Nixon administration steered him toward the left.

In 1957, flight attendant Natalie Cavallo plopped down in the seat next to Wills to tell him he was too young to be reading ""The Two Sources of Morality"" by French philosopher Henri Bergson. Fresh out of seminary, he failed to get her number. But the journalist in him tracked her down. They married two years later, raising three children in Baltimore, where he worked at Johns Hopkins University. They moved to Evanston in 1980 when Wills secured a post at Northwestern, where he earned tenure.

But tenure had a price, he said. The administrative duties and academic politics took time away from his writing. After chairing a hiring committee and finding his preferred candidate rejected for political reasons, he cast off tenure and started another book. Northwestern honored him by restoring his tenure in 2005. He continued to teach for a few more years during retirement, but no longer does.

Ed Muir, a professor of Italian social and cultural history and the Renaissance at Northwestern, said he always has admired Wills' focus and uncommon courage.","2013-02-15 19:19:00","0","58.0","5.0","0.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","46.0","21.0","0.0","84.0","4.0","15.0","0","874","90.04","63.43","25.49","33.67","15.61","25.97","79.75","45.31","9.50","6.29","1.14","0.00","0.00","4.58","0.57","3.20","8.70","14.07","5.38","3.09","5.72","1.60","11.33","5.03","2.29","1.95","2.29","1.37","3.09","1.72","1.26","0.00","0.11","0.80","8.92","0.11","0.00","0.23","4.35","8.24","1.83","1.49","0.80","0.92","0.92","2.75","1.49","0.46","1.03","0.00","0.80","0.23","0.46","0.00","0.11","8.70","1.03","2.06","5.15","1.03","0.46","5.15","4.92","0.34","16.70","2.29","8.12","6.18","7.09","1.03","0.11","0.57","4.12","0.23","0.23","0.00","0.11","0.11","0.00","0.00","20.25","6.52","7.55","0.11","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.34","2.97","1.95","0.00","0.34","4239","8.19","17.431372549019606","1279","872","56","64.1","11.2","8.2","12.06","10.4","209","6.857142857142857","17.827155963302754","480","16.29","13","0.44","0","35","16","83","0","99","73","2","2","5","126","115","3","43","0","0","48","15","29","0","1","7","21","0","19","50","23","14","15","24","4","5","1","11"
"http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-sun-1117-love-notes-schaffer-20131117-story.html","Love Notes Mike and Michele Schaffer","When Mike Schaffer walked down the halls of Mater Christi Catholic school in North Riverside escorting his son, Michael, to his kindergarten class, he made an impression on first-grade teacher Michele Cargola.

""They were so cute together,"" Michele said, ""and I thought, 'Oh, that's such a handsome dad.' ""

It was early 2004. Michele was 32 and had never been married. Mike, recently divorced, was 42.

A few months passed. Michele was having coffee with a friend at Panera Bread in River Forest when she saw Mike behind the counter.

Mike had recently relocated to North Riverside from Kenosha, Wis., with Michael, and was working as a manager at the restaurant.

""I spent that whole school year with a ridiculous crush on him,"" Michele said.

""I was clueless,"" Mike admitted.

Fortunately, the frequency of their conversations increased when Michele became Michael's first-grade teacher that fall.

""I was really growing fond of Michael,"" Michele recalled, ""and he started saying things like, 'Maybe you can come over to our house for pizza with my dad?' ""

Mike and Michele started sharing long chats — either after school or during Michele's coffee visits to Panera. While they always kept their relationship in the ""friends zone,"" Michele's attraction continued to accelerate.

""I remember I was with my mom at the pancake breakfast at school in the spring (2005) and she saw Mike there and she said, 'I know that guy from somewhere.' So the very next day, my mom called me and she said, 'You'll never guess who's sitting in the waiting room. That guy that we saw at the pancake breakfast!' ""

It turned out that Mike was a patient at the doctor's office where Michele's mom was working.

""So I put my mom on the case to see if he was dating anyone,"" Michele said.

""Her mom was asking me questions whenever I went to the doctor, trying to gently find things out,"" Mike said. ""I was working so much and taking care of Michael, so I wasn't dating.""

The school year ended on a somber note for students and staff when Mater Christi closed its doors in June 2005 because of low enrollment. Michele gave all of her students her phone number and email address to keep in touch, so Mike had his son call and ask Michele if she wanted to join them for pizza and bowling.

""I wasn't sure if she was interested in me as more than a friend,"" Mike said. ""I figured with Michael calling, it was safe and that way if it was just a teacher-student thing it would be fine. If it's something more — that's fine. I'm trying to figure it out. So I had my first-grader do the work!""

For the next couple of months, Mike, Michele and Michael spent a lot of time together. Until one day, Mike decided to ask just Michele on a date.

Mike thought it went well, until it was time to say good night.

""I brought her home and I thought it was strange that she didn't ask me in,"" he said. ""Her uncle was sitting on the porch. I figured she'd introduce me, (but) she just jumped out of the car.""

""I was so nervous,"" Michele said.

Mike, however, thought maybe Michele just wanted to be friends. Despite the apparent rejection, though, he kept asking Michele out. Within a couple of months, they shared their first kiss.

""It was Sept. 4 and we'd gone out with some friends and went back to my house that night and he made a move,"" Michele said.

Except, again, Michele's nerves got the best of her.

""We were kissing,"" Mike recalled, ""and she said, 'Everybody stop!' And I said, 'Who's everybody?' ""

""I was a nervous wreck,"" Michele explained, ""and I was also so attached to Michael at this point and I thought, 'If this doesn't work out, then what happens?' ""

Despite the mixed signals, Mike brought Michele a dozen roses and a card on Sweetest Day 2005. This time, Michele didn't put a halt to his kisses — and was relaxed enough to tell Mike she had had a crush on him since the first time she saw him.

""I never would have guessed that,"" he admitted. ""I had no idea!""

They were engaged in October 2006 and married July 5, 2008, at St. Louise de Marillac Church in La Grange Park.

""Michael spoke at our wedding,"" Michele said, ""and he said, 'To my dad and my new mom, I hope that we're happy as a family.' And then he started bawling and so many people started crying — that was the talk of the wedding, how touching Michael's speech was.""

Nine years after they met, Mike is still amazed when he hears Michele talk about the way she felt when she first saw him walk down the hall at Mater Christi.

""Sometimes signals come across and you think, 'OK, that's it,' "" he said, ""but a person might be putting something out there that isn't how they really feel because they're scared or they've been hurt.

Being catfished is something no one wants or deserves.

For those of you who don't know, a catfish is someone who uses social media to create false identities in an attempt to pretend they're someone they're not.

And while what happened to Manti Te'o is bringing the term to light, we shouldn't talk about catfishing like it's a new thing. Ever since there's been an Internet, there's been a fat guy in an undershirt pretending to be a hot model. Social media only makes the lie more believable and more noticeable.

But now that it's happened to someone prominent, there's a renewed interest. We're focusing plenty on how the media should have been more diligent in its reporting and how Te'o shouldn't have been so quick to believe, but what we're not doing enough of is talking about how to prevent it from happening to you.

We may not all be up-and-coming football stars, but these tips can help you avoid becoming the victim of a catfish or general web hoax.

Google image search

Te'o basically was attracted to a Twitter avatar. That's OK — a little weird but OK — but only if you do your homework first. While no one is saying you have to check every image of every person, use this if there's something that doesn't feel quite right. The easiest way to use the free tool is to go to images.google.com and drag and drop an image onto the page. A good result is ""no other sizes of this image found,"" indicating it hasn't been shared by thousands of websites. But if you see the same image used on multiple social media profiles, you may have a problem. Considering this takes all of 15 seconds, can you really afford not to do it?

Check the person's Facebook Timeline

The privacy settings may prevent you from seeing much, but focus on two areas to start: The join date and the number of friends. If someone just joined Facebook an hour ago, that's a reason for a red flag. If someone has 6 friends and joined years ago, that's also a reason to raise the flag. If the person has some open privacy settings, look at posting habits. Are there any photos of family members? Has anyone tagged this person in other activities? Does the person like other comments or businesses, or do they seem to go out of their way to avoid a conversation? Someone who is very quiet on Facebook should be given a closer look.

Check the person's LinkedIn profile

While LinkedIn isn't the hot social network where everyone congregates, it's less likely these days to find someone with absolutely no LinkedIn presence. Don't use this as your only measurement, but if the other two above are problematic and you find no LinkedIn presence, add it to the concern list.

Ask to video chat

Going back to the fat guy in the undershirt, a request to video chat would be his worst nightmare. That kind of chat existed years ago, but it wasn't the norm. Be concerned if repeated attempts are met with excuses. And don't chalk it up to technology — most computers, mobile devices and tables nowadays support this feature, whether it's Facebook chat, Skype, FaceTime or something else.

Background check

Creepy? Stalkerish? It may seem that way, but if you really want to be sure someone is telling you the truth, a simple Google search for online background checks turns up plenty of options. And because more options exist today than a few years ago, they aren't that expensive. Save this for the last thing, but remember the option is available should it make you feel more comfortable.

And finally, here's one piece of advice that never changes, no matter how much technology evolves. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

Trades listed in chronological order.



By Bobby Bonett and Nick Klopsis

Sept. 10, 1976

Kings trade Tiny Archibald to the Nets for Jim Eakins, Brian Taylor and two first-round picks

The Nets acquired Archibald, a future Hall of Famer, after several dominant seasons in Kansas City. In fact, during the 1972-73 season, Archibald became the first and only player to lead the league in both points and assists. Archibald’s stay was short, though, as the Nets shipped him to the Buffalo Braves less than a year later. The two first-round picks the Nets sent to Kansas City wound up being Otis Birdsong and Phil Ford.

General manager: Roy Boe



Oct. 2, 1979

Jazz trades Rich Kelley to the Nets for Bernard King, John Gianelli and Jim Boylan

After two seasons averaging more than 20 points per game, 22-year-old Bernard King was shipped to the Jazz in a package for Rich Kelley. The 7-footer lasted less than a season with New Jersey, averaging just 10 points and seven rebounds per game. King scored nearly 20,000 points in his career, and led the league in scoring in 1984-85.

General manager: Charles Theokas



Dec. 24, 1981

Lakers trade a second-round pick to the Nets for Bob McAdoo

Nine months after they had signed him as a free agent, the Nets dealt future Hall of Famer Bob McAdoo to the West Coast. McAdoo won two titles with the Lakers as one of the team’s key players off the bench.

General manager: Bob MacKinnon



Feb. 6, 1983

Warriors trade Micheal Ray Richardson to the Nets for Sleepy Floyd and Mickey Johnson

The Nets parted with a young “Sleepy” Floyd for Micheal Ray Richardson, an All-Star point guard who led the league in assists and steals during the 1979-80 season. Richardson was named an All-Star as a member of the Nets in 1985, but a year later was banned from the NBA for life for violating the league’s substance abuse policy multiple times.

General manager: Bob MacKinnon



Jan. 23, 1991

Trail Blazers trade Drazen Petrovic to the Nets as part of a three-team trade.

The Nets landed Croatian-born Drazen Petrovic during the 1990-91 season in a three-way deal that cost the Nets Greg Anderson and a first-round pick. He earned a spot in the team’s starting lineup the next two seasons and put up huge offensive numbers. Petrovic averaged more than 20 points per game and shot better than 44 percent from three each season. His life was cut short by a fatal car accident in June 1993.

General manager: Willis Reed



Oct. 8, 1992

76ers trade Jayson Williams to the Nets for two second-round picks

The Nets only needed to part with spare change to pick up the 24-year-old 6-9 center. Williams was slow to develop for New Jersey, but he broke out during the 1996-97 season, averaging 13.4 points and 13.5 rebounds. Williams was named to the All-Star team the next season, but was forced to retire at just 30 years old — shortly after signing a massive contract extension — because of a career-ending knee injury.

General manager: Willis Reed



Nov. 3, 1992

Hawks trade Rumeal Robinson to the Nets for Mookie Blaylock and Roy Hinson

Taken by the Nets with the 12th overall pick in the 1989 draft, Mookie Blaylock was the Nets’ starting point guard by his sophomore season. But the Nets opted to deal the 24-year-old guard for Rumeal Robinson. Blaylock averaged at least 11 points per game and five assists each of the next 10 seasons; Robinson started just 28 games in 1 1/2 seasons with New Jersey.

General manager: Willis Reed



Nov. 30, 1995

76ers trade Shawn Bradley, Greg Graham and Tim Perry to the Nets for Derrick Coleman, Sean Higgins and Rex Walters

Despite three straight seasons averaging more than 20 points and 10 rebounds, Derrick Coleman fell out of favor by the end of the 1994-95 season. He was shipped in a package to Philadelphia, with the Nets receiving 7-6 center Shawn Bradley. Bradley served as a solid defender in the paint for New Jersey for 1 1/2 seasons; Coleman averaged a double-double just one more time in his career.

General manager: Willis Reed



Feb. 17, 1997

Mavericks trade Sam Cassell, Chris Gatling, Jim Jackson, George McCloud and Eric Montross to the Nets for Shawn Bradley, Ed O’Bannon, Robert Pack and Khalid Reeves

In one of the great heists in team history, the Nets parted with four players who had already peaked for two real impact players: Sam Cassell and Jim Jackson. Cassell and Jackson both had short-lived stints with New Jersey, though: Jackson averaged 16.5 points in 31 games, and Cassell averaged just under 21 points in 102 games.

General manager: John Calipari



June 27, 1997

76ers trade Keith Van Horn, Michael Cage, Lucious Harris and Don MacLean to the Nets for Jim Jackson, Eric Montross, Anthony Parker and Tim Thomas

Two days after he was selected second overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1997 draft, Keith Van Horn was dealt in a package to the Nets. Van Horn spent five seasons in New Jersey — the five best years of his career — and averaged 18.2 points and 7.6 rebounds.

General manager: John Calipari



March 11, 1999

Timberwolves trade Stephon Marbury to the Nets as part of a three-team trade.

Two seasons after acquiring Sam Cassell, the Nets traded him, Chris Gatling, Brian Evans and a first-round pick in a three-team deal for 22-year-old Stephon Marbury. Marbury excelled with the Nets, averaging more than 22 points in each of his three seasons with the team, including an All-Star appearance in 2001.

General manager: John Calipari



July 18, 2001

Suns trade Jason Kidd and Chris Dudley to the Nets for Stephon Marbury, Johnny Newman and Soumalia Samake

In what signaled the beginning of a new era in New Jersey, the Nets built the foundation of a team that would emerge as an Eastern Conference power. Kidd led the Nets to five straight playoff appearances from the 2002-06, including back-to-back appearances in the NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003.

General manager: Rod Thorn



Aug. 6, 2002

76ers trade Dikembe Mutombo to the Nets for Keith Van Horn and Todd MacCulloch

Following his worst statistical season with the Nets, Van Horn was traded to Philadelphia for Mutombo. The 7-2 veteran center played in just 24 games for New Jersey.

General manager: Rod Thorn



July 15, 2004

Nuggets trade three first-round picks to the Nets for Kenyon Martin

The No. 1 overall pick four years earlier, Kenyon Martin was shipped to Denver after four productive seasons for three draft picks. Martin, who had averaged 16.7 points during the 2003-04 season, averaged more than 13 points just one more time in his career. The Nets wound up using two of the picks to acquire Vince Carter.

General manager: Ed Stefanski



Dec. 17, 2004

Raptors trade Vince Carter to the Nets for Alonzo Mourning, Aaron Williams, Eric Williams and two first-round picks

In search of a No. 1 scoring option, the Nets acquired Vince Carter early in the 2004-05 season. Carter, who was unhappy in Toronto, made the All-Star team from 2005-07 with the Nets, and averaged more than 20 points each season with the team.

General manager: Ed Stefanski



Feb. 19, 2008

Mavericks trade Maurice Ager, DeSagana Diop, Devin Harris, Trenton Hassell, Keith Van Horn and two first-round picks to the Nets for Jason Kidd, Malik Allen and Antoine Wright

Looking to rebuild, the Nets parted with veteran point guard Jason Kidd in a midseason package that centered around young point guard Devin Harris and a pair of draft picks. Harris averaged 21.3 points per game during the 2008-09 season, his first full season with the Nets. The two picks wound up being Ryan Anderson and Jordan Crawford.

General manager: Rod Thorn



June 26, 2008

Bucks trade Yi Jianlian and Bobby Simmons to the Nets for Richard Jefferson

After a career year in New Jersey where he averaged 22.6 points per game, Richard Jefferson was traded to the Bucks following the 2007-08 season. The deal was a cost-cutting move, saving the Nets more than $10 million. Yi underachieved in two seasons with New Jersey, while Jefferson averaged more than 15 points just once more in his career.

General manager: Kiki Vandeweghe



June 25, 2009

Magic trades Rafer Alston, Tony Battie and Courtney Lee to the Nets for Vince Carter and Ryan Anderson

The final piece to go from the Nets’ mid-2000s teams, Vince Carter was dealt to the Magic during the 2009 offseason. Courtney Lee was solid in his lone season with the Nets, averaging 12.5 points in 33.5 minutes per game. The real prize of the deal wound up being Ryan Anderson, though, who was named the league’s Most Improved Player following the 2011-12 season.

General manager: Kiki Vandeweghe



Feb. 23, 2011

Jazz trades Deron Williams to the Nets for Derrick Favors, Devin Harris, two first-round picks and cash

In a bold move that paid off, the Nets mortgaged their future in exchange for All-Star point guard Deron Williams at the 2011 trade deadline. Williams’ contract was only guaranteed through the 2011-12 season, however, he signed a max extension with the team in the summer of 2012.

General manager: Billy King



March 15, 2012

Trail Blazers trade Gerald Wallace to the Nets for Mehmet Okur, Shawne Williams and a first-round pick

For the second time in as many years, the Nets gambled at the trade deadline, parting with a first-round pick for Gerald Wallace. Wallace’s contract was only guaranteed through the end of the season, but the Nets inked the swingman to a long-term deal the following summer.

General manager: Billy King



July 11, 2012

Hawks trade Joe Johnson to the Nets for Anthony Morrow, Jordan Farmar, Johan Petro, Jordan Williams, DeShawn Stevenson and a first-round pick

In a move engineered to encourage Gerald Wallace and Deron Williams to re-sign with the team, the Nets parted with young talent and a draft pick for Hawks guard Joe Johnson. Both Wallace and Williams signed extensions shortly after the news broke.

General manager: Billy King

"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/brookhaven-officials-look-at-potential-uses-for-brownfields-site-1.5933648","Brookhaven officials look at potential uses for brownfields site","Brookhaven officials are studying potential uses of the Lawrence Aviation site in Port Jefferson Station, though it is expected to take up to two decades to rid the parcel of toxic contamination.

Town planners next year are expected to complete a land-use plan for the 126-acre federal Superfund site on Sheep Pasture Road, where the aircraft-parts manufacturer is believed to have dumped tons of sludge and chemical waste before it closed in the 1990s.

In addition to environmental concerns caused by the shuttered factory, its owner owes more than $10 million in unpaid taxes, officials said.

""This is a scar on the land, and this scar is a deep one,"" Town Supervisor Edward P. Romaine said in an interview Tuesday. ""This is a brownfields I want to see cleaned up and reused in the best possible way.""

The property is undergoing a massive cleanup by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which thus far has spent $27.3 million, EPA spokesman John Martin said. Restoration is expected to take up to 20 years.

Environmental hazards -- including a mile-long toxic plume emanating from the site -- leave few viable options for future development, town and civic leaders said. Housing developments, for example, are practically out of the question.

Romaine said the property may only be suitable for a park, nature preserve or open space.

Town Councilman Steve Fiore-Rosenfeld, whose North Shore district includes the site, said it could accommodate an office building, adding, ""We don't necessarily want something that's going to . . . [grow] food for people to eat, or a senior housing complex.""

Lawrence Aviation and its owner, Gerald Cohen, 79, of St. James, pleaded guilty in 2008 in U.S. District Court in Central Islip to federal charges that they illegally stored corrosive wastes in two tanks at the site.

Cohen completed a federal prison term last year, but he has not paid $105,816 in court-ordered restitution, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office said Tuesday.

Cohen also owes about $10.5 million in back taxes, including penalties and interest, and has not paid taxes on the property since 1993, Suffolk County chief deputy treasurer Doug Sutherland said. The county reimburses the town and other agencies for lost tax income, he said.

Cohen, in a phone interview on Tuesday, declined to comment on the unpaid taxes and restitution.

Houses above the plume have been connected to public water systems, and a $2 million water treatment plant was built to filter contaminated groundwater. But residents are wary.

Michael Eiermann, of Port Jefferson Station, one of five people appointed last month by the town board to the Lawrence Aviation Land Use Plan Citizens Advisory Committee, said he was unsure what could be built there. ""I can't imagine, from what I've read in the newspaper and heard in the news, that it can be cleaned up to that extent,"" he said.","2013-08-21 19:32:00","1","42.0","73.0","27.0","0.0","32.0","0.0","231.0","49.0","0.0","122.0","0.0","23.0","0","512","96.80","68.72","34.16","22.74","20.48","25.59","74.41","39.84","6.05","2.34","0.59","0.59","0.20","0.78","0.20","3.71","8.20","15.04","5.66","1.76","3.52","0.78","13.09","2.15","0.78","0.98","3.91","0.78","1.76","0.78","0.98","0.39","0.00","0.20","7.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.78","7.42","0.98","1.17","1.37","1.95","0.59","1.95","3.52","0.39","3.12","0.00","1.17","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.78","7.42","0.59","1.17","4.69","0.98","0.59","4.88","8.01","1.76","17.19","0.78","13.09","3.52","5.66","0.00","0.78","2.54","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","19.73","6.05","7.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.15","1.56","1.17","0.00","1.37","2451","8.42","20.88","761","504","29","62.27","11.9","8.9","12.12","11.4","125","11.875","18.88063492063492","305","19.72","9","0.39","0","16","23","46","0","56","40","1","1","5","86","73","0","29","0","0","14","4","11","1","0","4","18","0","14","19","8","20","11","15","2","2","1","1"
"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/epa-criticizes-gsa-s-plum-island-environmental-review-1.5894178","EPA criticizes GSA's Plum Island environmental review","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has criticized another federal agency's environmental review of Plum Island for failing to detail contamination caused by the island's high-security animal disease testing lab -- including disease-causing microorganisms that have led the government to kill all deer on the island lest they transmit those diseases to other animals.

The critique came in a letter sent last week to the General Services Administration, which is in charge of the sale of Plum Island. The lab there is slated to be closed after the federal government builds a $1 billion high-tech National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Kansas, scheduled for completion in 2019.

The EPA earlier had told the GSA that its final environmental impact statement on the island's sale should ""include a discussion of the long-term potential health implications for future residents"" and how a cleanup ""will ensure the safety of future potential inhabitants of the island.""

The most recent letter concluded the final environmental impact study ""is not significantly enhanced"" from the draft and ""does not provide a sufficiently detailed evaluation of the potential impacts of the sale of Plum Island."" It was written by EPA regional administrator Judith A. Enck to the GSA's environmental manager.

GSA defends reportThe GSA and Department of Homeland Security, which operates Plum Island, defended the environmental review.

""The federal government will conduct any necessary environment remediation"" before the island is sold, Homeland Security spokeswoman Nicole Stickel said in a statement.

The GSA said in a statement the review evaluated short- and long-term impacts of selling the island and ""identifies measures to mitigate those impacts where appropriate.""

""The federal government has the responsibility to certify that all actions have been taken to protect human health and the environment,"" the GSA said.

Environmentalists said the GSA review is deficient in several areas, from the sale's effect on endangered species to a lack of detail on waste disposal sites.

For 40 years, the island had a waste disposal policy of ""nothing leaves Plum Island."" All waste was burned or buried on the island, until 1991, the report stated.

Disposal sites in focusThe environmental review notes a 1996 investigation of suspected and known waste disposal sites on Plum Island found it should not be designated a ""superfund"" site. But it said 24 former waste sites have been identified by Homeland Security and the state Department of Environmental Conservation for ""investigation and remediation.""

""To our knowledge, there has been no real-time monitoring or testing to provide data about the current status of remediation at those sites,"" said Leah Schmalz, director of legislative and legal affairs for environmental group Save the Sound. The GSA's review ""does not have as much information as is needed to comply"" with federal law, she said.

A coalition of groups concerned about Long Island Sound requested additional information on the contamination sites from the Department of Homeland Security in November 2010. It never received the information, Schmalz said.

Environmentalists also say the report did not address a concern raised by the EPA in an October letter to the GSA regarding white-tailed deer, which are prevalent on eastern Long Island.

The GSA's environmental review notes that all white-tailed deer have been eliminated from Plum Island -- including ""culling"" the occasional deer that swims over from the North Fork mainland a mile and a half away. None have been spotted since 2004. The review calls it ""a standard safety procedure"" on an island where a primary research focus is foot-and-mouth disease, which could cripple the nation's livestock industry and could be spread by deer.

The EPA's October letter raised the issue of when it would be safe for the deer to live on Plum Island again. The final environmental impact statement does not address the issue.

""It appears the GSA did as poor a quality job with the final environmental impact statement as they did with the draft,"" said John Turner, a spokesman for the Protect Plum Island Coalition and former director of Brookhaven Town's Division of Environmental Protection.

Save the Sound attorney Charles Rothenberger said the final report ""did nothing to resolve in any meaningful way any of the deficiencies that were previously raised.""

The federal government plans to sell Plum Island to help pay for the new facility in Kansas. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center, which opened in 1954 and has been described as ""inadequate"" by Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, will be closed once the Kansas facility is complete.

Long Island officials, environmentalists and members of the New York and Connecticut congressional delegations have been fighting the sale.

Southold Town is considering zoning to prevent residential development on the island, and Rep. Tim Bishop (D-Southampton) has introduced legislation that would remove the requirement the land be sold.","2013-08-14 22:16:30","0","54.0","86.0","29.0","0.0","30.0","1.0","236.0","49.0","0.0","127.0","0.0","23.0","0","833","98.07","60.43","28.14","34.08","23.80","27.37","74.55","41.18","3.84","0.84","0.00","0.36","0.12","0.12","0.24","3.00","11.64","13.93","6.72","1.32","3.84","1.32","11.40","3.72","1.44","1.08","1.44","1.68","2.76","1.56","1.08","0.12","0.36","0.24","4.68","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.00","7.92","2.64","0.96","1.08","1.32","1.08","1.20","2.64","0.48","2.04","0.12","1.32","0.24","1.08","0.00","0.00","7.20","0.84","0.84","3.24","0.24","2.40","5.16","5.28","1.08","14.89","0.96","9.72","4.32","6.12","0.12","0.48","1.44","0.12","0.24","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.00","15.25","4.44","2.88","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.16","4.08","1.32","0.24","0.12","4286","8.73","25.606060606060606","1362","820","35","39.26","14.8","13.6","14.51","15.9","204","17.166666666666668","21.311219512195123","380","23.36","20","0.41","0","23","10","107","1","93","77","1","1","9","148","127","1","32","0","0","11","4","18","0","1","0","20","0","28","32","13","35","12","27","9","0","0","4"

Officials, meeting in Port Jefferson at the second annual Bi-State Long Island Sound Roundtable, discussed strategies for protecting the estuary -- a source of jobs and recreation for residents of both states.

""There is a sense of urgency that we need to gather together,"" said Assemb. Steven Englebright (D-Setauket) during a news conference before the meeting at Port Jefferson's Village Center. ""The legacy of the Long Island Sound is something that our generation will probably determine the fate of.""

The meeting was an informal forum facilitated by the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, which backs efforts to improve water quality.

About a half-dozen Connecticut officials arrived yesterday by ferry, joining Long Island officials such as state Sen. Kenneth LaValle (R-Port Jefferson), Brookhaven Supervisor Edward P. Romaine, Suffolk County Legis. Kara Hahn (D-Setauket) and leaders from Westchester County.

Hahn, chairwoman of the legislature's environment committee, said Sound protection would be good for tourism. ""Every day that a beach is closed is one more day we don't get to enjoy being in the water,"" she said.

Officials planned to discuss the impact of overdevelopment and the effects of natural disasters such as superstorm Sandy on coastal areas along the sound.

"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/hauppauge-sewage-treatment-plant-expansion-nearly-complete-1.6048752","Hauppauge sewage treatment plant expansion nearly complete","Suffolk County expects to complete a nearly $42 million expansion of a sewage treatment plant in the Hauppauge Industrial Park by the end of next month, officials say.

The expansion will supplement the $34 million installation of 72,800 feet of sewer line, upon which Suffolk County broke ground in July, said Gilbert Anderson, county commissioner of public works.

""We are in the process of expanding the treatment plant to be able to facilitate all of the lots within the industrial district,"" he said, adding the new capacity and infrastructure will increase the number of parcels served to nearly 400, up from 149.

""This is the largest expansion of county sewers and county treatment facilities since the 1970s,"" Anderson said.

Officials broke ground on the plant expansion in April 2011. The plant -- between Commerce Drive and Motor Parkway -- will have the capacity to treat 1.65 million gallons of wastewater per day, up from 450,000 gallons, officials said.

Funding for the combined $75.7 million plant and sewer expansion has been bonded in the past five years, Anderson said. The sewer district is expected to pay back the bond through an annual tax.

""Everybody in the district agrees to pay the operation and maintenance portion of the tax,"" he said. ""But in the areas that are expanding, people will have to pay for the construction costs for the expansion through the annual tax.""

Hauppauge Industrial Association Long Island president Terri Alessi-Miceli said the projects were ""vital,"" since the previous sewer system ""was insufficient.""

""This is the second largest industrial park in the Northeast. There are 1,300 companies and 55,000 employees,"" she said. ""You can't do anything else without sewers, so it's one of the things that will afford business owners in this park to expand.""

The plant expansion means a second plant at Oser Avenue will be decommissioned and a major main will be installed to force flow between the two plants. The accompanying sewer line installation calls for construction of two pump stations and is estimated to be completed by 2016, Anderson said.

To build each pump station, the county is purchasing two parcels from the Town of Smithtown for recharge basins, and the town is expected to provide an easement to access the stations, Anderson said. The price of the land buy has not been determined, he said.

Smithtown Supervisor Patrick Vecchio said the expansion work is ""something we've anticipated for . . . years."" Vecchio said last year that he favored lifting height restrictions from 35 feet to 50 feet in the park, but Councilman Robert Creighton, a fellow Republican who is trying to unseat Vecchio, has said he wants to raise building heights up to 62 feet along Motor Parkway.

""We would never be talking about allowing taller buildings in the industrial park if it were not tied to sewer expansion,"" Vecchio said.

Suffolk County Legis. John M. Kennedy Jr. (R-Nesconset) said that to keep ""Suffolk County's economic base growing and robust, it is absolutely critical to invest in this type of infrastructure.""

Anderson said the changes allow not only for economic growth, but ""for further protection of our groundwater, which is our most important natural resource.""","2013-09-10 20:48:11","0","51.0","73.0","27.0","0.0","29.0","0.0","230.0","49.0","0.0","119.0","0.0","22.0","0","564","97.45","73.84","13.43","38.37","19.45","26.24","72.70","42.38","5.85","2.66","0.00","1.24","0.35","1.06","0.00","3.19","9.57","15.60","6.91","1.60","2.84","1.06","12.06","1.42","0.89","0.53","5.32","0.89","1.77","1.24","0.53","0.00","0.18","0.35","7.62","0.00","0.18","0.18","1.06","6.56","0.53","1.06","1.06","1.42","1.06","1.77","3.55","0.18","3.37","0.00","1.06","0.71","0.35","0.00","0.00","6.74","1.60","0.89","3.55","0.53","0.18","4.96","6.38","2.13","14.18","1.06","9.75","3.55","5.50","0.00","0.00","2.66","0.00","0.00","0.53","0.00","0.18","0.35","0.00","0.00","18.62","5.50","5.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.24","4.26","0.89","0.35","0.53","2738","8.03","19.689655172413794","843","557","28","59.74","12.5","9.9","12.65","12.8","120","18.333333333333332","18.577594254937164","293","18.03","2","0.41","0","14","31","60","0","70","28","2","2","9","97","66","0","32","0","0","14","4","10","0","1","1","22","0","28","23","10","13","7","21","4","1","0","0"
"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/nassau-health-dept-gold-coast-mansion-s-sewer-pipe-capped-1.5859657","Nassau Health Dept.: Gold Coast mansion's sewer pipe capped","A pipe that discharged sewage into wetlands adjacent to Crescent Beach in Glen Cove has been sealed with concrete, but the owner could still face legal action, Nassau County Department of Health officials said.

Last month, the health department and the state Department of Environmental Conservation issued violations to Marvin Schein, whose Gold Coast mansion was the source of the sewage.

Schein, 72, said this week that the problem was resolved.

But DEC officials said in a statement that there are ""ongoing settlement negotiations. . . . These violations issued to Mr. Schein have not been modified, revoked or withdrawn.""

Health department spokeswoman Mary Ellen Laurain said in an email that inspectors last week confirmed the pipe was sealed. Last month, the health department issued violations to Schein, saying the flows were ""a public health hazard.""

Then the DEC fined Schein $15,000 and ordered him to remove the pipe.

Schein, who hired an engineer to confirm that the pipe was sealed, said the issue had been overblown. ""It turns out that the water leaving the pipe is actually beneficial to the wetlands because it wasn't black water, it was water coming off of the leaching system,"" he said. ""It was like filtered water and that kind of carries nutrients -- the engineer said -- and that's a good thing and that's really what the wetlands should have.""

DEC spokesman Bill Fonda disagreed in an email. ""Waste water from a residential cesspool, directly discharged to a wetland or to the side of a road, would be a threat to the receiving water body and a public health threat as well,"" he said.

Engineers hired by Glen Cove found the pipe was leaking last month when they were looking for sources of contamination that have kept Crescent Beach closed to the public since 2009.

Schein said his property was not the source of contamination and that he swims at the beach. ""There's no fecal matter going through my pipe into the wetland,"" he said.

But Laurain of the health department said the pipe was a culprit. ""The discharge is a contributing factor to the water quality at Crescent Beach,"" she said. ""We tested it for fecal coliform and enterococci, and the results were indicative for sewage.""

Schein has known about the problem since at least 2011, health department officials said.

The pipe runs under a dirt road; and Schein said bulldozers caused the recent leak. He said he had the pipe capped whenever he learned it was leaking.

When Newsday visited the site last month, the pipe was spurting streams of water like a drinking fountain into the wetlands.

""The discharge was illegal,"" said Glen Cove Mayor Ralph Suozzi. He said it was up to the regulatory agencies to determine whether Schein is now in compliance.","2013-08-10 00:36:05","1","45.0","78.0","28.0","0.0","32.0","0.0","233.0","49.0","0.0","125.0","0.0","23.0","0","492","93.04","76.16","8.61","14.53","18.22","21.34","73.78","45.93","8.33","3.46","0.20","0.61","0.20","2.24","0.20","4.88","11.99","11.99","7.72","2.24","4.67","0.81","15.65","0.61","1.02","1.42","1.02","0.20","2.85","1.02","1.83","0.41","1.02","0.00","9.55","0.00","0.00","0.20","2.03","7.11","1.42","2.03","1.02","0.61","0.20","2.24","4.88","0.61","4.27","0.00","3.86","0.41","1.63","0.00","1.83","5.08","0.61","0.20","3.25","0.41","1.02","9.96","4.27","0.61","12.20","2.44","5.49","4.47","3.46","1.22","0.20","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.20","0.20","0.00","17.28","6.30","4.88","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","1.02","3.66","1.02","0.00","0.20","2337","7.43","16.6","692","491","28","70.63","10.9","7.8","11.37","10.8","91","7.5","16.413441955193484","244","15.27","4","0.44","0","16","5","62","0","52","23","0","1","3","100","54","0","20","0","0","20","4","11","0","0","2","15","0","6","51","11","15","5","12","2","2","1","3"
"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/officials-mastic-beach-missed-sewage-plant-fund-deadlines-1.5900294","Officials: Mastic Beach missed sewage plant fund deadlines","A state environmental agency and Suffolk County officials say Mastic Beach has missed key deadlines to receive funding next year for a proposed sewage treatment plant.

Mayor Bill Biondi said village leaders still plan to apply for grants, even if it is for the following cycle, but Suffolk officials warn the money may no longer be available.

Suffolk officials say the village is not eligible for $30 million in grants and loans with the sewer infrastructure program because it missed the June 4 application deadline, and isn't in the construction phase.

To receive the money, Mastic Beach ""must have a project ready to go,"" said Joshua Slaughter, spokesman for Suffolk Legis. Kate Browning, whose district includes the 3-year-old municipality. He warned the grant money might not be available after next year. County officials say the program may not exist after next year.

At Tuesday's Mastic Beach board meeting, trustees withdrew an agenda item through which they would have chosen one of three engineering firms bidding to design the facility. The board is expected to revisit the issue at a Sept. 10 meeting.

Once the board chooses an engineering firm, it is expected to receive $500,000 in state grants state Sen. Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley) has secured for the village's sewer infrastructure. The money was part of a years-old $2 million Brookhaven Town grant to improve the Mastic Beach, Mastic and Shirley areas.

Mastic Beach is seeking up to $11 million in federal and state monies to design its first sewage-treatment plant, which officials believe would help upgrade residential cesspools and draw commercial businesses. Environmental advocates hope a treatment facility would minimize nitrogen levels in local waterways.

A day after Mastic Beach officials announced plans to pursue funds for the project, the state Environmental Facilities Corporation on Tuesday said the village is not eligible for any of the $450 million in grants and loans available to municipalities in the 2014 federal fiscal year because it did not apply by the Feb. 1 deadline.

The EFC, which manages the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, finances facilities that improve, maintain or protect water quality such as wastewater collection and treatment plants. It also finances local governments and public authorities for planning, design and construction of eligible water quality projects, EFC officials said.

Biondi said he's not deterred. Design research on the treatment plant could take 12 months, after which the village would apply for the funds. ""We're in the initial planning stages,"" the mayor said Tuesday, before the village's monthly meeting.

Village residents and board members seem to agree that a treatment facility is needed.

""The system of cesspools is an old waste solution that does not help the homeowner in the long term and limits commercial expansion,"" resident Geoffrey Slack, 56, said at the meeting.

""I can't see why the government wouldn't raise the funds,"" said Ron Snyder, 49, who plans to have his home connected to the system if it is designed. ""The government should want to do this.""

His wife, Anne Snyder, 45, said the treatment facility discussion is long overdue. ""We're the gateway to the Hamptons. It's a great idea. I'm on board.""

Village trustee Gary Stiriz said bringing a treatment center to the area is ""a necessary part of redevelopment for Mastic Beach.""","2013-08-15 19:26:00","1","43.0","72.0","27.0","0.0","29.0","0.0","230.0","49.0","0.0","119.0","0.0","22.0","0","583","96.06","62.77","9.72","37.93","17.67","27.62","69.81","38.59","5.15","2.06","0.34","0.69","0.17","0.69","0.17","3.09","10.29","11.66","6.35","0.86","3.60","1.89","11.84","2.23","1.20","1.20","3.95","0.51","2.06","1.37","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.34","6.86","0.17","0.00","0.17","0.69","6.86","1.03","0.69","2.57","1.54","0.34","2.23","2.92","0.34","2.57","0.00","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.51","7.72","1.37","2.06","3.77","0.51","0.69","2.74","7.03","1.89","12.86","1.20","6.35","5.83","5.32","1.20","0.86","2.57","0.00","0.17","0.51","0.00","0.17","0.34","0.00","0.00","17.67","5.66","5.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.03","2.40","2.06","0.34","0.86","2888","7.96","19.833333333333332","878","576","31","61.06","11.7","9.4","13.11","12.5","124","13.125","18.051111111111112","300","18.63","7","0.38","0","15","21","62","0","53","41","2","0","11","118","71","0","41","0","0","15","5","15","0","0","0","19","0","29","19","5","9","13","23","5","1","1","1"
"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/southampton-takes-lead-in-cleaning-up-wastewater-1.5664166","Southampton takes lead in cleaning up wastewater","Leading what they hope becomes a massive effort to clean up Suffolk County's waterways one septic system at a time, Southampton Town officials are seeking grants to create a system that would reduce nitrogen in the region's groundwater.

The goal, according to a proposal written last month: to develop an affordable technology that would replace or retrofit individual on-site septic systems so they would significantly reduce nitrogen levels in domestic wastewater.

""The degradation of our water is really a crime, and I would say at this point almost an emergency issue for all of us,"" said Southampton Supervisor Anna Throne-Holst at a Suffolk County Supervisors Association meeting June 28.

She was joined at the meeting by Islip, Babylon and Brookhaven supervisors, who publicly supported the effort.

""Water quality is at the foundation of our economic well-being, our quality of life, everything that drives life as we know it on Long Island.""

Throne-Holst cited increased water quality problems such as algal blooms, red and brown tides and high levels of bacteria as urgent issues for the region. Because about 70 percent of Suffolk is on individual septic systems, the effects of high levels of nitrogen flowing into waterways should be solved by tackling the problem at each site, Throne-Holst said.

But technology available to update antiquated septic systems is cost-prohibitive, and doesn't do enough to reduce the nitrogen in groundwater, she said. ""The systems we have are not dealing with the standards as we know them, and the standards will probably be . . . made harder"" in coming years, she said.

Last month, the town submitted a preliminary application to the Long Island Regional Economic Development Council for $2.7 million in ""transformative"" grant funds to build an incubator facility to develop and test a new system to reduce nitrogen emissions from septic systems.

""It's a generational issue that needs to be licked,"" said Stephen Savage, member of the economic development council and corporate senior vice president of CA Technologies, who described the project as an ideal candidate for the funding. ""It's going to be a huge problem for generations to come.""

The next step, Throne-Holst and Savage said, is to do a feasibility study that would generate interest, mobilize support for the initiative, identify possible partners -- such as universities and environmental groups -- and research what kind of similar technology exists nationwide, Savage said.

Suffolk Planning Commission chairman David Calone said new measures of water protection are needed especially on the East End, where good water quality is key to both the environment and the economy.

""The Southampton proposal will allow us to test a bunch of different products that exist now as well as products being invented right now,"" Calone said. ""To have a facility that could provide real, good scientific data . . . about what works and what doesn't work is very important, because we need to develop decentralized wastewater systems to protect our East End waters.""

"https://www.newsday.com/sports/football/jets/joe-namath-calls-relationship-with-jets-awkward-and-clumsy-1.5369017","Joe Namath calls relationship with Jets 'awkward' and 'clumsy'","Joe Namath is the most iconic of all Jets, but in recent years, he's also been one of the franchise's most outspoken critics. That's why, he said, his relationship with the team is so damaged.

""I wouldn't say communication has been totally cut off,"" Namath told Newsday Thursday. ""I still get along with some of the players and some of the personnel, but it's been a bit awkward. Whenever some of the criticism rubs you the wrong way, it's clumsy. I would say right now it's a clumsy relationship.""

His recent criticism of the Jets has included words such as ""misleading"" and ""deceptive,"" which go beyond questioning play-calling and talent assessment.

""Prior to last season, the team was being touted as the best team that coach [Rex] Ryan has had yet,"" Namath said. ""When I say deceptive, some of the reasons they were giving on why they signed [Tim] Tebow, for example, and why didn't they use him. I find it deceptive when you are getting players for reasons other than winning football games. Is winning the basic goal here, which it should be? I just have had problems with some of the explanations and unexplained moves over the last couple of years.""

Namath, who turns 70 Friday, was speaking on behalf of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's ""Future 50"" expansion and renovation project. He will attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday in Canton, Ohio.

The Jets declined to comment through a team spokesman, but Ryan spoke of Namath at Thursday's OTA in Florham Park, N.J.

""I've always respected and admired Joe Namath,'' Ryan said. ""Does it upset me that he'll make comments? I don't always agree with his comments. But he has a right to them.""

Namath seems to have an optimistic view of the Jets' immediate future. He said he thinks they can make the playoffs in 2013. ""The new batch that's in here, I look for them to win,"" he said.

He bristled at the idea of Ryan being a ""lame-duck"" coach. ""I can understand it a little bit,"" he said. ""The general manager didn't pick the head coach. But in the meantime, he is the head coach and Rex and his team have got to prove they're all worthy of being there the year after.''

Namath thinks Mark Sanchez will remain the starting quarterback. ""Sanchez has an edge, but he's got to show it,'' he said. ""And my guess is that come September, he will be starting because of his experience.""

On WFAN Thursday, Namath said his relationship with team owner Woody Johnson has been reduced to brief encounters. ""It hasn't been the same as it was originally,"" he said. ""We don't talk. [It's just]: 'Hi, how are ya?' ""

Can the relationship be fixed?

""I would think so,"" Namath told Newsday. ""Change is a positive. Change is a constant.""

And can the Jets be fixed?

""I certainly hope so,"" he said. ""I'm a fan, I'm pulling for them.""","2013-05-30 19:22:21","1","41.0","72.0","27.0","0.0","29.0","0.0","240.0","49.0","0.0","120.0","0.0","22.0","0","511","54.86","83.61","14.60","36.06","12.46","16.83","84.34","51.86","13.89","9.98","3.13","0.39","0.78","4.31","1.37","3.91","8.02","11.35","12.72","4.70","5.68","1.17","20.94","4.11","2.15","1.96","0.98","2.35","5.28","2.94","2.35","0.39","0.39","0.20","15.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.50","10.96","2.35","2.74","1.17","2.15","1.57","2.15","4.50","0.59","3.33","0.20","0.39","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.44","2.94","2.15","2.74","2.15","0.39","6.07","13.31","1.37","12.52","1.76","4.11","6.85","2.15","2.94","0.20","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.59","0.00","0.20","0.39","0.00","0.00","30.53","7.24","6.65","0.20","0.00","0.98","0.00","0.59","7.63","6.07","0.00","1.17","2197","6.93","13.325","683","507","41","84.27","9.0","4.6","9.09","6.9","86","6.071428571428571","13.74500986193294","264","12.68","18","0.54","0","17","4","48","0","52","33","0","1","10","62","55","0","21","0","0","55","8","21","0","2","1","10","0","19","25","15","16","23","24","3","1","0","6"

"https://www.newsday.com/news/health/nassau-suffolk-seek-to-create-aquifer-council-1.5534187","Nassau, Suffolk seek to create aquifer council","Legislators in Suffolk and Nassau counties want to create a regional council focused on protecting the drinking water supplies for more than 2.8 million Long Islanders.

A resolution to create the Long Island Commission for Aquifer Protection was introduced in the Suffolk County Legislature on Tuesday, sponsored by Democrats. A similar piece of legislation is expected to be introduced to committee July 1 in Nassau County, sponsored by the Republican majority.

Legislators and advocates want to create a commission because currently no central agency monitors the water supply and recent reports show that the quality of the water in some areas has degraded.

""Our aquifer has a lot of threats,"" Legis. William Spencer (D-Centerport) said. ""It's really to have water accountability. We share this common aquifer.""

Long Island's water needs are served by a network of underground aquifers. The region's sandy soils are conducive to replenishing the water supply, but they also allow contaminants, such as nitrogen, to filter through.

Statewide, there are 1,302 Superfund sites, and it is not uncommon for such sites to be associated with groundwater contamination. Nassau County, with 121, has the largest number in the state; Suffolk is third with 89.

The legislation must go through committees, public hearings and an eventual vote of the full legislature in both counties before the commission can be established. It must be reauthorized in five years.

If approved, a nine-member board will be charged with creating an annual report on the state of the aquifer. Within three years of that report, a resources management plan -- looking at threats, regulations and recommendations -- is due.

Each county executive and legislative presiding officer will appoint one member each and each county board of health will have a representative. The Suffolk County Water Authority, Nassau-Suffolk Water Commissioners Assocation and Long Island Water Conference, a coalition of public and private water suppliers, will also have one seat apiece.

Nassau Presiding Officer Norma L. Gonsalves (R-East Meadow) said the commission would be aimed at protecting residents and groundwater. ""Our aquifers are one of the most vital environmental resources we have on Long Island,"" she said in a statement.

Spencer said there will be no cost to taxpayers. The nine board members will be volunteers and work will be done with existing staff from the member organizations.

""We think most of the work can be utilized using existing resources,"" Suffolk County Water Authority chief executive Jeff Szabo said. ""It's sort of a shared expenditure.""

Many issues related to protecting the aquifer can be more cost-effectively handled on a regional basis, Mike Boufis, chairman of the Long Island Water Conference, said in a statement. ""This commission will create a means for all Long Island water suppliers to work together with regulatory agencies and other water professionals to address regional issues that up to now had to be addressed by individual water suppliers,"" he said.

Critics say the legislation does not go far enough.

""I think it's a good first step, but there are no action items in there to solve problems,"" Citizens Campaign for the Environment executive director Adrienne Esposito said. ""What we don't want to happen is we study the problem to death.""","2013-06-20 21:59:42","1","46.0","85.0","29.0","0.0","26.0","0.0","235.0","49.0","0.0","120.0","0.0","21.0","0","557","94.13","70.50","11.60","45.56","16.88","28.73","77.02","40.93","4.67","2.33","0.18","1.44","0.18","0.36","0.18","2.33","8.44","13.46","9.16","1.80","3.77","1.08","14.18","3.23","2.15","0.18","2.87","2.51","2.87","1.97","0.90","0.36","0.36","0.00","6.46","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.18","7.54","1.62","1.97","1.97","1.08","0.54","1.44","2.33","0.36","1.80","0.18","3.23","0.00","0.36","0.00","2.87","10.59","2.69","2.33","4.31","0.54","1.44","2.15","10.41","1.97","12.93","0.72","9.87","2.15","5.39","0.18","0.36","0.54","0.00","0.18","0.36","0.00","0.18","0.18","0.00","0.00","17.24","5.75","4.85","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.18","1.62","2.87","1.08","0.72","0.00","2827","8.51","17.625","899","551","34","55.03","12.7","9.6","13.51","11.9","142","10.2","18.78852994555354","290","16.59","6","0.42","0","15","15","57","0","59","33","2","3","14","84","80","2","40","0","0","16","3","12","0","1","0","19","0","30","12","12","18","19","13","1","1","0","0"
"https://www.newsday.com/news/health/officials-want-more-plum-island-studies-1.5914643","Officials want more Plum Island studies","Members of New York's congressional delegation have called on federal agencies to further study environmental contamination on Plum Island caused by the high security animal disease lab there.

A letter sent Friday to the federal agencies in charge of operating and shuttering the Plum Island Animal Disease Center outlined eight areas that they want studied, including soil and groundwater contamination and an inventory of solid waste sites.

""Our offices have been made aware of several outstanding environmental concerns that were not adequately addressed,"" wrote Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Sen. Charles Schumer and Rep. Tim Bishop (D-Southampton). The joint letter was sent to officials at the General Services Administration, which is handling the sale of the island, and Department of Homeland Security, which runs the lab.

The letter cited concerns raised by local environmentalists and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, about the GSA's final environmental impact statement.

The EPA said the report ""does not provide a sufficiently detailed evaluation of the potential impacts of the sale of Plum Island."" That includes lacking a cleanup plan for lingering pathogens and details about other contamination.

The lab, which has operated off the eastern tip of Long Island since 1954, is slated to be closed after the federal government builds a $1 billion high-tech National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Kansas, scheduled for completion in 2019.

Federal law requires the island be sold to the highest bidder to pay for the new lab.

The elected officials requested an ""inventory and assessment"" on issues that include fuel storage infrastructure, the sewage treatment facility, asbestos and drinking water.

But they also want to keep open the research facility, which employs 100 scientists and 300 support personnel.

""As you are aware, we have supported the work done at PIADC over the years and are in favor of keeping this facility operational,"" they wrote. ""Regardless of the future of Plum Island, it is important that full disclosure and reporting on environmental issues is addressed.""

The GSA did not respond to a request for comment on the letter Friday. But previously, both the GSA and Homeland Security defended the environmental review. The GSA said it ""identifies measures to mitigate those impacts where appropriate.""

The beaches are closed to swimming as a precautionary measure, the Nassau County Department of Health said, citing recent heavy rains.

Stormwater runoff can sweep bacteria and pathogens into streams and bays, causing bacterial levels to spike, according to health officials.

Fourteen closed beaches are on the North Shore: Centre Island Sound, Creek Club, Lattingtown Beach, Laurel Hollow Beach, Morgan Sound, North Hempstead Beach Park, Piping Rock Beach Club, Pryibil Beach, Ransom Beach, Roosevelt Beach, Sea Cliff Village Beach, Soundside Beach, Stehli Beach and Tappen Beach.

Five are on the South Shore including: Biltmore Beach Club, Hewlett Point Beach, Island Park Beach, Merrick Estates Civic Association and Philip Healey Beach.

Health department representatives are available weekdays, from 9 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., at 516-227-9717.","2013-08-14 12:36:00","1","34.0","74.0","28.0","0.0","14.0","0.0","221.0","42.0","0.0","116.0","0.0","15.0","0","155","97.52","57.67","15.22","37.17","19.38","25.81","59.35","20.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.87","10.32","3.23","0.00","3.87","0.00","3.87","1.94","1.29","0.00","7.74","0.00","0.65","0.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.29","0.65","0.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.87","0.00","3.23","0.65","2.58","0.00","2.58","0.00","0.00","4.52","2.58","0.00","1.94","0.00","0.00","1.29","3.23","0.00","14.19","0.65","12.26","1.29","1.94","15.48","0.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","26.45","7.10","14.84","1.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.58","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","827","9.68","22.142857142857142","226","148","8","61.16","11.0","9.3","17.11","15.8","48","12.25","22.372972972972974","104","19.43","0","0.21","0","5","11","6","0","11","5","0","0","1","10","67","0","16","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","4","0","2","4","5","2","5","1","0","0","0","0"
"https://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/groups-oppose-new-epa-beach-water-quality-standards-1.5599267","Groups oppose new EPA beach water quality standards","Two New York-based environmental groups are challenging federal Environmental Protection Agency water quality standards that determine whether a beach is safe for public use, saying the new regulations are too lax.

Manhattan-based Waterkeeper Alliance and Riverkeeper in upstate Ossining joined five other groups from across the country in filing an ""intent to sue"" notice on June 20.

""The EPA is not relying on the best science and not setting strict enough regulations,"" said Phillip Musegaas, Hudson River program director for Riverkeeper. ""We want the EPA to make sure that when there are bacteria, that they are not allowing people to swim in it.""

The EPA declined to comment on the potential litigation.

The environmental groups oppose changes the agency made to its recreational water quality criteria in November.

Although state health departments can create their own beach sanitation rules, the EPA standard serves as a guide for determining if a swimming beach should be closed, said EPA spokesman Dale Kemery.

Musegaas said tough environmental standards for beaches are a must in New York because overflows from sewage treatment systems sometimes spill into harbors.

A Riverkeeper report found beach water samples taken in New York City from 2006 to 2011 failed EPA standards 24 percent of the time. Nationwide, 7 percent of beach water samples failed during the same period.

Under the revised standard -- the first update since 1986 -- 10 percent of water samples taken each month can exceed EPA's bacteria contamination limit without triggering a beach closure. The previous criteria prohibited beach use after a single water sample exceeded the contamination limit, said Mary Ellen Laurain, spokeswoman for the Nassau County Department of Health.","2013-06-30 21:15:34","1","39.0","80.0","28.0","0.0","26.0","0.0","233.0","49.0","0.0","119.0","0.0","21.0","0","299","98.12","61.85","27.39","50.76","19.93","28.43","73.91","34.11","4.01","1.67","0.00","0.67","0.33","0.00","0.67","2.34","9.03","13.04","4.01","1.00","3.01","1.34","11.37","4.68","2.01","0.67","3.68","4.01","3.01","2.01","0.67","0.00","0.00","0.67","6.02","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.70","1.67","4.35","1.34","1.00","0.67","2.68","2.68","0.00","2.68","0.00","2.68","0.00","0.67","0.00","2.01","10.37","2.34","3.01","4.01","1.67","1.34","4.01","6.35","0.33","14.38","1.00","7.36","6.02","5.02","3.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.00","12.71","4.68","3.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.33","2.01","2.01","0.33","0.00","0.00","1557","8.98","20.0","472","297","15","51.38","12.9","11.0","14.21","14.0","82","12.75","20.963771043771047","194","19.27","8","0.33","0","2","9","27","0","38","23","0","2","4","53","46","0","23","0","0","5","3","5","0","0","0","7","0","7","12","10","6","11","4","1","0","0","1"

Sen. Ralph Marino, right, and David Peirez, attorney for Shore Realty Corp., look over pipes and valves used in gathering hazardous waste materials at Applied Environmental Services on Shore Road in Glenwood Landing. The above-ground storage tank in the background holds 45,672 gallons of waste oil. Shore Realty purchased the property in 1983 and evicted Applied Environmental in January 1984. (Feb. 24, 1984)



From 1980 to 1983 at the four-acre site, Applied Environmental recovered fuels from hazardous wastes. The site had seven underground tanks and 11 above-ground tanks; spills and leaks caused soil and groundwater contamination. Before 1980, the site was operated by a petrochemical company; several spills happened during that company’s tenure on the property including an overturned tank trailer that spilled 3,000 gallons of the volatile organic compound toluene.

From 1915 to 2000, the plating company on New Hyde Park Road electroplated small products such as car antennas and ballpoint pen parts. The facility sent wastewater with heavy metals and organic contaminants into four leaching pits at the back of the property. Groundwater monitoring wells on and off the site showed the presence of chromium, cadmium and nickel; on-site wells also showed volatile organic compounds contamination. Source: EPA

The Islip Municipal Sanitary Landfill, which covers about 55 acres, has been operated by the town since 1963. In 1978, 50 or more 55-gallon drums containing a mixture of tetrachloroethene and other liquids were allegedly disposed at the site. This is the only reported case of hazardous waste disposal on the property. The landfill stopped taking waste in December 1990. Source: EPA

The Liberty Industrial site, a 30-acre lot on Motor Avenue in Farmingdale, was used for manufacturing plane parts and associated metal-finishing activities during World War II and the Korean War. It was made into an industrial park in the late 1950s and used for operations such as metal plating and finishing and fiberglass product manufacturing. The property was then used for light manufacturing and warehousing from the 1980s on. Soil and groundwater are contaminated with heavy metals such as cadmium and chromium and volatile organic compounds such as dichloroethene, trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene. Source: EPA

The Superfund site is made up of three parts — the former LI Tungsten facility, located on a 26-acre lot on Herb Hill Road; the Captain's Cove property, a 23-acre lot that is bordered by Hempstead Harbor to the west; and the Glen Cove Creek. The LI Tungsten facility's operations involved the processing of ore and scrap tungsten concentrates to metal tungsten powder and tungsten carbide powder. Other specialty metal products were also made there. The Captain's Cove property was used as a dump for a variety of wastes; radioactive materials were found in Glen Cove Creek in 2001. Source: EPA

A study is underway by the Town of Brookhaven to determine possible future uses for the former Lawrence Aviation site on Sheep Pasture Road in Port Jefferson Station. (Aug. 20, 2013)



Founded in 1959, Lawrence Aviation manufactured titanium sheeting for the aeronautics industry. Past disposal practices and the presence of leaking drums resulted in violations cited by both the Suffolk County Department of Health Services and the state Department of Environmental Conservation. In 1980, Lawrence Aviation smashed more than 1,600 drums, allowing their contents to spill on the ground. The drums contained trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, hydrofluoric acid, nitric acids, waste sludges containing acid, salt wastes, hydraulic oils and other plant wastes. Source: EPA

The Stanton Cleaners area groundwater contamination site includes an active dry cleaning business on Cutter Mill Road in Great Neck. Because of past disposal practices, tetrachloroethene or PCE, a volatile organic compound, migrated from the subsurface soils into the indoor air environments of affected buildings adjacent to the property and into the groundwater.

The Town of Oyster Bay began operations at the landfill, located on a 68-acre site above the Magothy Aquifer, in 1957; it remained active through 1986. It was first used for disposal of incinerator residue before the town opened it to garbage and trash in 1967. Liquid and solid industrial process wastes and damaged drums containing organic residues went into the landfill from 1968 until 1978. After 1978, metal hydroxide sludges became the only industrial waste dropped there. Groundwater in the area is contaminated with volatile organic compounds. Source: EPA

"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/new-plan-focuses-on-lowering-long-island-s-nitrogen-pollution-1.6049190","New plan focuses on lowering Long Island's nitrogen pollution","A coalition of environmental groups Tuesday announced a $3 million, three-year public education campaign to rally Long Islanders and pressure politicians to save the region's threatened water system.

Leaders of the newly formed Long Island Clean Water Partnership said at a news conference in Farmingdale that their groups will spend $400,000 a year for three years on TV ads alone. The message: Nitrogen pollution from septic systems and other sources is endangering the water supply and prompting large numbers of beach and lake closings.

""We just had the worst summer ever with pollution,"" said Adrienne Esposito of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, a member of the coalition. ""We're losing the battle of the bays. Our bays are dying.""

Environmentalists and scientists said one of the principal culprits is nitrogen from sewage that seeps into the groundwater and then into bays and harbors. They also called on the public to do more to prevent polluted runoff and politicians to strengthen environmental protections for the region.

The TV ads have already started airing; radio ads and door-to-door visits in some neighborhoods are also planned, officials said. Funding for the effort came from participating groups and several Long Island foundations.

""Long Island's elected officials need to take action now to protect our most valuable resource -- our water -- before it's too late,"" said Richard Amper, executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society. The coalition also includes The Nature Conservancy and the Group for the East End.

This summer saw a dramatic increase in pollution-related beach and lake closings, often because of outbreaks of harmful algae linked to excessive nitrogen. Northport Harbor was closed in May and Lake Ronkonkoma Beach was closed in July and August.

Amper said the campaign will help educate people about many of their actions that damage the water supply, such as using too much fertilizer or flushing unused medicine down their toilets.

Many people pour damaging chemicals, such as oven cleaners and degreasers, down the kitchen sink -- not thinking that they will end up in the water supply, said Bob Deluca of the Group for the East End.

"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/nassau-eyes-borrowing-to-pay-for-sewage-plant-fixes-1.5792726","Nassau eyes borrowing to pay for sewage plant fixes","Nassau's Legislature will once again consider a borrowing request to pay for extensive repairs to the damaged Bay Park Sewage Treatment plant after three key committees approved $451.2 million in borrowing Monday for the repairs and other sewage-system upgrades.

The Republican-controlled Finance, Public Works and Rules committees all approved the borrowing requests put forth by Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano and the public works department. The request comes two weeks after the full legislature approved borrowing nearly $260 million to fix the aging plant that was damaged during superstorm Sandy.

Mangano has requested $722 million in borrowing to repair the plant, located in East Rockaway, but the legislature's Democratic caucus has opposed borrowing the full amount all at once, arguing additional oversight is needed to ensure the money is spent as intended.

""We are committed toward doing the entire amount, but we truly believe $260 million gets that process rolling,"" Minority Leader Kevan Abrahams (D-Freeport) said during the Finance Committee meeting.

Legis. Dave Denenberg (D-Merrick) broke from party ranks and voted for the additional bonding as a member of the Finance and Public Works committees.

Denenberg said since 2010 he has been calling on the county to hold public hearings on the state of the county's sewer-treatment plants.

""It's incumbent upon us to do our job,"" Denenberg said.

Legis. Richard Nicolello (R-New Hyde Park), chairman of the Finance Committee, criticized Democrats, saying they were attempting to ""slow down"" the project.

""From a political standpoint, why would you want to slow this down?"" Nicolello said.

The bonding request came in a series of 12 separate measures presented to committee members. The largest request -- $326.2 million -- would be used to replace and elevate the plant's electrical distribution system, public works officials said at the meeting.

Another $72.5 million would be directed toward ""hardening"" the plant's exterior to protect it from future storms, Deputy Public Works Commissioner Richard Millet said.

""We're still looking at various options,"" Millet told lawmakers. ""A dike with sea walls, it might be some sort of retractable wall system, as well as an exterior pump system.""

Deputy Public Works Commissioner Ken Arnold told lawmakers the money was needed as the county seeks reimbursement for the project from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as ""a good-faith effort to the federal government that we're moving forward on these projects.""

The damaged plant serves 40 percent of the county's population -- about 520,000 residents -- and was knocked offline for two days after 9 feet of saltwater entered the plant during the Oct. 29 storm. The plant has since run on generators at a cost of $700,000 a month, according to county officials.","2013-07-29 22:13:39","1","44.0","77.0","29.0","0.0","26.0","1.0","231.0","49.0","0.0","121.0","0.0","22.0","0","481","98.73","84.09","11.27","40.75","20.04","29.73","72.97","37.63","4.57","2.49","0.00","1.66","0.42","0.21","0.21","2.08","9.98","15.18","4.78","1.46","3.33","0.00","12.27","4.16","2.29","0.21","5.41","2.08","3.33","2.08","1.25","0.00","0.42","0.21","8.73","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.21","6.24","0.62","1.46","1.25","1.04","1.04","0.83","2.29","0.42","1.66","0.21","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.81","2.29","1.87","6.03","0.62","0.21","4.37","5.82","0.62","13.72","2.29","7.48","4.78","7.48","0.21","0.21","3.33","0.21","0.00","0.62","0.00","0.21","0.21","0.21","0.00","20.79","4.78","4.37","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.00","3.33","3.33","2.08","1.25","1.46","2442","8.65","21.47826086956522","744","471","22","49.75","13.5","11.6","14.39","15.0","118","8.7","20.581231422505308","277","19.78","4","0.37","0","10","27","53","0","55","26","0","1","5","79","75","1","23","0","0","12","3","9","0","0","4","15","0","16","23","16","17","6","15","2","0","0","1"

"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/officials-toxic-rust-tide-returns-to-east-end-1.5920797","Officials: Toxic rust tide returns to East End","A toxic rust tide caused by human waste, farm fertilizer and other pollutants, has returned for the 10th straight year to the environmentally fragile wildlife estuaries and salt water bays on Long Island's east end, officials said.

The collection of algae, which gets its name from the brown and orange hue that upon its arrival, replaces the clear blue tint on the water's surface, has been detected in the west end of the Peconic Estuary and Shinnecock and Flanders bays, said Christopher Gobler, a professor at the Stony Brook University School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences.

The algae can kill fish in hours, and shellfish in days, he said.

At the Peconic Estuary, the algae was detected at densities exceeding 10,000 cells per milliliter. At Shinnecock and Flanders, densities exceeded 1,000 cells per milliliter in the bays as well as their tributaries like Meetinghouse Creek, Gobler said, adding that 500 cells per milliliter can be deadly to marine life.

It's been the same every summer since 2004, Gobler said. Before then, the rust tide was never reported in Long Island waters.

The estuary forms at the end of the 15-mile long Peconic River, which stretches through farmland, wooded areas and the town of Riverhead.

Gobler said it's possible the organism was newly introduced to the area in 2004 or always existed but nitrogen levels, which intensify the algae blooms, happened to grow to ideal levels. Nitrogen can be found in urine and fertilizer, and can pollute waterways when waste water is not treated properly, Gobler said.

""It's here and it's not going away,"" he said of the rust tide.

The lethalness of the latest bloom will depend on its duration, Gobler said. It is expected to spread in coming weeks, typically extending into fall or until water temperatures drop below 60 degrees.

The organism makes cysts, or seeds, which sit at the bottom of the bay and emerge each summer to start a bloom. At the end of the bloom, they turn back into cysts and once again settle to the bay bottom, allowing them to return year after year.

In May, Peconic Baykeeper, a Quogue-based nonprofit, sued the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation for failing to protect surface waters from sewage pollution. The group also filed a notice of intent to sue against Stony Brook Southampton and the state office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation in July for the same reason, said Kevin McAllister, the group's president.

He said the rust tide doesn't just do damage to marine life.

Dirty water with fewer fish could mean fewer tourists, he said. Instead, tourists could take their business to the New Jersey shore or Cape Cod.

""A dead bay is not OK,"" McAllister said. ""The public at large has to start to rally and demand attention from government officials.""","2013-08-19 22:15:27","0","45.0","84.0","29.0","0.0","29.0","0.0","235.0","49.0","0.0","123.0","0.0","22.0","0","508","96.93","63.10","47.80","29.05","21.17","19.88","70.47","41.73","5.12","2.17","0.00","0.39","0.20","0.79","0.79","2.95","9.45","15.35","5.31","1.97","5.71","0.98","10.63","4.13","2.36","0.98","1.97","1.38","1.38","0.79","0.59","0.00","0.20","0.20","5.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.79","6.89","1.18","1.57","0.79","1.57","0.79","2.17","4.13","0.98","2.76","0.20","2.17","0.20","0.98","0.00","0.98","5.12","0.79","0.39","3.15","0.79","0.39","3.94","6.10","1.18","18.90","1.57","10.83","6.69","2.95","0.20","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.59","0.59","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.20","0.00","16.34","4.72","8.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.59","1.18","1.77","0.00","0.00","2392","8.23","21.541666666666668","733","503","24","58.62","12.2","10.3","11.6","12.5","113","17.666666666666668","19.386083499005963","284","19.71","3","0.41","0","23","10","49","0","63","20","2","1","7","92","65","1","31","0","0","12","7","22","0","0","1","16","0","24","24","7","14","6","14","5","0","0","1"
"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/brown-tide-threatens-south-shore-bays-1.5433448","Brown tide threatens South Shore bays","The dreaded brown tide is back in some South Shore bays, threatening everything from eelgrass to scallops, but Great South Bay has been spared so far thanks to superstorm Sandy, a marine scientist said Friday.

Levels of the tiny algae causing the destructive blooms have reached densities of 800,000 cells per milliliter in western Shinnecock Bay, said Christopher Gobler, a professor with Stony Brook University's School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences. Densities above 50,000 cells can be harmful to marine life.

Other areas badly affected by brown tide are eastern Moriches Bay and Quantuck Bay. The latest tests were conducted June 1.

""It's not good news,"" Gobler said. ""It's still a little early. Things could ramp up further through the month of June.""

So far at least, the current levels are not as high as last year, when they hit 2 million cells per milliliter.

While not harmful to humans, brown tides are a problem for eelgrass and bay scallops, and to a lesser degree other shellfish and finfish. It first appeared in large amounts in Long Island waters in 1985. Its main cause is nitrogen emanating from septic systems, Gobler said.

""I'm fishing in the western Shinnecock Bay and the water is terrible,"" said Edward Warner Jr., a Town of Southampton trustee and a professional bayman. He said it had been that way for the past two years ""and it's progressively gotten worse.""

""Every year the brown tide seems to appear at the same time the shellfish spawn,"" he said.

The situation in the Great South Bay is better, Gobler said. There, levels are between 10,000 and 20,000 cells per milliliter.

The creation of a new inlet on the eastern end of Fire Island after Sandy is probably helping to ""flush out"" the brown tide from the bay, Gobler said.

Carl LoBue, a senior marine scientist with the Nature Conservancy on Long Island, said that could be good news for his group's efforts to revive the bay's clam population.

""The Great South Bay has looked better than I have seen in years,"" LoBue said.","2013-06-07 21:32:49","0","41.0","77.0","29.0","0.0","25.0","0.0","230.0","49.0","0.0","117.0","0.0","21.0","0","382","95.41","63.32","39.29","30.17","17.36","18.32","71.47","39.53","5.50","2.36","0.52","0.52","0.26","0.79","0.26","3.14","8.64","13.87","6.81","1.83","4.45","0.79","12.30","8.38","2.88","0.26","3.66","1.31","5.50","2.88","2.62","0.52","0.52","0.00","5.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.79","5.76","0.52","1.05","0.79","1.31","0.52","1.83","6.54","2.62","3.14","0.79","0.52","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.26","8.12","0.79","1.31","3.14","2.36","1.31","5.50","7.07","0.00","18.06","0.00","12.04","6.28","3.14","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","18.59","6.02","6.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","3.66","2.09","0.00","0.00","1746","7.93","17.727272727272727","512","377","23","71.75","9.8","7.3","10.73","9.7","83","8.5","17.366366047745355","222","16.5","2","0.4","0","11","13","35","0","45","37","3","2","3","51","63","1","23","0","0","11","4","14","1","0","3","9","0","9","17","6","8","8","11","0","0","0","1"
"https://www.newsday.com/sports/media/mike-francesa-editorial-control-played-role-in-his-departure-from-yes-1.6622060","Mike Francesa: Editorial control played role in his departure from YES","Mike Francesa confirmed Monday that his radio show no longer will be simulcast on the YES Network after Jan. 31, a development he attributed in part to . . . Alex Rodriguez!

""Was A-Rod an issue? I'm sure he was, at some level; I guarantee he was,"" Francesa said on the air, a reference to the in-studio interview last month in which Rodriguez gave his side in his ongoing dispute with Major League Baseball over his 211-game suspension.

Francesa appeared to be alluding to the Yankees' presumed displeasure with him for providing Rodriguez a platform on a channel they partially own, as well as for his relatively sympathetic take on the A-Rod controversy.

While Francesa's tone was appreciative and he praised YES for being ""great partners in every way"" since 2002, he suggested YES and/or the Yankees eventually grew tired of their inability to control his content.

""It never is one reason,"" he said. ""You'll see [reported] that economics is an issue . . . Economics is always an issue; that's just the way it is. Is it the only issue? No, it's not the only issue. There are other issues.

""Editorial control is definitely an issue; it always has been an issue. It's always been a touchy issue. It almost ended the show a couple of times through the years . . . It's always been an issue. If they tell you it's not an issue, they're not telling you the truth.""

A YES spokesman declined to comment on those remarks.

The original ""Mike and the Mad Dog"" simulcast, which Francesa said was the late George Steinbrenner's idea, was a pioneering show in what has become a common practice. Now it will end just as WFAN becomes the Yankees' radio home for 2014, which would have been a natural fit.

Francesa's simulcast is expected to be replaced by another neat fit: Michael Kay's ESPN New York radio show. Kay is YES' Yankees play-by-play man.

(It is not clear where Kay will do the show during baseball season; CBS, which owns WFAN, has local radio rights at Yankee Stadium, and Kay has not been permitted to host his radio show inside the building.)

Francesa is likely to land on another television outlet, perhaps MSG, which made an offer for his show in 2009 that YES matched. He said he has not had any substantive discussions yet.

Francesa said he has known since the summer that YES would not renew its contract with his show. He said there had been no discussions about a new deal and acknowledged, ""It's not a cheap show; it's an expensive show."" Kay's is certain to come more cheaply.

""There have been a couple of rocky days through the years,"" Francesa said, ""but I'd say for the most part it's been a wonderful, wonderful relationship. It really has.""","2013-12-16 19:44:00","1","39.0","72.0","27.0","0.0","29.0","0.0","230.0","49.0","0.0","118.0","0.0","22.0","0","485","68.87","73.87","9.10","78.63","15.16","19.59","81.65","51.96","12.78","6.39","0.62","0.21","0.82","4.12","0.62","6.39","9.48","11.34","12.58","4.12","2.47","2.47","16.70","3.92","1.44","1.44","1.24","2.27","3.30","3.09","0.21","0.00","0.21","0.00","11.13","0.00","0.41","0.00","4.33","10.52","1.86","1.65","0.82","1.86","2.47","2.68","6.19","2.68","3.30","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.00","3.71","1.44","0.41","1.44","0.41","0.00","6.19","9.28","1.24","12.78","0.62","6.19","5.77","1.86","2.68","0.41","0.82","0.00","0.00","2.06","0.00","0.21","1.65","0.21","0.00","23.51","7.22","4.54","0.21","1.03","0.41","0.21","1.24","3.51","4.12","0.41","0.62","2147","7.41","13.567567567567568","678","478","31","72.76","10.2","6.9","10.15","8.8","91","8.3","15.775062761506277","251","12.41","18","0.51","0","7","6","51","0","48","24","1","1","5","80","57","1","12","0","0","36","12","30","1","0","0","12","0","13","35","6","16","12","25","6","1","0","1"

"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/sandy-cleanup-workers-treated-as-independent-contractors-1.6412051","Sandy cleanup workers treated as independent contractors","Three of the men hired to help clear the Long Island Rail Road of downed trees were classified as independent contractors, a common method employers use to get around paying workers prevailing wage rates, prosecutors and labor department officials said.

Salaam Saffiy, 46, a former Miami resident who now lives in Philadelphia, worked for Custom Tree Care, a Topeka, Kan.-based subcontractor for Huntington-based Looks Great Services Inc., clearing the railroad.

Saffiy, William Moore and Troy Roberts said they became suspicious of what they would be paid after they were told by Custom Tree Care to fill out a 1099 tax form, the IRS instrument used by corporations to document payments to independent contractors.

Saffiy, who like Moore and Roberts signed the form, said he grew more concerned after his first full week's paycheck for $850 was smaller than he expected and there was no accompanying paperwork showing the number of hours he worked or benefits earned.

Worker misclassification deprives the government of revenue and puts law-abiding contractors at a disadvantage because it forces them to compete against firms that illegally cut payroll costs, according to experts.

Under New York State labor law, ""laborers, workers and mechanics"" are entitled to prevailing wages. By misclassifying employees as independent contractors, employers get out of having to pay prevailing wages.

In 2011, the Joint Enforcement Task Force on Employee Misclassification appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo found 19,600 instances that year of employee misclassification and $412 million in unreported wages statewide. In 2010, the White House estimated that increased enforcement nationally could yield in the next decade $7 billion in revenue and penalties.

Saffiy said he helped remove mountains of debris in New Orleans after Katrina struck in August 2005 and after other major disasters in the Gulf States. Because of his experiences he and the workers he traveled with to Long Island for Sandy expected they would be paid New York State prevailing wages.

Custom Tree Care CEO Greg Gathers declined to be interviewed for this story. A spokesman for Looks Great Services referred questions to Custom Tree Care and declined to make the company's president, Kristian Agoglia, available for an interview.

Saffiy said two weeks into the work that he, Moore and Roberts received ATM cards and were told by the company supervisor that's how they would now be paid. The men were instructed they could make withdrawals from their card weekly. They received no further paperwork from the company showing an hourly wage breakdown, overtime payments, or whether benefits were paid and taxes taken out.

By Nov. 13, the workers had learned from the state labor department the rate they should have been paid -- about $1,665 for a 40-hour workweek, including benefits. Saffiy and his co-workers said they worked at least 12-hour days, seven days a week, and qualified for overtime payments.

""I knew the pay I was supposed to get and I kept telling the supervisor, 'Hey man, we're supposed to get prevailing wage,' "" he said.

Under the state's Construction Industry Fair Play Act, passed in 2010, workers are considered company employees unless a worker is free from direction and control in performing the job; the work to be performed isn't part of the usual work done by the business that hired the individual; or the worker has an independently established business.

Tension between management and employees was constant during the LIRR cleanup, said Aaron Mathis, 34, of Topeka, Kan., who worked for Custom Tree Care and who supplied copies of his payroll records to Newsday.

""They were saying it wasn't a prevailing wage job,"" said Mathis, who has sole custody of his 6-year-old son. ""They just acted like we didn't know what we were talking about.""

Roberts, 36, a fifth Custom Tree Care worker from Houston who hasn't filed a wage verification complaint with the state department of labor, said he drove three days to New York with Saffiy and Moore, 41, of Orange, Texas. He was looking forward to $27 an hour to recoup the money he'd already spent on travel costs.

""That's the only reason I went there to New York,"" Roberts said. ""I wouldn't have gone 5,000 miles for $9 an hour.""","2013-11-09 20:42:00","1","49.0","84.0","30.0","0.0","27.0","1.0","233.0","49.0","0.0","123.0","0.0","22.0","0","739","94.07","78.38","7.40","45.66","23.09","23.95","77.13","40.19","7.98","5.41","0.68","0.68","0.14","2.17","1.76","2.57","7.17","14.61","5.68","1.49","4.33","0.95","15.29","3.92","1.89","1.35","4.33","0.41","3.11","2.03","0.95","0.27","0.00","0.14","10.28","0.14","0.00","0.00","2.71","6.90","1.49","2.30","1.22","0.81","0.14","1.62","3.38","1.22","1.89","0.14","0.14","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","9.47","1.08","2.57","5.55","1.62","0.41","8.39","5.82","0.27","11.91","1.76","5.01","5.55","12.99","0.54","0.27","5.28","0.00","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.14","0.14","0.00","0.00","17.73","4.74","6.77","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","1.49","1.62","2.03","0.00","0.81","3590","7.99","25.1","1081","728","33","57.5","12.7","10.7","12.65","13.9","150","10.3","19.08175824175824","389","23.17","11","0.4","0","25","30","55","0","88","31","1","1","6","102","112","4","57","0","0","34","8","12","1","0","3","22","0","20","58","18","29","11","11","4","8","0","1"
"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/officials-say-some-sandy-cleanup-workers-were-underpaid-1.6411825","Officials say some Sandy cleanup workers were underpaid","State labor law governing how cleanup crews should be paid was repeatedly violated in the chaotic aftermath of superstorm Sandy, potentially depriving hundreds of workers of hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages and benefits, officials said.

The losses occurred when some cleanup contractors and subcontractors responding to the disaster failed to pay New York State-mandated wages, required for certain types of work performed for municipalities, governmental agencies and other public entities, records show.

In addition, local governments' role in interpreting the law and the state's own conflicting signals helped foster an environment where the wage requirements were not always followed in the weeks and months after Sandy, experts and officials said.

""There's a practical consideration for us locally,"" said state Sen. Kemp Hannon (R-Garden City), who wrote in July to Peter Rivera, the commissioner of the New York State Department of Labor, urging speedy resolutions for workers. ""If we mistreat workers this time, who will come to help us after a disaster, what do we do next time around?""

Sandy destroyed or damaged more than 50,000 Long Island homes, caused an estimated $8.4 billion in property and economic losses, and left in its wake more than 3 million cubic yards of debris.

Removing that debris cost taxpayers more than $300 million in the 12 months since the storm, $270.8 million from the federal government.

To do the cleanup, the state, counties, towns and various local agencies hired contractors, some of whom hired subcontractors from other parts of the country.

In one example, workers hired to clear the Long Island Rail Road tracks of trees and debris were paid at barely a quarter of the hourly rate and benefits called for under state law. They were underpaid further on overtime to which they were legally entitled, according to their pay stubs and the state wage schedules.

Four of these workers -- from Texas, Philadelphia and Kansas -- await a hearing before a labor department administrative law judge this week, more than a year after Sandy hit, in a bid to secure what the department has estimated they are owed: about $60,000. The four were part of a crew of around 20 working for a Topeka, Kan.-based firm, Custom Tree Care, which was hired by Looks Great Services of Huntington. Workers have two years from their last date worked to file a claim with the department.

An additional 40 workers, employed by another dozen contractors, had received more than $113,000 in back wages and benefits by late August after post-Sandy wage verification investigations on Long Island by the state labor department, according to officials and records.

Suffolk DA investigates

Local prosecutors also continue to investigate whether workers were paid the proper prevailing wages, which are based on what is paid to union members in the locality where the work is performed, for Sandy debris removal.

In Suffolk, the district attorney's office so far has investigated ""a couple of hundred"" prevailing-wage cases related to Sandy -- more than four times the caseload of an average year, officials said.

Several potential prosecutions have been identified but it is possible they could be settled with back wages and benefits paid to workers, said Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney Christopher Nicolino.

The Nassau County district attorney's office has investigated 16 Sandy contractors and found violations in seven cases with about $424,000 in wages owed to workers, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for District Attorney Kathleen Rice.

Tarek described Sandy prevailing-wage violations as ""crimes of opportunity"" fueled by huge amounts of federal aid. He said the district attorney anticipated both civil restitutions to workers as well as prosecutions of contractors.

""We won't tolerate unscrupulous businesses cheating workers on Long Island,"" said Rice. ""Whether it's after a major disaster like Sandy, or during any other time of year.""

Suffolk District Attorney Thomas Spota said his office's investigations and reviews of records from five towns show state labor law is too complex and open to interpretation.

""I don't think anybody in municipal governments really understands . . . what prevailing wages are,"" he said. ""Because the law is so ambiguous.""

Law passed back in 1894

The confusion was widespread. Newsday's examination found:

The state's prevailing-wage law, passed in 1894, covers different facets of public work with different record-keeping requirements that more than a century later do not clearly apply in the wake of a natural disaster. The law is also open to interpretation, experienced labor lawyers and municipal officials say, enabling different responses between governments.

The state Department of Labor sowed widespread confusion among governments and contractors about the meaning of prevailing-wage law during the Sandy recovery, when and if it applied, and what kinds of work it covered. In 2011 in the wake of Hurricane Irene, a labor department official told a local contractor that tree trimming and tree removal along the roads weren't covered by New York's prevailing-wage laws; in May, the same official wrote to Suffolk County that any items ""deconstructed"" to clear the roadways, including trees, are covered by Article 8 of state prevailing-wage law -- but sand removal isn't.

The two counties followed different paths, with Suffolk County's two largest debris cleanup contractors, Tennessee-based Phillips & Jordan and Plainview-based Grace Industries, paying workers prevailing wages, while in Nassau, officials determined tens of millions of dollars paid to its largest contractor, Looks Great Services, did not fall within prevailing-wage requirements.

Towns in both counties took different positions, with Islip and Smithtown in Suffolk hewing to the law, while Huntington did not comply with the law because it did not require some cleanup contractors to supply certified payrolls. At least two Nassau municipalities, Hempstead and Long Beach, piggybacked on the county's Looks Great Services agreement and thus did not require prevailing wages for that contract.

Flaws highlighted by the Sandy cleanup experience need addressing, said state Sen. Phil Boyle (R-Bay Shore), who plans to propose changes when the State Legislature convenes in January.

""I'm expecting strong bipartisan support,"" Boyle said. ""The state's labor law, as it is currently written, is inadequate.""

Hannon agrees. ""If you're in an emergency situation as a municipality, there's no clear, cookie-cutter solution under labor law for the cleanup,"" he said. ""And if, in the aftermath of such an emergency there's only criticism, municipal officials may be hesitant to act next time. So it's necessary for us to take a look at what happened after Sandy, see what didn't work, and try to set some reasonable parameters next time.""

Municipalities must instruct contractors what prevailing-wage requirements apply when a contract is competitively bid. Immediately after Sandy, while many governments on Long Island passed emergency declarations that enabled them to suspend normal competitive bidding requirements, at no time was state prevailing-wage law waived. The wage law itself does not make any allowance for emergency situations.

Told he'd get $20 an hour

Sean Cottrell was out of work when he signed up -- on the hood of a car in a Topeka parking lot -- to work the Sandy cleanup on Long Island, just days before the massive storm system struck the Northeast.

Cottrell, 45, made the three-day trip with other employees of Custom Tree Care. As they traveled, the firm's supervisor, a cellphone pinned to his ear, hustled for work. On the second day, Cottrell said he was told he'd be earning $20 an hour and would work to clear debris from Long Island Rail Road property.

By the fourth day, he was working sunup to sundown dragging trees from railroad tracks across Long Island and sleeping on a cot at a Red Cross shelter in a Levittown high school gymnasium. He was among 20 workers hired to clear the tracks when Looks Great Services subcontracted Custom Tree Care for the work.

At week's end, his first paycheck showed he'd earned $10 an hour, with $15 an hour for overtime.

""I thought, 'Hell, no!' "" Cottrell said. ""I went to the Custom Tree foreman and said, 'I can make $10 an hour, more than that even, at home.' That really hurt me.""

William Moore, of Orange, Texas, worked alongside Cottrell. Also unemployed before Sandy, Moore, 41, hoped he'd earn as much as $2,000 a week. Instead, his first full week's check was for $850.

""I lost a lot not getting paid right,"" Moore said this summer from Evanston, Wyo., where he moved for work after Sandy. ""I'm just now getting my head back above water.""

Greg Gathers, CEO of Custom Tree Care, declined to be interviewed for this story.

The two men joined Philadelphia resident Salaam Saffiy, 46, and Aaron Mathis, 34, of Topeka, in filing complaints with the state labor department in December. On Nov. 13, two weeks after Sandy struck, the men had learned through an email from Matthew J. Myers, the labor department's regional supervisor for public works, that state prevailing-wage rates applied to their work.

Myers sent the men the appropriate pay rate in an attachment: tree trimming and line clearance on the LIRR merited $28.63 per hour with $13 an hour in supplemental benefits.

""I got messed over in New York,"" Moore said recently. ""Honestly, if I had to do it again, I wouldn't.""

Guidance was sought

In the days and weeks after Sandy, some local governments across the region sought guidance from the state labor department on the issue of prevailing wage for the cleanup and repairs. Between Nov. 1, 2012, and Jan. 1, 2013, the department's public works bureau received and processed 316 requests for wage schedules from Long Island towns, villages, counties and other public entities. By late August, the department had overseen reimbursements to 40 Sandy workers totaling $113,259.87. They ranged from a few hundred dollars per worker to $31,973 to a single worker.

New York labor law, articles 8 and 9, requires prevailing wages for two kinds of public works contracts: construction and building service contracts.

There is a key difference between the two: Municipalities entering into construction contracts are required by law to collect, verify and sign certified payrolls from contractors. An official who knowingly disregards these duties could be guilty of official misconduct under state criminal law. This requirement assists investigators in detecting fraud.

For building services contracts, municipalities aren't required to collect certified payrolls, but a contractor must.

Through the years, interpretations have varied over what types of work must pay prevailing wage.

In a Nov. 1, 2011, email, Myers wrote to the head of Looks Great Services, Kristian Agoglia, under the subject line, ""Emergency Tree Trimming Info,"" that tree trimming and removal -- the very same work the four Custom Tree Care employees had done for the LIRR -- was not covered by state prevailing-wage laws.

""Tree Trimming and Tree Removal along the roadways & byways related to Hurricane Irene is NOT COVERED,"" he wrote.

But in another email to Suffolk County officials, subject-lined ""Coverage on Sandy,"" dated May 8, 2013, Myers took a different stand: ""Any items that must be 'deconstructed' to clear the roadways and byways ARE covered by Article # 8 (i.e., tree(s), housing, etc)."" In this email he said sand removal was not covered. Snow removal also is not covered.

Interviews with a number of regional officials show Myers' first email fanned ambiguity as to whether tree removal after Sandy required payment of prevailing wages. That ambiguity made it harder for prosecutors in both counties to bring a larger number of cases, sources said.

Nassau relied on email

Nassau County relied on the 2011 email as justification that Looks Great's work for the county after Sandy was not covered by prevailing-wage laws, according to a legal opinion written in April and provided to Newsday by county Attorney John Ciampoli.

The labor department declined to allow Myers to be interviewed for this story. Agoglia declined requests to be interviewed. Looks Great Services has repeatedly stated its view that its agreement for cleanup work with Nassau County was not subject to prevailing wage based on the November 2011 Myers email.

The department acknowledged that the law as written does not have the scope to cover all facets of work necessary in a storm cleanup. For example, asked to explain how the law applies to road-clearing after a storm, the department's spokeswoman, Jennifer Krinsky, said contracts to clear storm debris from public roads are not subject to prevailing-wage requirements. She cited an exception: ""where the task is incidental to a contract that is subject to prevailing wage.""

She said the department's position on tree trimming and removal didn't change between Myers' email of November 2011 and the aftermath of Sandy. ""It has been and remains that tree trimming and tree removal contracts are subject to Article 8,"" Krinsky said. However, ""incidental"" tree trimming performed under a storm debris removal contract is not subject to prevailing-wage law, she said.

The DOL routinely conducts investigations after referrals from agencies or complaints from workers and provides information and educational outreach to public entities, contractors, labor organizations, workers and other interested parties, Krinsky said.

Few should be surprised that state labor law is ""messy"" on prevailing wage because interpretations of the law can be framed by politics, Ciampoli said.

""Labor law in general is one of the most political, if you will, areas of law,"" he said. ""There are constant changes of direction and policy depending on what administration is running the show.""

Saul Zabell, a Bohemia attorney who specializes in labor law, said that prevailing-wage matters are influenced by politics -- particularly trade union support.

""Unions can only be competitive if the Department of Labor is taking a hard line,"" Zabell said, noting prevailing-wage rates mirror construction union pay scales.

The purpose of prevailing-wage laws is to encourage municipalities to use a better-trained local workforce to ensure that public works projects are built properly and a community's standard of living is protected, experts say.

""These laws were originally promulgated to protect against local job loss to out-of-state contractors,"" Spota said. ""We have a higher standard of living here on Long Island, and in general in New York State, that can be used against us when you have out-of-state contractors coming in who pay their workers lower wages, who are less trained, who don't do the same quality work, and all that government money is going out of state.""

Changes after subpoenas

A number of local governments that did not follow prevailing-wage laws abruptly changed course when subpoenas were issued by the district attorneys' offices last spring. In addition, Spota in May summoned five Suffolk town supervisors and their attorneys to his office to underscore municipalities' obligations under the law.

Some governments and public entities that piggybacked on the Nassau Looks Great Services agreement, including Huntington, Hempstead and the LIRR, then suspended millions of dollars in payments to the company. The firm has filed suits demanding payment from several entities. Officials confirmed the Department of Labor ordered the LIRR to withhold payment. Barry L. Kluger, MTA's inspector general, said, ""We can confirm that there is an ongoing investigation between the MTA Office of Inspector General and the district attorneys in both Nassau and Suffolk counties.''

Pushed by the subpoenas, post-Sandy reforms are underway in two towns, Huntington and Brookhaven, that acknowledge they did not meet obligations under prevailing-wage law.

""I do believe that the town was proceeding along the lines . . . that prevailing wage didn't apply,"" said Huntington Town Attorney Cindy Elan-Mangano, who took office in January.

In an about-face, Huntington officials last spring required nine of the town's more than 50 Sandy cleanup vendors to supply certified payrolls, Elan-Mangano said. Deputy Town Attorney Jacob Turner, hired in April, said: ""Cindy is going over what we did in Sandy and making sure we're in full compliance going forward.""

The town sought payroll from the nine because they were the only vendors as of late April to which it still owed money, said spokesman A.J. Carter. As of Oct. 15, only one vendor had complied and the town is still withholding payment from the remaining eight, including $781,697.91 from Looks Great Services.

Future storms will be handled differently. The town board in September voted to authorize 10 emergency debris removal contracts that specify prevailing-wage rates. Looks Great Services won three of them, Carter said.

""I think there have been a lot of lessons learned . . . we have learned now how best to handle it,"" Elan-Mangano said.

Brookhaven officials say the administration was unaware that prevailing wage applied when Sandy hit. The town board passed legislation in June that requires private operators of heavy equipment hired by its highway department to pay rates in line with prevailing wages in future storms. The town had engaged some private vendors who were paid rates too low for some of the Sandy cleanup work, officials said.

""We all like to pay lower price, but the law is the law and needs to be respected by the Town of Brookhaven,"" said Supervisor Edward P. Romaine, who took office a month after the storm. ""I'm committed to honoring our state prevailing wages -- it's the right thing to do. It's expensive to live and work here and we need to pay wages that make sure people can continue to do that.""

Sought to leave no doubt

In contrast, Islip Deputy Town Attorney Mike Walsh was clear right after the storm: all cleanup work paid for by the town would be covered by state prevailing-wage law requirements.

""I was there in the town emergency operations center as we were trying to get the cleanup operation up and running and departments were asking, 'Do we pay prevailing wage?' And I made it clear -- 'You bet we do.' ""

Walsh, who formerly worked in the Suffolk district attorney's office, said he told anyone giving him pushback: ""My job is to keep the DA out of our town. It's absolutely covered by state prevailing-wage law.""

The two counties also are a picture of contrast in how they enforced the law.

In Suffolk, Sandy cost the county about $21.8 million, $17.5 million of which went to two debris-removal firms, Phillips & Jordan of Tennessee, and Grace Industries from Plainview, officials said.

Suffolk's two contractors ""played by the rules"" regarding state prevailing-wage laws, Comptroller Joseph Sawicki said.

However, around $55,000 in additional wages was later paid to five employees of one subcontractor who were mistakenly paid according to the federal prevailing-wage rate, instead of the higher New York State rates, Sawicki's audit staff said.

The county's Department of Public Works did ""an excellent job"" of ensuring certified payrolls were supplied by all Sandy cleanup vendors, Sawicki said.

Even so, the county's department of audit and control will recommend standardized language in the contracting process with future debris removal vendors so that obligations under prevailing-wage law are clearly stated, Sawicki said.

While Suffolk determined almost all its debris cleanup was covered by prevailing-wage law, Nassau ruled the work of its largest debris removal contractor -- Looks Great -- was not because it contends prevailing-wage law does not apply to the firm's contract.

Asked why some workers were paid as little as $10 an hour to clear debris in his county, Ciampoli said: ""It is not a question of whether it is acceptable to us, it's a question of whether or not it's legal.""

He added: ""I assume it met the minimum wage requirement, then it would be legal."" Still, Ciampoli said, ""the ultimate determination of whether prevailing wage applies, in the criminal setting, is the matter appropriately before the DA.""

LI group sought assurance

Marc Herbst, the executive director of the Long Island Contractors Association, reached out to state officials on Nov. 8, 10 days after Sandy struck, to seek clarity that prevailing-wage laws would be followed. If they weren’t, he feared, the economic impact on his members, their employees and their families would be profound as local contractors were undercut.

“Most informal responses from various government officials to the question whether prevailing-wage rates will be honored have been ‘I think so.’ Obviously, we need something more concrete,” he wrote in a Nov. 8 email.

Herbst received an unequivocal response from the Office of the State Comptroller. “Prevailing-wage rates will be honored based upon local law and NYS law. If the local government is required to pay prevailing wage then prevailing-wages rates will be reimbursed,” came the same-day response from Kathleen McCormack, assistant comptroller of labor affairs in Albany.

“Without a doubt, Sandy magnified the issue of prevailing-wage enforcement for us in the local construction industry,” Herbst said, adding that his members depend on a level playing field for wages.

“As it stands, the municipalities all have a different process — there’s no oversight nor consistency applied to enforcement — and that’s the problem,” he said.

Overhaul sought

State labor law was last reformed by the legislature in 2008, and those who know it well and how it played out on Long Island after Sandy say it must be overhauled.

Thomas Walsh, an attorney with 27 years’ experience in labor and employment law, said municipalities’ sometimes laissez-faire approach to prevailing-wage obligations can end up hurting the contractor that wins the work.

“The problem is, if the municipality is not crystal clear on telling contractors with which it is bidding that a job is, or is not, prevailing wage, the law puts all the penalty on the contractors for making the wrong decision,” Walsh said. “The municipalities should be completely upfront about prevailing-wage requirements.”

Experienced contractors who regularly do big public projects are well aware of their responsibilities, but problems occur when work — such as storm cleanup — “is not on its face plainly public work meriting prevailing wage,” he said.

“Cleaning sand off Long Beach streets, picking up downed trees off roads immediately after Sandy, a contractor may not be sure on those gray areas,” said Walsh. “The municipality had a responsibility when they put the bid out ... to seek guidance from the DOL.” In the absence of that, contractors would be wise to seek department guidance themselves, he added.

As for what happened during Sandy, Spota, the Suffolk district attorney, said: “There’s no question some municipalities aren’t fulfilling their obligations under the law. And that’s not necessarily because they’re deliberately flouting the law. In a lot of cases, it’s ignorance.”

Asked about mixed messages emanating from the state Department of Labor, Spota said he had an appreciation of the pressure the department was under. “We understand the tension between the DOL trying to enforce the law and at the same time help municipalities work through an emergency situation,” he said.

“They are trying to walk that middle ground. The ambiguity occurs when you’re trying to serve two different objectives — following the law and getting a storm cleanup done quickly.”

No penalties for officials

Earlier proponents of toughening the law wanted to include criminal penalties within the law itself for municipal officials who shirk their requirements to receive and review payrolls. The provision was eliminated by the State Assembly Codes Committee.

Yet without a specific penalty in labor law for municipal officials who fail to fulfill their role, prosecutors say it’s difficult to bring criminal charges against government officials because they must show the official knew of the requirement and intentionally ignored it.

Another reform effort is in the works with changes Boyle hopes to introduce early next year. Among them: increasing penalties for violators, including municipal officials, and requiring contractors to file certified payrolls with the municipalities regardless of the type of public work performed. Boyle said this would give investigators greater access to company records and help them in bringing prosecutions.

“The law in my view still enables unscrupulous businesses to take advantage of some workers,” he said. “The Sandy cleanup, with its vast amount of public work out to contract and millions of dollars of public money, seemed to expose the law’s shortcomings. The fact that it was public money misused in this way is particularly egregious.”

For Cottrell, who learned last month he could be owed more than $11,000 in underpaid wages and benefits for helping clear the LIRR tracks, money alone is not the issue.

“The money’s important, but so is the principle,” Cottrell said. “People who don’t follow the law should be held accountable. Workers like us who traveled across the country shouldn’t be taken advantage of, is what it comes down to.”

Prevailing wage and Long Island towns

What towns on Long Island did in regard to prevailing-wage law. The five East End towns are not included.

BABYLON: All contracts for Sandy cleanup work included the requirement that vendors follow prevailing-wage laws, town spokesman Kevin Bonner said, adding that the town consulted the state Department of Labor. After the Suffolk DA issued subpoenas in the spring, the town asked nine vendors that conducted its cleanup to submit their certified payrolls so those records could be passed on to the DA.

BROOKHAVEN: Officials said it did not meet its obligations.

HEMPSTEAD: In the months after Sandy, officials moved to ensure remaining cleanup work would be done by contractors paying prevailing-wage rates, town records show. Initially, Looks Great Services, one of the six contractors the town used, didn’t pay prevailing wages. The town stopped paying Looks Great in June after being subpoenaed by the Nassau DA, said Mike Deery, town spokesman. The firm has yet to supply the town with certified payrolls.

HUNTINGTON: Officials acknowledge they failed to collect certified payrolls.

ISLIP: It complied with prevailing-wage law.

SMITHTOWN: Followed prevailing-wage law. Town workers collected certified payrolls and the town notified all contractors prevailing wage was required. Currently the town requires certified payrolls from all public work contractors.

NORTH HEMPSTEAD: The town paid prevailing wage on most of its debris removal work and contractors supplied certified payrolls, records show. But on some payrolls no worker job titles were listed; on others, no payrolls were included.

OYSTER BAY: Town Deputy Supervisor Leonard Genova said Sandy work was in compliance. Deputy Town Attorney Frederick E. Mei said he consulted with the labor department and was told hauling and yard waste removal contracts didn’t require prevailing wage.

GLEN COVE: The city used a handful of outside contractors to assist with its Sandy cleanup. City officials said some repair work did not specify prevailing wage. But, they said, they still expected that the contractors would pay it.

LONG BEACH: Officials declined to answer specific questions about prevailing wages for its estimated $36 million cleanup. “The city has requested an opinion from the Department of Labor and we decline to comment at this time as we await the opinion,” spokesman Gordon Tepper wrote in an email, though he added in a later email that the city “requires its vendors to follow Department of Labor standards.”","2013-11-09 23:22:00","1","168.0","124.0","34.0","0.0","39.0","1.0","247.0","49.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","26.0","0","4535","93.51","63.12","19.16","38.30","20.71","27.25","76.87","40.04","6.62","2.82","0.46","0.62","0.13","0.88","0.73","3.79","7.30","14.29","6.22","2.38","4.32","1.32","12.61","5.23","2.49","1.54","2.91","1.70","2.69","1.70","0.99","0.18","0.18","0.33","6.97","0.02","0.04","0.07","0.88","8.38","1.39","1.43","1.10","1.81","1.08","2.56","4.04","1.06","1.79","1.10","0.42","0.20","0.13","0.00","0.09","9.53","1.12","2.62","5.38","1.17","0.49","5.98","6.13","0.64","13.34","1.63","7.59","4.32","11.64","0.35","0.15","3.93","0.02","0.00","0.31","0.02","0.18","0.04","0.07","0.00","19.85","5.05","6.53","0.53","0.04","0.04","0.02","2.01","2.78","2.05","0.18","0.62","22740","7.3","22.627450980392158","6888","4463","221","59.43","13.1","10.0","13.75","13.9","752","17.666666666666668","16.81986107999104","1300","20.8","62","0.4","0","112","124","392","0","561","267","17","6","39","783","511","15","394","2","1","140","41","142","3","1","6","128","0","141","285","95","133","94","98","22","34","0","22"
"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/contractor-to-pay-65g-in-back-wages-for-post-sandy-work-1.5814982","Contractor to pay $65G in back wages for post-Sandy work","A contractor who hired workers for Sandy cleanup and demolition at four retail stores, including one in Nassau County, has agreed to pay back wages and other promised allowances totaling $65,000 to more than 100 people after an investigation by a nonprofit law firm and the New York attorney general's office.

InStar Services Group LP failed to pay workers their promised wages and overtime, according to a ruling by the attorney general's labor bureau.

After Sandy, it hired subcontractors to supply workers. One, Tennessee-based LA Construction, hired about 150 people to perform duties such as cleaning, demolition and removal of damaged inventory at a Michaels store in Queens, two Staples stores -- one in Lawrence and one on Staten Island -- and a Fairway Supermarket in Brooklyn.

Doris Rivera, 45, a mother of five from upstate Rochester, was one such worker. She said a recruiter told her and about 20 others from Rochester they would be paid $14 an hour, be put up in a hotel room and given a $25 allowance a week for food.

""He told us: 'You're going for four months,' "" she said, adding the choice to take the job was tough but she did it ""because I needed the money.""

Once downstate, the story changed, Rivera said. She worked three 10- to 12-hour days and survived on food from the Red Cross. She spent one night in a hotel room -- with eight others. ""We slept four nights in our car -- five of us in cold weather -- other people had six in a car. ""

Other workers she spoke with had traveled from Miami, Louisiana, Atlanta, Chicago, Albany and Syracuse.

At one point she was directed to the Staples store in Nassau, she said. ""They told us, 'It's a complete disaster, you have to clean up, wash floors and walls,' that sort of thing."" When they arrived on site, however, the company had hired others to work for $10 an hour, she said.

Rivera said she was never paid. Workers were told they would be reimbursed for tolls and gas, but that, too, never materialized, she said. Rivera and others documented what they saw with pictures and provided those to the Empire Justice Center, a nonprofit law firm, which investigated and alerted the attorney general's office.

The attorney general's office found there was sufficient evidence to conclude InStar violated New York State labor law, executive law, the Fair Labor Standards Act and other state codes and regulations. While the company neither admitted nor denied the findings, it agreed to pay $65,000 in back wages and the additional money it had promised workers.

Headquartered in Michigan, InStar provided disaster response to commercial clients nationwide until December, when it was sold. A representative and the company's attorney could not be reached Thursday.

Reyna Ramolete Hayashi, with the Empire Justice Center, said disasters such as Sandy are ripe for wage theft. ""I admire these workers for giving voice to so many who are driven into the underground economies that power our cities, that most of us take for granted, especially in times of crisis,"" she said.","2013-08-01 21:59:00","1","40.0","73.0","27.0","0.0","32.0","0.0","231.0","49.0","0.0","122.0","0.0","23.0","0","550","88.82","81.35","11.00","35.29","21.15","21.27","81.27","44.18","10.73","6.18","0.36","1.64","0.55","2.55","1.09","4.55","7.27","14.36","4.55","2.91","6.00","0.91","12.36","3.45","1.45","1.09","5.45","0.91","2.91","1.64","1.09","0.00","0.18","0.18","10.73","0.18","0.00","2.73","0.18","7.45","1.27","1.09","0.73","0.36","1.27","2.73","3.64","0.73","2.18","0.73","0.73","0.18","0.18","0.00","0.36","10.18","1.82","2.36","6.18","0.73","0.91","8.55","2.91","0.18","12.55","1.64","6.73","4.55","10.55","0.55","0.36","4.18","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","20.91","4.73","8.55","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.55","1.82","2.18","0.00","0.91","2553","7.98","21.46153846153846","786","545","26","67.08","11.7","9.1","11.37","12.3","114","12.625","18.766972477064222","300","20.12","6","0.42","0","24","29","41","0","63","31","1","1","3","83","71","1","37","0","0","34","6","8","0","0","4","17","0","13","47","7","18","8","3","2","3","0","2"
"https://www.newsday.com/from-the-archives-ruling-didn-t-change-the-way-shinnecocks-embraced-their-sense-of-self-1.6356309","From the archives: Ruling didn't change the way Shinnecocks embraced their sense of self","This story was originally published in Newsday on Nov. 13, 2005

As a girl growing up on the Shinnecock Indian reservation, Mabel Cuffee learned to savor Sundays.

That was the day her father, Charles Kellis Smith, would take his children on walks through the Southampton woods. Along the way, he pointed out fox holes and poisonous plants. He showed them how to look for indentations in the sides of trees where rainwater collects - a good place to wait for a deer.

Cuffee, now 48, grew up eating succotash, clam pie and fried bread, recipes that traveled from mother to daughter for generations.

Now, she and her husband, Eugene Cuffee, 55, do the same for their three girls and three boys, who range in age from 26 to 7.

The Cuffees don't need anyone to tell them who they are. They're Shinnecock Indians, just as their parents and their grandparents were before them.

On Monday, a federal judge declared the Shinnecocks a bona fide Indian tribe. Until then, the tribe - which counts about 500 members on its 800-acre reservation - had been recognized by New York State but never by the federal government.

Although the ruling may give the tribe a boost toward achieving its goals - such as building a casino or winning a pending land-claim lawsuit - the reaction within the tribe has been complex, the Cuffees say.

Among themselves since the judge's ruling, tribal members often acknowledge the news with a joke. A friend walked up to Eugene Cuffee the other day and shook his hand. ""Congratulations,"" the friend said. ""You're a Shinnecock.""

""All these years, I thought I was a Mexican!"" Eugene Cuffee quipped back.

In her interactions with outsiders, however, even a ""Congratulations"" makes Mabel Cuffee bristle. All week, customers in the tobacco shop on the reservation where she works have been offering their good wishes.

But ""I'm taking that as, 'Congratulations, you're recognized, you're real.' Because of that?"" she said, referring to the judge's decision. ""This is who we are and this is who we've always been.""

Family is a good place to start when it comes to discussions about Shinnecock identity. Children learn about tribal history and customs through their elders. And family - one's genealogy - is also part of what counts if a tribe wants to gain federal recognition, a status that makes it eligible for federal funding, services and special privileges, such as operating a casino. One of the principal tests for federal recognition is whether modern-day members can trace their roots back to early tribal membership lists.

The Cuffees, then, are a good place to start when it comes to discussions about Shinnecock genealogy. Many of today's Shinnecocks can trace their roots back to Paul Cuffee, a Presbyterian minister who preached to Long Island's Indian communities in the 18th century. Eugene and Mabel Cuffee are both direct descendants of the Shinnecock minister.

Eugene Cuffee, who works for the Southampton Town highway department, keeps reprints of some of his ancestors' photos in two black binders, which sit on his coffee table. Some of them date to the 1860s and were printed on tin. He has memorized all of his relatives' vital statistics - when they were born, when they died, who they married.

On the reservation, it's hard to say where one family begins and another ends. The names Cuffee, Eleazer, Kellis and Bunn are embroidered into nearly every family tree, appearing as surnames or middle names or maiden names across the reservation.

""We're all family and we take care of one another,"" Eugene Cuffee said.

Families also stick together. That's why Eugene Cuffee says he backs the tribe in its quest to open a casino, even though he's personally opposed to the idea.

""I'm going along that way because that's what the tribe wants,"" he said.

To Mabel Cuffee, the judge's decision also serves as a rare counterpoint to the discrimination that her family still encounters. For example, when her now 24-year-old son, Andrew, was in the second grade, some boys chased him into the bathroom. Andrew wore his hair long.

""Indian boy, Indian boy,"" they taunted. ""Dance for us.""

Humiliated, Andrew obeyed.

When he got home, he told his mother the story. The next day, she made him dress in a traditional Shinnecock outfit - including a headpiece made of deer hair, leather and hawk feathers - and dug out a tape of tribal songs. Then she marched him into school. Since the age of 3, Andrew had been dancing in ceremonies and at pow-wows on other reservations around the country.

In front of his second-grade classmates, Mabel Cuffee said, ""I put on the tapes, and he danced.""

The kids loved it, including his former tormentors.

It's that kind of pride that give the judge's words real meaning to Mabel Cuffee. After suffering through centuries of oppression and discrimination, she said, the tribe is standing up and saying, ""Hey, wait a minute. We're not doing this anymore.""","2013-11-13 10:50:00","1","49.0","73.0","16.0","0.0","26.0","0.0","223.0","49.0","0.0","109.0","0.0","21.0","0","826","82.78","92.84","17.94","45.80","15.02","19.25","78.93","47.70","12.71","7.63","0.61","0.73","0.36","3.87","2.06","5.08","8.60","13.92","5.69","4.48","6.54","0.36","12.95","2.91","1.45","2.78","2.18","1.57","2.06","1.57","0.48","0.24","0.24","0.12","16.10","2.06","0.48","2.06","3.51","7.63","1.82","1.69","0.73","1.57","0.85","1.57","2.42","0.61","1.33","0.36","1.21","0.24","0.36","0.00","0.48","9.56","5.21","0.85","2.66","1.45","0.00","4.48","7.75","0.97","16.10","1.57","7.87","6.90","2.18","2.30","1.09","0.73","0.48","0.12","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","22.76","6.42","7.99","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.12","2.06","2.91","3.15","0.00","0.00","3889","7.44","15.722222222222221","1180","820","55","73.27","10.5","6.7","11.3","9.7","159","7.5","15.71609756097561","423","14.61","6","0.46","0","26","17","88","0","95","49","0","1","4","128","74","2","58","0","0","49","24","28","0","0","5","23","0","17","40","20","15","28","32","6","9","0","11"

"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/sba-loans-keep-sandy-recipients-from-ny-rising-aid-1.6322457","SBA loans keep Sandy recipients from NY Rising aid","Several thousand Long Island residents whose homes were devastated by superstorm Sandy can't get full assistance from the state's NY Rising Housing Recovery Program because they already took out low-interest federal loans -- an unjust situation, a state legislator said Friday.

State Sen. Phil Boyle, flanked by a half-dozen Sandy victims at a news conference in Babylon, called on federal authorities to rectify the problem, which he said is preventing many residents from rebuilding or is saddling them with heavy debt.

""This is a serious problem and is going to cost tens of thousands, and in some cases hundreds of thousands, of dollars to New York State homeowners,"" said Boyle (R-Bay Shore). ""I've never seen anything more unfair. Every Sandy victim should be treated equally, and that's not the case.""

Babylon Village resident Lauren Norinder, 31, who said her home took on 2 1/2 feet of water during the storm, said, ""It infuriates me. I think it is obscene they can get away with that.""

At issue are Small Business Administration loans that homeowners say they were urged to take out to cover the difference between what their homeowners insurance would pay and what it would cost to repair or rebuild their homes. In many cases, the difference was $100,000 or more, the residents said.

In the weeks after Sandy, many local or Federal Emergency Management Agency officials advised property owners to pursue the SBA loans, Boyle said.

They later discovered that taking the SBA loans meant they were only eligible for minimal or no assistance from the NY Rising program, he said. The state program is using $485 million in U.S. Housing and Urban Development community block grants to help residents whose homes were damaged by Sandy and by tropical storms Irene and Lee in 2011, Boyle said.

The federal Stafford Act, which prohibits ""duplication of benefits,"" prevents residents from receiving overlapping assistance from multiple sources for a single disaster, he said.

In contrast, most homeowners who did not take out SBA loans are fully eligible for NY Rising grants, Boyle said. Nearly 4,000 Long Island homeowners are expected to benefit, receiving an average of more than $110,000 each, state officials have said.

Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman for the state Office of Storm Recovery, said homeowners who had a valid reason for refusing an SBA loan can be included in the state program. For those who received SBA loans, she said, federal rules require that the loan offset -- that is, be subtracted from -- any award from NY Rising.

She added, however, that receiving an SBA loan does not totally preclude homeowners from getting help from NY Rising, and the program is encouraging people to apply.

Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said there is a problem with the system and he is trying to fix it.

""It's simply not fair that residents who did the responsible thing, followed directions, and quickly took out loans to rebuild now have access to fewer grants,"" Schumer said Friday. ""I've urged HUD to revise their policy and will continue to push them to do so.""

The news conference was held outside the storm-damaged Babylon home of John Giebel, 64, a semiretired meat deliveryman.

He said there was a shortfall of about $100,000 between his insurance payout and what it is costing to rebuild and elevate his house, so he took out an SBA loan in that amount. When he later applied to NY Rising, the loan effectively canceled out the grant that he could have received, he said.

""The people that played by the rules get shortchanged,"" he said. ""We're not being treated as fairly as everyone else.""Another homeowner, Debbie Lemaire, 52, of Lindenhurst, said her house is still a wreck and she is living with relatives in Wantagh. She has applied for funds from NY Rising, but hasn't seen any money yet.

""I had a full sense of security by having insurance,"" Lemaire said, her eyes welling with tears. ""I never dreamed a year later . . . I'd still be homeless.""","2013-10-25 22:00:00","1","49.0","87.0","30.0","0.0","26.0","0.0","234.0","49.0","0.0","121.0","0.0","21.0","0","709","84.88","75.53","4.80","17.56","20.26","23.27","77.29","43.72","10.58","5.64","0.99","0.42","0.14","2.68","1.41","4.94","6.49","13.40","7.33","2.68","3.95","1.41","14.25","4.37","2.12","1.83","3.39","2.96","3.10","1.27","1.83","0.00","0.00","0.42","11.28","0.14","0.00","0.99","1.69","6.91","0.99","0.71","1.13","1.83","0.71","2.54","4.94","0.56","3.39","0.85","0.71","0.28","0.14","0.00","0.28","9.45","1.13","0.71","4.80","2.40","0.99","6.63","6.49","0.42","10.30","2.40","5.08","3.67","3.95","0.28","2.26","3.53","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.14","0.14","0.00","0.00","20.59","5.78","7.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.69","2.82","1.41","0.56","0.71","3307","7.98","20.571428571428573","1019","696","35","59.74","12.5","9.9","11.78","12.1","148","16.5","18.46574712643678","355","19.26","27","0.43","0","21","18","56","0","77","33","3","1","8","86","96","0","54","0","0","36","10","29","1","0","7","19","0","29","47","23","16","15","18","4","8","2","1"
"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/after-sandy-s-chaos-fishers-island-preps-for-next-big-storm-1.6358585","After Sandy's 'chaos,' Fishers Island preps for next big storm","Fishers Island, 13 miles northeast of Orient Point, survived worse storms, but Sandy laid bare concerns for the isolated Southold Town community.

Trees fell and power went out with no backup generators for the utility company on the 7-mile-long island that's closer to Connecticut than New York. No power meant water service also failed. Ferry service -- the only way on or off the island other than by small plane -- was canceled.

Part of Hay Harbor Golf Club's No. 2 hole fell away when the cliff crumbled, the airport runways flooded and erosion on the east end was so severe, part of a swimming pool hung out over Block Island Sound.

Even the past resurfaced, with soldiers' buttons, shirts and dog tags washing up, vestiges of an Army defense fort that was on the island from 1889 to the 1940s.

But no one was killed or injured. ""We actually got very lucky the storm turned into New Jersey,"" Fishers Island Utility Corp. president Chris Finan said. ""If it hit us directly, I don't know if anything would be left here at all.""

But Sandy left a lasting impression. In the past year, local groups have sought grants, applied for Federal Emergency Management Agency money and changed some operations to be better prepared for the next big storm.

""We're pretty much on our own,"" said Louisa Evans, an island resident and member of the Southold Town Board. ""When you're in the middle of a storm, it's not like anybody can come help.""

Fishers Island has about 250 year-round residents. The population expands to more than 3,000 in the summer with returning vacation-home owners, including Abercrombie & Fitch chief executive Mike Jeffries. The island has one seasonal hotel, a doctor financed by private endowments and an ambulance boat that ferries the ill and injured to the closest hospital in New London, Conn.

Official duties are shared by the year-round residents, especially firefighters.

""There's a lot of people who are part of the firehouse and have other jobs they have to run out to,"" said State Police Trooper Kevin Drew, one of a few troopers who is posted on the island from May 1 to Dec. 1 each year.

Finan also manages Fishers Island Development Corp., which oversees roads, private property and some buildings on much of the island. Fishers Island Fire Department Chief Jeremy Doucette is also a lineman for the utility.

As the storm approached, Doucette and six other volunteer firefighters were in Brookhaven for wildfire training and had to scramble to get home on two different ferries to prepare for the storm. Had they not, the community would have been without about one-third of its firefighters, one-third of utility workers and half of the town employees, Doucette said.

""The main concern was getting these people back to the island because the boats were getting canceled,"" said Mike Imbriglio, Southold's deputy emergency preparedness coordinator for Fishers Island.

The utility company, which provides electricity, water, and telephone and Internet service, is still working to obtain grants to harden the system.

""One of the major impacts for us is the water system does not have a backup generator,"" Finan said. ""When we lose power, we lose water as well.""

New pipes and generators are top priorities. So is computerized mapping of the system to pinpoint problems and not have to shut down large areas for damage assessment.

""Roads were flooded, quite a few power lines went down and we determined that it was best to turn power down until after the storm,"" Finan said.

Some electric lines placed underground in the 1920s -- among the first in the nation to do so -- are now so old they need upgrades, a fact heightened by Sandy. ""We have pretty old infrastructure everywhere,"" Finan said.

Fire officials use landlines and radios to communicate, but rely on a mid-island generator, which requires refueling every two hours, to power the repeater that keeps signals strong.

""We're still trying to work out where to have the repeater,"" Doucette said. ""We haven't really conquered the backup generation system with that.""

Communications among other officials can be difficult.

Fortunately, Doucette said, firefighters are also part of the highway department and have access to fire district radios.

""The fire frequency here is kind of the emergency be-all, end-all if we need to locate anybody or get a task completed,"" Doucette said.

The island prepared for the storm as it has for years.

The Fishers Island Ferry District moved its boats to protected space in New London, manager Donald Lamb said. The ambulance boat was moved to a secluded cove. The school district set up cots for the displaced, and used its email alert systems to send out critical notices, such as when the last ferry was leaving, Fishers Island school district principal Karen Loiselle Goodwin said.

The firehouse was a gathering point during and after Sandy for official status meetings, residents charging phones or utility crews grabbing a meal.

In the days after the storm, the ferry district hired local contractors to remove sand from the airport runways and seawall, and to clear roads, manager Donald Lamb said. One runway opened within a week, the second opened in the spring. Nighttime flights are still not permitted because there are no lights.

The district, which also manages the town-owned airport, is seeking reimbursement from FEMA to pay for repairs and is seeking other funding to harden the seawall.

""Remediation is good, but if what was there already flooded, what's the point?"" ferry district assistant manager Gordon Murphy said.

Advance planning helped business as well. Steve Malinowski, owner of Fishers Island Oyster Farm, said crews sank the oyster nets in the harbor. In a pond where they grow seed oysters, which are sold to other harvesters, equipment was moved, covered, anchored and secured in place.

""If we had not taken precautions out at the site, we would have lost 100 percent,"" he said.

Overall, the island weathered the storm better than other parts of Long Island, a feat credited to its history of self-sufficiency. ""People out here are pretty used to being by themselves,"" Doucette said. ""It seems like chaos but it's structured chaos.""

"https://newrepublic.com/article/114065/death-big-law-firms-cant-be-ignored","Yes, Big Law Really is Dying","Still, most people eventually forgot that the industry had entered a new era of modest long-term growth because it was obscured by two economic bubbles—the tech bubble of the late 1990s and the real estate bubble of the early-to-mid-2000s. Now that both bubbles have burst, the industry isn’t likely to grow faster than the growth rate of the overall economy, a rate that can’t support the increase in profits and revenue (per partner) that we've seen over the last two decades. Hence the problems I write about in my piece.

For the strange story of how libertarians took over the Supreme Court, click here.

This is why, to move to the third objection, it doesn’t strike me as very plausible that the industry will simply bounce back the way it has after previous recessions. The world I describe in the piece is basically the world the legal profession has been drifting toward for two decades.* In fact, there are good reasons to think the trajectory has taken a turn for the worse lately—that the legal profession won’t even grow at the same rate as the economy. For example, legal expenses didn't used to be a big enough share of a corporation’s bottom line to be worth vetting very closely, which encouraged firms to pad their bills. Now, according to The Wall Street Journal, clients are using sophisticated legal software to do the job for them, allowing them to effortlessly flag all sorts of dubious charges. That can’t be good for big law firms.

Similarly, corporations now have more alternatives to hiring law firms than ever before—like contract attorneys and the “legal process outsourcers” who procure them—and they’re using them increasingly often. Between 2004 and 2010, according to data collected by Bill Henderson of Indiana University, law firm employment dropped by 4 percent, or about 47,000 jobs. During the same period, employment in “all other legal services” (like outsourcers) increased by 50%, or about 8,000 jobs. Obviously, some of that change was driven by the pinch of the recession. But it’s hard to imagine clients reversing these trends as the economy recovers. Recent history suggests that outsourced jobs tend to stay outsourced, whatever the original reason for the move.

Big Law boosters point to the fact that revenue at the country’s 100 biggest firms grew by 3.4 percent last year—a reasonable increase, if hardly the 8-12 percent increases of the early-to-mid-2000s. But when you unpack the number a bit, it looks even less impressive. It turns out that the bump was driven primarily by a huge fourth quarter after three middling ones. And that big fourth quarter was, in turn, the result of some idiosyncratic factors—like a rush by corporations to complete transactions before the dreaded fiscal cliff took effect on January 1, and law firms aggressively seeking payment before the end of the year (for similar reasons).

Meanwhile, other data show the problems for the legal profession continuing. Of the law students who graduated in 2008, 75 percent of found a legal job within nine months, according to the National Association for Law Placement (NALP). For those who graduated in 2012, the number had fallen to 64 percent, a record low. Of course, Big Law firms typically hire associates well in advance, so these numbers partly reflect the hiring environment that existed a year or more earlier. And, in fairness, NALP reports that hiring at big firms did recover a bit for the class of 2012 after a terrible 2011, even if it was still well below the 2009 level. Still, the fact that the market for lawyers was historically weak more than three years after the recession is pretty alarming. NALP refers ominously to a “new normal” in law-firm hiring.

One final point worth keeping in mind any time someone points to history and insists the future will look pretty similar: Historical arguments tend to be right up until the moment they’re not. To take one random example, consider the insistence by so many people in the mid-2000s (many of them tied to the real estate industry) that housing prices couldn’t fall across the country all at once, since it had never happened before. That didn’t work out so well then, and you’d think it would give Big Law defenders pause now. You can’t just look at historical patterns. You’ve got to look at the reasons why the patterns existed. And if those reasons no longer apply, you’re going to find yourself in real trouble. Just ask all the happy people who bought condos in Ft. Lauderdale back in 2006.

"https://newrepublic.com/article/112194/walter-kirn-gun-owners","What Gun Owners Really Want","The country went berserk. Or further berserk. Where incidents of gun violence were concerned, there was suddenly no such thing as local news. The media sent out daily, rolling body counts. Four dead in Pennsylvania, five in New Mexico. Then came the shadow statistics. Gun sales, up. Ammunition inventories, down. Membership in the NRA, expanding. Meanwhile, on YouTwitBook—our virtual town square where actual bodily harm is not a threat and aliases, masks, and hoods are common—the usual anarchy turned to savagery. After Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's vaguely mortician-like leader and chief inflamer, called for armed guards in the schools on ""Meet the Press"" and David Gregory, the host, broke character as a fresh-faced voice of reason to wave around a rifle magazine, the video of the encounter unleashed comment streams that read like the transcripts of prison riots. A contingent of Sandy Hook ""truthers"" even emerged to call the horror a hoax. Naturally, this provoked obscene responses.

I hunkered down and started to reflect. To certain fellow gun owners whom I was ashamed to regard as fellow anythings, my belief that the public has a right to collective self-defense from those who abuse their individual rights qualified me as traitor and a weakling. To certain purists among the unarmed, my guns marked me as unwholesome, perhaps a ""nut job."" A girlfriend had called me this name once, partly in jest, after coming across some bullets in my desk (a few. 22 shells, just pocket litter to me and no more ominous than thumb tacks). I shouldn't have, but I bristled. This troubled her slightly. Which troubled me.

You all know how that goes, that spiral of defensiveness when someone questions something you take for granted. Or maybe you don't, since you've never owned a gun.

Let's go shooting together. It might help us talk.

They push back when they're fired. That's the elemental fact involved, the deep Newtonian heart of the whole business. They kick at your will in the instant they also project it, reminding you that force is always two-sided. It's a shock the first time, an insult to the senses, but once you've learned to expect it, absorb it, ride it, recoil becomes a source of pleasure. You're up on your board turning turbulence to flow. You want to do it again, again—again!—and the urge becomes part of your body, your nervous system. It feels as though it was always there, this appetite, this desire for a small, acute struggle that you can win. Win consistently. Repeatedly.

Semi-automatically.

When I shoot at the range, I don't feel personally powerful but like the custodian of something powerful. I feel like a successful disciplinarian of something radically alien and potent. Analyze this sensation all you want; you still can't make it go away. But that's the primitive, underlying fear, of course, which the likes of LaPierre exploit: the fear that it will be curtailed, suppressed, prohibited—perhaps not any time soon, but ultimately.

We're not talking rights here; we're talking instincts. It's not the gun that the so-called ""clingers"" cling to and don't like the thought of anybody screwing with. It's not even the power of the gun. It's the power over the power of the gun.

Guns alter your reflexes, your neural pathways. The changes are subtle at first, and welcome, like the heightened awareness that posture golf clubs bring. Later, if you're an imaginative type, the changes can grow more pronounced, more conscious. You start to entertain scenarios that might not occur to you if you didn't shoot.

My friend, an Army captain, a tall West Pointer, was just back from Iraq. He'd had a tough time there. We were wrapping Christmas presents. He asked me if I'd ever heard of a law passed under President George W. Bush (he called it a new ""order,"" actually) that established a formal military command, USNORTHCOM, over the country itself. His tone was dark, insinuating, and I looked at him, concerned. PTSD. We're all hip to its signs (at least in others), and a moment ago my friend had asked me (oddly, I thought) to turn off a ceiling fan whirling above our heads whose blades kept distracting him as he tied ribbons.

I felt vulnerable, humiliated, outmanned.

When I asked my friend what bothered him about the Northern Command, his answer, as I half-feared, boiled down to this: Americans beware America. I pressed him. Did he seriously, genuinely believe that soldiers, our soldiers, soldiers much like himself, could possibly be prevailed upon to intimidate or attack their fellow citizens?

Affirmative. If ordered to. They're soldiers.

The unarmed fear the armed, but the armed are disposed to fear the better armed. Occasionally, in idle moments, as an exercise in guided paranoia, I let myself picture the mythical siege of kicked-in doors and smoky, barricaded streets implanted in my head by my West Point friend. As a creative aid, I run the newsreel: Waco, the Rodney King tape, Kent State, etc. I also think back to a haunting traffic stop in the winter of 2004–2005 on a freeway near Junction City, Kansas. It started when I was pulled over for a bad headlight and ended with a dog sniffing my car, watched by a cop in a swat-team-style black uniform. I felt vulnerable, humiliated, outmanned.

I also know the opposite feeling, of outmanning someone else, because I pulled a gun on a guy once. It happened outside of the building where I live in downtown Livingston, Montana, a town of 7,000 that I moved to from New York City 23 years ago, back when New York was still considered dangerous. I was in the cab of my Ford pickup after a trip to a mini-storage locker with my two children, who were nine and six. Right across the street was the Mint Bar, a cavernous old brick hideout for midday tipplers in front of which was standing a lean young man who'd glared at me with a manic, feral focus the moment I'd parked and opened the truck door. He seemed high, not just drunk, with that toxic aura of meth, and when our eyes met, he bared his teeth and hissed that he was going to kill me, that I was dead, shifting his weight toward the curb at the same time. Somehow my kids didn't hear him as they climbed out, nor did they see my reaction to his threat: I opened the glove compartment and removed a long-barreled .22 target pistol that was there by chance, as part of the move. Its rubber grip met my hand and melded with it in a smooth, reflexive motion. I held the gun across my belt line, displaying its silver profile as I turned. The scary young man was about ten yards away by then, but when he saw the gun, his body rocked backward as though in a cartoon. I watched his flushed face drain pale as he backed off, one shoe untied and dragging a long, loose lace. He vanished around the bar's corner, a full retreat that left me presiding over a total victory that no one, because the street was empty, had witnessed.

A single win is not a streak. It may, in fact, be a basis for self-delusion. Statistics on the dangers guns pose to the health of their owners and those who live with them suggest that I'd be safer selling my guns than reserving them for Tombstone II. Trouble is, in an armed showdown, statistics tend to lose. In those who've learned to imagine assailants everywhere and may even have faced a real assailant, guns encourage a sense of personal exceptionalism. It's the essence of their magnetism. Firearms exist to manage situations where rationality has failed, so thinking rationally about them can be hard.

Guns can turn you into an insider even if you're an outsider by nature, recruiting you into a loose fraternity of people who feel embattled and defensive and are primally eager to win allies. For the apprehensive newcomer, this process of ingratiation happens in increments, through a series of pats on the shoulder and other encouragements.

Last year, I visited a local outdoors store with a well-schooled, citified young woman who'd taken a shooting-sports course at a friend's urging, discovered in herself a natural acumen, and decided to buy a firearm of her own so she could hone her aim. The clerk at the glass display case was a maven, clearly eager to make converts. He regaled us with talk of light-weight alloys, laser sights, and ""concealability."" When my friend chose a single-action Ruger pistol, there was a problem with the paperwork; her driver's license listed a P.O. Box, not a physical address, as the law required. No worries, the clerk offered a workaround. If she bought a fishing license in the same store, she could enter a street address on the honor system. Voilà, a second state ID!

A couple of weeks later, with our new sidearms, we sat in a spartan club house at a gun range as a folksy retired small-town cop gave about twelve of us a short exam that would qualify us for concealed-carry permits. The instructor made sure, with hints, that everyone passed. He also briefed us on the gun laws of states more tightly wound than ours. Special caution was urged when traveling through Nevada, where even an unloaded gun locked in a car trunk might land its owner in hot water. The presentation was neutral on the legitimacy of such regulations and restrictions, but its unmistakable, unvoiced premise was that we were entering hostile territory, a world poised to trip us up. The only solution was rigorous self-discipline, a heightened sense of vigilance and caution that those without guns didn't need to cultivate.





It's flattering being recruited into an ethos of responsibility. It makes you want to walk the line. It also reminds you how arbitrary some lines are. Cross the wrong state border with your gun or wake up one morning to new legislation or a new presidential executive order, and suddenly you're the bad guy, not the good guy. No wonder some gun owners seem so touchy; they feel, at some level, like criminals in waiting. This feeling helps promote a bond. ""If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns,"" says the cussed old right-wing bumper sticker. Perhaps there should be another one that says: ""If guns are outlawed, there will be a lot more outlaws.""

A few months after taking the concealed-carry class, my friend and I attended a benefit for a small-town charity that attracted several people of means. Barbecued ribs were served on the host's porch and somehow the talk turned to crime and self-defense. The former CEO of a huge company described being kidnapped for ransom many years ago. The man had escaped his captor and cheated death, he felt; he'd carried a weapon ever since, loaded with man-stopping, lethal ammunition of the sort that starts flying off the shelves when ""Meet the Press"" hosts wave ammo clips around on Sunday morning. Soon, other rib-eaters got to talking guns, and it emerged that a group of them, all women, liked to get together, don fancy clothes, and practice their marksmanship. They invited my friend to join them for their next outing, drawing her further into a new ""us"" that, only recently, had been a ""them"" to her.

Will there be fewer murders with tighter gun laws—the modest laws that might actually materialize rather than the grand ones that probably won't but will surely rev up the rhetoric and the hoarding—or only fewer or smaller massacres? Can we expect less violence altogether or merely less outrageous acts of violence? And if the answer is fewer catastrophes, fewer Auroras and Sandy Hooks, would that be a worthwhile accomplishment in itself? I think so. Horror and panic themselves are forms of violence, and diminishing them, restricting their dimensions, is itself a civilizing act.

To civilize, I think, is the key verb. It's a crossover word, with a cultural legacy and a practical, specific meaning—to order; to, yes, ""regulate""—that the gun-owning mind responds to and respects. In westerns, the gun (the gun in the right hands; and the gun owner thinks of his own hands as the right ones, which all who wish to engage him in conversation would be wise not to forget) is a tool of civilization, not a totem. It tames, the gun, but only if it's first tamed. Those who won't tame it, or can't—because they're unable to tame themselves—must face being disarmed. Especially hard-to-tame types of guns, moreover, must be closely, vigilantly watched.

Of the five or six guns I've gathered over the decades (IF YOU KNOW HOW MANY GUNS YOU HAVE, YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH read a t-shirt I saw once) only one is designed to use on human beings: a .38 revolver of the type that burdened policemen's sagging belts once, before the adoption of sleeker 9mms. The gun is a stodgy old classic, Smithsonian-worthy, that evokes the Made-in-USA age and also speaks of my distance, I like to think, from the cult of maximum firepower that draws harder-boiled folks to stores and gun shows to handle Bushmasters and similar weapons with death-dealing, quasi-military designs. Such ominous firearms hold no allure for me, in part because I doubt they'd do much good against a maniac carrying one or a hypothetical goon squad equipped with their vastly superior big brothers. Ban those guns. Neuter them. I'm fine with it. I can hunt with my shotguns and my deer gun (although I've grown tired of hunting), and I can protect myself from miscreants with my trusty .38.

To some in the gun-owning fraternity, this view makes me a traitor. So be it; I think they're wrong. As they have repeatedly pointed out themselves, and as even Wayne LaPierre might agree, assault rifles are functionally similar to ordinary semi-automatic rifles, differing chiefly in their sinister cosmetics, not in their underlying ballistics. This being the case, what will be lost by giving them up? Nothing but their destabilizing allure for the grandiose, image-obsessed mass killers who favor them—and whose crimes represent a far greater risk to gun rights than does the perceived hostility of certain politicians. By assenting to such a ban, the gun-owning community can demonstrate precisely the sort of reasonable public-mindedness of which some believe it to be incapable. Otherwise, the showdown will go on and we will have only ourselves to blame if our self-destructive intransigence leaves us despised and cornered, with no way out.","2013-01-30 00:00:00","0","45.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","50.0","26.0","0.0","112.0","0.0","15.0","3","2488","78.18","67.94","38.79","11.27","17.65","20.66","80.39","49.64","13.55","8.52","3.30","1.00","1.25","1.65","1.33","5.02","9.20","12.74","6.55","4.14","5.87","1.45","12.10","5.10","2.65","1.53","1.49","1.77","5.10","1.89","3.01","0.96","1.05","0.20","10.13","0.08","0.60","0.48","1.73","9.81","2.33","1.25","1.29","2.73","1.17","2.93","2.61","0.84","0.24","1.29","1.77","0.96","0.40","0.04","0.28","8.44","2.33","1.13","3.98","0.76","1.29","4.02","6.23","1.09","13.67","2.21","7.27","4.22","1.93","0.60","0.24","0.36","0.08","0.40","0.20","0.04","0.04","0.08","0.04","0.00","19.69","5.47","7.96","0.24","0.32","0.20","0.08","1.69","0.96","2.21","0.56","0.00","11263","7.79","18.15714285714286","3417","2431","137","70.43","10.5","7.8","10.61","10.3","505","3.5","17.389337721102425","1166","16.58","73","0.48","0","76","22","261","0","286","213","15","1","34","396","110","1","147","1","0","184","64","132","5","0","13","61","0","91","121","51","64","93","44","18","13","2","17"

Which is pretty darned certain. But this is a report which makes many of its assertions with an absolute level of confidence; it calls the evidence that the planet is warming “unequivocal.” So what about the other 5 percent?

“Science follows a hierarchy of certainty,” said Gabriel Vecchi, who works for the long-term research arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and was a contributing author to the report. “You’re always going to be more confident in what you’ve seen than what causes what you’ve seen.” Vecchi said that 5 percent represents the odds that in the future, the IPCC will have to revise this painstakingly crafted statement: “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”

“But I think 95 percent is a pretty substantial level of confidence,” Vecchia added. “One of them could be that instead of the dominant cause of planet warming—50 percent plus one—we learn over time that there could be another cause. But each one of the ways that you could revise that statement only adds up to 5 percent.”","2013-09-27 00:00:00","0","12.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","44.0","26.0","0.0","102.0","0.0","15.0","2","260","86.59","66.40","15.86","95.12","20.00","25.00","81.92","48.08","12.31","3.08","0.38","0.38","1.54","0.00","0.77","9.23","10.00","12.69","9.23","2.69","3.08","0.38","14.62","1.92","1.15","2.69","3.85","5.00","6.15","5.38","0.77","0.00","0.77","0.00","5.77","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.38","1.92","4.23","1.15","1.15","4.23","2.69","3.46","0.77","1.15","1.54","0.38","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.92","0.77","2.69","4.23","3.08","0.00","3.46","8.85","1.54","11.15","1.92","5.77","3.46","4.23","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","16.54","4.62","2.69","0.38","0.38","0.38","0.00","0.77","5.38","1.92","0.00","0.00","1256","8.68","29.444444444444443","387","256","13","59.94","12.0","9.8","12.36","12.5","66","7.333333333333334","20.192500000000003","159","25.0","2","0.47","0","7","9","32","0","34","22","0","0","5","50","19","0","6","1","0","9","2","10","1","1","1","4","0","7","6","4","4","5","17","3","5","0","0"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/114008/obamas-july-24-2013-speech-economy-middle-out-means-little","'Middle Out': What's With Obama's Tepid New Slogan?","But “middle out” is more than just another way to say populism. It’s also an economic argument.

In something of a manifesto for the phrase, Eric Liu and Nick Hanauer write in Democracy that the purpose is to explain how helping the middle class will help the nation grow. “Rich businesspeople are not the primary job creators; middle-class customers are,” they write. “The more the middle class can buy, the more jobs we’ll create.” Implicit here are two ideas: first, the Keynesian notion that firing up weak demand is crucial to lifting a country out of a recession; and second, a new view (supported by a growing body of research) that income inequality hinders a country’s growth.

Obama has explored this theme in the past. The middle class is the “true engine of America’s economic growth,” he said in this year’s State of the Union, though he did not elaborate much further. And it’s unclear how vigorously he will sell the link between economic growth and middle-class prosperity, or how successful this line of reasoning will be. Inevitably, there will be a GOP rebuttal that sounds equally compelling to a layman’s ear—say, that spending on the middle class would be nice if we could afford it, but that the government requires fiscal discipline.

Getting mired in such a debate about economic theory would be a mistake, says George Lakoff, a cognitive linguist who writes about political messaging. “The president assumes that the facts will set you free. But they won’t. Most people are not going to understand the facts.”

Instead, “Obama needs to come up with an undercutting moral message,” Lakoff says. “It’s about politics and principles.” Lakoff is partial to Obama's infamous phrase “you didn’t build that,” which he says was in the right spirit but got botched by sloppy delivery. “He meant you didn’t build the roads or the infrastructure, but it was interpreted as you didn’t build the business.”","2013-07-24 00:00:00","0","21.0","5.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","45.0","26.0","0.0","100.0","0.0","15.0","3","325","74.97","60.92","23.25","60.77","18.06","21.54","84.92","48.92","10.15","4.00","0.00","0.62","1.23","1.54","0.62","6.15","11.08","10.46","10.46","4.00","5.85","2.15","17.23","7.38","4.62","1.54","0.92","2.46","3.69","2.77","0.92","0.00","0.31","0.00","8.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.54","14.46","2.77","2.15","1.85","2.46","1.54","5.54","2.77","0.31","2.46","0.00","0.92","0.62","0.31","0.00","0.00","7.08","1.85","1.23","3.38","0.92","0.31","3.38","9.85","2.46","11.69","2.77","8.00","0.92","8.62","0.00","0.00","4.31","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","22.46","5.54","5.23","0.31","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.62","5.54","4.00","0.62","0.00","1520","8.3","22.533333333333335","467","322","18","61.77","11.5","9.1","11.31","11.0","77","6.833333333333333","18.725217391304348","196","20.13","1","0.5","0","12","1","40","0","32","36","2","1","9","56","19","0","10","0","0","19","0","13","2","0","3","7","0","16","8","6","5","15","18","3","1","0","3"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/113933/chris-froome-weight-why-are-cyclists-so-small","Why Are Cyclists So Small?","Whenever people who don’t follow bike racing happen to meet champion cyclists, they are always surprised by how small the riders seem. So they are, both in general and compared with other sportsmen, or even sportswomen. That thought was prompted again by last Sunday’s heroic stage of the Tour de France. It began in Givors, in front of illustrious guests. One was Eddy Mercx, perhaps the greatest cyclist of all, who must have watched Chris Froome’s victory on Mont Ventoux later in the afternoon and remebered his own heroic conquest of the mountain in 1970, on his way to the second of his five Tour victories.

Another was Marion Bartoli, a week after she won the ladies’ singles at Wimbledon. Her home town is Le Puy-en-Velay, not far from Givors, a ville-étape for the Tour ten years ago, when we who were covering the race were plied with cans of the famous Puy green lentils (they’re really good!), and she’s a Tour fanatic. Seeing her again, off the court, made me think of some comparisons. At Wimbledon, a BBC pundit got in the hottest of water by saying that Marion isn’t “a looker,” but even a less obviously sexist commentator called her “stocky.” To be precise, she’s five-foot-seven, and weighs 140 pounds.

Now look at some cyclists. Tony Martin, who is the current time-trialling world champion and won the first time trial in this Tour, is two inches taller than Bartoli, but the same weight, 140 pounds. Mark Cavendish is five-foot-nine like Martin, though heavier at 150 pounds, with a sprinter’s thick thigh muscles. Although Chris Froome is a lanky six-foot-one, he only weighs 152 pounds. Even then he’s a veritable giant compared with the one man who stayed close to him on Mont Ventoux. The wonderful Nairo Alexander Quintana Rojas, still only 23, is the kind of cyclist his fellow Colombians pleasingly call an escarabajo, a flying beetle. He’s two inches shorter than Bartoli at five-foot-five—and 14 pounds lighter, a pocket dynamo of 126 pounds.

With that kind of physique, one can agree that Quintana has certainly chosen the right sport, and the others too: None of them would have much of a career as an NFL tight end, or as an NBA center. What matters with cyclists isn’t their size but their energy-to-weight ratio, their internal organs, and their capacity to turn oxygen into strength. Miguel Induráin won the Tour five times in succession from 1991, and really was a kind of freak. His lungs were a third larger than average for a man of his size, his cardiac output was twice that of many cyclists, and his standing pulse rate was as low as 28 (I’m happy when mine is 65). Unfortunately Induráin was also a client of Francesco Conconi, another infamous “sports doctor,” who is now best known for his pioneering work introducing the blood-enhancing drug EPO to bike racing (and maybe other sports).","2013-07-18 00:00:00","0","16.0","6.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","42.0","26.0","0.0","108.0","0.0","15.0","3","501","82.19","64.79","13.46","77.25","22.77","17.17","76.05","44.91","9.78","5.99","0.60","0.20","0.00","3.79","1.40","3.79","8.18","12.38","7.19","4.39","5.79","1.00","11.38","6.39","4.59","2.20","6.19","2.40","3.99","3.39","0.60","0.00","0.00","0.20","8.98","0.00","0.40","1.40","3.19","7.58","0.80","0.40","0.40","2.00","1.20","3.59","2.40","1.00","0.20","1.20","3.39","1.80","0.80","0.00","1.00","4.59","0.40","2.00","2.79","1.60","0.00","4.19","7.39","0.20","13.57","1.00","7.78","4.99","1.20","1.40","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.20","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","20.56","4.39","7.78","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.20","2.99","1.20","2.59","1.20","0.00","2222","7.76","23.454545454545453","681","488","23","66.88","10.9","9.2","10.68","11.9","95","8.8","18.26688524590164","307","21.68","5","0.44","0","16","27","50","2","62","32","4","1","3","74","52","1","31","0","0","16","14","32","2","1","1","7","0","13","23","7","8","12","14","0","7","0","4"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/113937/bob-odenkirk-interview-qa-breaking-bads-saul-goodman","""Saul Goodman Should be Mayor of Las Vegas""","To illustrate our cover story about the meltdown of big law in the wake of the financial crisis, we chose a character who epitomizes the lawyer at his most ruthless (and, increasingly, desperate): Saul Goodman of “Breaking Bad,” who was photographed by Art Streiber. Saul, played by Bob Odenkirk, is the tacky, crooked attorney who traffics in drug busts and fraudulent insurance claims, smooth-talking his clients—and himself—out of a string of impossible jams. With the first of “Breaking Bad”’s final eight episodes set to premiere August 11, we spoke to Odenkirk about his inspirations for the character, whether Saul survives the end of the series, and rumors that he’ll be starring in a “Better Call Saul” spin-off.

Laura Bennett: Did you model Saul Goodman on any actual lawyers?

Bob Odenkirk: I’m happy to say Saul Goodman is not based on observing lawyers in any proximity. My mother-in-law is a lawyer.

LB: I’m sure she would be very flattered if I said she was your inspiration for Saul.

BO: She’s a very sweet lady and she does really great work for families in San Diego and San Jose. I actually based Saul on Hollywood agents. The energy of the character and the playful duplicity.

LB: I don’t know how much you’ve been told about our upcoming cover story, the one you’ve bravely agreed to pose for. But basically it’s about the moral decay of white-shoe law firms in the post-recession era, their descent into hotbeds of backstabbing and greed.

BO: I don’t think Saul is that far off from a lot of real people who decide that it’s above their pay grade to think about things on a deeper level, who think that the world is just a bunch of systems and it’s their job to navigate those systems to their benefit. I don’t think they wake up grinning maliciously. They don’t think about what’s right and wrong, or the meaning of things. They just think, I’m gonna get shit done. I think that’s what a lot of people think capitalism is: It’s meant to be an anarchist system that allows me to get whatever I want to serve myself. Oh jeez, I shouldn’t pontificate.

LB: How do you imagine Saul’s backstory? What was he doing before he became a criminal lawyer?

BO: He probably went through college very fast. I feel like he got his degree in three years, he passed his bar on the second try, and he worked really hard to just barely get over the hurdles. He was like, let’s get this done fast. And as many shortcuts as I can take, I will take them. And I will be an official lawyer, as official as any lawyer coming out of Harvard or any other big place.

LB: You think Saul reads The New Republic?

BO: He definitely does not read The New Republic. I think Saul reads GQ. I think he reads—is there a magazine that alerts you about when there are new strippers in town? He would read that. A stripper alert magazine. He would read USA Today if he were in the airport and were bored.

LB: The first time [“Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan] approached you with the script, what was your impression of Saul?

BO: My first thought was that they had the wrong guy. Because I’ve done mostly sketch comedy and I honestly thought—are you sure there isn’t another Bob Odenkirk who graduated from Yale drama school? Everything fed into [my excitement about the script]: showing up on the set, seeing the amazing set. That office is designed to intimidate and impress people who maybe aren’t that astute about the law and such.

LB: That set is so funny. Do you remember your initial reaction to the pillars and the Constitution backdrop?

BO: Well the thing is, it turns out, it’s not even that over the top! The guy who designed it, Robb Wilson King, is a great set designer. He went around town in Albuquerque and looked at law offices to get the idea of what to do. I have a photo of a law office in Albuquerque that I really think inspired him. I went for a bike ride and I saw this house that was a miniature White House. And it turned out it’s a law office. When you get up close, let’s just say it’s very homemade. I took a picture of it.

LB: I’ve heard there are some very intense scenes coming up between Walt and Saul. How did Saul change as a character over the course of season five?

BO: He’s trapped now, and he’s scared. He is doing less joking around, though he still comes up with a smartass remark once in awhile. It’s fun to play Saul when he’s in control and he’s putting on a show, and it’s a little less fun to play him buttoned-down and scared.

LB: What does Saul think of Walt?

BO: Saul is deeply afraid of Walt. On a level that Saul has never feared a client before—and Saul mostly works with drug dealers and roustabouts. It took Saul a long while to understand just how dangerous Walt is. This is a big change from when Saul met Walt and thought that Walt was the golden goose who was going to crap gold eggs for him forever and ever.

LB: Going into season five, did you know whether Saul was going to make it out alive?

BO: Every single script I’ve picked up, I look for his death scene and I just hope they don’t have to make one of those full-size death masks of me so they can make a decapitated Saul head. I can’t stand getting my face covered in latex.

LB: How did you feel about the way the Saul plot line wrapped up?

BO: I think it’s great. Absolutely believable and appropriate. Cannot tell you why I think that, though, without giving too much away.

LB: What was it like wrapping your final episode?

BO: I did not feel deeply sad at the final episode for Saul. I have always considered the work to be a crazy gift I’ve been given. Also, and maybe this is because I’m a writer myself, I am acutely aware that one of the reasons the show is so good is that it was hurtling towards an ending, not just lingering and mucking about.

LB: There are rumors that plans for a “Better Call Saul” spin-off were recently upgraded from “exploratory” to “full speed ahead.” What does that mean?

BO: It’s still hypothetical. It is. Vince is thinking about it, but we’ll see what happens.

LB: But it’s less hypothetical than it used to be?

BO: Let’s just say some of the blogs reporting it are really premature.

LB: What’s your dream Saul spin-off?

BO: Saul Goodman should be mayor of Las Vegas. He could work in any city. It’s just that in Vegas he could be the mayor one day. He’d really be an upstanding citizen.","2013-07-21 00:00:00","0","41.0","37.0","6.0","1.0","15.0","0.0","43.0","26.0","0.0","110.0","0.0","16.0","2","1185","49.02","65.74","29.23","49.32","14.81","13.92","82.45","53.59","16.62","9.87","3.71","0.68","1.52","3.04","0.93","6.75","6.75","12.91","10.63","6.24","5.57","1.43","18.73","4.73","1.69","2.70","1.27","1.77","4.81","3.04","1.77","0.42","0.34","0.17","9.70","0.25","0.17","0.51","3.04","10.80","3.38","1.77","1.01","2.03","0.84","2.45","2.28","1.10","0.59","0.51","1.18","0.59","0.25","0.00","0.34","7.26","0.84","1.27","3.04","1.86","0.59","4.47","12.15","1.18","12.24","2.11","6.58","3.63","3.29","1.43","0.25","0.42","0.08","0.25","0.68","0.25","0.17","0.08","0.17","0.00","19.32","5.32","3.38","2.70","0.00","1.35","0.08","0.84","1.18","4.05","0.08","0.34","4923","6.56","15.594936708860759","1486","1169","79","81.83","9.0","5.5","8.0","7.0","162","16.5","13.463199315654407","502","14.24","67","0.52","0","39","9","97","0","133","88","3","1","11","145","130","0","36","0","0","119","19","69","2","0","12","25","0","51","62","24","20","52","49","5","19","0","7"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/113945/new-york-mayor-race-who-wins-hipster-vote","Why the Hipster Vote Is Meaningless In New York City","On Thursday night, former Vermont Governor Howard Dean appeared at a closed-press grassroots fundraiser for Bill de Blasio, the New York City public advocate who is running for mayor. The “Night of Drinks & Fun” was hosted by Democracy for NYC, a branch of Democracy for America, the grassroots progressive advocacy group founded in the wake of Dean’s unsuccessful 2004 presidential run. And it was hosted at a location far different from the churches, senior centers, and been-around-for-decades small businesses where so much of New York’s retail campaigning takes place. It went down at The Crown Inn, a hip bar on Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

Studious readers of some of the more maligned articles in The New York Times Styles section will recognize the significance of several signifiers. Franklin Avenue, for example: The street, which runs south from Bedford-Stuyvesant through Crown Heights all the way down to southeast Prospect Park right near where Ebbets Field used to be, has become shorthand for “hipster gentrification craft cocktails etcetera”; here, for example, is a 2012 Times slide show that begins, “Franklin Avenue is the focus of the renaissance for the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn.” (For its part, The Crown Inn offers an impressive array of spirits as well as “From the Farm Sandwiches”—“All ingredients are locally sourced,” the menu promises, “and of the highest quality.”)

Add Dean—who probably led to more political awakenings among today’s liberal twenty- and thirty-somethings than any politician not named Barack Obama—and de Blasio’s own multicultural-marriage, “organic milk,” and economically progressive image, and it seemed fair to ask: Could it be that—in a crowded Democratic primary in which De Blasio is tied for third, pretty distantly behind Christine Quinn and Anthony Weiner—de Blasio is actively courting progressive young people who typically work in creative fields and predominately live in certain neighborhoods in lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and western Queens? Is de Blasio going after the hipster vote?

Dan Levitan, de Blasio’s spokesman, demurred. “Bill is running as a full-throated progressive,” he told me, “and that’s what Dean did when he ran for president.""","2013-07-19 00:00:00","0","21.0","7.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","55.0","26.0","0.0","112.0","0.0","14.0","3","359","96.86","65.18","52.99","62.74","32.64","28.41","75.49","38.72","5.01","0.84","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.56","0.00","4.18","7.52","15.60","5.29","2.51","4.46","0.28","10.31","6.41","3.06","2.51","1.39","3.62","3.06","2.51","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.56","5.29","0.28","0.28","0.28","0.56","6.41","0.84","1.39","0.28","2.23","1.11","0.84","1.39","0.84","0.28","0.28","2.51","0.84","0.28","0.00","1.39","8.91","1.11","1.11","6.13","0.56","0.00","4.18","6.41","0.84","20.33","2.51","13.37","4.46","4.18","2.23","0.28","1.39","0.56","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","21.45","2.51","7.52","0.56","0.28","0.56","0.00","2.51","5.01","1.67","0.56","0.28","1809","9.58","40.55555555555556","533","346","11","47.96","15.3","14.4","15.1","20.1","96","12.25","25.698265895953757","234","33.78","1","0.39","0","11","2","30","2","54","31","1","1","1","48","76","0","19","1","0","8","1","16","2","0","0","4","0","6","14","4","8","5","11","2","4","0","3"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/111891/andrew-cuomo-and-martin-omalley-bet-gun-control","The Democrats' 2016 Contenders Are Betting on Gun Control","Second, to the extent that gun control was politically risky in past years, the picture simply is different now. The national Democratic coalition -- what it needs to get 271 Electoral College votes -- relies far less than it used to on white, rural voters for whom gun rights are a priority, now that West Virginia, Tennessee and Arkansas are out of the Democratic column. Gun ownership generally sorts into partisan lines, with most ardent gun-rights adherents lost to the Democrats for good.

And then there is Newtown. The massacre of 20 elementary school students and a half dozen of their educators has indisputably shifted public opinion -- in a new Washington Post poll, 52 percent say that Newtown made them more supportive of gun restrictions. The NRA's provocative response has ginned up new members for the organization but not helped with the broader public. And that's even before the families of the victims – and of victims from other recent mass shootings, like the one at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado – have started to organize themselves as a political force, as we're now starting to see happening. We're going to hear more things like this, from Dave Hoover, a police officer in Lakewood, Colo., whose nephew A. J. Boik was one of the 12 people killed in Aurora: “It’s different now because children are being butchered in schools. Because kids were killed at a movie. Because families went to church and were gunned down. I don’t understand why we are even arguing about this.”

This not to say that a major gun control package is going to pass Congress in the months ahead. The fact remains that the House is controlled by the Republican Party (despite its winning well over 1 million fewer votes in House elections in November) and that the House Judiciary Committee, which has purview over gun legislation, is chaired by a Virginia Republican, Bob Goodlatte, who ranks the NRA as his sixth largest source of campaign funds and has declared new restrictions a non-starter.

But it is wrong to read the NRA's grip on the legislative machinery as a monolithic hold on this issue overall. The debate has been broken open after far too long, and it's going to be much more fluid and unpredictable going forward than it's been for years. It will be highly variegated from state to state—new restrictions will go on the books in East Coast states run by ambitious Democrats and in states such as Colorado, which have suffered more than their share of mass violence. Meanwhile, some states will go the other direction – Wyoming is considering a bill to block any new federal restrictions on assault rifles or magazine size – and, yes, congressional Democrats from those states will still balk at new regulations, as newly elected North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp has done. But these Democrats will for the first time in years face serious pressure from other Democrats and advocates, not least the deep-pocketed Mike Bloomberg. Democratic presidential candidates running in 2016 will have to have a serious gun control plank, and they will pitch it in the primaries with the forcefulness of people who won't fear that it'll come back to doom them in the general election.

If one needs further proof that the landscape has shifted and become far more complex, consider Rahm Emanuel, who as much as any other leading Democratic warned the party away from the gun control issue after 2000. He proudly recruited pro-gun rights House candidates in 2006, and strongly discouraged Attorney General Eric Holder and others in the Obama administration from pressing gun control in the president's firm term (""shut the fuck up"" on the issue, he reportedly declared).","2013-01-14 00:00:00","0","18.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","10.0","0.0","77.0","26.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","15.0","3","620","91.67","58.30","38.15","7.28","26.96","24.35","78.23","46.29","8.39","2.10","0.16","0.48","0.00","0.48","0.97","6.29","8.06","15.81","7.58","2.74","5.48","0.81","13.23","8.55","5.00","1.45","2.74","2.42","4.52","1.45","3.06","0.48","0.81","0.65","5.81","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.65","8.55","0.81","2.74","0.48","1.61","0.32","3.06","1.61","0.81","0.48","0.32","0.65","0.16","0.00","0.48","0.00","9.35","1.61","1.29","5.81","0.48","0.81","2.42","8.71","2.42","16.13","2.10","8.87","5.48","3.71","1.61","0.97","0.32","0.32","0.48","0.48","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.16","0.00","13.71","3.87","4.84","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.61","0.65","1.94","0.65","0.00","2968","8.41","31.6","902","619","23","52.63","13.3","12.6","11.73","15.3","135","10.3","21.483747980613895","349","28.25","6","0.46","0","21","11","58","0","90","62","6","2","7","77","57","5","42","0","0","19","4","33","2","0","3","16","0","19","17","12","22","11","26","2","5","1","1"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/114914/obama-rouhani-talk-promising-phone-call-after-united-nations-meeting","Iran's President Is Still All Talk, But He's Saying the Right Things","The call, now heard around the world, made Friday by President Barack Obama from the Oval Office to Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani, as he was stuck in New York City traffic on his way to the airport, has at least for the moment ended a tumultuous 34-year-old estrangement between the two countries, a estrangement only occasionally broken by discreet mid-level meetings between the two countries’ representatives, or “back-channel” encounters.

To anyone closely watching the contours of U.S.-Iran relations, the call was not so much a beginning but the middle of an intricately planned diplomatic dance that began several months ago. Faced with crippling sanctions, the Iranian regime announced its willingness to direct dialogue with the U.S. Indeed, many hours before the call, one of Rouhani’s top economic advisors had already met with a bevy of American captains of industry and finance, inviting them to invest in Iran. Rouhani and his capable foreign minister, Javad Zarif, had also privately met with several high-ranking American political, and media leaders. They had, in short, come not to bury the “Great Satan” but to woo him. Had there been no presidential call, the much anticipated trip to the United Nations headquarters might have been called much ado about nothing.

Rouhani’s trip was paradoxically predisposed to be both a great success and a disappointing failure. Its virtual success was ensured by the reality of the low bar set by the eight years of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s circus-like bombastic visits to the U.N. All Rouhani had to do not to fail was to avoid the buffoonery of his predecessor. At the same time, Rouhani’s repeated promises of expeditiously fixing the nuclear impasse, resetting and managing Iran’s troubled relations with the U.S., the fact of the strong surge of support he enjoyed from most of Iran’s moderate, reformist, and democratic forces, the multi-faceted media blitz organized by his advance team of advisors, had combined to create challengingly high expectations for his trip. His suggestion that because he is no historian he can’t positively say the Holocaust was a fact of history dampened some of the enthusiastic expectations. His vaguely conciliatory speech at the U.N. General Assembly, and his refusal to attend a luncheon hosted by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, lest he had to shake hands with Obama further dampened expectations. Rouhani, a consummate politician and well-aware of the power of images—evident, for example in his decision to bring with him the one Jewish member of the Iranian Majlis—this time chose to avoid the handshake, lest the photo-op with an American president afford more ammunition than needed to his critics at home. His final decision to take the call from the White House was clearly the diplomatic coup of his trip. Even with his vague statements, his presence had clearly dominated the new General Assembly. Save for the call with Obama, his other high-level meetings with heads of states, including with France’s president, were overshadowed by the guessing game of whether or not the U.S. and Iranian presidents will meet or talk.

In spite of the ultimate success of his trip (more than anything manifest in the call), Rouhani was not treated to a hero’s welcome at home. At the Tehran airport, about a hundred radical students blocked his motorcade by chanting death to America, performing their prayer, and hurling eggs and the infamous shoe at him. Another group had come to support the president and hailed him as the healer. After the motorcade left the airport, the two groups fought a pitched battle. Conservative papers also immediately begun to snipe at Rouhani by pointing to the discrepancy between the White House and Rouhani’s version of how the call took place. In his rendition—one clearly intended to appease the conservatives and show that he had made no concessions—it was the White House that insisted on the call even after the rebuke it received in Rouhani’s refusal to shake Obama’s hands. The White House, on the other hand, suggested that it was the Rouhani team that offered a call instead a hand-shake. Hossein Shariatmadari, the Khamenei-appointed editor of the Tehran daily Keyhan, claimed in an interview that the discrepancy between the two narratives must be resolved, adding that either Rouhani or the White House is lying, and in either case, the controversy, he insisted, underscores “the ugly and evil” nature of Rouhani’s decision to talk to the president of the U.S.","2013-09-29 00:00:00","0","11.0","7.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","49.0","26.0","0.0","105.0","0.0","15.0","2","754","97.88","74.22","5.27","32.60","29.00","27.72","79.84","46.02","7.16","4.64","0.00","0.00","0.40","3.85","0.40","2.52","11.54","16.05","4.38","2.79","3.98","1.33","7.82","6.23","2.52","0.27","1.33","2.52","4.91","2.65","2.25","0.66","0.80","0.53","10.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.85","8.09","1.06","0.93","0.66","1.72","1.59","2.79","2.12","1.19","0.40","0.53","1.33","0.80","0.13","0.00","0.40","8.49","1.86","2.12","4.11","1.46","0.66","5.31","2.79","0.93","11.94","2.12","5.97","4.11","5.17","0.80","0.93","0.40","0.53","0.40","0.93","0.00","0.53","0.27","0.13","0.00","16.18","5.04","6.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.86","0.80","1.99","0.27","0.00","3665","8.75","32.25","1136","734","30","55.07","14.4","11.7","13.0","15.2","181","16.166666666666668","21.66376021798365","382","27.46","16","0.45","0","22","9","96","3","98","60","1","4","4","130","89","0","39","0","0","16","21","36","1","0","0","29","0","26","44","9","24","2","6","3","0","0","1"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/113813/afghanistan-elections-2014-potential-presidential-candidates","The Men (and One Woman) Who Might Be Afghanistan's Next President","There will also likely be an opposition candidate, probably from the Tajik minority that makes up about 26 percent of the country. Two of the top contenders are:

Abdullah Abdullah, the leader of the largest opposition party and one of Karzai's main rivals. Abdullah came in second place in the 2009 elections where he got as much as 30 percent of the vote during the runoffs. Abdullah, who accused Karzai of vote-rigging in 2009, has said he is disgusted with the political process and might not run in 2014. In a country where ethnicity trumps politics, Abdullah has an advantage in that he is of mixed Pashtun and Tajik ancestry. But most of his support is Tajik, and he has struggled to win over Pashtuns at large.

Atta Muhammad Nur, the wealthy governor of Balkh Province. Nur is the Eddard Stark of Afghanistan, widely admired in the north. He supported Abdullah in the 2009 election, but has not ruled anything out for 2014. With his money and influence, he could easily become a heavyweight contender himself, Majidyar says. But Felbab-Brown says he has little chance with the Pashtuns. She suspects that Nur is waiting for someone to buy him off with a plum position.

Majidyar emphasizes that the political parties in Afghanistan are capricious and alliances can easily fracture. ""All these political leaders can be easily bought,"" he says. ""If you just show them your candidate will be a winner, they will happily leave their coalitions and join you."" Then there is the distinct possibility that infighting will set in, which would tarnish the legitimacy of an already shaky election. This is why Felbab-Brown thinks that the Afghan party leaders might try to rally around a single consensus candidate. ""Karzai himself was a compromise figure,"" she says. ""The most important thing was that he seemed unthreatening to anyone.""

Being chosen as a compromise candidate might be the only chance for a whole host of outsider presidential candidates who lack traditional power bases in the country, though it's still wildly unlikely. These colorful hopefuls include:

Ashraf Ghani, the chairman of the Afghanistan Transition Coordination Commission. Ghani is a respected technocrat who was educated in the West and spent most of his career as an academic in the U.S. He returned to Afghanistan after 9/11 to advise Hamid Karzai but ran against him in 2009, coming in fourth. As the point person for the transition, he holds a crucial job that also sidelines him to an extent and will cramp his campaigning.

Hanif Atmar, the former minister of the Interior who lost a leg as a special ops officer fighting the Mujahideen in the '80s. Atmar remains on bitter terms with Karzai, who fired him in 2010, ostensibly over a security incident. Tough on the Taliban, Atmar had clashed with Karzai daily so his sacking was no surprise. Now he runs his own political party. ""People view him as non-corrupt,"" Majidyar says—which amounts to high praise.

Ramazan Bashardost, a parliamentarian who came in third with about 10 percent of the vote in 2009. Bashardost went to college in France and lived there until 2002. He is Hazara, one of Afghanistan's minor ethnic groups, but was popular among Pashtuns and Tajiks in 2009. Loud, idealistic, and alone, Bashardost is something like the Ralph Nader of Afghanistan. ""People love him because he's big on anti-corruption,"" Majidyar says. ""But you need alliances. You need the support of heavyweights.""

Shukria Barakzai, a fierce women's rights advocate and member of parliament. Barakzai was a university student when the Taliban took control in 1996. Her family fled but she stayed in Kabul, where she was kicked out of university and forced to wear a burkha. The day the Taliban was ousted, she celebrated by throwing away her burkha. Barakzai is one of the few to have openly announced her candidacy, though she stands no chance. ""Afghanistan has not reached a point where they will elect a woman,"" Majidyar says.

In the coming months, some or all of these characters may step forward. Or they might get bought off one-by-one in backroom deals. It will be delicate balance, Felbab-Brown says. Afghan leaders will try to narrow the field, but any consensus candidate will have to seem harmless to all the major factions. He may be too weak to keep the country together. But if too many titans remain in the race by next spring, the resulting brawl might shake apart the country anyway.

""Hopefully between these two poles there is some solution,"" she says. Hopefully, there will be elections to fret over in the first place.","2013-07-11 00:00:00","0","25.0","14.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","56.0","26.0","0.0","108.0","0.0","15.0","3","777","87.15","81.62","4.09","69.44","15.86","23.29","76.83","49.03","9.91","6.31","0.00","0.00","0.64","5.02","0.64","3.60","9.14","14.29","8.11","3.86","5.53","0.64","13.64","5.15","1.93","1.80","3.60","2.45","5.15","3.60","1.29","0.39","0.26","0.26","11.71","0.13","0.00","1.54","3.73","9.40","0.90","1.03","1.29","4.50","0.51","2.70","2.32","0.77","1.42","0.00","0.77","0.26","0.39","0.00","0.00","9.14","2.06","2.06","5.28","0.77","0.39","3.60","7.98","2.83","13.26","1.80","9.40","2.45","2.70","0.77","0.13","0.77","0.39","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.13","16.47","6.56","5.41","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.03","2.32","0.77","0.00","0.13","3665","7.55","15.66","1106","767","50","72.87","10.8","6.9","10.95","9.6","153","10.1","16.099139504563233","398","14.92","2","0.47","0","24","24","83","1","98","52","0","3","21","102","89","0","29","2","0","40","11","32","0","1","5","16","0","32","30","9","12","9","38","4","6","0","6"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/113822/egypt-coup-civil-war-or-civil-state-next","Civil State or Civil War?","Aside from the generally more violent atmosphere, it is unclear how the Muslim Brotherhood will react to this massive political setback. At a minimum there will be a profound Islamist rethinking of the value of political action, but the Brotherhood, unlike related groups such as Hamas, has not used violence for more than 40 years and is not prone to quick pivots. There is a long tradition, however, of individuals and subgroups leaving the Brotherhood to pursue more extreme and violent activity (notably al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, as well as those who formed Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Gama'at), while others have left to pursue peaceful political activity (inter alia the Wasat and Strong Egypt parties).

For now, the Egyptian military and transition government seem to be sending a double signal to the Brotherhood. They are speaking at the same time the language of political inclusion—for example, announcing a reconciliation initiative called “One Nation” aimed at reintegrating Islamists into politics—and of repression. Morsi himself remains in detention by the Republican Guard, while there are daily reports of the planned arrest of senior Brotherhood figures including Supreme Guide Mohamed Badei, Deputy Guide Khairat al-Shater, and Freedom and Justice Party head Saad el-Katatni. Possible charges include ordering the use of lethal force against demonstrators at Brotherhood headquarters, breaking out of prison during the 2011 revolution, and insulting the judiciary. The most recent allegations stem from an incident at the Republican Guard headquarters on July 8, in which at least 51 (some estimate as many as 84) protesters in a sit-in and three security officers were killed, and hundreds were injured, with live fire and birdshot. An investigation reportedly is ongoing, but whoever provoked the fight, it is a disturbing indication of the sort of violence to come, which might well trigger or justify mass arrests of Brotherhood supporters.

What could easily happen is a return to the sort of low-level insurgency and domestic terrorism that plagued Egypt during the 1980s and especially the 1990s. That period saw the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat, a 1995 unsuccessful attempt on Mubarak’s life, a 1997 attack in which 58 tourists and four Egyptians were killed in Luxor, and many other incidents in which jihadi Islamists targeted Christians, liberals, foreigners, and government officials. Tens of thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, often for lengthy periods without charge. The Sinai will probably become much more dangerous than it already has, further setting back efforts to restart tourism and get the economy on track. Clashes between Islamist demonstrators and security forces are likely to continue, and those between armed Islamist and secular gangs might become common.

Will the post-Morsi violence become an actual civil war? Several more shoes would have to drop—a return to arms of the so-called repentant former jihadis, the drift toward extremism of more Brotherhood members, the formation of more and larger armed Islamist units in lightly governed areas of Egypt, such as Sinai and the Western Desert­—to bring about that unhappy prospect. But it can no longer be excluded altogether.

Meanwhile, Egypt’s political kaleidoscope will continue to shift, confounding attempts to predict what is coming next (remember how the Brotherhood was unstoppable and going to rule for decades?). It helps to remember that there are not two but at least three major sides—Islamists, secularists, and the state itself—in this fluid game. On the surface, it seems that for now the state and secularists are teamed up against Islamists, but even that is illusory; as Nathan Brown notes, the Salafi Nour Party got its favorite article on Sharia right up front in the interim constitutional declaration.","2013-07-11 00:00:00","0","17.0","2.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","54.0","26.0","0.0","109.0","0.0","15.0","3","616","93.29","55.15","32.91","20.82","30.80","30.19","78.08","44.48","4.87","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.16","4.55","8.28","15.26","6.17","3.73","7.47","0.81","9.74","6.98","4.06","1.62","2.76","2.76","5.52","2.60","2.92","0.49","1.30","0.49","5.19","1.46","0.16","0.00","1.62","9.25","1.95","1.79","0.32","2.44","0.32","3.08","0.65","0.32","0.16","0.16","0.97","0.65","0.49","0.00","0.00","9.90","3.25","0.97","4.87","0.32","0.81","2.44","6.33","1.79","13.80","1.46","7.47","4.71","2.92","0.81","0.16","0.32","2.60","0.97","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.00","13.47","3.08","6.49","0.00","0.16","0.32","0.00","1.30","0.32","0.49","1.30","0.00","3167","9.62","30.9","988","601","20","40.92","16.9","15.0","14.81","19.2","171","16.333333333333332","25.42103161397671","369","27.35","0","0.43","0","33","15","58","0","75","59","5","2","9","74","67","2","45","0","0","9","1","28","3","1","4","17","0","25","15","15","12","11","17","6","4","0","2"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/113774/quebec-train-crash-undermines-key-pro-keystone-claim","Is The Fiery Quebec Train Crash Another Setback For Keystone?","It was overshadowed by the fatal plane crash in San Francisco, but don't be surprised if the horrific runaway train accident in eastern Quebec, where oil tanker cars derailed and exploded, killing at least five and wiping out the downtown district of the small town of Lac-Megantic, has the far greater ramifications. That's because just about everything these days that involves the transport of North American oil factors into the high-stakes debate over the Keystone XL pipeline.

It's not hard to imagine how the Keystone boosters will try to use the crash to their advantage: It will be taken as evidence of the downsides of transporting oil by rail rather than by pipeline. The weekend news coverage already hinted at this tack. The Associated Press reported: ""Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced he was heading to the town Sunday. Because of limited pipeline capacity in North Dakota's Bakken region and in Canada, oil producers are using railroads to transport much of the oil to refineries on the East, Gulf and West coasts, as well as inland. Harper has called railroad transit 'far more environmentally challenging' while trying to persuade the Obama administration to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast.""

But of course there's an entirely different way of looking at it. The environmentalist opponents of Keystone argue that the pipeline should be blocked so that high-emissions tar sands oil stays in the ground in Alberta rather than being burned and thereby exacerbating climate change. The pipeline's boosters have countered that the tar sands will be developed and exported regardless of whether the pipeline is built or not—whether by pipelines crossing British Columbia for export to oil-hungry China, or by rail to the Atlantic or Gulf Coast. That was the gist of the State Department assessment that found that Keystone would not significantly increase emissions compared with other routes of export.

That basic claim—that the tar sands will make it out no matter what—has taken some hits of late, though. An in-depth Reuters analysis in April challenged the State Department assessment, raising serious questions about the economic feasibility of transporting large quantities of tar sands oil by rail. Then came word last month that the provincial government of British Columbia had, on environmental grounds, rejected a proposed pipeline to carry tar sands oil to ports for export to China.","2013-07-08 00:00:00","0","13.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","49.0","26.0","0.0","107.0","0.0","15.0","1","401","95.14","35.41","46.33","34.42","28.64","28.43","72.07","44.14","5.74","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.25","5.24","8.73","16.21","6.23","2.99","5.99","1.25","9.73","5.24","2.49","1.25","0.25","1.25","2.99","1.75","1.25","0.00","0.50","0.25","2.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","9.98","1.50","2.00","1.50","2.00","0.50","4.49","4.49","0.25","0.00","2.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","4.74","0.00","1.50","2.74","0.75","0.00","2.49","4.74","1.50","16.21","2.49","11.47","2.49","3.24","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.25","0.50","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","10.72","3.49","2.99","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.25","0.50","2.00","0.00","0.00","2021","9.13","29.071428571428573","599","393","14","51.41","14.0","13.1","13.58","17.4","102","15.833333333333334","23.621679389312977","237","25.64","2","0.43","0","11","1","40","0","63","26","1","1","6","72","45","1","27","0","0","6","1","17","1","0","2","14","0","15","12","13","14","4","7","3","1","0","2"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/114922/foolish-malicious-war-apostrophes","The Foolish, Malicious War on Apostrophe's","In the debate over whether the apostrophe should be eliminated, there may appear to be connection with real life. However, there isn’t—it can only be classified as a kind of journalistic kabuki. Not that there isn’t sense to it: More than a few understand that apostrophes serve no function and could be eliminated from writing with no ill effect. The Kill the Apostrophe website gets it just right: “If you’re the kind of person who does know and care about the ‘correct’ usage of apostrophes, think how much time you waste fretting over examples of ‘misuse’ when the very fact that you spotted the error means that you knew what they were trying to say in the first place.” Some even think that the anti-apostrophe movement is making inroads, given the general absence from texts. But the truth is that however careless people may be to the apostrophe when they text, in formal writing, the little bugger is—unfortunately—with us to stay.

The impression of demise comes from an age-old fear: that the kind of things that develop in casual speech—or today, e-mails or signs for “Pikes Peak” instead of “Pike’s Peak”—are about to infuse The New York Times. However, texting is essentially speaking with the fingers, not prose, and prose is much less permeable to casual speech than we tend to suppose. It’s more obvious in many other countries: An Arabic speaker’s casual language is as different from the standard language as Italian is from Latin, and no one in Finland actually speaks the standard language casually. In English a similar phenomenon is apparent in spelling conventions: Ours is a language in which through, tough, bough, and cough are all pronounced differently and no one bats an eye. Given that we accept this, the chance is decidedly slim that we are going to give up the difference between it’s and its.

Ah, but if only we could! The apostrophe is a magnificently arbitrary little frill, antique, fussy, and almost begging to be used incorrectly, like a fish fork. They remind me of sartorial advice I was urgently given when I moved to New York: Never wear pants with small vertical pleats around the hips, because it imparts a note of “old.” That makes no logical sense at all, and aesthetically I happened to like those pleats. However, I internalized the random fashion rule because one must, such that even today I wouldn’t be caught dead in pleated pants.

Our adherence to the rules of the apostrophe is no different than the business about pants. We are told we need apostrophes for clarity, but the supposed pitfalls of failing to use them are the kind of thing one must work to conceive rather than actual threats. Coming up with such situations has almost become a game. “Residents refuse to be placed in bins,” is one example John Richards of the Apostrophe Protection Society gave to Slate writer Matthew J.X. Malady. But to be human is to use and interpret language in context, not as disembodied sentences on a page. The notion of people being put in the trash lends a puckish enjoyment—but on a sign in an apartment building, there would be no confusion.","2013-10-01 00:00:00","0","14.0","21.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","43.0","26.0","0.0","99.0","0.0","15.0","2","538","77.25","52.97","25.78","28.86","23.39","22.12","80.86","52.23","9.29","4.28","1.12","1.67","0.74","0.00","0.74","5.02","8.92","14.31","9.29","5.76","6.32","2.60","17.47","4.28","2.97","1.49","1.12","1.86","3.35","1.30","1.12","0.37","0.37","0.19","7.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.80","2.42","1.67","2.04","3.90","1.86","5.76","2.04","0.37","1.12","0.19","1.30","0.74","0.56","0.00","0.00","5.39","2.04","0.74","2.42","0.19","0.56","2.60","11.71","0.74","9.85","1.49","5.95","2.60","1.30","0.74","0.37","0.56","0.00","0.56","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.19","0.00","15.43","4.28","5.20","1.12","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.56","2.23","1.86","0.00","0.00","2471","7.95","26.238095238095237","778","533","22","55.37","12.9","11.5","10.91","13.3","105","12.25","19.55992495309569","308","23.14","7","0.5","0","17","3","60","0","76","51","1","0","9","80","30","0","24","0","0","28","2","32","2","0","2","19","0","25","8","11","12","20","26","4","2","0","4"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/113784/benjamin-netanyahus-two-state-solution-conversion","Netanyahu Could Save the Two-State Solution","“You ask these right-wing ministers why they are so calm despite Bibi’s new rhetoric,” one veteran Israeli reporter told me, “and they say that they put their faith in Abbas [not to negotiate].”

The current deadlock stems from Palestinian demands that Israel freeze all settlement construction and agree up front that their state will be based on the 1967 lines—preconditions which, Netanyahu is fond of saying (not incorrectly) were never placed on his predecessors. The stonewalling strategy made sense so long as Netanyahu seemed utterly uninterested in meaningful concessions and led a cabinet that was even less so.

But times have changed. Netanyahu’s current coalition is more centrist than his last one. His chief peace negotiator, Tzipi Livni—who was also Olmert’s chief negotiator—is Israel’s most prominent advocate for the two-state solution. And Kerry, unlike Hillary Clinton, seems prepared to invest the necessary diplomatic capital to see any talks succeed.

Kerry, for his part, is reported to be floating compromise formulas which would see Israel freeze construction outside the major blocs and agree to base talks on President Obama’s May 2011 speech (which calls for a Palestinian state on the 1967 lines with swaps, as well as recognition of Israel as a Jewish state). Israel seems prepared to accept these compromises. The Palestinians should, too.

It could be that ninety-something percent will prove to be Netanyahu’s bottom line, rather than his starting point, that he won’t budge on Jerusalem and will continue to insist on other non-starters, such as a long-term Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley. But even so, getting a Likud prime minister on the record offering ninety-plus percent of the West Bank would strike a tremendous blow to the idea of Greater Israel and create a baseline from which all future Israeli discussions about territorial compromise would begin.

Were Netanyahu to surprise the world by offering Olmert-like terms—terms that, with some American gap-bridging, Abbas could accept—he would be the one Israeli leader actually able to implement a deal. ""If he leads it, they'll go with him,"" said the Ha’aretz source of his fellow Likud ministers. ""Even those who today present themselves as right-wing."" True, Naftali Bennett’s party would try to bring down the government, but Labor Party leader Shelly Yacimovich has already pledged to be Netanyahu’s “safety net” (joining the coalition or supporting it from outside) if necessary to advance peace. Getting an agreement passed in the public referendum that Netanyahu promises would be even less of a hurdle: Polls have long shown broad Israeli support for the compromises necessary for an agreement.

Earlier this year, I wrote that I believed Netanyahu’s intransigence to be the major obstacle to an agreement. I remain skeptical that Netanyahu will be the leader to make peace with the Palestinians, but less so than I was then, if only because his political survival may now depend on it. Polls show the right-wing bloc losing its majority, and with the growing Tea Party-ization of the Likud—and the presence of a plausible challenger in Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon—it’s not even clear Netanyahu will have a party to lead in the next elections. If Netanyahu wants a fourth term—and he does—he needs to shake things up. The Palestinian leadership should put him in a position where he can.

“I’m convinced that, if the circumstances are right, he will go much farther than people think,” Dennis Ross, Obama’s former Middle East envoy, told me a few months ago. “Abu Mazen told me he thought there was no way Bibi could do a deal. I said, ‘How do you know? You haven’t tested him.’”

"https://newrepublic.com/article/113820/political-journalists-find-refuge-phish-listserv","Political Journalists Find Refuge in Phish Listserv","Financial analyst Dan Greenhaus’s hits on CNBC, couched in jargon, typically attract little more than the bored stares of traders looking up from their monitors. But two seemingly routine appearances of his have been uploaded to YouTube, receiving thousands of views and earning a New York Times blog post. In one, discussing the Federal Reserve, Greenhaus tells three other panelists, “I look back on secular bull markets—you know, the days when my life was a haze, and you could just buy and call it a day.” In the other, arguing heatedly on Lawrence Kudlow’s show, he says, “Inflation as what the Fed cares about has been going backwards down the number line for the better part of two years now,” and, “We quote unquote tightened in the summer and the fall of 2008—I feel the feeling I forgot from that time.”

Why the attention to such banal quotes? Because they, and a couple others from those appearances, contain lyrical allusions from five different songs by Phish (“when my life was a haze,” for example, comes from the song “NICU”). The nearly 30-year-old Vermont jam band will play Long Island’s Jones Beach Theater Friday night and two shows this weekend at Merriweather Post Pavilion outside Washington, D.C. On sports broadcasts, on “Community,” and on innumerable Twitter feeds, Phish fans have sent out little bits of code that let other likeminded aficionados know they are one of them. (Ideally, the lyrics are double entendres that reveal nothing to outsiders, like a thin veil of clouds that keeps stars out of sight.) “When you watch a morning show, ‘Today,’ or on MSNBC, and they use ‘Tweezer Reprise’ as an outro, there’s always a chuckle,” observes National Review’s Robert Costa, who has been going to Phish shows for a decade and can easily recognize these subtle sounds.

Phish’s community is disparate, stretching across geographic and professional boundaries; it rewards obsessiveness, whether it is knowing concert callbacks or recognizing lyrics in tweets; and it is small, though not as small as you think, and deeply committed—as the Pricenomics blog has noted, this is an act with zero hit songs but a quarter billion dollars in ticket sales. Social media has only emboldened the soft cult of Phish: Even as the band’s quirks—both in their music and their appearance—have precluded mainstream success , Twitter and Facebook have allowed fans to find and communicate with each other more easily than ever. A Phish fan will see a reference in a tweet, and shrug, “We are everywhere” (or type “#weareeverywhere”)—a standard saying that, like many of Phish’s cultural cues, originates with the Grateful Dead.

About two years ago, Jake Beckman, an assignment editor for Bloomberg Television , noticed his peers tweeting, openly and covertly, about Phish, and decided to bring them all together on one of the media world’s most exclusive and least juicy private email discussion groups. Its name, “Journophish,” is a pun on JournoList, the defunct liberal listserv turned conservative bête noire, though it is doubtful any of Journophish’s members would be pressured to resign from a job should any of their emails leak, as occurred with JournoList. (Full disclosure: I am not a member of Journophish, but wish I were. Which is to say: I will be attending my 27th Phish show Friday night. And yes, I can hear you when you sigh.)","2013-07-11 00:00:00","0","22.0","9.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","66.0","31.0","0.0","109.0","0.0","14.0","3","565","83.11","70.24","46.87","41.79","31.39","22.65","80.35","45.13","9.38","5.31","1.77","0.35","1.06","0.53","1.59","4.07","7.08","13.45","6.55","3.72","7.43","0.53","12.39","4.07","3.01","1.59","2.83","2.65","3.36","2.12","1.24","0.53","0.18","0.35","9.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.53","10.27","3.01","0.88","0.88","1.77","1.06","3.36","5.31","2.83","1.77","0.53","0.71","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.35","4.96","2.83","0.88","1.06","0.71","0.18","2.30","7.96","1.06","13.81","1.95","7.08","4.96","2.12","3.36","0.18","1.24","0.18","0.18","0.71","0.00","0.35","0.18","0.18","0.00","21.42","3.19","9.20","0.53","0.35","0.18","0.00","0.35","3.89","2.12","1.42","0.18","2667","8.89","38.333333333333336","790","556","18","57.03","13.4","13.0","12.54","17.8","131","11.75","23.78446043165468","356","34.2","13","0.45","0","27","13","50","0","70","46","3","1","8","70","55","0","49","0","0","26","10","25","0","1","3","8","0","16","11","13","14","23","23","2","2","0","6"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/111731/liberal-wave-senate-produces-third-golden-era-our-lifetime","Welcome to Another Golden Era of Liberal Senators","One of the most stunning outcomes of the 2012 elections was the Democrats’ two-seat gain in the Senate. With 23 seats at risk to only ten for Republicans, Democrats were hoping simply to hold their own or keep their losses to a minimum. A gain of a single seat was almost wildly optimistic; picking up two seemingly unrealistic.

But just as important as the overall gain was the nature of the new class of Democrats sworn in to the Senate last week. With the addition of Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Baldwin, Tim Kaine and Chris Murphy, and the possibility of Barney Frank joining them for a few key months and being followed by Ed Markey, the Senate has seen an infusion of liberal talent. Thanks to an impressive class of 2006 (Ben Cardin, Bernie Sanders, Sherrod Brown, Claire McCaskill, Amy Klobuchar, and Sheldon Whitehouse all were reelected last fall) and the class of 2008, including Mark and Tom Udall, Jeff Merkley, Michael Bennet, and Al Franken, the Senate has a core of assertive, brainy liberals greater than we have seen in decades.

The Senate in our lifetimes has had two previous golden eras for liberals. Energized by the 1958 Democratic landslide that brought in Gene McCarthy, Harrison Williams, Ed Muskie, Ernest Gruening and Phil Hart, among others, the early 1960s was a time of liberal giants. Besides this group, we had Warren Magnuson, Wayne Morse, Hubert Humphrey, Paul Douglas, Albert Gore Sr., JFK, Joe Clark, Ralph Yarborough and, added in 1964, RFK. The 1974 Watergate election brought the Senate John Culver, Dale Bumpers, Gary Hart, and Pat Leahy. They joined an all-star group that included George McGovern, Dan Inouye, Birch Bayh, Walter Mondale, Alan Cranston, Jim Abourezk and Hubert Humphrey in his second go-round in the Senate.

Ira Shapiro, in his wonderful book, The Last Great Senate, describes some of these men and the impact they had. Some, like Morse, Joe Clark, and Abourezk, were complete iconoclasts, driving Senate leaders, including their own, batty, and often doing the same with presidents. Others, like Magnuson, Mondale, Muskie, Bayh, and Bumpers, were consummate insiders, able to use their leverage in the body to accomplish policy goals consistent with their policy beliefs. Some, like Humphrey, Paul Douglas, and Phil Hart, were simply forces of nature, with the intellect, personal integrity and personal force that transcended policy differences and moved their colleagues and outsiders alike. Humphrey, whom I knew well, was a remarkable and unique human being; he would have made a marvelous president. Unlike Hubert, Phil Hart was understated and soft-spoken, but his impact on the Senate was made clear when his former colleagues named one of their three office buildings after him.","2013-01-08 00:00:00","0","12.0","2.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","69.0","26.0","0.0","152.0","0.0","15.0","2","453","94.04","71.70","2.15","67.49","26.65","22.30","66.67","39.07","6.18","4.42","0.22","0.66","0.00","1.32","2.21","1.77","7.95","12.58","5.30","1.77","5.96","0.00","9.71","5.52","3.09","0.44","3.53","2.43","3.53","2.65","0.44","0.22","0.00","0.22","7.06","0.00","0.44","0.00","1.55","7.28","0.66","1.55","0.66","2.43","0.88","1.77","1.77","1.10","0.44","0.44","1.32","0.44","0.00","0.88","0.00","9.27","1.99","1.77","4.86","1.55","0.44","6.84","2.21","0.22","8.17","1.55","3.09","3.53","3.31","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","20.75","3.97","14.79","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.88","0.00","0.22","0.44","0.00","2200","8.6","26.647058823529413","638","449","18","63.12","12.5","10.6","12.71","15.2","106","10.2","21.403207126948775","277","24.41","4","0.38","0","24","14","43","0","44","40","1","0","1","41","116","4","25","0","0","8","12","11","0","1","1","7","0","6","22","9","10","4","4","3","1","0","1"

And he has less than 1,300 days left.



View The New Republic's full guide to how he should make the best use of them.

The White House’s response to the explosive revelations about the National Security Agency’s monitoring of Americans’ phone records and e-mails has essentially boiled down to this: Trust us, we’re doing this for your own good, and we’re going about it the right way. But the public is not buying it. The president’s approval rating has dropped 8 points, and only 37 percent support the secret spying program, which, as currently implemented, may well violate the Fourth Amendment’s prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures. The administration needs to curb the excesses of its surveillance programs, so that whatever national security benefits they provide no longer come at such great threat to personal freedoms. These are the moves to make:

Show us the Memos

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or the FISC, was set up by Congress in 1978 to supervise domestic eavesdropping. Before 9/11, intelligence agencies could seize from American citizens only certain types of information, like business records, and only when it was shown to be associated with a specific espionage or terrorism investigation. But the Patriot Act (in its notorious Section 215) changed that, authorizing the government to seize “any tangible thing”—that is, any data whatsoever—so long as it’s arguably relevant to counterterrorism efforts. What the Patriot Act’s congressional backers didn’t anticipate was that technological advances would make digital storage cheap enough to amass vast troves of information—and that an administration would interpret Section 215 as permitting ongoing, daily collection of so-called meta-data, as Obama’s has.

The White House has said the perpetual dragnet is permitted by the law but has not released the secret memos justifying its conclusion. Meanwhile, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper claims that the FISC limits the government’s access to the information the NSA has been collecting. That court order is secret, too. The country needs an open debate about the constitutionality of the program, and that can’t happen unless the White House releases all of the relevant documents.

Fix the “Third-Party Doctrine”

The Supreme Court has held that, when an American surrenders data (like a phone number or financial records) to a third party for one purpose (say, to get a working phone line or a bank account), he or she abandons all expectations that the data will remain private for any purpose. But the 1979 ruling that established that standard was handed down in an analog world. Today, the so-called “third-party doctrine,” taken to its extreme, could allow the government to access every bit of data a person stores in a cloud computer database—from e-mail to photos to word-processing documents to geo-location readings—without limitations. A bipartisan bill sponsored by Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee, and another put together by Ron Wyden and Jason Chaffetz, would fix that problem by requiring search warrants before digital data can be seized. So far, however, the Obama White House has refused to back these measures. It should give them its full support.","2013-07-01 00:00:00","0","25.0","10.0","6.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","43.0","26.0","0.0","113.0","0.0","14.0","2","548","88.30","64.26","4.72","67.17","26.10","27.55","78.28","43.98","8.03","2.19","0.00","0.73","0.18","0.73","0.55","5.84","9.85","12.04","6.39","3.83","6.39","1.09","11.31","6.57","2.37","1.09","2.92","2.37","5.29","3.65","1.46","0.36","0.55","0.36","7.12","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.55","11.31","1.82","2.55","2.01","1.64","1.09","3.28","2.55","1.64","0.91","0.00","0.36","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","10.40","1.46","1.46","4.74","2.37","1.09","2.37","7.85","0.91","8.58","1.09","5.11","2.37","4.93","0.55","0.73","1.82","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","16.97","3.83","6.02","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.82","1.09","2.55","1.09","0.18","2761","9.28","26.761904761904763","864","532","21","45.8","15.3","13.2","14.34","16.7","148","8.416666666666666","23.24781954887218","333","23.9","5","0.43","0","21","11","67","0","50","43","1","2","11","88","54","1","36","0","0","16","6","25","0","0","3","21","0","25","11","11","18","9","22","6","1","0","3"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/113625/daniel-ellsberg-edward-snowden-and-bradley-manning-leakers","Daniel Ellsberg, the Original Big Leaker","For decades, Daniel Ellsberg, the leaker of the Pentagon Papers, has used his celebrated past to condemn the present. He has given hundreds of talks about the alleged crimes and deceits of every president from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama; demanded the impeachment of George W. Bush; called on government employees to leak plans for bombing Iran; and been arrested on several occasions for protesting U.S. foreign policy.

None of this drew much notice from anyone outside of the anti-imperialist left. But now, in the wake of WikiLeaks and the NSA revelations, Ellsberg, the pioneer of Big Leaking, has become everyone’s commentator of choice. He does not disappoint. “In my estimation, there has not been in American history a more important leak than Edward Snowden’s release of NSA material—and that definitely includes the Pentagon Papers 40 years ago,” Ellsberg wrote in the Guardian. Ellsberg also regards Julian Assange and Bradley Manning as heroes and has raised money for WikiLeaks.

One can view such generosity as the latest act of anti-authoritarian solidarity by a 1960s radical or, less kindly, as an old man’s attempt to preserve and extend his legacy as the first American to pass explosive government secrets to the media. In any case, Ellsberg has been eager to bestow his blessing on Snowden and Manning and to echo their civil libertarian alarms. In the Guardian, Ellsberg wrote that Snowden “gives us the possibility to roll back a key part of what has amounted to an ‘executive coup’ against the U.S. constitution.”

Whatever his motivations, Ellsberg’s admiration for the two contemporary leakers neglects what distinguishes him from them, and, ultimately, may make his defiant act more significant. Most Americans probably don’t realize that, until the New York Times began publishing the Pentagon Papers in 1971, Ellsberg was a respected, if self-doubting, member of the club. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard and, after a stint as a Marine officer, returned for a PhD in economics. Then he moved on to the Pentagon and the Rand Corporation, becoming a favorite advisor first to Robert McNamara and then to Henry Kissinger. “I have learned more from Dan Ellsberg,"" Kissinger told an audience at Rand, ""than from any other person in Vietnam.” Ironically, Ellsberg’s first visit to the country in 1961 had convinced him that the U.S. could never defeat the rebellion led by Ho Chi Minh. But he largely kept such thoughts to himself.","2013-06-26 00:00:00","0","22.0","11.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","47.0","26.0","0.0","114.0","0.0","14.0","3","407","95.78","64.39","13.02","48.57","22.61","28.26","73.96","45.95","7.13","4.42","0.49","0.25","0.00","3.19","0.49","2.70","9.09","16.95","4.91","2.70","6.39","1.23","9.34","4.42","3.44","0.74","2.21","2.95","5.16","3.19","1.97","0.49","0.49","0.49","7.86","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.44","9.58","2.95","0.98","0.49","2.46","0.98","2.70","0.25","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","8.11","1.47","1.97","4.18","0.25","0.98","4.67","5.16","0.98","11.79","1.23","5.16","5.65","4.67","0.49","0.00","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.94","5.90","6.63","0.00","0.74","0.00","0.00","0.74","2.21","1.72","0.00","0.00","1987","8.65","27.733333333333334","638","403","19","49.96","13.4","11.6","12.47","13.3","101","8.8","20.504813895781638","254","24.73","10","0.45","0","16","6","41","0","58","32","0","2","3","53","68","2","18","0","0","11","7","16","4","0","0","15","0","13","13","6","14","1","14","1","2","0","0"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/113626/supreme-court-invalidates-voting-rights-act-debate","Debating the Court's Voting Rights Decision","More importantly, this “fundamental principle” is not to be found in the constitutional text. There are specific provisions requiring equal treatment of states, such as the one prohibiting any “Preference ... by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another,” or the one stating that bankruptcy laws must be “uniform”—or even the neglected requirement of the Spending Clause that money may be expended only for the “general” welfare, as opposed to the sort of local projects Congress now feels free to fund. But there is no generalized equal protection clause for the states. It would be remarkable to read one into the Reconstruction Amendments, which after all were primarily designed to reform the dozen or more states that engaged in the rebellion.

Conservatives should be wary of reading specific prohibitions into generalized structural principles, just as liberals should be (but are not) wary of reading specific prohibitions into generalized notions of “liberty.”

That said, I am braced for hysterical and demagogic attacks on the decision, as if Bull Connor still roams the voting registration booths. The Court was right to find Section Four outdated. It is a pity this conclusion was reached in a constitutional decision where it did not belong, instead of by Congress.

To: Michael McConnell

From: Jeffrey Rosen

Dear Michael,

I’m mightily impressed, but not at all surprised, to read your principled, and intellectually consistent response to the Shelby decision. Not all of our readers will know that among your many accomplishments, you have written the most influential historical scholarship in the country arguing that the Framers of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments intended violations to be enforced by Congress, not the courts. In fact, although you’re too modest to note this, Justice Ginsburg cited your scholarship in her dissenting opinion today. Here is what she said:

It cannot tenably be maintained that the VRA, an Act of Congress adopted to shield the right to vote from racial discrimination, is inconsistent with the letter or spirit of the Fifteenth Amendment, or any provision of the Constitution read in light of the Civil War Amendments … See also McConnell, Institutions and Interpretation: A Critique of City of Boerne v. Flores, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 153, 182 (1997) (quoting Civil War-era framer that “the remedy for the violation of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments was expressly not left to the courts. The remedy was legislative.”).

It’s true, as you say, that Justice Ginsburg was less deferential to Congress in the Boerne case involving federal protection for religious freedom, and it’s also true that other dissenters today were less deferential to Congress in other cases, such as Gonzalez and Carhart, another 5–4 decision where the liberals in dissent would have struck down the federal ban on partial birth abortions. I agree with you that these cases show that neither liberals nor conservatives today are consistent advocates of judicial deference to Congress. That should make critics of today’s decision less self-righteous about Chief Justice Robert’s penultimate paragraph quoting Justice Holmes on behalf of the proposition that “Striking down an Act of Congress is the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.” The Court had “no choice” in this case, he continued, because Congress failed to take the hint and revise the coverage formula when first warned by the Court in 2009. “No choice” may be too strong, but it’s certainly true that neither side has a monopoly on Holmesian deference.

Still, I can’t resist one last point on the deference question. In the spirit of his concurring opinion in the Fisher case yesterday, Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion today stressing that he would have gone even further than his conservative colleagues. He would have struck down Section Give of the Voting Rights Act, which requires federal preclearance for voting changes, not only Section Four, which defines the covered jurisdictions that need to seek pre-clearance. And that’s not the only part of the Voting Rights Act Thomas would strike down. He has signaled that he believes parts of Section Two of the Voting Rights Act are also unconstitutional, to the degree that they are construed to allow lawsuits against voting arrangements involving “vote dilution” that has a racially disparate impact, rather than a racially disparate purpose.

In this sense, some defenders of today’s decision who insist that Section Two is a perfectly adequate protection for voting rights—in other words, that it’s fine to challenge voting discrimination after the fact rather than stopping it from occurring in advance—are not being entirely candid. Given the right opportunity, they may join Justice Thomas in trying to challenge Section Two of the Voting Rights act as well. And if the Court accepts the invitation, it would be completely inconsistent, as you suggest, with the original understanding of the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment who believed that it didn’t apply to political rights at all. Suddenly Justice Felix Frankfurter’s warnings in Baker v. Carr about the judicial activism that would result from the Court’s decision to enter what he called “the political thicket” are seeming more prescient by the day.

As a principled conservative defender of judicial restraint, you recognize all this, and for that please accept my admiration and gratitude.

"https://newrepublic.com/article/112258/atari-bankrupt-video-game-industry-refuses-heed-history","Atari Bankrupt: Video Game Industry Refuses to Heed History","For those of us born in the 1970s, last week’s news of Atari’s demise came as a sentimental shockwave. Atari was our first video game console. It introduced us to Space Invaders and Missile Command and Pitfall. More importantly, it taught us how to play electronically, forming our habits and blistering our thumbs. To see it filing for bankruptcy was to see a part of our past wither: Atari was like a childhood bedroom we no longer occupied, but whose mere existence comforted us.



The real tragedy here, though, isn’t about the past. It’s about the future. Many of the large corporations currently leading the video game industry are making all of the same mistakes that toppled Atari some three decades ago, consigning it to oblivion. That is, what we’re witnessing now is not only Atari’s requiem, but a reminder that the ailments that weakened and finally killed Atari are still rampant.



I glimpsed that sickness back in 1982, when I was six and Atari was still the biggest name in the video game market. Early that year, the company announced it would release by Christmas a game based on Steven Spielberg’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. My birthday is in early November, but I couldn’t imagine any other gift I wanted more; in a rare feat of forbearance, I told my parents that I would wait for more than a month for the game to come out. When it finally arrived, I plugged it into the console and, my hands trembling, began to play. Within three minutes, I realized that the game, which focused on E.T.’s efforts to fall into and extricate himself from large holes in the ground, was an utter disaster. Then I started crying. Video games had ruined my birthday.



And not, I suspect, mine alone. Since the E.T. debacle, game publishers have remained committed to blockbuster, big-budget games that are heavy on hype and light on innovation: from 1994’s Shaq Fu, in which Shaquille O’Neal fought Egyptian mummies in Japan; to 1999’s Superman: The New Adventures (aka “Superman 64”), which was so shoddily designed that the Man of Steel frequently wandered off the world of the game and into a black abyss; to 2007’s Lair, which would have worked beautifully as a short animated film about dragons but paid very little attention to pesky things like game play or level design.

This sort of business model may work for the film industry, where, to make a lot of money, a lot of money must first be spent. There are plenty of blockbuster video games that cost tens of millions to make, but it’s still the sort of industry where an indie hit could bring a windfall: In 2009, a Swedish programmer named Markus Persson used his spare time—and spent virtually nothing—to create a crudely animated sandbox game called Minecraft, eventually releasing it for a small download fee while the game was still in development. At its peak, more than a year after its release, the game was being downloaded every three seconds, earning its creator $15,000 every hour. Within 18 months, Persson’s game studio announced it had hit the $80 million revenue mark.

Persson, of course, is the exception. Even in an industry like video games, still busy being born, rare are the tiny passion projects that spawn a global pop culture phenomenon. Still, you’d expect video game developers to look at Minecraft and realize there’s a lot of very good money to be made by simply cultivating people like Persson and supporting their visionary designs. But game studios aren’t scrambling to find the next Minecraft. Instead, they’re looking for the next E.T.—and when they find it, they're willing to pay a fortune in licensing and development fees. Game studios are taking the same approach, increasingly, as movie studios: to create and replicate big titles, advertise the hell out of it, and hope you can make a big enough splash to make a lot of money quickly. As in Hollywood, this logic sometimes pays off, and sometimes doesn’t. And when it doesn’t, it can undermine even the most solid and beloved franchises in the industry. Anyone who has picked up Halo 3: ODST, say, or Assassin’s Creed: Revelations, knows well the heartbreak that comes with expecting creative brilliance and instead finding careless, tedious titles designed with little else but greed in mind.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Valve Corporation, a game studio valued at $2.5 billion, is one of the industry’s most successful companies, thanks to popular series like Half-Life, Counter-Strike, and Portal. Valve has no corporate hierarchy, and is famous for encouraging and rewarding innovation: When a team of amateur programmers modified Half-Life to create a free first-person-shooter game of their own, Valve offered them a job, a collaboration that eventually led to Team Fortress 2, one of the company’s best-loved games. Most contemporary video game studios, however, have less in common with Valve than they do with Atari in its heyday, an entertainment giant more interested in safe bets than experimentation.","2013-01-29 00:00:00","0","25.0","32.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","62.0","31.0","0.0","104.0","0.0","15.0","2","859","84.70","61.91","38.99","51.94","23.22","22.00","81.61","45.75","9.55","3.96","1.75","1.16","0.23","0.23","0.58","5.59","7.80","13.50","6.40","4.66","5.59","1.28","12.11","6.17","3.26","1.75","3.14","2.68","5.47","3.38","1.98","0.12","0.47","0.58","7.68","0.12","0.12","0.00","0.35","9.90","1.28","1.98","1.28","2.33","0.70","2.79","1.98","1.63","0.12","0.23","0.93","0.23","0.47","0.12","0.00","9.20","4.66","1.98","2.10","1.28","0.23","4.19","6.52","0.93","15.02","1.40","6.75","6.98","5.01","5.01","0.81","2.56","0.23","0.35","0.47","0.23","0.23","0.00","0.12","0.00","18.86","5.01","7.80","0.93","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.93","0.23","3.03","0.23","0.35","3964","8.21","23.81081081081081","1200","838","39","66.57","11.7","9.3","11.43","12.6","186","5.5","19.478281622911695","466","21.3","20","0.45","0","33","23","78","0","98","66","2","2","8","141","75","0","41","0","0","40","14","43","5","3","2","25","0","34","37","22","21","25","19","11","2","1","8"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/115942/democratic-schism-over-bankers-vs-reformers-real","The Question at the Heart of the Democratic Schism","But when you actually try to reform the status quo, any approach that relies on courting insiders (lobbyists and businessman, often regulators and Washington think tankers) rather than ginning up public support typically stalls out before long. The oil-state Democrats cave to energy companies; northeastern Democrats cave to the financial industry; coastal Dems cave to the tech sector; farm-state Dems cave to Big Ag. There are defense-contractor Dems; big-box retailer Dems; health insurer Dems (one reason for the Rube-Goldberg contraption we know as Obamacare). And any number of them who will parrot the Beltway editorial page consensus about the urgency of hacking away at Medicare and Social Security, a view just about every respectable corporate executive and financier subscribes to.

When I was working on my recent profile of Warren, I often heard critics accuse her of being irresponsible—or worse, a demagogue. “For someone like me, it’s kind of a disappointing thing, in the sense that a Harvard law professor would presumably know the system and would understand the issues and would therefore address them in a responsible way,” one bank executive told me. “She’s gone out of her way to undermine confidence by using intellectual constructs that are nonsensical.”

The problem with this critique is that the only reliable way to make reformist inroads is to play to the folks back home. Take financial regulation, since we’re on the subject. In early 2009, Senator Maria Cantwell blocked the nomination of a former Goldman Sachs partner and Clinton Treasury official named Gary Gensler, whom she accused of being a Wall Street lackey, until the Obama administration got tougher on derivatives. It did. In August of that year, Gensler turned around and broke all sorts of unwritten rules by publicly slamming the too-soft derivatives bill Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner sent to Congress. It ended up tougher. In the spring of 2010, Senator Blanche Lincoln, a pro-business moderate who suddenly found herself in a brutal primary fight, abruptly embraced an even more austere set of derivatives restrictions. The final version of the law ended up tougher still.

All of these moves could on some level be chalked up to crass, ambitious, politically-motivated grandstanding. None of them would fit the banking industry’s definition of responsible discourse. But it’s also the case that no meaningful reform of the financial system would have happened without them. In the real world, the playing field is so tilted toward corporations that a decision to debate calmly, behind closed doors, is in effect a decision to accept the status quo.

More importantly, all these changes were both substantively important and politically popular. That’s why it’s so strange to hear people say populism would be an electoral catastrophe—“nothing would be more disastrous for Democrats,” the Third Way brass writes. The statement is almost self-refuting, suggesting that issues for which there’s a lot of public support are politically toxic. And, in fact, when you look at the set of issues the Third Way op-ed cites as a dead-end for Democrats—increasing Social Security benefits to keep up with inflation for seniors, resisting Medicare benefit cuts—they poll exceptionally well. The same goes for getting tough with Wall Street and for raising the minimum wage, among other populist positions.

That’s not to endorse majoritarianism, or some even cruder form mob rule. As Barney Frank once said, the voters are no bargain either. Granting full civil rights to gays, women, and racial minorities was the right thing to do even when most people opposed it. So was preventing AIG and Citigroup from collapsing in 2008 (though I would have done it on vastly different terms), even though no one wanted any part of it. The point is just that, when powerful economic interests are involved, the burden of proof should fall on self-interested elites rather than popular opinion, whereas Third Way proposes something akin to the opposite. That’s not a trivial difference. It’s the schism that’s increasingly defining the Democratic Party.

*It’s worth pointing out, as my colleague John Judis noted in this piece, that populism has long resonated among a segment of the middle class.

"https://newrepublic.com/article/115919/sharon-bowen-wall-street-lawyer-president-obama-wants-appoint","A Buddy of Big Banks May Wind Up Watchdogging Wall Street","Now, the White House wants to follow up the Massad selection with Bowen. Her law firm, Latham & Watkins, has represented global financial institutions like Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch in past cases, and advises a wide range of corporations in litigation as well as securities transactions. Bowen, who as an African-American woman would be the only face of diversity on a panel currently made up of all white men, also serves as the Acting Chair of the Board of Directors for the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPIC), which seeks to restore funds for investors when collapsing financial firms hold their assets. SIPIC was active in the effort to rescue funds for investors in MFGlobal, the failed derivatives broker.

With the SIPIC experience, Bowen’s supporters can make a bank-shot case for her experience in derivatives. But her record on those issues is noticeably thin. “It’s like judicial nominations now,” said Jeff Connaughton, former Senate aide and author ofThe Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins. “She has a great resume but no track record to stir up specific complaints.”

There is recent precedent for nominees to the CFTC without major qualifications, and it didn’t work out well for reformers. Mark Wetjen, the only holdover Democrat on the commission, was a staffer for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid similarly lacking in significant financial expertise when he was nominated to serve as commissioner in 2011. Since that time, Wetjen has proven an asset to Wall Street on the commission, time and again working to weaken or delay rules in ways favorable to the banks. For example, he forced changes to rules to make all bids in derivatives trades public before the transaction, as well as rules governing CFTC authority on overseas trades. Given the complexity of the issues involved, reform groups worry that a CFTC with Democrats Massad, Bowen, and Wetjen—two Wall Street securities lawyers and an ex-Hill staffer with a pro-industry record—will allow lobbyists to run roughshod over the commission, without an informed in-house advocate to push back. “When a derivatives dealer comes in with a complicated argument, there will be nobody to call B.S.,” said one source.

This comes at a time when the CFTC is under enormous pressure, empowered with multiple new authorities under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. The commission wrote over 60 rules on derivatives trading as part of Dodd-Frank, and was one of the five agencies that this week passed the Volcker rule, designed to prevent commercial banks from making risky trades for their own profit. Now, they must enforce all these rules, requiring them to sift through a mountain of swap trading data to analyze trends and search for non-compliance and systemic risk.

As I reported last month, the CFTC is woefully underfunded to complete these tasks, and the addition of Volcker rule responsibilities makes this worse. The agency does not have enough personnel to conduct exams and has already delayed investigations and enforcement activities. Republican Commissioner Scott O’Malia has consistently claimed that the data stream has overwhelmed the agency’s computer systems, and that the information being gathered isn’t usable. In a perfect world, with reform-minded commissioners riding herd, the commission may not be up to the task, to say nothing of the administration’s proposed team. And regulatory enforcement is the entire ballgame for whether Dodd-Frank will have any effect at all in making the financial system safer.","2013-12-13 00:00:00","0","19.0","5.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","59.0","26.0","0.0","119.0","0.0","14.0","3","576","96.37","55.52","14.90","34.83","26.18","24.13","75.00","42.88","4.69","1.91","0.17","0.00","0.00","1.04","0.69","2.78","8.68","16.84","5.56","3.30","5.73","1.56","10.07","4.34","2.95","1.39","1.04","1.74","4.34","2.43","1.91","0.87","0.17","0.52","4.86","0.00","0.00","0.87","0.52","7.99","1.22","2.43","0.69","0.52","2.08","1.74","1.39","0.52","0.52","0.00","0.35","0.17","0.17","0.00","0.00","10.07","0.52","1.56","6.77","0.69","1.91","2.60","6.60","0.87","13.37","1.56","7.29","4.69","9.38","0.17","0.35","4.34","0.00","0.17","0.87","0.00","0.17","0.00","0.52","0.00","15.10","4.17","6.25","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.74","1.04","1.22","0.35","0.17","2889","9.03","27.761904761904763","888","563","23","46.61","14.4","12.8","13.76","15.8","149","18.0","22.386145648312613","345","25.29","12","0.42","0","18","6","62","0","75","43","1","0","7","90","72","1","54","2","0","8","4","22","0","0","2","21","0","25","12","10","14","3","22","1","1","0","5"

In the West, Brazil often is portrayed as an environmental success story. It gets about 80% of its electricity from an essentially carbon-free source: water coursing through dams. It has made major strides in combatting deforestation. And roughly 20% of the automotive fuel it uses is ethanol, made from sugarcane. Yet Brazil’s government-controlled oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, long has sold gasoline domestically at below-market prices. Now, as Petrobras tries to extinguish that subsidy, it’s sparking a political blowback.

The subsidy, which Petrobras doesn’t officially acknowledge but which is openly discussed in Brazil, is a creature of the Brazilian government’s desire to minimize inflation. But the subsidy is causing billions of dollars in annual losses in Petrobras’s refining division, analysts estimate. Late last month, in response to investor pressure, Petrobras announced it would phase out the subsidy over what the company called “an appropriate period” of time. That didn’t satisfy investors, who expected a firmer move and who promptly hammered Petrobras’s share price. Smarting from that investor drubbing but leery of stoking Brazilian motorists’ ire, Petrobras has declined to specify how quickly or how significantly it will cut the subsidy.

Hard as it is to pull back these direct fossil-fuel subsidies in poor countries, it’s at least easy to quantify them. Not so for the indirect fossil-fuel subsidies that analysts say the US and other wealthy nations proffer in massive quantities. These subsidies, the IMF says, arise in large part because rich as well as poor countries are failing to tax fossil fuels enough to pay for the environmental and health consequences of burning them — everything from climate change to respiratory disease, things that economists call “externalities.” In Washington and beyond, the argument that the failure to boost the price of energy to cover these factors amounts to a subsidy is stirring a fierce ideological debate.

The IMF estimates that, in 2011, the most recent year it analyzed, indirect fossil-fuel subsidies from both developed and developing countries amounted to about $1.4 trillion. That’s nearly three times the $480 billion the IMF says came through direct fossil-fuel subsidies, which occurred overwhelmingly in developing countries. The IMF reached the larger figure after making various assumptions about the cost of addressing fossil fuels’ environmental and health effects. One of them: that rectifying the global-warming damage wrought by burning fossil fuels will cost $25 for every ton of emitted carbon dioxide. According to the IMF, levying that price on CO2 emissions would raise the price of gasoline or diesel by about 20 cents per gallon.

This penalty has come to be known in many political and academic circles as the “social cost of carbon.” Everything about it elicits debate: not just the general premise that energy should be taxed to penalize carbon emissions, but, even more, the attempt to nail down a specific dollar amount per ton. Some critics, typically those on the right, say the IMF’s $25-per-ton estimate is too high. Others, typically on the left, say it’s too low. Each side cites dueling evidence. In Europe, which has regulated carbon-dioxide emissions since 2005, a permit to emit one ton of CO2 is trading today for only about $5. In the U.S., in an announcement that so far has drawn only limited attention, the Obama Administration last month issued a revised estimate of the social cost of carbon pegging it at $37 per ton of emitted CO2.

The drive to curb fossil-fuel subsidies is sputtering uphill. If one side is right in the dispute over the cost, it’s a few hundred billion dollars. If the other side is right, it’s a few trillion dollars. That gap is no longer academic. It’s about real money. And increasingly, it appears that someone, somewhere, sometime, is going to pay.","2013-12-19 00:00:00","0","21.0","3.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","49.0","26.0","0.0","114.0","0.0","14.0","2","648","91.72","54.90","25.10","31.01","19.06","28.70","73.46","42.28","8.49","0.62","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.46","7.72","8.18","14.66","5.86","4.32","4.48","0.77","9.72","5.71","2.47","1.39","3.24","2.93","3.70","2.01","1.70","0.31","0.15","0.77","4.01","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.72","1.85","2.62","1.08","2.62","0.62","2.16","1.70","0.15","0.77","0.62","0.62","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.15","5.56","0.62","0.93","3.70","0.46","0.77","1.54","7.10","0.77","14.04","1.54","9.72","3.09","4.63","0.00","0.15","4.94","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.00","18.83","5.56","6.33","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.85","0.93","2.47","0.00","1.23","3235","8.75","20.75","1017","637","35","53.0","12.7","10.4","13.4","12.6","170","6.1875","19.95503924646782","346","19.5","13","0.42","0","15","21","64","0","84","60","3","1","5","117","34","0","45","0","0","20","1","37","0","1","2","20","0","21","13","26","14","9","36","10","3","0","2"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/111770/america-cant-afford-cut-its-discretionary-spending","America Can't Afford to Cut Its Discretionary Spending","At the heart of our fiscal challenge is a clash between the present and the future, and the future is losing. Intended or not, the top priorities for Republicans and Democrats add up to a relentless squeeze on discretionary spending. That means less for education, less for research, less for infrastructure—the vital public investments that have nourished innovation and growth throughout our history. (It also means less for defense, the topic of a future column.) To go down this path is to imperil our future.

In September of last year, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) published a study examining the impact of sequestration on federal investments in research and development. It found that the required automatic cuts would reduce these investments by $57.5 billion over the next five years. The National Institutes of Health would lose $11.7 billion; the National Science Foundation, $2.1 billion. Civilian cabinets and agencies throughout the government would see R & D cuts averaging 8.4 percent. Research in the Department of Defense, which includes not only weapons development but also billions for basic scientific and medical research (much of it university-based) would be slashed by $33.5 billion between 2013 and 2017.

We don’t need to rummage through the history of canals and land-grant colleges to see why this prospect represents such a threat. A 2012 report from the National Research Council (the principal operating agency of the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of Engineering) found that federal investments in information technology R & D had helped create numerous firms with annual revenues of $1 billion or more, along with entirely new sectors of the economy such as microprocessing, the internet, cloud computing, and robotics. The NRC highlighted the role of public investment at the hub of a “complex ecosystem” that makes innovation in IT possible. Much of it has come from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Science Foundation, with the Department of Energy, NASA, the National Institutes of Health, and other agencies also making important contributions.

The NRC report summarized the reasons why these investments were so significant. Among them: federally funded research supports basic research whose practical benefits “typically take years to realize”—the kinds of investments that the private sector is increasingly reluctant to undertake. That is why federal support for research “has tended to complement, rather than preempt, industry investments.” In short, basic research is a classic public good that the private market will undersupply, leaving us all worse off. Federal spending in this area doesn’t displace the public sector. Nor does it redistribute resources. Instead, it promotes economic growth and an improved quality of life for the entire society.","2013-01-09 00:00:00","0","15.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","41.0","26.0","0.0","103.0","0.0","15.0","3","450","96.85","54.43","18.21","29.49","21.43","34.44","84.44","43.78","6.44","1.33","0.00","1.11","0.00","0.00","0.22","5.11","10.22","15.33","4.44","2.89","5.11","1.11","9.56","5.78","2.00","1.11","3.56","2.67","4.22","2.22","2.00","0.44","0.44","0.44","3.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.44","2.00","2.00","1.33","0.89","0.67","2.44","0.67","0.44","0.00","0.22","1.56","0.22","1.33","0.00","0.00","7.11","1.33","2.00","2.00","1.56","1.78","1.56","6.67","1.33","12.44","1.78","7.33","3.33","13.78","0.00","0.00","3.33","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.78","4.67","4.67","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.44","1.33","0.44","2.22","1.56","2368","9.13","22.85","751","446","24","44.14","14.2","11.7","14.62","13.8","129","7.75","21.009506726457403","260","20.45","11","0.41","0","17","20","54","0","62","42","6","0","5","70","46","5","27","1","0","9","3","15","0","0","2","8","0","16","8","7","6","5","16","3","0","1","3"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/115905/newtown-shooting-anniversary-how-tragedy-changed-gun-debate","If You Don't Think Newtown Changed America's Gun Debate, Consider These Facts","A year after the horrific shooting in Newtown last December, one can be forgiven for thinking nothing’s changed in America’s gun debate. We still haven’t seen any major new federal laws passed, and President Obama’s push for expanded background checks and restrictions on high-capacity magazines went nowhere. Democrats in Congress still talk about revising the Obama proposals but most have given up hope of anything passing soon. Gun advocates remain committed to stopping Congress from passing any new laws, so much so that they even killed a proposal this week to expand the ban on undetectable guns to apply to all-plastic, 3D printed guns.

Nonetheless, the gun debate has changed in significant ways since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The gun control movement is reinvigorated after being moribund for nearly two decades. Today, thanks largely to Michael Bloomberg, there’s real money flowing into campaigns to support candidates favoring more restrictive gun laws. And, while legislation is stalled in Congress, a host of new laws have been passed at the state level. Of course, the gun advocates remain a powerful political force. Yet for the first time in years they have serious competition in the political marketplace. The gun debate is now more evenly matched than it has been in a long time.

After Republicans took the House in 1994, Democrats in Washington decided to steer clear of the gun control issue. They blamed the Republican victory on President Clinton’s support of two major gun control laws, the Brady Background Check law and the now-expired ban on certain military-style (or “assault”) weapons. Fearing that gun control was politically toxic, Democrats practically made it a plank in the party’s platform to Avoid Gun Control At All Costs. If nothing else, Newtown radically changed the Democrats’ political calculations. President Obama had barely mentioned gun control during his first term, even earning an F (!) rating from the Brady Center, one of the nation’s leading gun control advocacy groups. After Newtown, however, Obama moved gun control to the very top of his second-term agenda. While his push failed, it established gun control as an issue of national priority.

We’ve also seen a wave of new money flowing into elections to support pro-control candidates. For the past 30 years or so, nearly all the money that went into campaigns went to anti-control candidates. The NRA and gun enthusiasts spent millions to elect candidates opposed to new gun control laws. By contrast, the Brady Center and other gun control groups were struggling just to stay afloat and couldn’t afford to be active contributors. Since Newtown, more political money than ever has gone to the side seeking new restrictions. Led by New York’s outgoing mayor, Michael Bloomberg and his Independence USA political action committee, gun control advocates have spent considerable funds on races from Virginia to Illinois to Colorado. In the Virginia gubernatorial race, Bloomberg’s PAC outspent the NRA by a wide margin—and helped secure a victory for Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the NRA’s own home state.","2013-12-12 00:00:00","0","15.0","2.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","44.0","26.0","0.0","112.0","0.0","14.0","2","509","96.60","55.46","50.14","43.69","19.58","29.27","74.07","37.92","3.54","1.77","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.79","0.59","1.77","7.86","14.73","4.52","4.52","4.13","0.79","10.81","6.48","2.36","0.00","1.96","2.36","4.52","2.75","1.77","0.59","0.79","0.20","3.73","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.79","11.00","0.59","4.72","0.59","2.36","1.77","1.96","0.98","0.79","0.00","0.20","0.59","0.00","0.20","0.39","0.00","12.18","0.98","1.96","9.63","0.98","0.79","5.50","4.91","0.39","19.84","4.32","8.06","7.66","5.70","0.39","0.39","1.77","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.32","4.91","4.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.20","1.38","0.39","2.75","0.79","0.00","2552","8.34","20.076923076923077","779","501","26","51.89","12.3","10.8","13.23","13.0","119","11.125","19.22099800399202","285","18.92","8","0.38","0","12","7","44","1","62","47","0","1","1","93","57","6","39","1","0","8","4","28","3","0","1","18","0","13","22","16","19","9","8","1","0","0","0"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/115918/food-stamps-2013-congress-fails-pass-bill","Congress Fails on Food Stamps with Little Fanfare","The legislature’s failure to pass a farm bill in 2013 “serves as a poster child for congressional dysfunction,” Norm Ornstein inveighed in the National Journal Thursday. Ornstein helpfully traced the origins of the odd couple that is the bill: Its bloated farm subsidies are tied to the essential food stamps program because of the historic friendship that developed in the early 1970s between George McGovern and Bob Dole. Though Ornstein allows that the alliance at the heart of the farm bill was always “at best imperfect,“ he allows himself a moment to bask in the glow of a lost era:

I saw McGovern and Dole walking arm in arm in the Old Senate Office Building. They forged a relationship that blossomed into a 40-year-plus friendship, based on their common interest in dealing with food issues. Dole, representing his Kansas farmers, embraced the food-stamp program on their behalf, a way to deal with farm surpluses. McGovern, with a deep passion to alleviate hunger in America, embraced a system of price supports that gave money to agribusinesses for not planting crops as a way to fund the food-stamp program. Their alliance reflected a more than five-decade relationship between rural and urban lawmakers that made farm bills possible, a kind of model for how Congress, through compromises and trade-offs, can find majorities for legislation that primarily benefits minorities or narrower interests.

Earlier this fall, I compared the philosophy embedded in Republican’s derision of the farm bill to the 47 percent bombshell that imploded Mitt Romney’s campaign. They suggest the same callous message, that poverty is the fault of the people in it. But Congress’s can kicking hasn’t caused much of a stir. Most of the angst this December has been directed at a possible “dairy cliff”—if the bill expires, the law of the land will revert to the 1949 Agricultural Act, under which milk prices could spike to $7 or $8 a gallon. As Ornstein suggests, this is doubtless in part because “the same day the farm conference came a cropper, we got a mini budget deal, creating a brief feel-good moment, a sense that maybe compromise is still possible.” This morning, The New York Times ran a story, buried deep in the New York edition, titled “House Passes Budget Pact and Military Abuse Protections, but Not Farm Bill.”

As my colleague Jonathan Cohn has written, the food stamps program, or SNAP, “seems awfully good at what it is supposed to do: keep low-income people from going hungry or struggling even more financially”:

In 2011, according to the [Center on Budget and Policy Priority’s] analysis, ""SNAP kept about 4.7 million people out of poverty in 2011, including about 2.1 million children. SNAP also lifted 1.5 million children out of deep poverty (defined as 50 percent of the poverty line) in 2011, more than any other government assistance program."" Research by Kathryn Edin from Harvard and Luke Shaefer at the University of Michigan, two of the country’s leading scholars of poverty, has found that SNAP alone significantly reduces the number of households with children living on $2 a day. And new research from Shaefer, collaborating with Italo Gutierrez, suggests that SNAP significantly reduces the likelihood that low-income families will fall behind on other expenses, like rent and utilities.

The question now is whether the Senate will agree with the House of Representatives’ decision to pass a one-month extension of the farm bill, pushing expiration to January 31. ""Pass the extension ... and we on the Agriculture Committee will take care of our business in January,"" Frank Lucas, the committee chairman, told Reuters. He added that House and Senate negotiators were making ""incredible"" progress on a new draft. But SNAP dependents have every reason to fear what that draft will look like. As Mother Jones has reported, Steve Southerland, one of the Republicans on the committee, is an anti-food stamps crusader of unprecedented vitriol. “The explosion of food stamps in this country is not just a fiscal issue for me,” Southerland told The Washington Post, which profiled him in September. “This is a defining moral issue of our time."" On that last, at least, his constituents who rely on the program may agree.","2013-12-13 00:00:00","0","11.0","8.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","61.0","26.0","0.0","112.0","0.0","15.0","1","708","97.97","59.48","26.50","33.07","27.23","26.27","76.98","42.23","7.20","2.68","0.56","0.56","0.00","0.85","0.71","4.52","10.59","15.54","4.10","1.55","4.52","0.56","8.47","4.66","2.97","0.99","3.11","1.84","3.25","1.84","1.41","0.42","0.14","0.71","5.51","0.28","0.14","0.14","0.85","8.19","1.55","1.84","0.42","2.54","0.56","2.54","0.71","0.42","0.00","0.14","2.12","0.42","0.14","0.14","1.41","8.19","1.84","0.85","4.38","1.13","0.71","2.54","4.66","0.99","13.84","1.98","7.63","4.10","5.51","0.14","0.85","3.81","0.28","0.14","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","17.80","3.95","6.50","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.55","3.11","1.13","0.28","0.71","3414","8.95","31.26086956521739","1057","697","29","55.58","13.1","11.5","12.6","14.6","182","16.833333333333332","22.044763271162125","396","27.61","8","0.42","0","19","26","85","0","103","39","2","3","9","135","87","2","34","0","0","13","9","19","3","0","0","15","0","18","28","15","11","6","23","11","3","0","1"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/115867/hussein-morsi-my-brothers-presidency-was-disaster","Hussein Morsi: My Brother's Presidency 'Was a Disaster'","By the same token, the current government’s crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, which has forced the organization underground in the major cities, hasn’t had much of an impact on its activities within Al-Adwa. In Cairo, for example, the Brotherhood has suspended the regular meetings of its five-to-eight-member cells known as usras, and has urged its cadres to work on behalf of the organization individually, such as by trying to improve the Brotherhood’s reputation in conversations with neighbors. One Giza-based leader told me that phone communication is no longer safe for those Brotherhood officials who haven’t been arrested, so they now send messages to each other via their daughters.

But according to Hussein Morsi, the Brotherhood’s command chain in al-Adwa and the surrounding rural areas is still intact. The usra he heads continues to meet weekly—the same frequency as before his brother’s ouster—and still collects its members’ monthly dues, which remain seven to ten percent of each member’s salary. The leadership of the local shoaba, a division within the Brotherhood’s Leninist hierarchy that manages the work of six to twelve usras, is also functioning normally, and directly organizes the local Brotherhood-led marches demanding Morsi’s return to power.

Hussein, who serves in his shoaba’s administrative office, added that the head of his shoaba has continued to attend the regular meetings of the next tier in the Brotherhood’s hierarchy, the muntaqa. And despite the arrest of many higher-ranking provincial and national Brotherhood leaders, the Brotherhood’s provincial office in Sharkiya continues to disseminate orders that it receives from national Brotherhood leaders. For example, following major clashes in October between Brotherhood protesters and ordinary citizens opposing the organization, Muslim Brothers were ordered to refrain from retaliating when civilians attack them.

Given Hussein Morsi’s relatively low position in the Brotherhood’s nationwide hierarchy, he did not know exactly how the national leadership managed to maintain communication with the provincial leaders, because he has no personal access to these individuals. But he said that, on at least one occasion, a Brotherhood Guidance Office leader came to Sharkiya to meet with provincial leaders and distribute directives. He further revealed that, following Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie’s imprisonment in August, the Brotherhood appointed a new chief. (The man whom Morsi named as the new Brotherhood leader has no public profile and has never served in a top leadership position within the organization previously; although I was able to verify this man’s existence as a Muslim Brother, I could not confirm whether he was, in fact, the Brotherhood’s acting Supreme Guide.)

The fact that the Brotherhood is still functioning even somewhat normally in Egypt’s rural areas, despite a nationwide crackdown that has ensnared most of its top leaders, is good reason to question the widespread analysis that the organization cannot reemerge politically anytime soon. Much depends on what the Brotherhood’s leadership, perhaps even at the local level, decides to do: If the Brotherhood decides to run its own candidates as independents or support candidates from other parties in the next parliamentary elections, which are slated for next year, it could regain at least a small share of the influence that it lost during the past five months. The Guidance Office, Morsi told me, had not yet decided on its policy for the next elections—but if the Guidance Office decides to participate, he indicated, rank-and-file Brothers are prepared to resume political activities.","2013-12-10 00:00:00","0","20.0","9.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","45.0","26.0","0.0","105.0","0.0","15.0","3","572","93.80","80.89","36.19","41.58","35.75","31.29","82.69","45.10","8.57","2.97","0.70","0.00","0.00","1.75","0.52","5.59","9.62","14.69","4.90","2.97","5.07","1.75","9.44","5.77","2.97","1.75","1.57","1.92","2.10","1.40","0.52","0.00","0.17","0.35","14.34","4.37","0.17","0.17","6.29","8.74","1.75","1.57","1.05","1.75","0.87","3.15","0.52","0.17","0.35","0.00","0.35","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.03","6.29","3.85","6.64","0.52","0.35","3.67","6.82","0.35","16.08","1.40","9.09","5.59","6.47","0.17","0.17","0.35","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.38","2.80","6.64","0.17","0.17","0.00","0.00","1.75","0.00","3.50","0.35","0.00","3020","9.83","36.9375","959","559","16","27.59","18.3","18.1","15.68","22.3","158","18.166666666666668","27.265903398926653","301","32.0","2","0.44","0","14","7","62","0","77","59","1","3","2","79","56","1","38","0","0","16","11","28","1","0","0","22","0","21","23","12","13","9","25","5","4","0","2"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/115837/obamacare-834-error-rate-falls-25-percent-10-percent","Exclusive: The Obamacare Error Rate Has Fallen Dramatically","Until a few weeks ago, almost nobody outside the insurance industry had even heard of 834s. Then healthcare.gov opened for business—and the insurers discovered the 834s from the site contained errors at an alarming rate. Data was missing or in the wrong field: Some files had transposed parents and children, for example. Among the first to write about this problem was Robert Laszewski, the insurance industry consultant and widely read blogger. It also got attention in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and from Sarah Kliff in the Washington Post. If you want a fuller explanation of the forms and how companies use them, Kliff’s backgrounder at the Post’s Wonkblog remains the most accurate and thorough guide I’ve seen.

Early on, administration officials confirmed that 834s were among the site's myriad failures and high on their “punch list” of tasks to get the site fully functional. But as the more visible parts of healthcare.gov have started working better—from the looks of things, most consumers are now able to navigate the site easily and successfully—the lingering 834 issue has gotten more attention. On Monday, Amy Goldstein and Juliet Eilperin at the Post reported that about one-third of healthcare.gov enrollments since October 1 contained errors. At that point, discussion of 834s entered full freak-out mode.

But this may not be freak-out material. Technical experts from the insurers have been working closely with staff at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and with the private contractors. By the middle of November, the error rate had already declined significantly. Then, on Sunday, HHS introduced a key repair designed to fix the Social Security number problem. Laszewski, appearing on Fox News this week, said the error rate on Monday was as high as it had been three weeks ago. But other sources have said the latest batches of 834s insurers are, in fact, cleaner. “The enrollment files continue to get better and the new process they put in place this week to deal with the back end issues is making a difference,” says Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans. Bryce Williams, who is Managing Director of Exchange Solutions for Towers Watson, says ""We are hearing reports from insurers that the quality of the 834s being sent from Healthcare.gov is getting better—for example, fewer cases of children showing up as spouses."" But, he adds, ""there are still backend enrollment issues to be fixed.""

The restraint in those quotes reflects some very understandable caution—and a grasp of the relevant math. While the rate of error is declining, the pace of enrollment is increasing, which means the system may still be creating too many flawed files. Even when the error problem finally falls to acceptable levels, the past errors will need attention. Nobody has said exactly how many people will end up in this category, but the administration source said a rough guess would put the eventual number in the tens of thousands.

Still, the significance of that figure is not clear. It includes files with relatively minor mistakes, such as an incorrect middle initial, and it includes instances where the problem may be simple duplication or a mistake on the insurer end. More important, Administration is confident that most of the 834 errors involve cases where insurers have the files, as opposed to cases in which insurers never received the files. That means tracking down the right information, though labor-intensive, is straightforward to do. The Administration is also conferring with insurers about how to find those never-sent 834s, perhaps through some kind of cross-referencing of applications finished at healthcare.gov and new plans started by insurers. In the meantime, the Administration is reaching out to everybody who applied for coverage in October and November, via either email or phone, reminding them to confirm enrollment directly with insurers—and to pay the first month’s premium.","2013-12-06 00:00:00","1","18.0","10.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","60.0","26.0","0.0","115.0","0.0","15.0","3","657","93.26","57.84","50.03","21.11","22.66","25.88","79.00","45.51","5.33","1.22","0.15","0.15","0.15","0.15","0.61","4.11","9.44","15.22","6.54","4.72","6.70","0.91","12.18","5.63","3.50","1.52","1.37","2.28","3.35","1.52","1.83","0.15","0.00","0.30","5.33","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.15","11.11","2.59","1.52","1.52","2.74","1.37","2.28","2.74","0.91","1.52","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","8.07","0.61","2.28","3.35","1.67","1.37","4.41","6.70","1.52","17.66","1.22","9.13","7.31","5.18","0.15","0.00","1.07","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.46","5.18","5.78","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.91","1.22","0.91","0.30","0.00","3244","8.44","22.896551724137932","987","641","33","60.24","13.0","9.7","13.05","12.9","156","6.75","19.494789391575665","356","20.97","3","0.43","0","27","12","74","0","88","45","3","3","6","96","56","2","55","0","0","11","1","32","4","1","5","14","0","19","24","19","17","16","22","3","2","0","6"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/115745/homelands-biggest-washington-screw-ups","The Most Blatant Ways Homeland Gets Washington Wrong","Our new cover story investigates the TV shows that come closest to depicting the truth of Washington. But one of the most blatant offenders is Showtime's ""Homeland."" ""Homeland"" wasn't filmed in Washington. Instead, it was filmed in a shoddy simulacrum of Washington: Charlotte, North Carolina, since the latter was less expensive and logistically complicated. And partly as result, it has given us some pretty egregious distortions of the real DC.

FARRAGUT SQUARE IS NOT FARRAGUT SQUARE

A dramatic season one episode of Homeland was set in ""Farragut Square,"" as we were told repeatedly. But it could not have looked less like Farragut Square. For one, it had a fountain. And there was no iconic statue of David Farragut in sight.

DC HAS SKYSCRAPERS

In one episode, police shut down many blocks around the State Department. As Megan McArdle wrote in the Atlantic, this is an action that would have required shutting down two bridges and a big portion of the Mall. The show also put a sniper on what seemed to be at least the 20th floor of a building in a city that has a 12-story limit for its downtown structures.","2013-11-26 00:00:00","0","20.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","16.0","0.0","42.0","26.0","0.0","112.0","0.0","15.0","2","193","92.31","47.93","25.77","34.78","16.08","21.76","77.20","47.15","6.74","1.55","0.00","1.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.18","9.84","15.03","9.33","2.07","5.18","2.07","13.47","8.29","4.66","0.52","3.11","3.63","1.55","1.04","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.00","3.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.33","1.04","1.04","1.04","2.59","1.04","3.11","4.66","4.66","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.15","1.55","0.52","2.07","0.00","0.00","6.22","5.18","0.00","13.99","1.55","10.36","2.07","2.59","2.59","0.00","1.04","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.54","6.22","4.15","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.52","3.11","1.04","0.00","0.00","892","7.88","16.25","268","192","12","72.16","9.7","7.2","10.5","9.4","42","6.142857142857143","17.150000000000002","135","15.58","12","0.45","0","6","6","21","0","26","12","0","2","2","25","33","0","5","0","0","6","2","8","2","1","1","2","0","4","11","2","8","0","6","2","1","0","0"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/115748/conventional-wisdom-favors-diplomacy-iran","The Neocons Are Losing","I liked former New Republic writer Dana Milbank’s column this morning about how “Republicans mindlessly oppose Iran Nuclear Deal.” I liked it not just because it was witty, but because its prominence in the Washington Post—and its place when I woke up near the top of its list of the most popular stories—suggests that in this latest fracas over foreign policy, the conventional wisdom, as well as public opinion, is on the side of liberal internationalism rather than neo-conservative war-mongering. That this time it is the Bill Kristols and Ari Fleischers and Marco Rubios who are howling at the moon.

That’s especially important because in this case, there is an underlying truth—an emperor without any clothes, an elephant in the room—that no one in the administration or in the Republican opposition wants to openly acknowledge. It goes something like this: We all want Iran to abandon its quest for nuclear weapons, and we hope that through sanctions and negotiations, and the threat of war, we can achieve that result. But we Americans also know that if negotiations fail, then war may not be a real option. As the debate over intervention in Syria showed, the American public is not eager to go to war in the Middle East when the United States itself is not in danger. The Obama administration would have a hell of a time carrying out its threat. And even if it did, it would have a hell of a time achieving its objective of knocking out Iran’s nuclear capabilities.

So the various politicians and pundits who called for upping the sanctions as the interim deal was being negotiated, and who now denounce the deal as being woefully inadequate are doing a particular disservice. On one level, they are calling for war, which is the only alternative if we don’t pursue diplomacy. But on another level—if you consider the political and strategic difficulty, in this case of war—they are calling for a shutdown of our foreign policy—for the kind of national embarrassment and blow to our global standing from which we were saved in Syria by the Russians. So three cheers for Dana Milbank and for the good sense of the American people and the old foreign policy establishment of the Scowcrofts, Albrights, and Brzezinskis.","2013-11-26 00:00:00","0","10.0","4.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","43.0","26.0","0.0","103.0","0.0","14.0","1","386","77.67","59.21","20.53","5.98","29.69","23.32","82.38","54.66","12.18","3.63","0.78","2.07","0.26","0.00","0.52","8.55","9.84","14.51","6.74","3.89","9.59","1.81","9.59","5.96","3.63","2.07","0.78","1.30","7.51","2.85","4.66","1.04","2.85","1.04","7.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.88","1.30","1.30","2.85","3.37","0.78","4.15","0.52","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.62","2.07","1.81","6.22","1.04","1.30","2.07","6.22","1.04","12.69","0.78","8.55","3.11","3.89","0.00","0.26","0.26","0.52","1.55","0.78","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","10.36","3.37","4.66","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.52","0.52","1.04","0.00","0.00","1802","8.8","32.583333333333336","583","378","13","50.4","14.6","13.5","11.73","16.2","89","18.0","23.05798941798942","223","27.25","3","0.53","0","18","2","49","0","61","31","0","2","4","62","29","4","12","0","0","19","8","20","0","1","2","5","0","7","9","12","2","12","10","3","3","0","3"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/115772/single-payer-healthcare-supporters-complain-about-obamacare-problems","Now's Not the Time for Liberals to Say ""I Told You So"" About Obamacare","It has been a rough two months for the Affordable Care Act and its defenders. Having spent years fighting ridiculous allegations about socialized medicine and ""death panels,"" supporters of near-universal coverage now face something different. The performance failures in the rollout of healthcare.gov have triggered cries of ""I told you so!"" from some liberals. This wouldn’t have happened, they say, if only Obama had supported some form of single-payer plan, such as Medicare for all. The anger over the botched rollout is understandable, but these recriminations are poorly timed—and just plain wrong.

For starters, the ACA is working reasonably well in some places—California, Connecticut, Kentucky, Washington, and the District of Columbia, for example. These under-reported success stories show that insurance exchanges can work, if properly administered. Exchanges are successfully determining applicants’ eligibility for Medicaid or private insurance, enabling consumers to choose among competing plans, and computing the tax credits to which people are entitled. The human benefits are real, from California to Breathitt County in rural Kentucky. These successes make the federal government’s dismal rollout even more embarrassing. Republicans may have done everything within their power to dynamite the ACA, but the administration fell inexcusably short in launching Obama's domestic-policy centerpiece.

It doesn't help that health reform is really complicated. The U.S. health-care system is far and away the most complex in the world, one that includes employer-sponsored coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, the Indian Health Service, and small-group and individual insurance coverage—and that's before Obamacare was implemented.

Given that complexity, some on the left say, life would be simpler if only Congress had been willing—which it was not—to scrap all current arrangements and replace them with a single, federally administered health insurance plan. Those on the right regard this complexity and say that life would be simpler if only Congress had been willing—which it was not—to scrap all current arrangements and replace them with income-related vouchers people could use to help pay for private insurance of their choice.","2013-11-29 00:00:00","0","21.0","6.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","48.0","26.0","0.0","106.0","0.0","16.0","3","344","74.37","60.33","16.33","30.69","21.50","31.98","84.88","43.90","8.43","2.03","0.29","0.00","0.29","0.00","1.45","6.40","5.81","11.34","9.59","3.20","6.10","1.16","13.95","5.81","2.03","0.87","1.16","3.49","6.10","2.91","2.62","0.29","0.87","0.58","6.98","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.92","2.91","1.74","2.33","3.49","1.16","3.20","1.45","0.29","0.87","0.29","3.78","0.58","3.20","0.00","0.00","8.72","0.87","3.20","4.36","1.74","0.87","4.94","8.43","1.16","11.05","1.16","7.56","2.33","7.56","0.00","0.29","4.65","0.00","0.29","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.00","18.02","5.23","7.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.29","2.33","1.16","1.74","0.00","0.00","1854","9.89","21.875","565","328","17","43.43","14.4","12.0","16.82","15.9","110","5.125","23.13463414634147","224","21.0","5","0.43","0","15","1","33","0","38","29","0","0","5","52","32","1","28","1","0","9","3","19","1","1","0","7","0","17","10","7","16","11","8","6","0","0","0"
"https://newrepublic.com/article/115796/kiev-protests-yanukovich-eu-deal-moscow-green-envy","Russia's Liberals Are Watching Ukraine's Revolution Very Closely—And So Is Putin","In case you missed it, Kiev has been exploding over the last few days. Hundreds of thousands of people came out into the streets over the weekend—both in Kiev and elsewhere in Ukraine—to protest President Viktor Yanukovich's last-minute decision to scuttle the signing of a vaguely worded agreement that would have begun to pull Ukraine into the European orbit—and out of Russia's. The police can't clear the streets. The protesters have taken over city hall, as well as some other buildings, and forced a high-level resignation over police brutality. They've also caused a split in Yanukovich's Regions party and forced him to retreat back to the Europeans' negotiating table. (Given that the protesters are now calling for his ouster, well, it's a small price to pay.)

There are some legitimate questions about whether the move toward Europe is a wise one for Ukraine. They encompass everything from the country's own economic health, to the wisdom of alienating Russia, a neighbor that is both so vindictive and so close, and to whether the Ukrainians overestimate what they'll get out of this pact.

But tune in to the reaction in Moscow and you won't hear much about that. What you'll hear is Moscow talking mostly about...itself.

Two years ago this week, falsified parliamentary elections brought thousands out into Moscow's streets. But, after a euphoric winter and spring, the protests collapsed, having forced no real concessions from the Kremlin. Putin remained in power, the system remained in place, and both went after the opposition with renewed viciousness and vigor. Moscow's revolution is dead.","2013-12-03 00:00:00","0","18.0","9.0","6.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","67.0","32.0","0.0","118.0","0.0","15.0","3","266","93.19","64.66","77.66","32.21","19.00","24.44","82.33","49.62","7.89","3.01","0.00","0.00","1.13","0.75","1.13","4.89","9.77","17.67","6.39","4.51","7.14","1.13","10.90","3.38","1.50","1.50","1.88","2.63","4.89","2.63","2.26","0.00","1.50","0.75","6.39","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.75","8.65","1.50","1.88","0.38","1.88","0.75","2.63","1.50","0.38","1.13","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","7.89","0.75","0.00","6.39","0.75","0.00","3.38","6.02","1.13","22.56","2.26","15.04","5.64","2.26","0.75","0.38","1.13","0.00","0.38","0.75","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.75","0.00","18.05","6.39","5.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.75","0.00","4.89","0.75","0.00","1300","8.14","19.857142857142858","377","260","14","61.06","10.8","9.4","13.0","12.4","59","9.0","18.516923076923078","167","17.79","0","0.51","0","12","2","35","0","37","22","0","0","2","39","20","1","17","0","0","10","1","12","0","0","3","9","0","9","15","6","7","9","5","2","2","0","0"

(Photo credit: David McNew/Getty Images)

LAKE FOREST (CBSLA.com) — Pastor Rick Warren is expected to preach his first sermon since his youngest son’s death next weekend.

The service scheduled for July 27, will be streamed online by the evangelical megachurch.

The first sermon will be held at 4:30 p.m., followed by a 6:30 p.m. service. Another service will be held at 9 a.m. on July 28.

The 59-year-old Warren is also expected to lead a series titled, “How to Get through What You’re Going Through.”

The church announced on April 6, that the Warrens’ 27-year-old son, Matthew, committed suicide. Warren later said via Twitter (@RickWarren) that his son had used an unregistered gun purchased online.

Founded in 1980, Saddleback Church serves a large Southern California community with several locations.

Pastor Warren is known for authoring, “The Purpose Driven Life,” which has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, according to the church’s website.

"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/12/12/ex-bell-city-manager-robert-rizzo-to-plead-guilty-to-filing-false-federal-tax-return/","Ex-Bell City Manager Robert Rizzo To Plead Guilty To Filing False Federal Tax Return","LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Robert Rizzo, the former city administrator of the city of Bell, will plead guilty to federal income tax charges and faces a sentence of eight years in federal prison, according to a plea agreement filed Thursday in United States District Court.

Rizzo, 59, agreed to plead guilty to felony charges of conspiracy and filing a false federal income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service, federal officials said. Rizzo, a Torrance resident, also admitted he created a corporation to fraudulently claim losses on his income tax return to reduce his tax liability on his exorbitant income from the City of Bell.

The federal plea deal comes just days after his former assistant, Angela Spaccia, was convicted on 11 public corruption counts, including misappropriating funds, conflict of interest and hiding records about other city officials’ salaries.

Rizzo was originally charged alongside Spaccia, but he pleaded no contest to 69 corruption charges in October, just before the trial began.

Bell, a blue-collar city of just a little over 35,000 people, was paying Rizzo nearly $800,000 annually before he resigned in July 2010.

According to the plea agreement, Rizzo created an S Corporation he called R.A. Rizzo Incorporated (RARI) in 2002 in order to claim bogus losses in relation to a purported rental property in Auburn, Washington. RARI’s corporate tax return fraudulently deducted more than $409,731 in losses for the years 2006 through 2009.

Rizzo’s tax preparer, Robert J. Melcher, assisted in the scheme and has pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the filing of a false tax return. Melcher faces a sentence of up to three years in prison and will be sentenced in 2014.

Rizzo admitted to using a RARI account to pay for more than $80,000 in personal expenses in 2009 and $120,000 in construction work on his Huntington Beach home in 2010. The corporation’s tax returns falsely claimed these expenses were related to a rental property.

“Pursuing public servants who corruptly endeavor to circumvent the tax laws to fund their lavish lifestyles is a top priority for IRS Criminal Investigation,” said Richard Weber of the IRS.

According to the plea deal, Rizzo will file amended individual and S Corporation tax returns for the years 2006 through 2010 and pay all additional taxes and penalties, including a 75 percent fraud penalty.

Rizzo faces a maximum statutory sentence of eight years in federal prison.","2013-12-12 14:39:42","1","58.0","159.0","35.0","0.0","67.0","0.0","219.0","62.0","0.0","498.0","0.0","40.0","37","404","99.00","66.31","11.72","18.47","23.76","26.73","67.08","34.90","3.22","2.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.23","0.25","0.74","7.92","16.83","2.48","1.73","2.97","0.25","4.95","3.96","2.48","0.25","6.44","0.99","3.71","1.49","1.98","0.74","0.00","0.99","5.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.23","3.71","1.24","0.99","0.25","0.25","0.25","0.99","0.74","0.25","0.50","0.00","0.74","0.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.18","0.25","1.98","4.21","0.00","1.73","3.47","1.24","0.99","14.11","0.25","7.92","5.69","7.92","0.25","0.99","7.43","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.35","4.70","6.93","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.50","0.99","0.99","0.99","1986","8.71","27.133333333333333","634","397","18","49.04","14.2","11.9","12.94","14.1","100","12.75","20.915566750629722","210","24.47","13","0.35","0","11","26","34","0","48","34","2","0","3","68","55","1","28","0","0","4","6","12","0","0","0","18","0","11","18","12","7","1","7","0","1","0","0"

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — The baseball winter meetings are starting with a look back.

Joe Torre, Tony La Russa and Bobby Cox were among the candidates considered Sunday by the Hall of Fame’s expansion era committee. The trio of retired managers was joined on the 12-man ballot by a pair of much-debated figures who died in recent years: New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and pioneering players’ union head Marvin Miller.

Among the nine managers with three or more World Series titles, Torre and La Russa are the only ones not in Cooperstown. The vote announcement is scheduled for Monday morning at the meetings site near Orlando.

“He’s going to go to the Hall of Fame,” La Russa’s former closer in Oakland, Dennis Eckersley, predicted last year.

Torre and Cox retired as managers after the 2010 season and La Russa after leading St. Louis to the 2011 championship. Torre won four World Series titles with the Yankees, La Russa three with Oakland and the Cardinals, and Cox one with Atlanta. La Russa is third among managers with 2,728 wins; Cox had 2,504 and Torre 2,326.

On the ballot for the sixth time, Miller received 11 of 16 votes when the expansion-era committee last met three years ago, one shy of the required 75 percent. Steinbrenner made his ballot debut in 2010 and received fewer than eight votes, the Hall said, without specifying.

By the time the vote is announced, the lobby in the Dolphin hotel near Walt Disney World should be filled with agents and team officials arriving for the four-day session.

When the meetings were held here three years ago, the ballroom where deals are announced wasn’t even set up when agent Scott Boras and Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo walked in to discuss a just-completed, $126 million, seven-year contract for outfielder Jayson Werth.

The eve this year wasn’t as dramatic. But 42 of 168 major leaguers who became free agents after the World Series already had agreements heading into the meetings, with at least seven more deals in the process of being finalized.

Since Boston finished off St. Louis for its third title in 10 seasons, Prince Fielder, Ian Kinsler, Doug Fister, Jim Johnson, David Freese and Heath Bell have been traded in a busy swaps market.

“It’s not the best free-agent market,” Texas general manager Jon Daniels said, “and so I think that teams realize they weren’t going to be able to fill all of their needs, or wouldn’t necessarily want to fill all of their needs on the open market, and that led to a lot more accelerated trade conversation, and we’re seeing that play out.”

Robinson Cano, Jacoby Ellsbury, Joe Nathan, Jhonny Peralta, Tim Hudson and Curtis Granderson are some of the top free agents who have already changed teams.

Outfielders Shin-Soo Choo and Nelson Cruz are among the free agents still available, joined by designated hitter Kendrys Morales, shortstop Stephen Drew and pitchers Bronson Arroyo, Bartolo Colon, Matt Garza, Roy Halladay, Ubaldo Jimenez, Fernando Rodney and Ervin Santana.

“It’s a bit like an art auction,” Oakland general manager Billy Beane said. “You go into any free-agent period with a rational view of how you see things and also remember you’re part of a dynamic market. It’s still a very busy time for us. We’re certainly not bored, that’s for sure. This is a time the industry is very active, you want to make sure you’re a part of what’s going on so you don’t miss anything.”

Cano has the largest package, a yet-to-be-finalized deal with Seattle said to be worth $240 million over 10 years. The star second baseman left the Yankees to join the Mariners.

“Nothing should be surprising anymore. Therefore I wasn’t surprised — after a moment,” New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said. “That kind of money has been spent before. The thing about baseball (that) is funny is that all 30 teams are on a continuum and nobody is in the same point psychologically, competitively and financially at any point in time.

“So there’s always somebody who’s digging in their heels, they’re not going to do this and they’re not going to do that, they’re going to get the first pick every year for three years, what have you,” he said. “And there’s somebody on the other end that’s going crazy. It doesn’t do any good to lament that. That’s reality. You just have to deal with it.”

After missing the playoffs for only the second time in 19 seasons, the Yankees have been big spenders despite the loss of Cano. New York has committed $307 million to add Ellsbury, Brian McCann, Carlos Beltran and Kelly Johnson and to retain Hiroki Kuroda and Brendan Ryan.

It appears the Yankees have little chance of getting under the $189 million luxury tax threshold for next season. When Beltran’s deal is finalized, the Yankees will have 13 signed players for a tax total of $172,233,810. That leaves them about $5 million for the rest of their 40-man roster, given that the payroll for tax purposes includes between $11 million and $12 million for benefits.

New York would gain some flexibility if Alex Rodriguez’s suspension is upheld and it doesn’t have to pay his $25 million salary.

LOS ANGELES (CBS/AP) — An audit by the California state controller’s office reveals that the city of Bell is still reeling financially three years after it was discovered the working-class suburb’s municipal leaders had looted millions of dollars from its treasury.

State Controller John Chiang released the audit Wednesday.

He says it shows Bell’s general fund balance has a shortfall of more than $1 million. Bell also owes its residents more than $3 million in taxes and fees that were collected illegally.

Chiang praised the city’s new leaders for conducting business honestly and taking other steps to turn Bell around since residents voted the entire City Council out of office two years ago.

But he says if these and other financial woes aren’t addressed the city faces a “fiscal crisis.”

"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/07/19/california-finds-too-few-inmates-for-early-release/","California Finds Too Few Inmates For Early Release","SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration says in a court filing that the state is falling far short of meeting a demand from federal judges to find thousands of inmates who could be released from prison early without endangering the public.

The judges are requiring the state to free nearly 10,000 inmates by year’s end to reduce crowding in prisons and improve treatment for sick and mentally ill inmates.

If other methods fail, they ordered the state to reach that level by releasing offenders who are considered unlikely to commit new crimes.

However, the state said late Thursday that it has identified only about 1,200 inmates who could be safely released.

Inmates’ attorneys are filing a challenge Friday asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reject Brown’s request to delay releasing the inmates.

COMPLETE COVERAGE: Paul Walker

The Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department says Tujunga resident Jameson Witty took the roof panel from the charred Porsche Carrera GT as it was being towed away Saturday from the crash site.

The flat-bed tow truck left the Valencia crash site at around 10 p.m. and was being followed by several vehicles as it headed east on Newhall Ranch Road, officials said. Police believe Witty and another man exited one of those vehicles when the tow truck stopped at a red light, pulled off the Porsche’s red T-top roof panel and drove off.

The tow truck driver reported the alleged theft to the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station.

Deputies were able to identify Witty as the suspect and arrested him Thursday morning at his home.

The stolen panel was later recovered when detectives served a search warrant at a Canyon Country home.

It was unclear if the suspects stole the panel to sell or to keep as a memento.

Officials say they’ve tracked down a second suspect, an unidentified 25-year-old man outside California who was making arrangements to turn himself in.

Witty and the second suspect will likely be charged with felony grand theft and tampering with evidence, the LASD reported. Witty’s bail was set at $20,000 and he’s due in court Monday.

The crash investigation is ongoing.

Witnesses say the crash happened minutes after Walker left a fundraising event, held by his charity Reach Out Worldwide for supertyphoon Haiyan victims, at around 3:30 p.m. Saturday in Valencia. The 40-year-old star was riding in the passenger seat of friend Roger Rodas’ Porsche.

Moments later the car had slammed into light pole and burst into flames, killing both Walker and Rodas. Authorities say speed was a factor in the crash.

"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/05/16/former-compton-fire-department-deputy-chief-arrested-for-arson/","Former Compton Fire Department Deputy Chief Arrested for Arson","COMPTON (CBSLA.com) — A former deputy chief for the Compton Fire Department has been arrested for allegedly starting a fire at headquarters and stealing thousands of dollars in radio equipment.

Marcel Melanson, 37, was arrested Wednesday without incident at his Torrance home on charges of felony arson and grand theft, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

The arrest stems from what investigators say was a suspicious fire that broke out at Compton Fire Department headquarters on Acacia Avenue on December 11, 2011.

The Compton Fire Chief requested the LASD’s Internal Criminal Investigations Bureau to assist in looking into the case on January 4, 2012.

Authorities conducted a joint investigation with arson investigators from the Long Beach Fire Department and Montebello Fire Department.

They believe Melanson deliberately set fire to the facility to conceal theft of Motorola radios worth thousands of dollars with the intent of selling them over the internet.

The radios were purchased by Compton’s city government in connection with the planned re-establishment of the Compton Police Department, LASD spokesperson Steve Whitmore said.

The Compton City Council dropped the plan to re-establish its own police department because of the city’s financial difficulties. The sheriff’s department continues to provide police services for the city.

Melanson’s case has been submitted to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office.

Melanson was an employee of the Compton Fire Department for over 15 years. He was terminated earlier this year.

He remains in custody in lieu of $250,000.00 bail.

He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday at 8:30 a.m. at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center.","2013-05-16 20:56:03","1","59.0","159.0","35.0","0.0","67.0","0.0","223.0","62.0","0.0","498.0","0.0","40.0","37","270","99.00","64.46","16.62","11.41","18.00","34.44","69.63","36.30","3.70","2.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.48","0.74","1.48","10.00","17.04","4.07","0.00","1.48","0.37","7.41","1.11","0.74","0.37","4.44","0.00","1.85","0.37","1.48","0.37","0.00","0.37","4.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.48","1.85","0.74","0.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.37","5.93","0.37","2.22","3.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.04","0.00","1.11","5.56","0.37","0.37","4.44","2.96","0.37","15.56","0.00","10.74","4.81","8.89","1.48","0.37","3.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.70","6.30","2.59","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.74","0.00","2.59","0.74","0.37","1426","9.34","19.857142857142858","439","265","15","45.05","13.6","11.4","14.96","13.8","81","11.0","21.306415094339624","167","18.71","5","0.39","0","3","11","28","0","38","7","0","0","0","46","66","1","13","0","0","5","2","2","1","0","1","8","0","6","13","5","10","3","7","1","1","0","0"
"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/11/25/president-obama-touches-down-in-southland-for-2-day-visit/","Obama Meets Family Of Slain TSA Officer During Southland Visit","LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — President Obama wrapped up the first of a two-day Southland visit Monday, meeting with the family of slain Transportation Secretary Administration officer Gerardo Hernandez and headlining a pair of Beverly Hills fundraisers.

Obama kicked off his visit late Monday afternoon with a short stop at the Beverly Hilton, where he met with the family of Hernadez, who was killed when a gunman opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport Nov. 1. The president also met with TSA officers Tony Grigsby and James Speer, who were wounded in the rampage.

Obama participated in two fundraising events in Beverly Hills, one of which is being held at the Beverly Park home of Magic Johnson and his wife, Cookie, impacting streets in the area as well as in nearby Westwood.



The president’s visit is his 16th to the Los Angeles area since taking office, and the 10th fundraising trip. Monday night’s reception at the home of Magic and Cookie Johnson raised money for Democratic candidates for the Senate and Congress; the cheapest tickets cost $2,500 and the price went up to $15,000 to be a host and receive a photo with the president.

An estimated 80 guests attended the intimate fundraiser at Johnson’s home, according to pool reports. KCAL9’s Dave Bryan reports the Lakers hall of famer introduced the president as the “the greatest leader in the world.”

I have won 5 NBA Championships, 3 MVPs and an Olympic Gold Medal but hosting Pres. Obama at my home was greater than all of those moments! — Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) November 26, 2013

Johnson later tweeted that “I have won 5 NBA Championships, 3 MVPs and an Olympic Gold Medal but hosting Pres. Obama in my home was greater than all of those moments!”

The president praised Johnson for changing the public perception of HIV and for serving as a leader in business, then delivered a 17-minute speech urging the country to start thinking like a team, pool reports said.

Obama later attended a dinner fundraiser at the nearby Beverly Hills home of Israeli-American billionaire Haim Saban, where dinner for two cost more than $32,000.

Waiting up the hill outside from the home of the night’s second fundraiser were a few dozen demonstrators protesting the TPP, which they charge is being secretly negotiated by multinational corporations and industry trade groups.

The president’s trip to California got off to a somewhat confrontational start earlier Monday at his one public event in San Francisco’s Chinatown, when protesters standing behind the president on stage shouted at him to use an executive order to stop deportations of undocumented immigrants.

“The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,” Obama said in response. “And what I’m proposing is the harder path which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won’t be as easy as just shouting, it requires us lobbying and getting it done.”

Protesters also awaited the president’s arrival at Will Rogers Park in Beverly Hills to demonstrate against a global trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. According to protesters, if the agreement between the U.S. and about 12 other countries is allowed to go through it could allow corporations to sue state and local governments over regulations that might affect future profits.

Demonstrators from a variety of organizations, including MoveOn and Occupy, told CBS2’s Randy Paige they would not go up to Magic Johnson’s home but wanted the president and the public to hear their concerns.

On Tuesday morning, Obama is slated to attend another fundraiser in Hancock Park, affecting Wilshire, Fairfax to Western avenues and Beverly to Pico boulevards from 8 a.m. to 10:45 a.m., officials said.

From there, the president will travel to DreamWorks Animation in Glendale, where he will deliver remarks on the economy during the noon hour. The following streets will be affected from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.:

• Riverside Drive

• San Fernando Road and Grandview Avenue to North Pacific Avenue

• West Kenneth Road to Victory Boulevard

• San Fernando Road

• 5 Freeway and 134 Freeway

Obama’s departure from LAX will also affect streets near the airport between 1:15 p.m. to 2 p.m.

The trip comes as the U.S. and other world powers just sealed a historic deal with Iran for a temporary freeze of its nuclear program, and after Obama’s health care law approaches a crucial Nov. 30 deadline for an improved insurance enrollment website whose catastrophic start Oct. 1 dealt a serious political blow to the White House.

“So even as we’re getting this darn website up to speed, and it’s getting better, states like California are proving the law works,” Obama said in his public remarks in San Francisco Monday.

A new CNN poll shows more than half of all Americans now believe Obama is not honest or trustworthy. Only four in 10 say he is managing the government effectively.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Shoppers and merchants aren’t the only ones preparing for Black Friday; so are Los Angeles police.

Officers Monday reminded shoppers of numerous safety tips and precautions to keep in mind during holiday shopping.

“A car drove up behind me. A young man got out, pointed a gun at me, and said ‘—–, give me your purse’,” robbery victim Corinne Nitz said of her experience during a previous Black Friday. “So the —– gave him her purse.”

The LAPD emphasized the principles of its “Lock It, Hide It, Keep It” program, in which shoppers who have packages and valuables in their vehicles are urged to keep them out of sight and make sure the car is locked, KNX1070’s Ron Kilgore reports.

“If you’re going to have belongings in your car, you’re going to have to hide it. That means keep it concealed — we suggest putting it in the trunk,” LAPD’s Janet Zumpstein said. “If the suspect can’t see it, they won’t know that you have it in your car.”

LAPD Prepares For Black Friday, Reminds Shoppers To 'Lock It, Hide It, Keep It' “The Police Department works with all the malls that we cover, and they did increase security staff for the malls,” Zumpstein said. “We have extra patrol with LAPD.

NEW YORK (CBSLA.com) — CBS News plans extensive coverage — across a variety of their shows — to commemorate the 5oth anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a motorcade in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.

The coverage will include archival footage from the day as well as the unforgettable moment when Walter Cronkite broke into a live broadcast of “As the World Turns” to announce the president had been shot.

Cronkite, who at first was just heard in a breaking news bulletin, would announce — his eyes filling with tears — that the president was dead.

Shows taking part in the anniversary coverage include “CBS This Morning,” “The CBS Evening News With Scott Pelley,” “Face the Nation,” “CBS Sunday Morning with Charles Osgood” and a new prime-time special, “As It Happened: John F. Kennedy 50 Years” (airing Nov. 16. from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.).

“As It Happened” is produced by the makers of “48 Hours” and will be hosted by Bob Schieffer. The program will look at how the four days surrounding the assassination changed America, as well as TV news forever. The show will also examine the continual debate about whether there was a conspiracy to kill the young president and, if so, who was involved?

The following day on “Face the Nation,” host Schieffer (50 years ago a reporter at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram) will recount his personal experiences from that period, including the first interview with Marguerite Oswald, the mother of the accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. He will anchor the broadcast live from Dallas.

“CBS This Morning” will look back at eyewitness interviews and rare photos of the day. The show will also look at Kennedy’s lasting legacy.

Also on Nov. 17, “CBS Sunday Morning” will examine what JFK continues to mean to the country, along with the Camelot mystique and how the city of Dallas is still trying to shake the negative images left from that time.

Scott Pelley will anchor the evening news live from Dallas on Nov. 22. During the week, the program will feature an interview with Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent (now 80) who famously climbed on the back of the president’s limo after the assassination.

Throughout the week, CBS Radio News will also broadcast remembrances and special reports from several correspondents, including Peter Maer, Dan Raviv and Barry Bagnato, who will report from Dallas on Nov. 21 and Nov. 22. CBS Radio News will also broadcast special reports throughout the anniversary day.

CBSNEWS.com will stream original CBS News coverage in real time. The stream will cover the four-day period following the shooting, Lee Harvey Oswald’s slaying captured on live TV, and the president’s funeral. Viewers will get to relive the extraordinary moments from Dallas, New York, Washington and around the world as Cronkite, Eric Sevareid, Harry Reasoner, Charles Kuralt, Roger Mudd and others reported the tragedy.","2013-11-07 21:14:52","1","59.0","160.0","35.0","0.0","68.0","0.0","222.0","61.0","0.0","503.0","0.0","40.0","37","496","97.01","60.35","31.72","32.70","16.53","24.40","70.36","40.73","3.43","0.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.60","0.20","2.62","11.09","14.11","5.65","3.83","6.25","0.20","10.48","4.44","2.02","1.81","3.43","0.60","2.62","1.41","1.01","0.20","0.20","0.60","3.43","0.20","0.00","0.20","0.60","3.23","1.01","1.21","0.40","0.40","0.20","0.60","3.43","2.62","0.60","0.00","1.61","0.81","0.81","0.00","0.00","2.82","0.00","1.01","1.41","0.40","0.00","3.02","3.43","3.63","17.54","1.41","7.06","9.48","4.03","0.81","0.00","0.40","0.00","2.02","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.00","21.57","6.85","5.85","0.40","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.60","4.44","0.81","2.02","0.40","2370","8.36","25.0","727","492","26","60.75","11.9","9.5","12.24","12.0","118","10.2","19.15349593495935","256","22.7","19","0.37","0","11","16","59","0","63","30","0","0","18","66","108","0","19","0","0","3","3","18","0","0","0","8","0","24","14","13","9","4","5","0","5","0","3"

KNX 1070’s Mike Landa reports Supervisor John Moorlach wants his colleagues on the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) Board of Directors to reconsider the plan.

'My Constituents Are Livid': OC Supervisor Leads Effort To Delay Decision On Toll Lanes

The OCTA plans to build at least one new free lane in each direction of I-405, paid for with a half-cent sales tax that voters approved for transportation projects.

The full OCTA, which rejected the idea of adding toll lanes to that project last year, is set to vote Friday on the proposal with support — and some say even pressure — from Caltrans officials.

However, following a commission vote Monday, Moorlach — who is part of an apparent slim majority of board members who either reject tolls outright or want to take a step back — said the county should postpone a decision on tolls until March or April.

“My constituents are livid,” he said. “Everywhere I go, they’re saying, ‘We’re opposed to the toll roads.'”

Committee officials believe delaying a decision would allow the OCTA to secure assurances from Caltrans that any money raised by the tolls would stay in Orange County.

While Caltrans owns the freeway and has the final authority over any decision, some OCTA directors have expressed concern that Caltrans could enact tolls on its own and then take control of revenue.","2013-11-08 10:09:03","1","26.0","91.0","4.0","0.0","41.0","2.0","131.0","36.0","0.0","294.0","0.0","6.0","11","260","97.61","60.62","38.39","39.52","28.89","23.08","76.15","37.31","5.77","2.69","1.54","0.38","0.00","0.77","0.00","3.08","8.08","14.62","4.62","1.54","3.46","0.00","11.15","4.23","1.15","1.15","2.69","4.62","3.08","1.92","1.15","0.38","0.00","0.77","5.38","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.77","10.77","2.69","1.54","2.31","2.31","1.15","1.54","2.69","1.15","1.54","0.00","0.77","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.77","10.77","1.15","2.31","6.54","1.15","0.77","1.15","6.92","1.54","16.54","3.08","8.85","5.00","4.62","0.77","0.00","2.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.00","3.85","3.46","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.77","2.69","2.31","1.54","0.00","1236","8.98","29.11111111111111","383","261","10","53.44","13.2","12.3","11.84","15.0","67","12.625","22.708199233716478","174","27.0","12","0.38","0","5","6","28","0","32","12","0","2","4","37","43","5","19","0","0","5","2","4","0","0","0","10","0","12","6","5","4","9","9","1","2","0","0"

Secret Drug Tunnel Uncovered Along U.S. Border Near San Diego Agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), U.S. Attorney’s Office, U.S. Border Patrol, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) joined with the San Diego and Chula Vista police departments to shut down the massive cross-border drug tunnel Wednesday night, officials said. The passageway, which linked warehouses in the Otay Mesa industrial park and Tijuana, Mexico, is equipped with electricity, ventilation and a rail system, according to officials. In related enforcement actions, San Diego Tunnel Task Force agents and local authorities seized more than eight tons of marijuana and 325 pounds of cocaine, marking the first time cocaine has recovered in connection with a local drug tunnel, officials said. Three suspects were taken into custody on federal charges following the operation, but no additional details were provided.","2013-10-31 13:21:33","1","26.0","91.0","4.0","0.0","41.0","2.0","130.0","36.0","0.0","294.0","0.0","6.0","11","189","97.87","56.31","37.24","34.98","31.50","30.16","59.79","24.87","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.53","6.35","10.05","3.17","0.00","4.23","0.53","7.41","3.70","1.06","0.53","3.17","1.06","0.53","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.94","3.17","1.06","0.00","2.65","0.00","1.06","1.59","0.00","1.59","0.00","4.23","0.53","3.70","0.00","0.00","9.52","0.53","1.59","5.82","1.06","1.06","4.76","1.59","0.00","14.81","1.59","10.58","2.65","6.35","0.53","0.00","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","26.46","10.05","8.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.06","0.00","1.59","5.29","0.00","1027","9.35","32.833333333333336","319","186","13","48.5","13.3","10.0","15.88","13.1","59","4.15","20.40817204301075","130","28.33","21","0.27","0","8","5","12","0","14","12","1","0","0","30","68","0","19","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","0","1","8","4","6","1","4","1","0","0","0"

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — City Councilman Jose Huizar’s former deputy chief of staff, who is suing him for alleged sexual harassment, is filing a second lawsuit to block a subpoena issued by a panel that is probing the case.

Huizar has admitted to having an affair Francine Godoy, who filed suit against the city earlier this month, but has denied her accusations of sexual harassment and retaliation.

Godoy’s latest legal action states that City Council President Herb Wesson’s involvement in the committee investigating her claims “will be fatally tainted by Wesson’s deep, intimate personal and professional ties to Huizar and Wesson’s unabashed and enthusiastic public support of Huizar.”

Wesson recently campaigned for Huizar, who is seeking a third four-year term.

Godoy, 34, who worked in Huizar’s office for seven years, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Oct. 17 claiming the councilman encouraged her to run for a seat on the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees and then withdrew his support when she refused his sexual advances.

“…Huizar explicitly conditioned the plaintiff’s employment benefits on sexual favors and when the plaintiff refused Huizar’s sexual advances and opposed Huizar’s sexual harassment, Huizar began a campaign of retaliation against the plaintiff,” the lawsuit stated.

Godoy said Huizar began to cut back her duties in his office, which eventually forced her to get another job.

KCAL9’s Dave Bryan reported that Godoy was repeatedly promoted when she worked for Huizar. Her salary, he said, nearly tripled from around $47,000 a year when she started to more than $132,000 a year before she left the job and went to work for the sanitation department.

Back in August, Godoy also filed a complaint with the state about the alleged harassment. Since then, the president of the Los Angeles City Council has appointed a panel to investigate the charges.

In a statement, Robert Alaniz, a spokesman for Huizar’s attorney Dennis Walsh, said Huizar denies Godoy’s claims, but admits to having a consensual relationship with her.

“The claims of illegal sexual behavior and other alleged allegations against him are absolutely false and malicious,” Alaniz said. “More importantly, Francine Godoy’s behavior towards him both before and after these fabricated events will prove that they are not credible. The lawsuit fails to mention that Ms. Godoy and the councilmember had an occasional and consensual relationship, which the councilmember deeply regrets. He has apologized to his wife and family, and he and his wife are currently working on repairing their marriage.”

Alaniz also said that “Godoy is someone seeking to damage the councilmember’s reputation because he would not help advance her career as she expected.”

"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/10/29/oc-residents-public-officials-to-debate-toll-lanes-on-405-freeway/","OC Residents, Public Officials To Debate Toll Lanes On 405 Freeway","WESTMINSTER (CBSLA.com) — Orange County residents got a chance to voice their opinion Tuesday night on a proposal to introduce toll lanes along the I-405 Freeway.

Many residents argued that they already pay taxes on Orange County highways, and that freeways should remain free.

“So you’re going to pay for that whole freeway, and then you’re going to pay if you want to ride on it. That’s not right,” Seal Beach Mayor Pro Tem Ellery Deaton said. “I will never vote for anything else that they ever ask me to vote for from OCTA, because they lied to me, and I’m mad.”

Following a meeting in September, the Orange County Transportation Authority’s (OCTA) Board Of Directors is scheduled to vote on Nov. 8 on the Caltrans-backed proposal, which would add toll lanes on the 405 between SR-55 at Costa Mesa and the 605 Freeway at the Los Angeles County border.

If approved, construction would begin in 2015 and is estimated to last up to five years.

The 405 Freeway Cities Coalition, who organized the town hall-style forum, hosted a panel comprised of City Council members from six cities: Costa Mesa, Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos, Seal Beach, and Westminster. Several elected public officials also attended.

Second District Supervisor John Moorlach said the state appears to be tying freeway funding to an agreement to introduce toll lanes, which in turn has led to push-back by residents.

“We need to step up and say, ‘Wait a second, we’re the second-highest generator of income tax for the state of all 58 counties, and you’re treating us as if we haven’t been planning and doing the right things over all this time period,” Moorlach said. “That just doesn’t sit well.”

The 405 freeway in Orange County is counted among the busiest stretches of road in all of the U.S., with over 370,000 cars a day traveling up and down the interstate.

Express toll lanes that were installed and opened on the Harbor (110) Freeway earlier this year have been blamed for slower traffic speeds, with officials attributing the slowdown to solo drivers no longer being allowed to use the carpool lane illegally.

The OCTA did not speak at the meeting, and former Westminster mayor Margie Rice believes she knows the reason why.

“Because when they come, we give them hell,” former Westminster mayor Margie Rice said. “We tell them what we think.”","2013-10-29 11:09:55","1","59.0","159.0","35.0","0.0","67.0","0.0","222.0","61.0","0.0","498.0","0.0","40.0","37","406","88.83","76.25","52.86","21.97","22.56","19.95","75.86","43.35","9.85","5.91","1.23","1.72","0.99","0.25","1.72","3.94","7.14","14.29","5.67","2.46","5.42","1.48","12.81","3.45","1.97","1.48","4.19","1.72","2.22","0.99","1.23","0.00","1.23","0.00","9.11","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","8.37","0.99","2.22","1.97","1.97","1.23","1.72","2.96","1.23","1.72","0.00","0.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.74","6.40","1.97","0.49","3.69","0.49","0.00","4.19","7.88","1.23","19.70","3.20","11.33","5.67","3.69","1.23","0.74","1.97","0.25","0.00","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","20.20","5.17","6.40","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.48","3.20","2.22","1.48","0.00","1861","8.4","27.733333333333334","564","399","19","67.08","11.0","9.1","11.31","12.3","94","8.6","19.823558897243107","252","24.4","11","0.42","0","12","14","38","0","46","14","1","2","4","43","69","2","21","0","0","24","1","17","2","0","1","17","0","21","15","11","12","15","7","3","2","0","2"

KNX 1070’s Ed Mertz reports environmental justice advocates and community members are concerned about potential environmental fallout from a taxpayer-funded plan to drill on protected land.

LA County Supervisors Reject Proposed Oil Drilling In Whittier Hills

Supervisor Gloria Molina was on hand at a meeting Tuesday night to stand in opposition to proposed oil drilling by the Matrix Oil Co. in what Molina described as “pristine open space” which purchased with nearly $17 million in Proposition A tax revenues.

The Board of Supervisors unanimously rejected a lease deal that opponents say would keep all profits between Matrix and the city of Whittier, while also disrupting core protected habitat, creating visual blight, closing hiking trails, and subjecting the local community to noise, air, and potential water pollution.

“When taxpayers approved Prop. A in 1992 and again in 1996, we promised that a vote for Prop. A meant support for land preservation and animal habitat restoration — not oil drilling,” Molina said in a statement.

In 1992, Whittier received $9.3 million in Prop. A funds for the “acquisition of natural lands and related facilities” in the Whittier Hills, which contains about 1,280 acres of open space which the city agreed to operate and maintain “into perpetuity.” The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy allocated $7 million more in Prop. A money to the Whittier Hills project to “facilitate the preservation of park and open space land,” according to Molina.

But residents say officials are using a double standard when it comes to determining which sites are targeted for drilling operations.

“Oil drilling on Prop. A land would never be accepted in the Santa Monica Mountains,” said one opponent. “Why is it OK to do it in Whittier Hills?”

As many as five lawsuits have been filed against the city of Whittier, Matrix and Clayton Williams Energy, according to the Whittier Daily News.

The issue will go back to court, where the decision could impacting the use of other lands under Prop. A.

"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/10/30/report-new-details-emerge-in-fbi-sting-of-state-senator-calderon/","New Details Emerge About FBI Sting Of State Senator Ron Calderon","LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — When FBI agents raided the Sacramento offices of state Senator Ron Calderon in June, it was part of an FBI investigation in which agents posed as movie studio executives and allegedly paid about $60,000 in bribes to Calderon, Al Jazeera America reported Wednesday.

The Al Jazeera report was based on a 124-page federal affidavit in which authorities say Calderon drew up and promoted legislation that could have resulted in lucrative tax credits for the studio. The affidavit says a daughter of Calderon was paid $30,000 to work at the studio but never showed up for work.

The FBI affidavit says Calderon also accepted money to assist a spinal surgery business.

A spokesperson for the FBI told KCAL9 Political Reporter Dave Bryan the agency could neither confirm nor deny the Al Jazeera report.

To some, it sounds like a replay of the movie “Argo.”

Via Skype on Wednesday, Al Jazeera producer Trevor Aaronson told Bryan, “This is more than political corruption. This is political corruption posed in the shadows of Hollywood posing as independent movie producers. And in a way, it’s really funny. It comes less than a year after a movie that documented how the CIA used similar tactics to get Americans out of Iran.”

Bryan also called Calderon’s office. It had no comment on the report.

On Wednesday, Al Jazeera TV showed reporter Josh Bernstein confronting Calderon and seeking a comment about the allegations.

Said Bernstein to Calderon: “The FBI says you accepted tens of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for supporting legislation.”

Calderon replied, “That’s … that’s … like I said, ‘I’m not going to answer anything right now.'”

Bernstein shot back, “You’re an elected official, in one of the largest states in the country. Don’t you think the public has a right to hear from you?”

“They hear from me all the time,” Calderon answered.

The affidavit obtained by Al Jazeera outlines conversations between Calderon and the undercover agent.

At one point, Calderon is quoted as saying: “Because of my position … we cannot have a quid pro quo conversation.” But Calderon would later ask for favors.

Calderon also is quoted as saying, “I told you man, anything you can do, any help you can do for my kids, is, you know…. That’s diamonds for me. That’s diamonds.”","2013-10-30 22:53:38","1","63.0","160.0","35.0","0.0","67.0","0.0","224.0","62.0","0.0","498.0","0.0","40.0","37","387","92.06","71.52","20.34","49.84","16.12","25.58","74.42","44.19","8.79","4.39","1.81","0.26","2.07","0.00","0.26","4.39","8.79","15.76","7.24","2.84","4.65","1.81","14.73","4.65","3.88","1.03","2.07","1.55","1.81","1.55","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.00","9.30","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.26","8.27","1.55","2.07","0.78","1.03","0.52","2.33","3.62","0.52","3.10","0.00","0.52","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","5.17","1.03","1.29","3.10","0.78","0.00","4.91","9.30","0.26","11.11","0.52","7.75","3.10","7.49","1.29","0.78","2.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.45","7.24","5.17","0.52","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.26","4.39","2.58","0.52","0.52","1827","7.7","20.842105263157894","550","387","24","72.05","10.9","7.2","11.48","10.2","80","12.125","16.7087338501292","221","19.26","15","0.42","0","8","7","41","1","52","13","2","1","6","55","64","1","21","1","0","20","2","12","0","0","2","8","0","13","24","7","8","7","13","5","0","0","2"
"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/10/29/health-reforms-could-help-calif-prison-spending/","Health Reforms Could Help Calif. Prison Spending","SACRAMENTO (AP) — California could gain tens of millions of dollars annually in federal reimbursements for prison health care under the nation’s new health law, state and federal officials said Tuesday.

The money would come from Medicaid reimbursements for inmates who are treated in outside hospitals. It would not help pay for health care within prisons.

A nationwide study of prison health care spending released by The Pew Charitable Trusts cites an estimate from California’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office that the state could save nearly $70 million annually.

The study assumes that California will take full advantage of a change in federal law that will make Medicaid coverage available to low-income childless adults, meaning more prisoners will be eligible. States can also get a higher reimbursement rate for newly enrolled inmates.

The federal court-appointed official who controls California’s prison medical system uses a more conservative projection of $40 million in savings. The state Department of Finance projects $20 million in additional annual reimbursements for inmates through Medi-Cal, which is California’s Medicaid program, and through California’s Low Income Health Program.

The lower estimates are partly because California already was seeking reimbursement for some inmates and because it is sending fewer inmates to outside hospitals. The state recently opened an $839 million medical facility in Stockton to treat seriously ill inmates.

The projected savings would be a fraction of the nearly $9 billion the state spends on the prison system, of which more than $2 billion goes for inmates’ medical, mental health and dental care.

The federal receiver’s office collected $37 million in Medicaid reimbursement last fiscal year under the current 50 percent reimbursement rate. It projects the state will collect $40 million during the current fiscal year, even as the rate for those newly enrolled in Medicaid temporarily increases to 100 percent under the nation’s new health insurance system.

“This is like new money coming into the state of California,” said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver. “We were getting zero reimbursement before.”

The legislative analyst’s higher estimate, used in the Pew report, dates from February and relies on 2-year-old data on inpatient costs. Aaron Edwards, one of the authors of the study, said it used the best available information at the time.

SACRAMENTO (AP) — Graduates struggling to repay private student loans could get a reprieve under legislation that passed the state Assembly on Thursday.

The bill from Assemblyman Bob Wieckowski, D-Fremont, would prevent private lenders from garnishing the wages of indebted former students.

Wieckowski said the creditors are allowed to withhold up to 25 percent of a delinquent borrower’s disposable income. Preventing such automatic withholding would encourage lenders to create manageable repayment plans for graduates, he said.

“The amount of private student loan debt is growing,” Wieckowski said. “It’s placed an inordinate burden on underemployed graduates.”

The bill, AB233, would not affect the government’s ability to tap wages for the repayment of federal student loans.

Supporters said the increasing burden of student loan debt, which cannot be eliminated during bankruptcy proceedings, endangers the state’s economy by limiting young adults’ ability to buy homes and make other investments.

Republican lawmakers who opposed the bill said it would be unfair to private lenders if the federal government could continue garnishing wages while private lenders cannot. The strategy is one method they use for ensuring debts get repaid.

Access to private loans could shrink as a result, opponents said.

“You may dry up the market of private loans being accessible in the future,” said Assemblywoman Shannon Grove, R-Bakersfield.

The legislation was sent to the Senate on a largely party-line, 50-22 vote. GOP lawmakers opposed it, along with Democratic Assemblyman Mike Gatto of Los Angeles.

Video Obtained by KCAL Raises Questions","LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — In the wake of sexual harassment lawsuits filed against city officials, two members of the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday called for a “thorough review” of the city’s training procedures.

One of those calling for the review is City Council President Herb Wesson.

KCAL9 Political Reporter Dave Bryan received a copy of a cell phone video recorded Tuesday evening at a fundraiser and re-election rally for council member Jose Huizar, who is currently being accused of sexual harassment and retaliation in a lawsuit filed by a former deputy chief of staff, Francine Godoy.

Huizar has admitted to having an extramarital affair with Godoy but denies ever harassing her. He called her allegations “false and malicious.”

Reporters were not allowed inside the Tuesday evening fundraiser for Huizar’s 2015 re-election campaign. The cell phone video was given to Bryan by a source who wished to remain anonymous.

And in the cell phone video obtained by Bryan, Wesson is heard effusively lauding Huizar. Wesson said, “Mr. Huizar is like my brother. My best friend on the council. I trust him with my life. … ”

Bryan said it is for this reason that Wesson asking for the review is raising concerns.

Scott Johnson, who writes the political blog Mayor Sam’s Sister City, said with last night’s comments, Wesson all but shredded any perception that he could remain impartial or objective.

“How can you take Council President Wesson seriously in his comments that he could be an impartial overseer of this investigation and he’s up there on stage backslapping the guy. It raises a lot of serious ethical questions here.”","2013-10-23 23:43:35","1","57.0","160.0","35.0","0.0","67.0","0.0","217.0","62.0","0.0","498.0","0.0","40.0","37","271","93.52","88.11","2.88","11.45","18.07","25.46","72.32","40.59","8.86","4.80","1.48","0.00","0.37","2.95","0.00","4.06","7.75","13.28","5.90","1.85","3.32","0.37","10.70","1.85","1.11","1.48","1.11","1.11","2.58","0.74","1.85","0.00","1.11","0.00","15.13","0.74","0.74","1.11","2.95","7.01","1.48","1.48","1.11","1.48","0.74","1.85","4.06","1.11","2.58","0.00","1.48","0.37","0.37","0.74","0.00","8.12","1.85","0.74","5.17","1.11","0.37","4.80","5.54","0.00","8.86","0.37","5.17","3.69","7.01","1.48","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.87","6.64","2.95","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.74","2.95","1.85","0.74","0.00","1323","8.27","18.4","402","271","17","63.8","11.0","8.3","12.0","10.6","66","11.625","18.101697416974172","171","17.27","5","0.41","0","8","3","26","0","34","17","0","1","3","53","46","0","9","0","0","10","5","7","0","0","1","3","0","4","13","8","8","1","11","1","3","0","1"

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — In the wake of sexual harassment lawsuits filed against city officials, two members of the Los Angeles City Council Wednesday called for a “thorough review” of city’s training procedures.

Council President Herb Wesson and Councilwoman Nury Martinez specifically want the city’s ethics, harassment and workplace violence procedures to be examine.

They introduced a motion calling for a report on the city’s training process to be brought back in 45 days.

The motion also proposes that training sessions be conducted “in person,” as opposed to over the Internet, which is currently allowed.

The call for re-examination comes less than a week after City Councilman Jose Huizar was hit with a sexual harassment lawsuit, but Wesson spokesman Ed Johnson said today’s motion was unrelated to any legal action.

Wesson felt that “now is a time for us to review all of these policies,” given that there are seven new council members, a new mayoral administration and new city commissioners, Johnson said.

Francine Godoy — Huizar’s former deputy chief of staff — filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the 12th District councilman last week. Huizar, who is married and running for re-election, admitted to a “consensual relationship” with Godoy, but denied ever harassing her.

Godoy claims Huizar offered to support her bid to run a community college board only if she had sex with him. The lawsuit alleges, when she refused, Huizar began yelling and cursing at her.

Meanwhile, Councilman Mitch Englander’s chief of staff is the target of a separate sexual harassment lawsuit filed in September by a former Englander field deputy.

The unnamed former employee accuses John Lee of subjecting her to repeated “inappropriate and offensive jokes and comments of a sexual nature” and denying her the opportunity to apply for a job as a public safety deputy.

Englander has said he was surprised by the lawsuit and that his office has a “system in place where any situation like this would immediately surface and be dealt with.”

Wesson and Martinez’s motion was referred to the Personnel and Animal Welfare Committee and still requires approval by the full City Council.

SACRAMENTO (AP) — California prison officials said Wednesday that they will change the rules for using pepper spray on mentally ill inmates, as a federal judge considers whether current practices violate inmates’ civil rights.

The corrections department will limit how much pepper spray can be used and how quickly, said spokeswoman Deborah Hoffman. The rules are still being written and would not apply to emergency situations.

The state’s announcement comes as U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton ordered corrections officials to publicly release videos that show prison guards pumping rounds of pepper spray into the cells of mentally disturbed inmates, some of whom begin shrieking or yelling for help.

The videos were shown during a hearing over the use of force against mentally ill inmates. The state’s own expert said in court documents that guards routinely use canisters of pepper spray the size of a fire extinguisher on unarmed inmates when a much smaller quantity could be used.

“Obviously, it’s our goal to use a minimal amount of force. Having it spelled out may help these situations stay more in control,” Hoffman said.

Michael Bien, one of the attorneys representing mentally ill inmates, praised the move but said it doesn’t go far enough.

“It’s a big step, and I think that it’s a significant admission that the department needed to reform,” he said.

However, the department is “kind of fine-tuning how they use pepper spray” instead if questioning whether “this the type of weapon they ought to be using or are there other ways to avoid use of force?”

The weekslong hearing grew out of Karlton’s decision in April to reject Gov. Jerry Brown’s effort to end court oversight of prison mental health treatment. In the course of contesting that move, Bien said attorneys representing mentally ill inmates discovered new problems.

A separate ongoing federal lawsuit challenges the state’s medical treatment of inmates. Both cases prompted federal judges to rule that overcrowding is the main source of inadequate care, forcing the state to greatly reduce its prison population.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Political activists today staged a “die-in” outside a federal building in downtown L.A. in protest of the deal to lift the debt ceiling.

Demonstrators wore black clothing and skull masks, carried black roses and held signs with slogans such as, “Cause of death: cuts to meal program.”

“We understand that Congress is about to increase the debt limit and end the government shutdown. But they’re only kicking the can down the road to January and February, and the problems may come up again then. We still have the problem of the sequester cuts,” one protestor told KNX1070’s Claudia Peschiutta.

Die-In Held In Downtown LA Over Debt Ceiling Lift The activist was referring to a plan unveiled today by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who announced plans to fund the federal government through January 15 and lift the debt limit through February 7, CBS News reports. People with disabilities are worried about losing federal aid, and consequently, their independence, Peschiutta said. “Will we have enough money to buy food? Pay our rent? Buy our medications? Or pay for our healthcare?” another protestor asked. The deal announced by Reid and McConnell was approved by the Senate and the House this evening.","2013-10-16 17:24:40","1","27.0","92.0","4.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","135.0","36.0","0.0","299.0","0.0","6.0","11","215","95.80","81.15","12.01","8.90","15.36","28.84","74.42","40.47","5.12","3.26","0.00","2.79","0.00","0.00","0.47","1.86","8.84","13.95","4.65","2.79","6.51","0.00","10.23","1.40","0.47","0.47","1.40","0.93","3.26","0.93","2.33","0.47","0.47","0.47","6.98","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.65","0.93","1.40","0.93","0.93","0.00","0.93","1.40","0.93","0.47","0.00","2.33","0.93","0.47","0.00","0.93","12.09","2.79","3.26","5.58","0.00","1.86","4.19","5.58","2.33","13.02","1.40","6.51","5.12","5.12","0.00","0.93","5.58","0.00","1.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.47","5.58","4.19","0.93","0.00","1.86","0.00","0.93","3.72","0.93","1.86","0.47","1052","8.08","19.727272727272727","315","211","15","65.62","10.8","7.6","12.52","10.3","50","5.714285714285714","17.11867298578199","149","17.73","9","0.39","0","12","3","20","0","22","11","0","0","2","35","45","0","12","0","0","4","4","5","0","0","1","7","0","10","10","3","3","5","2","0","1","0","0"
"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/10/18/doj-says-racial-policy-in-calif-prisons-breaks-law/","DOJ Says Racial Policy In Calif. Prisons Breaks Law","SACRAMENTO (AP) — California is violating the federal Constitution when it punishes prison inmates after a riot based on their race, the U.S. Department of Justice said Friday.

Gangs in California prisons typically are based on race, and riots often pit members of one race against one another or involve inmates of only one race.

After the riots, officers often lock inmates in their cells based on which races were involved to prevent further violence — whether or not those inmates were involved.

The Justice Department said in a court filing that the practice violates the 14th Amendment, which requires equal protection under the law. The opinion is not binding, but is part of an ongoing class-action lawsuit in federal court in Sacramento.

The policy “is not based on any individual analysis of prisoner behavior, but rather on generalized fears of racial violence. Indeed, the policy affects hundreds of prisoners throughout the (prison) system who the state acknowledges have absolutely no gang ties or history of violence,” according to the filing signed by the chiefs of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

The state could adopt race-neutral alternatives, the Justice Department said, including locking up specific inmates who it suspects were involved in the fight, or locking down entire housing units where the riot occurred.

It could also do a better job of gathering information in advance on which inmates are involved in gangs or are likely to engage in race-based violence and keep them separated.

Corrections department spokeswoman Terry Thornton said the state’s policy is not to base lockdowns “solely on the inmate’s race or ethnicity.” State law says the department “shall not target a specific racial or ethnic group unless it is necessary and narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest.”

The U.S. Justice Department contends that the policy is too broadly written to pass constitutional muster.

The lawsuit was filed in 2008 by Robert Mitchell after he was locked in his cell following a fight at High Desert State Prison in Susanville. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation imposes more than 600 lockdowns in a typical year, at least 200 of which are based on the race of the inmates, said Rebekah Evenson, whose nonprofit Prison Law Office represents Mitchell and other inmates.

No other state has a similar policy she said.

“They lock down people who were not involved in the incident, not involved in the gang and just happen to have the same color skin,” she said.

The policy is similar to another California practice that the U.S. Supreme Court found to be discriminatory nearly a decade ago, the practice of segregating inmates by race in their cells and sleeping areas to prevent gang violence.","2013-10-18 17:04:19","1","61.0","161.0","35.0","0.0","68.0","0.0","219.0","61.0","0.0","504.0","0.0","40.0","37","452","95.08","57.04","25.43","7.73","26.59","29.20","77.21","44.91","6.42","1.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.88","1.11","4.42","9.73","14.38","5.75","2.88","4.42","1.99","10.84","4.20","2.88","2.43","1.55","1.99","3.32","0.88","2.43","0.22","1.11","0.00","9.29","0.00","1.11","0.44","0.44","12.17","1.11","1.77","0.66","3.10","1.77","5.53","2.43","0.22","1.99","0.22","0.66","0.44","0.22","0.00","0.00","10.62","1.77","1.11","7.08","0.44","0.66","3.76","5.31","0.22","11.95","1.11","8.19","2.65","6.64","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.00","12.83","5.09","3.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.66","1.77","0.66","0.88","0.00","2260","8.47","30.533333333333335","709","451","20","48.54","14.1","12.1","13.18","14.3","106","10.2","20.441330376940137","229","26.67","8","0.43","0","16","7","50","0","56","27","2","1","3","76","49","1","28","0","0","9","4","21","1","0","3","10","0","13","16","10","18","8","19","4","3","1","2"

(Photo credit: U.S. Geological Survey)

TORRANCE (CBSLA.com) — A state lawmaker from Torrance wants Sacramento to boost funding to map active earthquake faults in an effort to prevent buildings from being constructed near dangerous faults.

The push by Sen. Ted W. Lieu to the Los Angeles Times came after a report earlier this month that at least 18 buildings were constructed on or near the Hollywood and Santa Monica faults over the last decade without extensive studies being conducted.

“Allowing buildings that house large numbers of people to be built on or near fault lines is not acceptable,” Lieu said in remarks reported by The Times.

According to the report, very few earthquake faults in California have been mapped over the past two decades since a series of budget cuts enacted in the early 1990s slowed the effort dramatically.

RELATED: Report: Calif. Quake Faults Mapping Has Slowed

Between 1974 and 1991, California aggressively mapped 534 earthquake faults, but since then, only 23 have been drawn, according to The Times.

Officials estimate about 300 more maps need to be drawn, including some in heavily populated areas in Southern California, to represent about 2,000 miles of faults statewide.

James Feathersone has been appointed as Acting Chief of the department effective Nov. 1, and Cummings is set to retire in February following a period of transition, according to the Mayor’s office.

Featherstone is a former LAFD captain and is currently head of the city’s Emergency Management Department, where he will return after a permanent chief is found, officials said.

“I thank Chief Cummings for his service to Los Angeles. My agenda for the Fire Department is focused on reducing response times, improving technology, to make sure we’re prepared for every emergency,” Mayor Garcetti said in a statement.

Garcetti publicly insists Cummings’ resignation was a mutually agreed upon decision.

“He’s a good man. I’ve decided to take a different direction, and that’s something we agreed upon mutually, then the last couple of days he’s been informed about it,” Garcetti told KNX1070’s Claudia Peschuitta.","2013-10-10 11:50:33","1","30.0","91.0","4.0","0.0","41.0","0.0","130.0","36.0","0.0","294.0","0.0","6.0","11","169","94.87","72.29","20.13","70.33","18.78","32.54","72.19","39.05","7.10","5.33","1.78","1.18","0.00","2.37","0.00","1.78","8.88","13.61","8.28","1.18","3.55","0.00","15.38","3.55","2.37","0.59","0.59","1.18","4.73","3.55","1.18","0.00","0.00","1.18","7.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.96","7.10","3.55","1.78","0.00","0.59","1.18","0.59","1.78","0.00","1.18","0.59","1.18","1.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.10","1.18","0.59","4.14","1.18","0.00","6.51","8.88","1.78","12.43","0.59","4.14","7.69","4.73","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.71","5.92","5.92","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.37","5.33","1.18","0.00","867","9.24","22.125","276","169","10","54.32","13.8","9.9","13.74","12.5","51","4.785714285714286","20.831005917159764","115","20.75","8","0.4","0","4","1","16","0","19","13","0","0","1","26","37","0","4","0","0","8","1","5","0","0","0","5","0","4","9","4","8","3","8","0","0","0","1"
"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/10/09/disney-parks-change-policy-that-allowed-disabled-guests-to-bypass-long-lines/","Disney Parks Change Policy That Allowed Disabled Guests To Bypass Long Lines","ANAHEIM (CBSLA.com) — Disney rolled out new guidelines Wednesday in an attempt to prevent what it describes as “growing abuse” of an earlier system that allowed disabled visitors and their families to bypass long lines at the park.

The changes were made to the Guest Assistance Card (GAC) program, which was reportedly exploited by guests who would hire a disabled “guide” to pose as a family member and allow their party to skip ahead in line at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park.

KNX 1070’s Mike Landa reports in some cases people paid $130 an hour for backdoor access to the park under the old system.

Disneyland Changing Passes For Disabled To Prevent Fraud Under the new program, disabled visitors who cannot tolerate long wait times will be asked to sign a form and be photographed for a new disability access service card. Cardholders will then visit one of three kiosks around the park and receive a time to return to the attraction based on current wait times. “It will have their picture on the pass so they won’t be able to sell it to somebody else and they’ll have to schedule a ride time to return to the attraction to ride, so there’s no real advantage of being able to ride quicker than anyone else,” said Todd Regan of the website MiceChat. Some parents of children with behavioral challenges object to the changes. “It’s important to me because Disney is so important to my son,” said Stacey Presley, whose son has autism. “It’s the only thing that really gets a smile on his face. And I want him to be able to enjoy the park.” “Our kids have had meltdowns under the old system where they were basically offered abilities to have very, very brief waits,” said Judy Mark, who together with Presley attempted to bring a petition opposing the new system with 40,000 signatures to Disneyland Wednesday. “And to say to these families now who have such a stressful life that this one thing has been taken away from us is absolutely abominable to me.” In a statement, Disney Parks President Meg Crofton said the program is being modified to serve those guests who “truly need it.” “Our new program is designed to provide the special experience our guests have come to expect from Disney and help us discourage growing abuse,” Crofton said. “We have long recognized and accommodated guests with varying needs and will continue to provide assistance that is responsive to their unique circumstances.” RELATED STORY: Disneyland, California Adventure Reportedly Mulling Changes To Special Needs Passes","2013-10-09 20:17:02","1","27.0","91.0","4.0","0.0","41.0","0.0","132.0","36.0","0.0","294.0","0.0","6.0","11","432","88.16","87.17","20.11","69.41","27.00","23.15","79.40","46.99","10.19","4.40","0.93","1.39","0.00","0.46","1.62","5.79","7.18","15.74","8.33","3.47","4.17","0.69","15.05","3.01","1.39","2.08","1.62","0.46","4.17","3.24","0.93","0.23","0.46","0.23","12.73","1.39","1.16","0.00","0.93","6.71","0.69","2.08","1.39","0.93","0.46","1.16","2.08","0.46","1.39","0.00","0.46","0.23","0.23","0.00","0.00","8.80","3.24","1.62","2.31","1.62","0.46","3.47","9.95","2.08","15.05","4.17","4.63","6.71","3.24","0.93","0.69","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","14.12","3.70","3.01","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.63","1.39","0.93","0.23","2030","8.13","36.416666666666664","621","430","16","61.09","13.0","11.4","11.32","15.0","86","16.166666666666668","20.76","250","31.33","7","0.45","0","11","7","37","0","35","29","2","0","5","52","51","0","27","1","0","16","9","16","0","0","1","34","0","34","15","6","16","11","10","4","6","1","1"

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Starbucks, known for its piping hot coffee, is throwing itself in the middle of yet another heated national debate.

The world’s biggest coffee chain said Thursday that it will ask customers and businesses to sign a petition calling for an end to the partial government shutdown that has forced hundreds of thousands of federal workers off the job.

The petition, which will be available at all Starbucks 11,000 U.S. locations to sign beginning Friday, calls for reopening the government, paying debts on time and passing a long-term budget deal by the end of the year. In addition to Starbucks customers, the company is trying to get the CEOs of the nation’s largest companies to sign.

The move is unusual for a company like Starbucks. While big brands generally steer clear of politics to avoid alienating customers, Starbucks and its outspoken CEO, Howard Schultz, in recent years have run toward the spotlight by trying to gain a voice in national political issues.

But because the company’s efforts are generally non-partisan and unlikely to cause controversy, marketing and corporate image experts say they burnish Starbucks’ reputation as a socially-conscious company.

“It’s always risky when brands mix politics and business,” said Allen Adamson, managing director of the New York-based branding firm Landor Associates. “But the benefit for Starbucks likely outweighs the risk.”

Last month, Schultz asked customers not to bring guns into Starbucks stores. In December of last year, the chain asked its employees to write “Come together” on cups to send a message to lawmakers about the damage being caused by the divisive negotiations over the “fiscal cliff,” a combination of tax and spending cuts that was scheduled to become effective Dec. 31, 2012.

And In 2011, Schultz asked other chief executives to join him in halting campaign contributions until politicians stopped their partisan bickering over the debt ceiling, which led to a downgrade in the country’s credit rating. The CEOs of more than 100 companies, from AOL to Zipcar, took the pledge. Also in 2011, Starbucks collected donations for a program to stimulate job growth.

On Wednesday, the company made headlines when it said it would give a free coffee to anyone in its stores who buys someone else’s order in a “pay it forward” gesture.

On Friday, Starbucks plans to post its petition to try to put an end to the partial government shutdown in the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today and the Wall Street Journal. It also will be in stores and available to print out.

“I believe that we will capture the voices of the American people,” Schultz said. “We want to send a powerful message to Washington.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles are feeling the effects of a voter-approved crackdown.

Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer says his office is in the process of shuttering 38 pot shops that do not comply with a recently approved municipal ballot measure.

The Los Angeles Times reports that Feuer promised Friday there will be more prosecutions to come.

Another 42 shops have decided to close since July, when Measure D took effect.

The law caps the number of nonprofit dispensaries at about 135. There were nearly 1,000 a few years ago.

The city struggled with how to regulate the budding industry until voters agreed to sharply reduce the number of shops, and tax those that were operating legally under state and local laws.

The exhibit was created by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the museum. The 60-minute experience, which includes multimedia presentations and displays, is narrated by Academy Award-nominated actress Hailee Steinfeld.

“Anne Frank never chose her fate, but destiny placed in her hands the memory of all the victims who perished,” said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. “Through her diary, so full of the innocence of a young child with unfulfilled dreams and hopes, we are left only to imagine what the world lost by the millions we never knew.”

"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/10/09/ann-romney-promotes-best-selling-cookbook-talks-politics/","Ann Romney Promotes Best-Selling Cookbook, Talks Politics","LA CAÑADA (CBSLA.com) — The wife of a former presidential candidate can now add best-selling author to her list of credits.

Ann Romney signed more than a hundred copies of her new best-selling cookbook at a La Cañada bookstore Wednesday.

Nearly a year after her husband lost the 2012 presidential election, fans came to see the mother of five and grandmother to 22, who is promoting “The Romney Family Table,” a New York Times best-seller.

“The boys think I’m a pretty good cook and I thought ‘gee, that sounds like fun’ having no idea how much work it could be,” Romney told KCAL9’s Andrea Fujii.

Romney said the book shows how cooking for a large family and being Mitt’s wife could be a tough job.

The cookbook, which includes a recipe for “Mitt’s Meatloaf” is “a real reflection of what it was like and how difficult it is at times when I have a husband that’s really busy,” Romney said.

The former first lady of Massachusetts said being out of the political limelight is better for their personal lives, but argues the country is worse off.

“There’s times when you look and scratch your head and say oh, if only,” she said.

With the government shutdown nearing two weeks and Congress at an impasse over raising the debt ceiling, Ann Romney said her husband would have worked across the aisle as he did when he was governor.

“They worked things out, they didn’t stop talking,” Romney said. “They didn’t shut down the state, they worked things out. And I think Americans are frustrated right now.”

Some argue Mitt Romney predicted the current political crisis. During the election, Romney warned that the country could face a shutdown or default if President Obama was reelected.

“I think we’re now seeing that he was right and a lot of people are saying ‘oh my gosh look, everything he said has happened’,” Ann Romney said.

Politics aside, the fans who came to her booksigning said they were there to support her.

“I think she just represents good American values that we don’t seem to have,” said fan Jim Frasco.

“A woman that can raise five boys, automatically I’m a big fan of that,” said Summer Cacciagioli.

For now, Ann said she and Mitt are focused on their family and will continue to be beyond 2016.

Stretching between the gorgeous Gulf of Mexico and serene Sarasota Bay, these keys attract many visitors who come to enjoy the average year-round temperature of 73 degrees. The area is appreciated by wildlife as well, so these waters are home to manatee, dolphins, and fish, while pelicans, osprey, and a variety of shorebirds find sanctuary here. Tennis and golf enthusiasts will find first-class facilities here, and there are several parks on the Keys to visit for a relaxing afternoon.

Longboat Key, Florida is a 10.5-mile-long island on the Gulf Coast near Sarasota and Bradenton.

Whether you like to spend your time shelling, biking, shopping, fishing, golfing, or dining, opportunities for these activities are boundless on Longboat Key, Lido Key, and St. Armands Key. Well known as private island paradises, there are accommodations here to suit everyone, from deluxe suites in plush resorts and condominiums to beachfront cottages and modest hotel rooms.

The Longboat Key Center for the Arts, with a permanent collection and changing exhibits of juried and invitational shows, hosts art classes, workshops, and cultural events here on Longboat Key. Sarasota's many cultural centers are only minutes away over the south bridge, including Van Wezel Performing Arts Center, Asolo Theater, Ringling Museum, Sarasota Ballet and Opera, and several other live theaters.

You'll find terrific shopping on Longboat Key, and St. Armands Key. Anna Maria Island and Bradenton, over the north bridge, both also offer a variety of shopping, theater, and cultural experiences.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/destinations/florida/tallahassee/os-fla-destinations-tallahassee-081113-20130810-column.html","Tallahassee: A window on history","Even a tourist knows that Florida's official nickname is ""The Sunshine State,"" but the identity of the state pie (Key lime) and state wildflower (Coreopsis) is perhaps not-so-common knowledge.

Such minutiae can be found on the walls of Florida's Capitol, a 22-story building that makes an appropriate centerpiece and starting point for a historically minded Tallahassee day trip. It's one of only four state capitols in the United States to use a tower design, a list that includes Louisiana, Nebraska and North Dakota.

Opened in 1978, the tower sits behind the ""Old Capitol,"" restored to its 1902 appearance, on North Monroe Street. For first-time visitors, the historic building is an eye-catching landmark that's handy for navigation in congested downtown traffic caused by activities at state offices, Florida State University and Florida A&M University.

Expect any motorist hesitation to look for addresses to be greeted by impatient horn-tooting. Fortunately, a convenient garage for the Museum of Florida History (500 S. Bronough St.) offers free parking for museum visitors only two blocks from the Capitol.

Allow several hours to tour the museum (museumoffloridahistory.com). It's a free attraction that traces the state's history from giant mastodons to Spanish explorers, Seminole tribes and Civil War battles to the birth of the tourism industry in the wake of industrialist Henry Flagler's arrival in the early 20th century.

It won't take as long to cover the Capitol, but it's worth a visit. In addition to the state trivia on the fifth-floor walls, a self-guided tour (also free) offers a look at the Senate and House chambers as well as a bird's-eye view of Tallahassee landmarks such as FSU's Doak Campbell Stadium from an observation deck on the 22nd floor.

Reluctant to surrender my parking spot, I opted to walk 10 blocks north on Monroe for a quick lunch at Dog Et Al (dogetal.com), a sandwich shop that boasts of its 10,230 ways to fix a hot dog. That math seems fuzzy to me, but the restaurant makes a tasty Italian sausage.

It's a short drive from the museum to Railroad Square Art Park, a circle of pedestrian-friendly galleries and vintage shops. The Other Side Vintage (theothersidevintage.com) is a good spot to find stuff you didn't know you couldn't live without.","2013-08-10 00:00:00","0","16.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","24.0","2.0","37.0","18.0","0.0","79.0","4.0","15.0","0","389","98.26","45.89","27.88","39.56","22.88","24.42","69.92","39.85","5.40","1.29","0.77","0.00","0.51","0.00","0.00","4.11","11.83","14.65","3.86","2.57","4.11","1.29","8.48","3.86","1.03","0.00","3.08","0.51","3.60","2.06","1.29","0.77","0.51","0.00","2.31","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","6.43","1.80","1.29","0.51","1.29","0.00","1.80","3.08","2.31","0.00","0.51","2.83","0.77","0.51","0.00","1.54","3.60","0.77","0.26","1.54","0.51","0.51","0.51","6.68","0.51","13.62","1.54","8.23","3.60","1.54","2.57","0.51","1.54","0.00","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","20.82","5.14","4.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.57","1.03","3.60","3.60","0.26","1839","8.81","26.866666666666667","578","374","18","58.82","13.1","10.2","12.71","13.3","98","13.25","20.801283422459893","246","24.33","5","0.41","0","10","11","46","0","44","35","1","0","1","80","58","1","19","0","0","9","3","14","0","0","0","15","0","11","9","4","4","4","19","5","0","0","0"

Think again. Right here in Florida there is plenty to intrigue history buffs. Here are five Florida historic sites arranged alphabetically by site name that open windows to the past:

-- Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, St. Augustine  A stone and mortar fortress, the Castillo de San Marcos was begun in Spanish St. Augustine to protect St. Augustine against pirate attacks and raids in 1672. An excellent example of ""bastion architecture,"" it is the oldest masonry and only extant 17th century fortress in North America and covers 20.5 acres. Castillo de San Marcos offers a variety of events and activities including living history and weapons demonstrations throughout the year and it is under the direction of the National Park Service. Entrance fee is $7 (children under 16 years of age are free). For information, visit www.nps.gov/casa.

-- Fort Clinch, Amelia Island  In the 19th century the United States took control of Amelia Island and Fernandina Beach and construction of Fort Clinch began in 1847. Named for General Duncan Lamont Finch, a veteran of the Seminole and Mexican Wars, the fort was occupied during the Civil War by the Confederate troops but evacuated in 1862 under orders from Robert E. Lee as Lee felt he could not hold the fort against Union attack and the fort came under Union control. It was used again during the Spanish-American War in 1898. The fort is part of the Florida Park System since 1935 and boasts sandy beaches, a six-mile biking/hiking trail, nature trails for self-guided tours to observe wildlife and view plants, campsites and a state museum. Daily tours with period re-enactors are featured. Admission fees are $6 per vehicle (2-8 people); $4 for single occupant vehicle; $2 per person for pedestrians, bicyclists, extra passengers, passengers in a vehicle with holder of an annual individual entrance pass. Fort admission fee is $2 per person. Visit www.floridastateparks.org/fortclinch.

-- Fort Matanzas National Monument, St. Augustine  During the colonial era, Fort Matanzas guarded St. Augustine's southern river approach. It is located 15 miles south of the Old City and is a reminder of the Spanish empire's presence in Florida. Cannon firings, musket demonstrations and other living history events are featured. There are no admission fees for the park nor for the 36-passenger ferry that takes to the park (it operates on a first-come/first served basis). Donations are gratefully accepted and used for the maintenance and upkeep of the fort. Visit www.nps.gov/foma.

-- Mission of Nombre de Dios and Shrine of Our Lady of La Leche, St. Augustine  Think you have to travel to California to see Spanish missions? Nope. We have some right here in Florida. The Mission of Nombre de Dios traces its origins to the founding of St. Augustine America's oldest city  in 1565. The mission stands on the spot where Spanish explorer Pedro Menendez de Aviles knelt and kissed a cross given to him by Father Francisco Lopez de Mendoza Grajales, his expedition's chaplain. At this spot, the chaplain would celebrate the first Mass, the mission would be built and the Spanish settlers would begin the devotion of Our Lady of La Leche, which continues centuries later to the present time. Mission highlights include The Great Cross made of stainless steel and rising 208 feet over the Mission and the marshes of the Matanzas River. There is no admission fee; donations are encouraged. The mission is at 27 Ocean Avenue. Visit www.missionandshrine.org.

-- Mission San Luis, Tallahassee  Another historic Spanish Florida mission is Mission San Luis, a living history village and national landmark in Tallahassee that recreates a community where Apalachee Indians and newcomers from Spain live in close proximity drawn together by religion and economic and military purposes. Visitors can see the plaza where Apalachee Indians played traditional ball games, the council house, the most important structure in the Apalachee village, as well as the Spanish deputy governor's house and the church built under the direction of Franciscans. A visitor's center features art and artifacts from colonial times. The mission has a busy special events calendar each month including colonial crafts sessions for children, black powder musket demonstrations and historic gardening tours. Admission is $5 for adults, $2 for children. The mission is at 2100 West Tennessee Street.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/traffic/os-sunrail-seminole-spur-20130419-story.html","Seminole officials hope to extend SunRail to Sanford airport","SunRail commuter trains won't start running through the Orlando area for at least another year, but already some Seminole County officials envision extending the system to Orlando Sanford International Airport.

That would mean a traveler could someday board a northbound SunRail train in downtown Orlando, switch trains in Sanford and head to the airport to catch a flight.

""This is something that is very doable,"" said Seminole County Commission Chairman Bob Dallari.

The potential link between the main north-south SunRail line and the airport is an 11-mile spur. The spur, currently used by freight trains, runs from the Sanford SunRail station now under construction to the airport and then to Winter Springs.

But several things would have to happen before trains could go to the airport, and turning the idea into a reality could take years, if not decades.

The state Department of Transportation would have to buy the spur from CSX. In 2007, when the state purchased from CSX more than 61 miles of tracks from DeLand to Poinciana for SunRail, the contract also gave DOT a 30-year option to buy the spur for $10. The 4-mile portion of track between Sanford and the airport also would have to be upgraded to handle passenger trains.

""Once you own it, you have to maintain it, and that's where you're talking about a considerable amount of money,"" said Steve Olson, a DOT spokesman. ""If you run passenger service on those tracks, it has to meet standards, and those are standards that are higher than for freight trains.""

So far there are no cost estimates, and any decision to extend the line would also depend on the success of SunRail and how many passengers would be willing to take a train to the airport, Seminole officials say. Lynx used to run buses to the Sanford airport, but the service was canceled several years ago for lack of riders.

The $1.2 billion SunRail train system is set to start running in May 2014. The first 31-mile segment will run from DeBary to south Orange County. The second phase is scheduled to open in 2016 and add DeLand to the north and Poinciana in Osceola County to the south.

Larry Dale, president and chief executive officer of Orlando Sanford International Airport, said a train would help draw air passengers and become an important component of the region's growing transportation network.

""It's something that we've got to get the powers that be to make happen,"" Dale said. ""It has to be a coordinated effort by the county and the state.""

The Sanford airport served about 1.8 million passengers in 2012. It largely accommodates charter flights and Allegiant Air, a low-cost carrier that flies to more than three dozen cities from Sanford. By comparison, Orlando International Airport handled more than 35 million passengers last year and has more than 40 airlines.

OIA does not have a train connection, but buses are expected to transport passengers between the airport and the SunRail station near Sand Lake Road and Orange Avenue. In addition, All Aboard Florida, a Coral Gables company, wants to build a train linking South Florida to the Orlando airport within three years.

Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett said a train to Orlando Sanford International would be a boon not only for Sanford but for the region as a whole by giving tourists another transportation option.

""And I think that would really boost ridership for SunRail but also help in taking cars off the road,"" Triplett said. ""The airport already has a huge rental-car business.""

In coming months, Seminole County and Sanford plan to launch a study of development around the SunRail station. The study could look at the feasibility of train service to the airport, including the cost to upgrade the tracks for commuter trains and the number of passengers needed to make it work, county officials said.

""It has the potential to offer economic-development opportunities for the community, so it certainly bears a second look,"" said Nicole Guillet, Seminole's director of growth management.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/os-redistricting-secrets-could-get-aired-out-in-court-20130531-post.html","Judge finds GOP consultants in contempt over redistricting-records fight","TALLAHASSEE -- A Leon County judge has held three prominent Republican consultants in contempt for not handing over thousands of pages of private records detailing their work in last year's contentious redistricting fight.

Leon County Judge Terry Lewis had ordered Gainesville-based Data Targeting Inc. along with employees Pat Bainter, Matt Mitchell, and Michael Sheehan to produce the records last year in an ongoing legal battle between voting-rights groups that backed the 2010 Fair Districts reforms and the GOP-controlled Legislature.

The groups, including the League of Women Voters, have alleged in two separate lawsuits winding their way through the courts that the state Senate and congressional maps were still drawn to help Republicans hold onto their majorities, and the records they are seeking from Data Targeting will help make their case.

But lawyers for the company have called the efforts a ""fishing expedition.""

This week, the company handed over more than 1,800 pages of records, but filed a motion in Leon County Circuit Court on Thursday to keep them protected from public disclosure because they are ""trade secrets"" -- involving datasets and analyses of how legislative maps might perform in elections.

Because the political consultants aren't parties in the litigation, Bainter's lawyer argues the attempts to get them to hand over records is ""intrusive, unconstitutional, burdensome and wholly irrelevant discovery in this case.""

On Friday, Judge Lewis ordered the two sides to sit down with a another judge in private next week and start going over the records to decide whether any or all will be released to the plaintiffs.

Data Targeting lawyer Kent Safriet had argued the records in question pertained to internal discussions about how individual candidates would fare in elections if different drafts of new districts were ultimately approved -- but not communication between lawmakers and consultants, which could have influenced which maps were adopted.

""These communications between other non-legislative parties are not relevant,"" Safriet said.

Data Targeting worked closely with former Senate President Mike Haridopolos, who is a party to the lawsuit, the Republican Party of Florida, other consultants and GOP legislative candidates statewide whose districts were re-drawn last year. The lawsuits contend that GOP lawmakers still violated the 2010 Fair Districts constitutional amendments by gerrymandering districts to help Republicans and hurt Democrats.

The firm has already turned over some email of its communication with legislators and their staff -- another 166 pages this week -- but the plaintiffs in the case have issued subpoenas for internal communication and the judge in the case ordered them produced eight months ago.

""We're disappointed in so far as we believe the documents should have been produced immediately,"" Fair Districts lawyer Adam Schachter said after the hearing, in which he unsuccessfully argued for all the records to be immediately released.

""It's our belief these paid political consultants were working with the Legislature to draw the maps that became law. And we believe those maps violate the constitution.""

The fight has produced some vivid examples of behind-the-scenes politics, shown legislative staff working with political consultants, and captured Fair Districts groups themselves drawing intentionally gerrymandered maps -- although they claim they were doing so to prove a point, while the GOP-controlled Legislature was passing theirs into law.

The contempt order means the Bainter and his company will have to pay the legal bills for the eight-month fight to get the records, which Schachter estimated to be ""many thousands of dollars.""

Also Friday, the Legislature filed a new brief arguing that the Fair Districts backers were just as guilty of gerrymandering, what's known as a ""clean hands"" defense based on the records showing Fair Districts organizers working with Democratic consultants to draw proposed maps that favored Democratic congressional members such as Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston.

The Leon County lawsuit is slated to go to trial in August, although the Florida Supreme Court is still weighing whether to allow the challenge of the Senate districts to move forward. Last week, a divided appeals court ruled that legislators couldn't be put under oath in that case.","2013-05-31 06:21:00","0","23.0","5.0","3.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","39.0","20.0","0.0","74.0","4.0","15.0","0","677","93.12","76.54","25.96","15.40","30.77","31.76","74.45","41.95","6.94","2.95","0.00","0.59","0.00","0.30","2.07","3.99","8.57","13.59","6.35","2.36","5.47","0.74","11.08","3.84","1.33","1.62","1.77","1.77","4.58","1.92","2.66","0.15","1.77","0.44","10.19","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.30","8.71","1.92","2.36","0.74","1.03","0.59","2.81","1.18","0.30","0.44","0.44","0.44","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.15","11.52","2.95","1.33","7.09","0.44","0.30","3.40","5.47","0.74","13.44","1.33","7.68","4.73","7.53","0.74","0.00","0.74","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.03","3.25","4.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.25","2.36","1.03","0.00","0.00","3616","8.84","34.2","1063","666","22","40.72","15.3","15.1","15.91","20.2","156","12.5","23.48936936936937","349","31.1","7","0.4","0","20","10","70","0","79","50","1","0","7","63","79","8","78","1","0","14","8","22","0","0","3","22","0","29","31","20","31","15","11","7","2","1","2"
"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-bank-deposits-market-share-race-20131008-story.html","SunTrust wins latest deposit race, but Old Florida surges in ranks","In Central Florida's latest money-in-the-bank score card, an Orlando bank run by a father-and-son team has surged into first place among the locally based community banks, regulatory figures show.

Fast-growing Old Florida National Bank, headquartered in downtown Orlando, became the No. 1 locally based bank by deposit market share as of June 30, propelled by a 30 percent year-over-year jump in customer deposits, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported.

The bank is led by Chief Executive Officer John Burden and his father, Randy O. Burden, chairman of the board and veteran local banking entrepreneur. The elder Burden headed a group of investors that acquired control of Old Florida's predecessor — Orlando National Bank — and renamed it in 2009.

During the past year, Old Florida's deposits grew at a faster pace than any of the 25 largest banks operating in Central Florida, moving it into 10th place overall with total deposits of more than $640 million.

Including all 59 banks operating in Central Florida, customer deposits increased to $53.5 billion, up 3.5 percent from June 30, 2012.

SunTrust Banks Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co., which typically dominate the region's deposit market share, finished first, second and third, respectively.

Together, the top three now have deposits of more than $31 billion – or nearly 60 percent of the six-county market, including Orange, Seminole, Lake, Osceola, Volusia and Brevard counties, according to the FDIC. Compared with 2012, their combined deposits rose 3.2 percent, though rivals such as JPMorgan Chase and big community banks such as Old Florida grew at a faster pace.

With customer deposits of $11.3 billion, SunTrust led the latest horse race – a position it has held for much of the past decade or so. SunTrust's deposits slipped 0.4 percent over the year as the Atlanta-based bank closed 10 branches across Central Florida, figures show.

Despite its slight decrease in deposits, SunTrust would consider its deposit performance a success, said Stanley D. Smith, a banking specialist and finance professor at the University of Central Florida.

""From the bank's point of view this is great,"" he said. ""They increased the average deposits per office from $95.2 million to $103.5 million, an increase of 8.7 percent. In other words, they kept most of their deposits while cutting back 10 of their less productive offices.""

Smith said many banks are reducing their number of branches as more customers use features such as online banking and smart phone check deposits.

Bank of America also has shuttered local branches – three closed since June 2012 – but BofA boosted its customer deposits by 8.3 percent to more than $10.1 billion, according to the data. That moved BofA into second place past Wells Fargo, which closed two local branches over the year, but increased its deposits 2.5 percent to $9.8 billion.

In fourth place, JPMorgan Chase Bank ($2.95 billion) posted the highest year-over-year rate of deposit growth among the region's largest banks (20 percent).

The FDIC releases the deposit market share data once a year, pulling back the curtain on deposit market share figures that banks otherwise hold close to the vest.

Experts follow the numbers closely because it is one of the few publicly available measures for how banks are reaching and retaining customers at a local level.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/arts-and-theater/os-edyth-bush-charitable-foundation-20130625-story.html","Congratulations to Edyth Bush foundation on 40 years of philanthropy","Congratulations to the Edyth Bush Charitable Foundation, which this month is celebrating a major milestone — 40 years of making Central Florida a better place to live through its philanthropy. Throughout the last four decades, the Edyth Bush Charitable Foundation has awarded more than 3,165 grants to 790 nonprofit organizations totaling more than $100 million in funding, making a positive impact on the lives of countless individuals.

Certainly, our local arts organizations have benefited. Just one major example: The foundation sponsored the entire season of the Orlando Repertory Theatre this year — one of the Rep's main theaters is named in Mrs. Bush's honor.

The foundation also has provided support to the Crealde School and the Albin Polasek Musuem and Sculpture Gardens, among other organizations.

This spring, the Edyth Bush Charitable Foundation introduced a $5,000 ""Art of Philanthropy"" purchase award at the annual Winter Park Sidewalk Art Festival. The winning piece hangs in the foundation's offices.

In 2011, the foundation helped bring famed violinist Midori to Orlando to play in a concert presented by the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra.

But it's not just arts groups supported by the foundation. It also has made philanthropic investments in Nemours Children's Hospital, Guardian Care Nursing Home, Heart of Florida United Way, Parramore Kidz Zone and Christian Service Center, among numerous others.

To read how the foundation has affected grant recipients and community partners, check out the foundation's website, http://www.edythbush.org.

Mrs. Edyth Bush, who died in 1972, was responsible for the formation of the foundation, which began providing grants a year later. The foundation's mission has remained: Creating innovative civic solutions that help people help themselves.

Since its creation, the foundation has been enriched by the Richard J. Conlee Fund and the H. Clifford Lee Fund. Though it does not actively solicit outside donations, the foundation will work with philanthropists to achieve their charitable goals.

Board members are Gerald F. Hilbrich, chairman; Herbert W. Holm, vice chairman; David A. Odahowski, president; Matthew W. Certo; Elizabeth Dvorak; Deborah C.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/ct-ott-0118-brandy-20130117-story.html","Another chance for Brandy","It's OK if you call it a comeback: Until recently, Brandy Norwood, teen R&B sensation and former star of the beloved '90s sitcom ""Moesha,"" had been having a rough couple of years. There was the death of her mentor Whitney Houston, a fatal car accident (Norwood's car struck another on a Los Angeles freeway; the driver died), a painful breakup and album sales that consistently disappointed.

But Brandy's new album, ""Two Eleven,"" debuted in the Billboard top five, she got engaged over the holidays to record industry executive Ryan Press and she appears in both the upcoming Tyler Perry film ""Temptation"" and the BET show ""The Game.""

In a recent phone interview, the singer, 33, who plays the Venue at Horseshoe Casino on Saturday night in a show to benefit the anti-violence group Project HOOD, discussed her engagement, her struggle with depression and her semisecret life as rapper Bran'Nu, who appeared on a '09 Timbaland disc and was never really heard from again. Here is an edited transcript of the conversation.

Q: Congratulations on your engagement. Was it a surprise?

A: Oh, yeah. You have your moments where you think it's going to happen, but the imagination does the real moment no justice. Even if you're expecting it, you're still surprised.

Q: Between this and the album doing well — I don't want to call it a comeback, but are you calling it a comeback?

A: I don't feel disrespected if you call it a comeback. I know I've been gone for a while. I was trying to get myself together and figure my way. Now I'm in a place where I feel connected to my fan base again and really feeling these amazing emotions of doing what I was born to do and doing it full time. It's a great feeling.

I do call it a comeback, I'm gonna be honest with you. … When you feel like you don't have your purpose intact, you can get off balance. But it wasn't about proving myself to one particular person, it was about proving it to me. Once you prove it to yourself, proving it to everyone else is easy.

Q: What made you doubt yourself?

A: I think different struggles in your life, not knowing how to deal with certain things that have happened in my life. Painful moments in your life can cause you to go into a state of depression where you don't believe that you deserve anything good in your life.

You forget what you were created for. I was not only created to sing and share but also to be a mom and a friend and a daughter.

All these people in your life, to have (lost) that connection with everyone around me, including my fans, it was tough. But after a while I just got tired of feeling like that.

Q: Did you feel as if this album was your last chance?

A: I did. What you believe is what you manifest, so it's kind of dangerous to believe something like that. But for me it was a good belief, because I was able to push myself to give 150 million percent. … When you feel like these are the last songs you're gonna sing, you want to make them the best songs you've ever sung.

Q: You had talked about possibly rapping on this album. Did you think the better of it?

A: It seems like I'm the only one who believes in my rap (abilities). I'm not as confident in my sharing that side of me with everybody. I tried it; people responded the way they responded. I don't think people really want to hear me rap. They just want to hear me sing.

Q: Do you feel like people expect you to be nice, polite Brandy who was on ""Moesha""? How much can you break out of that box?

A: I think I'm already out of the box of being this perfect little angel. I mean, if you Google me, there's a whole bunch of stuff that comes up.

Q: Did you get a lot of push-back from fans about your collaboration with Chris Brown on the ""Two Eleven"" hit ""Put It Down""?

A: People pretty much accept it, what we did. When something is good, of course, people have to have their opinions about it and judgments, but they start to accept it. …

There's things we've all done that we haven't been proud of, or things that if we could turn back the hands of time, we would probably do a little bit different. I'm in no position to judge anyone, and neither is anybody else. … Even though a person has a past or whatever, that shouldn't hinder you from working with people that can make a great song. That's just silly. Especially when the person is really trying to change and get better.

Q: ""Two Eleven"" refers to both your birthday and the day Whitney Houston died. What do you think of when you think of her now?

A: I definitely think of good times. I think of things she's taught me, shared with me. She was a phenomenal lady that shared so much of her life, her talent and her time. She went through her own struggles and trying to pull out of that. There's so many layers, so much inspiration to her life, so much people can learn from her. … She is the bar, you know? There will never be another.

Q: Who comes close to her these days?

A: I don't think anyone comes close to Whitney. That's a disrespectful thought. I'm not saying you're being (disrespectful), I'm saying for me (to say it). …

Artists like Frank Ocean or Bruno Mars, they don't come around every day. … That's the type of artist that Whitney was. But to compare her voice? I can't do that. I would have to put myself on a timeout if I did that.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/la-ca-jc-matt-apuzzo-adam-goldman-20131027-story.html","'Enemies Within' sheds light on NYPD's secret spying campaign","What with taking off our shoes and belts at airports, discovering the feds are hoovering up all our phone records, and watching drone strikes and SEAL raids around the globe, it's sometimes easy to forget that America has escaped the horror of another mass casualty terrorist attack in the dozen years since Sept. 11, 2001.

Other than blind luck, it's an open question whether that success is because of aggressive law enforcement at home, muscular intelligence ops overseas, or the inescapable fact that most terrorists, like most criminals, are fairly dimwitted and thus get caught.

Indeed, the vast majority of people now imprisoned on terrorism charges are young, wannabe Bin Ladens who were handed phony bombs by government informants and then arrested in carefully controlled sting operations.

The plots that could have been the most deadly, including the ""underwear"" bomb aboard a jet to Detroit in December 2009, and the massive car bomb left in New York's Times Square in May 2010, were foiled because the devices fizzled, not because the FBI or CIA detected or disrupted the plans.

That makes a deep dive into the strange case of Najibullah Zazi all the more useful. Zazi, of course, was the former New York coffee-and-Danish street cart owner who flew to Pakistan with two friends, got themselves into an Al Qaeda training camp for suicide bombers, and came home determined to blow up three New York subway trains in 2009.

His case was instructive not just because he and his confederates were caught — thanks to a combination of blind luck, smart police work and bumbling terrorists — but because it helped expose a bizarre piece of America's post-9/11 terror-scape: the New York Police Department as rogue spy service.

Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman, two investigative reporters for the Associated Press, shared the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for exposing the NYPD's clandestine spying campaign on American Muslims. In ""Enemies Within,"" they have expanded that seminal work and woven it with a police procedural on the Zazi case. It's an uneven mashup, but it's worth the effort.

The Zazi chapters read like a taut thriller, full of car chases, secret surveillance and cop screw-ups. It pits a series of hard-headed, foul-mouthed G-men and other state and federal counterintelligence types against three mooks from Queens who managed to do what the CIA evidently has not: get in to meet some of Al Qaeda's top operatives in Pakistan.

Luckily when he gets home, Zazi sends an email to an Al Qaeda drop box about his wedding plans. U.S. intelligence grabs the email, and the feds soon decide he wants to blow up New York. A cross-country chase and much mayhem ensues. But when Zazi spots his surveillance and flushes his bomb-making chemicals down the toilet, the FBI can't prove much of anything. Then Zazi decides he's smarter than they are and offers to come in to talk. He ultimately confesses.

Perhaps that's the real surprise. Despite the perception that suspects clam up under police questioning, most talk even after they are told they have the right to remain silent. Terrorists, it turns out, are even more likely to sing. Once his plot was foiled, confessing was Zazi's chance at glory.

The narrative slows when the authors shift to the NYPD intelligence unit. The authors make a convincing case that like Zazi, New York's finest became self-radicalized after 9/11. They ""saw terrorists everywhere. The middle class and the unemployed. The aimless and the ambitious. Criminals and college students. Longtime American citizens and new arrivals. Anyone.""

The result was the Demographics Unit. Led by a former CIA officer, it sent plainclothes cops dubbed ""rakers"" into coffee shops, bookstores and halal butchers. They recruited informants, tracked who watched Al Jazeera, recorded lectures and sermons, infiltrated college Muslim study groups. Mosques were treated as terrorist fronts.

It was all of dubious utility and legality given the focus on protected political speech and religious beliefs rather than unlawful activity. Even the cops knew it. They had a running joke: ""This is Intel. We don't make cases. We make overtime.""

It's hard to argue that authorities shouldn't try to identify terrorists before they act rather than just after. That leaves the authors in a quandary. They are understandably outraged that the NYPD was ""secretly assessing the religious and political views of US citizens ... and viewed activities protected by the First Amendment as precursors to terrorism.""

But they are equally outraged that the NYPD intelligence division — which now has an annual budget of $60 million and 600 officers — wasn't very good. It failed to identify Zazi, the Times Square bomber, or other New Yorkers who contacted Al Qaeda and were bent on murderous schemes.

""Was any of it illegal? We don't know,"" they admit. Nor do we, but ""Enemies Within"" is asking the right questions.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/la-et-ct-box-office-one-direction-getaway-gomez-20130829-story.html","On slow Labor Day weekend, tweens will turn out for One Direction","The boy band One Direction is headed straight to the top of the box office over Labor Day weekend, thanks to throngs of overzealous teenage girls.

""One Direction: This Is Us,"" a 3-D concert documentary about the mega-popular British group, is set to rule at the multiplex, likely debuting with a robust $22 million over the four-day long weekend, according to those who have seen pre-release audience surveys.

But another tween icon, Selena Gomez, won't have cause to celebrate during the holiday. The former Disney Channel star's new action film ""Getaway,"" co-starring Ethan Hawke, is poised to open with a dismal $6 million.

ON LOCATION: Where the cameras roll

Meanwhile, ""The Butler,"" the civil rights drama that has been No. 1 since opening in mid-August, will inch closer to the $100-million milestone. Heading into the weekend, Lee Daniels' film has already grossed more than $55 million and should take in another $15 million this long weekend.

""This Is Us"" follows Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik and Liam Payne as they embark on a 150-date world tour. The $10-million production, which is being released by Sony Pictures' TriStar label, was directed by Oscar-nominated documentarian Morgan Spurlock. ""This Is Us"" will be the filmmaker's highest-grossing picture to date, as 2004's ""Super Size Me"" -- in which Spurlock ate nothing but McDonald's for 30 days straight -- collected $11.5 million.

""This Is Us"" is the latest in a string of concert documentaries to hit theaters in recent years. The most successful has been ""Justin Bieber: Never Say Never,"" which made nearly $100 million worldwide in 2011. Last summer's ""Katy Perry: Part of Me"" didn't fare as well, grossing $32.4 million globally. Both the Bieber and Perry docs were Paramount releases.

PHOTOS: Hollywood Backlot moments

The One Direction flick will probably end up somewhere between the Bieber and Perry movies, as the band is riding a wave of popularity in the U.S. This month, they performed four sold-out concerts at Staples Center, and hundreds of fans stormed a movie theater at the Grove after being shut out of an advance ""This Is Us"" screening.

Gomez, however, is still struggling to prove she is a box office draw. The provocative indie ""Spring Breakers,"" in which the 21-year-old was one of four lead actresses, performed respectably earlier this year. But her teen-aimed romantic comedy ""Monte Carlo"" grossed only $40 million worldwide in 2011.

Co-star Hawke has had a better run as of late, coming off the critically beloved “Before Midnight” and surprise box office hit ""The Purge,"" the low-budget horror film that raked in $84 million in global sales in June. Unfortunately, his good run will end with the poorly reviewed ""Getaway,"" which on Thursday had notched a 0% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In the movie, Hawke plays a man trying to rescue his kidnapped wife and finds an unlikely partner a young, tech-adept teen (Gomez).

The movie was produced for $18 million by Dark Castle Entertainment and is the last picture from Joel Silver's company to be released by Warner Bros. Silver's deal with the studio ended in 2012, and he then signed a five-year distribution deal with Universal Pictures.

The only other debut this weekend, the thriller ""Closed Circuit,"" is playing in 1,000 fewer theaters than its rivals. The film starring Eric Bana hit theaters Wednesday and may sell just $3 million worth of tickets through Sunday. The picture, about a controversial trial following the detonation of a bomb in a London market, has received mixed critical response.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/la-et-ct-box-office-one-direction-butler-20130901-story.html","'Butler' tops One Direction documentary during big Labor Day weekend","Even a legion of ardent teenage girls was unable to overpower Oprah Winfrey at the box office this Labor Day weekend, as the film ""The Butler"" starring the media mogul cleaned up for the third consecutive weekend.

Heading into the four-day holiday, pre-release audience surveys indicated that a new 3-D concert documentary about the U.K.-based boy band One Direction would be the big winner. While ""One Direction: This Is Us"" did sell more tickets between Friday and Sunday than ""The Butler,"" the civil rights drama's four-day tally was $20 million, according to an estimate from distributor the Weinstein Co. The One Direction film has so far collected a healthy $18 million -- a figure that includes ticket sales from Thursday evening screenings.

""The Butler,"" about a devoted White House employee played by Forest Whitaker who served eight different presidents, has now grossed $79.3 million since debuting mid-August. Erik Lomis, the Weinstein Co.'s president of theatrical distribution, noted that an increasing number of late-night ticket sales indicated the film was now attracting younger moviegoers. The independent studio is hopeful the film may now reach $120 million at the domestic box office, Lomis said.

Meanwhile, even though ""This Is Us"" came in a bit below industry expectations and two other new films -- ""Getaway"" and ""Closed Circuit"" -- flopped, it was still the biggest Labor Day on record, not adjusting for inflation. All movies released over the long weekend grossed a total of $157 million -- beating 2007's $148-million haul.

Not surprisingly, ""This Is Us"" attracted a strong female contingent. Roughly 87% of the audience were women, and 65% were under the age of 17. Those who saw the movie loved it, assigning it an average grade of A, according to market research firm CinemaScore. Shot during the first six months of 2013, the movie is directed by ""Super Size Me"" filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, who trailed the group on their current world tour.

Produced by Sony Pictures' TriStar label for $10 million, ""This Is Us"" is off to a better start than the most recent concert documentary to hit theaters, ""Katy Perry: Part of Me."" Last summer, the pop star's film opened to just $7.1 million; One Direction's flick grossed $15.8 million in its first three days in release. Still, Directioners didn't prove to be quite as rabid as Beliebers: Justin Bieber's film ""Never Say Never"" launched with $29.5 million in 2011.

Overseas, ""This Is Us"" launched in 53 foreign countries including Mexico and France and grossed $14.5 million. As expected, the film performed best in the band's native U.K., selling $5.7 million worth of tickets there.

PHOTOS: Hollywood Backlot moments

Tweens weren't as eager to see former ""Wizards of Wavery Place"" star Selena Gomez's new movie, ""Getaway."" The picture -- which has the dubious distinction of being the worst-reviewed film of the summer -- spun out at the box office this weekend with a four-day opening of just $5.5 million.

As much as critics hated it -- the film has an embarrassing 2% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes -- audiences disliked it, too, giving the film an average grade of C+. The picture stars Gomez as a computer whiz who helps a man (Ethan Hawke) trying to rescue his kidnapped wife.

Gomez, 21, has had better luck singing than acting. The one-time Disney Channel star saw her newest album ""Stars Dance"" debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in August, the same month she took home an MTV Video Music Award for pop video. While her last film, the racy indie ""Spring Breakers,"" was a hit at the art-house, the only other movie she has headlined -- 2011's ""Monte Carlo"" -- grossed only $23 million.

Playing in 870 locations, the thriller ""Closed Circuit"" had a dismal debut. The film starring Eric Bana opened on Wednesday and has since made $3.1 million. In an email, a spokeswoman for the Focus Features release would say only that the film's ""box office results have been modest over the holiday weekend.""","2013-09-02 12:21:00","0","33.0","7.0","0.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","66.0","21.0","0.0","85.0","4.0","15.0","0","683","96.45","60.97","25.15","56.17","23.55","22.84","75.99","38.51","5.86","2.20","0.29","0.73","0.29","0.73","0.15","3.66","10.83","12.01","5.27","3.07","2.78","1.02","9.08","6.15","3.66","0.73","8.64","1.46","4.54","3.07","1.46","0.15","0.15","0.00","4.98","0.15","0.00","1.17","0.44","5.86","0.29","1.32","0.73","1.17","0.88","1.90","2.93","1.61","1.17","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.86","1.46","1.61","2.64","1.17","0.15","4.69","4.39","0.73","15.96","1.02","6.88","8.05","3.07","7.32","0.73","0.88","0.00","0.00","0.59","0.00","0.59","0.29","0.00","0.00","26.65","4.98","5.27","0.73","0.15","0.00","0.00","4.69","5.86","1.90","0.29","2.78","3165","8.47","24.137931034482758","973","666","36","61.16","10.7","9.3","12.13","11.7","165","12.5","19.30990990990991","398","22.59","11","0.37","0","7","63","81","0","73","46","3","4","3","128","104","0","26","0","0","8","5","23","1","1","2","10","0","10","39","19","13","5","18","2","4","0","0"
"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-47-ronin-troubles-20131226-story.html","Troubled '47 Ronin' may be headed for a box office reckoning","In ""47 Ronin,"" Keanu Reeves portrays the leader of a band of ronin — masterless samurai in 18th-century Japan who must suffer the indignity of having no one to lead them in battle. Turns out that plot line provides an apt metaphor for the period 3-D sci-fi epic's problem-plagued odyssey to the screen.

""47 Ronin"" arrived in theaters Christmas Day as one of the most troubled movie productions in recent memory, as well as one of 2013's most spectacular flops-in-the-making.

According to pre-release awareness surveys, the revenge thriller, which cost at least $175 million to produce, is on track to earn around $20 million in its opening five days. Such a weak box-office haul would put ""47 Ronin"" in the top tier of big-budget Hollywood failures, ranking alongside ""John Carter,"" ""R.I.P.D."" and ""The Lone Ranger"" in the ""when tentpole films go horribly wrong"" category.

Moreover, the film's distributor, Universal Pictures, has taken a rare pre-emptive write-down on the cost of ""47 Ronin"" — a charge on the studio's income tax statement to offset substantial losses. Even on the heels of hugely profitable films for Universal this year (including ""Fast and Furious 6"" and ""Despicable Me 2""), it's a move that signifies the white flag of defeat to industry observers.

""Universal Pictures regularly evaluates its film slate for potential adjustment,"" the studio said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. ""In the case of '47 Ronin,' we adjusted film costs in previous quarters and as a result of our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by its theatrical performance.""

Earlier this month, ""Ronin"" got off to a disappointing start in the country in which the movie is set, grossing just $1.3 million over the film's opening weekend in Japan. But its difficulties date back to 2011, when shooting began in Budapest, Hungary, and a widely reported difference of vision between Universal and ""Ronin"" director Carl Rinsch.

An acclaimed TV commercial director whose short sci-fi film ""The Gift"" sparked a bidding war between Hollywood studios interested in expanding it into a feature in 2010, Rinsch was filmdom's hot new thing. He was originally tapped to direct the ""Alien"" prequel ""Prometheus"" (before being replaced by Ridley Scott, his mentor and father of his then-girlfriend), but had no experience directing feature films before reaching the ""47 Ronin"" set.

Loosely based on a legendary 18th-century saga (""Ch¿shingura"" in Japanese), the film follows some four dozen samurai who set out to avenge their feudal master after he is forced to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) for assaulting a power-hungry feudal chieftain. Reeves was cast as a character nowhere to be found in the original text — the ""half-blood"" outcast Kai — despite not having carried an effects-driven action movie across the $100-million threshold in domestic box office since 2003's ""The Matrix Revolutions.""

Universal expected Rinsch to deliver an effects-driven thriller, but according to a January 2012 Hollywood Reporter story, the director envisioned ""Ronin"" as more of a drama. Even as its $175-million budget reportedly soared ever closer to $200 million (a posting on the entertainment news website the Wrap said ""Ronin's"" production budget grew to $225 million; Universal executives dispute that figure), producers and the studio remained unhappy with crucial battle sequences and ordered Rinsch to film scenes beefing up Reeves' heroism and a romantic sub-plot. (Neither Universal executives nor Rinsch would agree to be interviewed for this story.)

In the end, Universal brought in seasoned second-unit director Phil Neilson (""Iron Man,"" ""Tears of the Sun"") to help film five days of pick-up shots in London last year to get the scenes the studio originally wanted from Rinsch.

But contrary to previous reports, Rinsch was never removed from ""Ronin,"" according to a person close to the production who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Nor was the director prevented from editing the film, although he did not retain final cut.

""47 Ronin's"" problems didn't end there, however. Universal pushed the film's release date back twice — first from pre-Thanksgiving 2012 to last February and then again to this Christmas — in what Hollywood watchers interpreted as yet another sign of impending disaster.

The completed film is visually dazzling and fetishistically — if not authentically — shot through with Japanese cultural touchstones, featuring more ceremonial bowing than perhaps any studio movie in the last half-decade. Amid a cast of A-list Japanese actors, Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuchi (""Pacific Rim,"" 2006's ""Babel"") steals scenes as ""Ronin's"" shape-shifting witch character. And the movie's action set pieces are handsomely staged.","2013-12-25 10:00:00","0","33.0","9.0","0.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","57.0","21.0","0.0","86.0","4.0","15.0","0","798","97.95","49.50","35.66","6.35","29.56","26.69","72.93","38.22","4.26","1.38","0.25","0.25","0.00","0.63","0.25","2.88","8.65","15.66","3.26","2.51","4.39","1.75","6.52","4.64","3.38","1.13","5.76","1.13","5.26","1.75","3.51","0.13","1.00","0.88","4.26","0.13","0.50","0.13","0.88","7.77","1.38","1.75","1.00","0.88","0.75","2.63","1.75","0.88","0.38","0.38","0.63","0.25","0.13","0.13","0.13","7.27","0.63","1.75","4.39","1.00","1.13","3.01","2.76","0.75","16.17","2.38","7.52","6.64","5.01","3.76","0.75","1.25","0.38","0.38","0.38","0.00","0.13","0.13","0.13","0.00","25.06","3.76","4.26","0.38","0.13","0.13","0.00","3.51","7.52","2.26","2.01","1.13","3894","9.26","30.074074074074073","1202","772","28","43.46","15.0","14.1","14.05","17.6","208","12.5","23.817202072538862","453","27.48","10","0.37","0","18","40","79","0","92","56","2","1","4","161","100","0","36","1","0","8","9","42","2","2","5","28","1","20","33","23","20","5","13","3","4","1","2"
"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-47-ronin-review-keanu-reeves-20131225-story.html","Review: '47 Ronin' doesn't quite cut it as a samurai fantasy","There's the kind of movie that comes riding into theaters on such a prolonged wave of bad buzz — changed release dates, backstage whispers of production troubles and a swelling budget — that the film itself starts to seem beside the point, something to just get out of the way. That's the case with ""47 Ronin,"" an overlong, underwhelming movie now hitting theaters that certainly wasn't worth the wait.

The story opens with a stentorian voice-over announcing that ancient feudal Japan, as history buffs will no doubt be happy to learn, was a time of witchcraft and demons. Kai (Keanu Reeves) — referred to throughout the film as a ""half-breed,"" though it is somewhat unclear if that is half-Anglo or half-demon — lives in exile in the woods, protected by the benevolent Lord Asano.

After Asano is forced to commit seppuku by the ruling shogun following an incident in which he was bewitched, his faithful samurai, led by Oishi, are cast adrift as masterless Ronin. The evil Lord Kira has eyes on Asano's daughter, Mika, and eventually Kai, Oishi and the Ronin attempt to save Mika and avenge Asano's death.

PHOTOS: Best films of 2013 | Kenneth Turan

The ad campaign for the film is focused on Reeves, understandably, so one could be forgiven for spending time during the film wondering ""Where's Keanu?"" and ""Who are all these other people?"" Though Reeves does have a key role, the storytelling and screen time is also very much focused on such performers as Hiroyuki Sanada as Oishi, Tadanobu Asano as Kira, Kô Shibasaki as Mika and Rinko Kikuchi as a treacherous witch. Those expecting all Keanu all the time will be left feeling off-balance.

The film comes at something of a transitional moment in Reeves' career, as he has been on a run of unexpected, seemingly passion-driven projects such as producing the engaging documentary ""Side By Side,"" about shooting on film versus digital moviemaking, as well as his directing debut with ""Man of Tai Chi."" That film, in which Reeves played the villainous leader of an underground fighting circuit, pulsed with the enthusiasm of a martial arts film fan.

""47 Ronin,"" which is directed by Carl Rinsch, has no such feelings behind it. For a film whose story is so steeped in honor, there is something dutiful but uninvolved about it, respectful without really understanding the deeper traditions — a student faking it through a quiz. Though based on history, the movie is hung up on creating a fantasy-world version of Japanese feudal life. (Japanese filmmaker Takashi Miike's recent ""Hara-Kiri"" and ""13 Assassins"" both created more vibrant, lived-in variations on similar themes.)

PHOTOS: Best films of 2013 | Betsy Sharkey

Rinsch, making his feature debut, shows the shortcoming of someone coming from the image-based world of commercials and advertising. There are moments of genuine beauty and a few terrifically eye-popping effects, but no feel yet for storytelling.

The film becomes something like the punch line to an old ""screw in a light bulb"" joke: What does it take to make a samurai fantasy film? More than ""47 Ronin.""

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-box-office-one-direction-weekend-20130831-story.html","Box office: One Direction bound for the top this weekend","On a slow weekend at the box office, the voice of the tween is rising above all others.

Powered by a surging, young girl fanbase, the 3-D concert documentary ""One Direction: This Is Us"" shot to the top of the box-office rankings going into the holiday weekend with an estimated $8.9 million in ticket sales on Friday. The film about the wildly popular British boy band thus far is meeting expectations for the weekend after prerelease audience surveys forecast a four-day take of $22 million.

In more good news for the film's studio, TriStar, ""One Direction: This Is Us"" earned an A grade from the market research firm CinemaScore, which is considered a reliable indicator of audience satisfaction.

By contrast, the action film ""Getaway,"" starring Ethan Hawke and former tween star Selena Gomez, received a C+ from CinemaScore, a rating that was reflected in a dismal opening-night take of an estimated $1.4 million on Friday. At that pace, the film will debut outside of the top five for the weekend.

Lee Daniels' ""The Butler,"" a decidedly more adult-focused civil rights drama, fell out of the No. 1 position for the first time since its mid-August opening with an estimated $3.6 million. The film is expected to add another $15 million to its $55 million in earnings thus far.

The comedy ""We're the Millers"" crossed the $100-million mark with an estimated $3.1 million on Friday, followed by Disney's ""Planes"" with $1.7 million and the Matt Damon-led sci-fi film ""Elysium,"" which is on track to close out the top five with $1.5 million.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-judi-dench-20131219-story.html","Judi Dench felt a tremendous responsibility toward Philomena Lee","LONDON — The first time Judi Dench witnessed the power of acting, she was 7 and saw her brother get away with using a swear word.

Dench was accompanying her parents to a boarding school performance of ""Macbeth,"" with her oldest sibling in the role of King Duncan. ""He came on stage and said, 'What bloody man is that?'"" Dench said, with a gasp. ""I thought, 'What did he say?'""

Now 79, Dench has performed nearly every play of Shakespeare, Chekhov and Ibsen, as well as the role of M in seven James Bond films; Queen Elizabeth in ""Shakespeare in Love,"" for which she won her Oscar in 1998; and Queen Victoria in ""Mrs. Brown,"" for which she collected one of her five other Oscar nominations.

FULL COVERAGE: Oscars 2014

Dench's latest performance — for which she has so far received Screen Actor Guild and Golden Globe nominations — is as a more ordinary but just as dignified woman in the drama ""Philomena,"" in which she plays a working-class Irish mother who enlists a jaded journalist (Steve Coogan) to help her find the son whom nuns forced her to give up decades earlier. Written by Coogan and Jeff Pope, and directed by Stephen Frears, ""Philomena"" is a true story adapted from the book ""The Lost Child of Philomena Lee,"" by Martin Sixsmith.

Some critics have called the movie anti-Catholic for its harsh portrayal of the church's treatment of unwed mothers, but Dench sees the story as one of fidelity.

""I don't think it's a polemic against Roman Catholicism; I think it's a film that's unbelievably about faith,"" said the British actress.

In an interview in a London hotel suite in October after ""Philomena's"" premiere at the London Film Festival, Dench was warm and funny — her blue eyes twinkling mischievously as she dropped onto the suite's rotating bed, and shared her views on religion, acting and life after Bond.

Dench's own faith is Quakerism, which she calls, ""a strength I can't do without.""

REVIEW: Judi Dench brings out the best in 'Philomena'

She joined ""Philomena"" after Coogan came to the garden of her 17th century home in Kent, England, and read her his script — the actress has vision loss from macular degeneration.

""That's always the best way to hear a story, to hear it told to you,"" Dench said. ""There was no question in my mind that I wanted to do it, primarily because she's a remarkable person. There must be very few people who would be able to come through all that.""

In preparation for the role, Dench spent time with the real Philomena Lee, whom she described as somewhat ""childlike.""

""There's a tremendous innocence about her, real genuine innocence and shyness,"" Dench said. ""She made me laugh a great deal. I watched her and listened to her as much as I could. The responsibility to somebody who's alive and whose story it is is absolutely considerable. You can do all kinds of things with Queen Victoria and Elizabeth I, but you can't with somebody who's standing right over your shoulder.""

The film reunites Dench with Frears, who directed her in the 2005 comedy ""Mrs. Henderson Presents.""

""We have a shorthand now,"" Dench said. ""Always at the end of a shot when he says to you, 'Do you want to go again?' you know that means he wants to go once more. I would like to think we're going to work together again. All I'm trying to do is to squeeze myself into Lycra and get on a bike to send him a photograph so he can put me in his Lance Armstrong movie.""

LIST: Complete list of SAG Awards 2014 nominees

Dench recently said goodbye to what is perhaps her most iconic screen character, the imperious M from the James Bond series — a role that exposed her to a new audience of ""my grandson's friends,"" she said.

""Mi6 would have probably given her the push by now,"" Dench said. ""And I have had 17 years — four films with Pierce [Brosnan] and three with Daniel [Craig]. I think I've been pretty lucky, and I don't actually feel sad about it. I'm terribly pleased I did it. I shall miss them, though, and when I know they're starting [to film again], I expect I'll get quite beady.""

The actress, who has always loved to paint, is adapting to the difficulty of her lost vision.

""I paint quite a lot,"" she said. ""Just now I'm having terrible trouble seeing, but I don't want to make a thing of it. If you think of Monet, he painted what he thought he saw.""

A friend is teaching Dench to sculpt in soapstone, she said. And her other art, acting, continues to beckon. In November she returned to an old role as the Egyptian queen in a scene from ""Antony and Cleopatra"" at the 50th anniversary of Britain's National Theatre, where she got her start. And in the spring she's scheduled to film ""Esio Trot,"" a BBC adaptation of a Roald Dahl story in which she'll star opposite Dustin Hoffman.

""The arts are an essential bit of life,"" Dench said. ""There is a need for us to see things, experience things, to feel, to be made to face ourselves, to understand an emotion in ourselves that we might need to see portrayed. It's something to do with facing yourself and understanding yourself, and it's vital.""

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-monuments-men-20131023-story.html","George Clooney's 'The Monuments Men' pushed to 2014","George Clooney's World War II drama ""The Monuments Men"" will not arrive in theaters this year as planned because the film's visual effects could not be completed in time, the actor and director said.

The tale of a ragtag band of art historians, museum curators and academics racing to rescue paintings and sculptures looted by the Nazis — slated to open Dec. 18 — now will be released by Sony Pictures early next year.

""We just didn't have enough time,"" Clooney said Tuesday by phone from London, where he and producing partner Grant Heslov were to start a 16-hour scoring session with composer Alexandre Desplat and a 110-piece orchestra as part of their race to complete the film.

PHOTOS: George Clooney: Career in pictures

""If any of the effects looked cheesy, the whole movie would look cheesy,"" said Clooney, who directed the film and stars in it. ""We simply don't have enough people to work enough hours to finish it.""

By moving into 2014, ""Monuments Men"" will be ineligible for the upcoming Academy Awards. But Clooney said Oscar attention was never his goal for the film, which he and Heslov adapted from Robert Edsel's nonfiction book ""The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History.""

""All we've ever said, from the very beginning, is that we wanted to make a commercial, non-cynical piece of entertainment,"" Clooney said. He said the intention was to make an ensemble film in the style of ""The Guns of Navarone."" In addition to Clooney, the film stars Matt Damon, Bill Murray, Jean Dujardin, John Goodman and Cate Blanchett. It was filmed in Germany and England earlier this year.

Clooney and Heslov still are the producers of another movie with Oscar ambitions, director John Wells’ adaptation of the play “August: Osage County.” That film is scheduled to open Dec. 25.

After arriving in London a day ago, Clooney said he and Heslov realized they were facing an impossible pursuit. ""I looked at Grant and said, 'We're dying,'"" Clooney said.

The filmmakers decided to call Sony and 20th Century Fox (which is distributing ""The Monuments Men"" overseas) to ask for an extension, even though they knew it was an extraordinary request so close to the film's planned premiere. ""We can't call and ask for this,"" Heslov said he told Clooney before they picked up the phone. ""They are going to kill us.""

PHOTOS: Hollywood stars on stage

Clooney and Heslov said they called Sony's Amy Pascal and Fox's Jim Gianopulos on Tuesday morning, wondering if they would consider postponing the film.

A few hours after listening to Clooney and Heslov, Sony and Fox called back to say that the film could be pushed to an unspecified date in February, Clooney said. Sony would only say the film will come out in the first quarter of next year, but did not specify a month.

Jeff Blake, vice chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said that he planned to discuss with Clooney on Wednesday potential new release dates. “We haven’t even had time to digest it yet,” Blake said. “But the main thing is that it’s a big, commercial movie.”

""The Monuments Men"" isn't the only high-profile project unable to make a planned release date this season. Paramount Pictures is moving Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" which is still being edited, from Nov. 15 to Dec. 25, three people close to the production said this week. Several other movies, including ""Foxcatcher,"" ""Grace of Monaco"" and ""The Immigrant,"" all of which were once set to debut this year, have been delayed to 2014.

Clooney said he had sought a December release date, because his successful films ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""Ocean's Twelve"" both had been released in that month. But even under the best of circumstances, he and Heslov would have been racing to finish the movie.

Principal photography on the $65-million project commenced in early March, and wrapped in mid-July. The real time crunch, however, came in constructing hundreds of visual-effects shots, some used in scenes depicting the art preservationists coming ashore in Normandy in the hours after D-Day.

""This is a bigger film than we usually do,"" said Clooney, who last directed 2011's ""The Ides of March"" and currently stars opposite Sandra Bullock in ""Gravity."" ""It was a mad rush to do it from the very beginning."" Without faulting the work of the half-dozen companies working on the hundreds of visual-effects shots in the film, Clooney said the quick post-production schedule didn't allow for their best efforts. ""It wasn't going to be finished, and I wouldn't want to have my name on it,"" Clooney said. ""You don't want it to look like a film that was all done in the computer.""","2013-10-22 20:40:00","0","37.0","8.0","0.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","64.0","21.0","0.0","87.0","4.0","15.0","0","803","89.59","72.91","27.63","36.74","20.08","20.80","78.83","44.33","8.09","3.86","0.37","1.12","0.12","1.25","1.00","4.23","8.34","13.45","7.47","2.62","4.73","1.74","15.07","2.74","1.62","0.87","2.62","1.62","2.12","1.37","0.75","0.00","0.50","0.00","9.59","0.00","0.50","0.00","1.87","8.34","1.37","2.12","1.62","0.87","0.87","2.62","4.98","1.74","3.24","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.37","5.35","1.25","2.12","2.12","0.75","0.12","7.22","6.10","1.12","15.94","1.37","5.85","8.47","3.61","5.11","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.91","4.98","6.35","0.75","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.37","6.97","3.11","0.25","0.12","3690","7.67","24.235294117647058","1090","793","39","67.79","11.4","8.8","11.37","12.0","152","12.25","17.78708701134931","394","22.38","8","0.44","0","29","12","80","0","87","44","1","2","11","102","141","3","34","0","1","37","5","31","1","0","2","29","0","37","54","23","20","19","11","5","2","0","1"

Vijay Iyer, Mike Ladd. ""Holding It Down: The Veterans' Dreams Project"": Jazz meets hip-hop and poetry to detail the costs of war. Haunting.

Charles Lloyd and Jason Moran, ""Hagar's Song"": A masterful duet-as-conversation, examining familiar and undiscovered ground with grace.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/sc-mov-0619-world-war-z-20130619-column.html","'World War Z': Fast zombies, global chaos and a semi-entertaining mess ★★ 1/2","It begins the way global epidemics have begun once or twice before in the movies: with a nice American family around the kitchen table, television droning in the background, delivering news reports of a mutating virus. OK, pass the oj! Let's get on with the rest of our undead-plagued lives, shall we?

We shall. And we shall overcome. ""World War Z,"" the messy, fairly entertaining Brad Pitt zombie picture directed by Marc Forster (""Monster's Ball,"" ""Quantum of Solace""), barely hangs together in story terms, and Forster's direction is more about nervous traffic management than tonal certainty or action finesse. But in the key sequences, pitting our man Pitt (playing a vaguely defined United Nations investigator/world saver) against some superfast and rabidly hungry swarms of unhumanity, the stakes are high and the excitement's there and the results, as previously stated, are messy but fairly entertaining.

Sequels are desired, clearly. The massively budgeted ""World War Z"" (production costs, not including the selling part, soared north of $200 million by most reports) would have to be really, really popular to warrant another chapter in the zombie-wompin' days and nights of Gerry Lane, played by Pitt, whose panic meter never exceeds 30 percent. Amazingly terrible things are happened all around him, and to him, all the time. Yet he soldiers on, glamorously, killing the already killed, saving the save-able, guided by his love for a good woman (Mireille Enos), their two gold-plated young daughters and an adopted-on-the-fly Newark, N.J. survivor of the outbreak.

The first big blowout in ""World War Z"" finds the Lanes in traffic in downtown Philadelphia (the scenes were shot in Glasgow, Scotland). Suddenly: zombie attack! In a matter of minutes many of the world's cities are in flames. The conceit of ""World War Z,"" based very loosely on Max Brooks' novel, is that takes only 10 or 12 seconds for a chomped human to join the undead hordes. ""28 Days Later"" and ""28 Weeks Later"" got there first, and did it better, but in general it's clear: Fleet-footed zombies are better than slow ones.

Driving a stolen camper into a trashed-out, looter-friendly Newark, the Lanes are rescued by UN forces and relocated to an aircraft carrier, where Gerry's old boss (Fana Mokoena) monitors a rapidly disintegrating crisis. From there ""World War Z"" sends Gerry off on a series of ad hoc missions, first to South Korea, then to Israel, then to Cardiff, Wales, to find the elusive origin of the zombie problem, and/or concoct a cure.

Forster's visual strategy is similar to that of ""Man of Steel"" director Zack Synder's: Keep the camera too close to everyone and everything, handheld style, for maximum fake realism and jiggliness. Both Forster and Snyder might benefit from being sent to directorial reeducation camp to learn the value of an extended take not designed to induce nausea. As in ""Quantum of Solace,"" half the time in ""World War Z"" you don't know who's hacking whom.

The simplest set-ups and payoffs save the movie from utter confusion. In Jerusalem (these scenes were shot in Malta, with lots of extras and thousands more digital extras), the immensely tall concrete barriers prove no match for the scrambling zombie enemy. Later, on a flight to Wales, Gerry and an Israeli commando (Daniella Kertesz, in the film's fiercest and best performance) find themselves sitting in what appears to be first class, when a zombie comes out of nowhere (well, the toilet, actually) to attack a flight attendant in the rear of the cabin. A better, more subversive director than Forster might've done something with this condescending set-up — my God, what is happening back there, in coach? But even in his better films (""Finding Neverland,"" ""Stranger Than Fiction"") Forster has betrayed not even a trace element of humor. Like it, don't like it, or like parts of it, ""World War Z"" has no interest in splattery high spirits. It got by, barely, with a PG-13 rating, though you sense an R-rated version just dying to bust out.

The movie's travails have been extensively chronicled. ""World War Z"" went into production without an ending, and the rewrites and reshoots threw out much of the final third (a zombie battle in Moscow, alluded to briefly in an epilogue) in favor of a new climax, set in a remote World Health Organization office in Cardiff. There Gerry and his fellow survivors match wits with their undead adversaries, in dark hallways and a warren of biohazardous lab facilities. It's a strangely modest climax to a globe-trotting movie. In its way, it satisfies; at least ""World War Z""'s laborious reshoots steered the thing away from generic scenes of mass destruction, toward old-fashioned human scale zombie vanquishing problem solving. The epilogue and attendant voiceover narration that caps it? Pure desperation. But that's the movie all over: inept one minute, enticingly dire the next.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/sns-la-et-ct-box-office-one-direction-butler-20130901-story.html","'Butler' tops One Direction documentary during big Labor Day weekend","Even a legion of ardent teenage girls was unable to overpower Oprah Winfrey at the box office this Labor Day weekend, as the film ""The Butler"" starring the media mogul cleaned up for the third consecutive weekend.

Heading into the four-day holiday, pre-release audience surveys indicated that a new 3-D concert documentary about the U.K.-based boy band One Direction would be the big winner. While ""One Direction: This Is Us"" did sell more tickets between Friday and Sunday than ""The Butler,"" the civil rights drama's four-day tally was $20 million, according to an estimate from distributor the Weinstein Co. The One Direction film has so far collected a healthy $18 million -- a figure that includes ticket sales from Thursday evening screenings.

""The Butler,"" about a devoted White House employee played by Forest Whitaker who served eight different presidents, has now grossed $79.3 million since debuting mid-August. Erik Lomis, the Weinstein Co.'s president of theatrical distribution, noted that an increasing number of late-night ticket sales indicated the film was now attracting younger moviegoers. The independent studio is hopeful the film may now reach $120 million at the domestic box office, Lomis said.

Meanwhile, even though ""This Is Us"" came in a bit below industry expectations and two other new films -- ""Getaway"" and ""Closed Circuit"" -- flopped, it was still the biggest Labor Day on record, not adjusting for inflation. All movies released over the long weekend grossed a total of $157 million -- beating 2007's $148-million haul.

Not surprisingly, ""This Is Us"" attracted a strong female contingent. Roughly 87% of the audience were women, and 65% were under the age of 17. Those who saw the movie loved it, assigning it an average grade of A, according to market research firm CinemaScore. Shot during the first six months of 2013, the movie is directed by ""Super Size Me"" filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, who trailed the group on their current world tour.

Produced by Sony Pictures' TriStar label for $10 million, ""This Is Us"" is off to a better start than the most recent concert documentary to hit theaters, ""Katy Perry: Part of Me."" Last summer, the pop star's film opened to just $7.1 million; One Direction's flick grossed $15.8 million in its first three days in release. Still, Directioners didn't prove to be quite as rabid as Beliebers: Justin Bieber's film ""Never Say Never"" launched with $29.5 million in 2011.

Overseas, ""This Is Us"" launched in 53 foreign countries including Mexico and France and grossed $14.5 million. As expected, the film performed best in the band's native U.K., selling $5.7 million worth of tickets there.

Tweens weren't as eager to see former ""Wizards of Wavery Place"" star Selena Gomez's new movie, ""Getaway."" The picture -- which has the dubious distinction of being the worst-reviewed film of the summer -- spun out at the box office this weekend with a four-day opening of just $5.5 million.

As much as critics hated it -- the film has an embarrassing 2% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes -- audiences disliked it, too, giving the film an average grade of C+. The picture stars Gomez as a computer whiz who helps a man (Ethan Hawke) trying to rescue his kidnapped wife.

Gomez, 21, has had better luck singing than acting. The one-time Disney Channel star saw her newest album ""Stars Dance"" debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in August, the same month she took home an MTV Video Music Award for pop video. While her last film, the racy indie ""Spring Breakers,"" was a hit at the art-house, the only other movie she has headlined -- 2011's ""Monte Carlo"" -- grossed only $23 million.

Playing in 870 locations, the thriller ""Closed Circuit"" had a dismal debut. The film starring Eric Bana opened on Wednesday and has since made $3.1 million. In an email, a spokeswoman for the Focus Features release would say only that the film's ""box office results have been modest over the holiday weekend.""","2013-09-02 12:21:00","0","33.0","7.0","0.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","66.0","21.0","0.0","85.0","4.0","16.0","0","683","96.45","60.97","25.15","56.17","23.55","22.84","75.99","38.51","5.86","2.20","0.29","0.73","0.29","0.73","0.15","3.66","10.83","12.01","5.27","3.07","2.78","1.02","9.08","6.15","3.66","0.73","8.64","1.46","4.54","3.07","1.46","0.15","0.15","0.00","4.98","0.15","0.00","1.17","0.44","5.86","0.29","1.32","0.73","1.17","0.88","1.90","2.93","1.61","1.17","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.86","1.46","1.61","2.64","1.17","0.15","4.69","4.39","0.73","15.96","1.02","6.88","8.05","3.07","7.32","0.73","0.88","0.00","0.00","0.59","0.00","0.59","0.29","0.00","0.00","26.65","4.98","5.27","0.73","0.15","0.00","0.00","4.69","5.86","1.90","0.29","2.78","3165","8.47","24.137931034482758","973","666","36","61.16","10.7","9.3","12.13","11.7","165","12.5","19.30990990990991","398","22.59","11","0.37","0","7","63","81","0","73","46","3","4","3","128","104","0","26","0","0","8","5","23","1","1","2","10","0","10","39","19","13","5","18","2","4","0","0"
"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/consumer/bs-bz-taymour-20130503-story.html","From intern to T. Rowe Price portfolio manager","A decade ago, Taymour Tamaddon was an MBA. student with a background in physics trying to convince Baltimore-based money manager T. Rowe Price to hire him as an intern.

Not only did Price give him the internship and hire him later as a health care analyst, but six months ago the company chose Tamaddon to head up the Health Sciences Fund, one of the firm's top-performing funds with $7.4 billion in assets.

""It's overwhelming, as you can imagine. Exciting, challenging,"" he said. ""I love learning. For me, that's probably been the most rewarding aspect.""

The 37-year-old's rise to portfolio manager came when the previous manager, Kris Jenner, abruptly left in February to launch a hedge fund in Baltimore, taking with him two of the fund's analysts.

Price doesn't have star managers whose names are as familiar to investors as the funds themselves. But if it did, Jenner definitely would have been one. A doctor who walked away from 13 years of medical training to become a money manager, Jenner was skilled at uncovering small health care companies that could produce big payoffs for patient investors.

Tamaddon said he wasn't surprised by Jenner's departure and declined an opportunity to join him. Analyzing his long-term career options and the work he could do down the road at Price, he said he decided to stay with the firm.

Tamaddon's first priority was to manage the fund to make sure its performance stayed on track, he said. He stepped up communication with fund shareholders, visiting the largest clients to tell them the fund's strategy wouldn't change and explain his plans to build his team.

With the departure of Jenner and the two analysts, the fund lost half of its U.S. analyst team. Tamaddon has since added three full-time analysts and one part-time.

The Health Sciences Fund continues to outperform its peers. As of the end of last week, the fund's total return — including reinvested dividends — was 37.97 percent year to date, compared with an average of 35.46 percent for about 30 actively managed health care funds, Morningstar reported.

The fund maintains a top 5-star rating from Morningstar for its long-term past performance. But Morningstar analysts' lowered the fund's rating from gold — the highest — to neutral after Jenner left due to uncertainty about how the fund will perform under a new manager, said Flynn Murphy, a Morningstar fund analyst.

""Thus far, investors are still putting money into the fund at a greater pace than in years past,"" Murphy said.

For the 12 months ended in July, $929 million flowed into the fund, up from $600 million the year before, according to Morningstar.

""He's doing about as fine as Mr. Jenner was,"" said David Snowball, publisher of the Mutual Fund Observer.

Snowball gives part of the credit for investors sticking with the fund to Price, which he said spends more time than many other large investment firms in communicating with shareholders.

""It means they have a better-informed shareholders who are less likely to bolt,"" Snowball said.

Tamaddon said he shares more similarities than differences with his predecessor: ""The boring part — the strategy of the fund is not going to change.""

Morningstar's Murphy said, ""Kris Jenner used a very patient, low-turnover approach.""

Under Jenner, the fund invested in small health care companies with one drug or product coming to market and waited for them to pay off, Murphy said.

""It tended to be a little more volatile than other health sciences funds,"" Murphy said. ""It would lose more in downturns and … gain more during upturns.""

Tamaddon made some portfolio adjustments, he said, such as switching Gilead Sciences from a major position to the fund's top stock. He's said he's convinced Gilead will transform the treatment for hepatitis C.

""In three years, we will have cured many more people with hepatitis C than the market anticipated,"" he predicted.

A Virginia native whose parents both worked for the U.S. Army, Tamaddon majored in applied physics at Cornell University.

""I love numbers,"" Tamaddon said.

And that love of math and analyzing things drew him to the business world. He became a consultant after graduating in 1998, then spent two years in finance at Amazon.com before going to graduate school at Dartmouth College. It was there in 2002 that he encountered Bill Stromberg, head of global equity at Price, who was recruiting on the campus.

""I actually had never heard of T. Rowe Price. I really had not heard of stock. I didn't know this job existed,"" said Tamaddon, who initially didn't make the interview list with Price. ""I literally dedicated the next three months of my life to getting a job at T. Rowe Price.""

For example, he sent Price detailed 20- to 30-page analyses on stock picks. He offered to take executives in Price's research department out to lunch when he was in the area visiting his parents, although none took him up on the invitation.

Persistence paid off. He was hired as an intern in 2003, and after receiving his MBA in 2004, he joined Price as a health care analyst.

""Taymour stood out from the moment I met him — exceptionally bright, tenacious and full of positive energy. All of our reference checks confirmed that he was truly a special person,"" Stromberg wrote in an email. ""During his internship, we saw that he was also incredibly hardworking, curious and a natural team-player.""

Tamaddon covered stocks that made up 13 percent of the Health Sciences' portfolio. He said he covered a wider range of industries than other analysts, from specialty pharmaceuticals and medical technology to diagnostics, life sciences tools and health care services.

""The good news was in terms of preparing me to look at the broad health care universe, it was very diverse,"" he said. ""In a sense it ended up being a blessing, but it made the first nine years a little more difficult.""","2013-09-16 18:33:00","0","38.0","3.0","0.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","41.0","21.0","0.0","82.0","4.0","15.0","0","991","95.68","74.42","30.03","67.71","17.39","22.40","84.46","42.99","9.18","5.95","1.01","0.30","0.10","4.14","0.40","3.23","8.17","16.55","5.15","2.02","3.83","1.01","13.52","6.46","4.34","1.01","3.53","2.42","3.83","3.03","0.81","0.20","0.00","0.50","10.80","0.20","0.10","0.00","4.14","8.88","2.72","1.61","0.61","0.91","0.71","2.62","2.52","0.30","2.12","0.00","2.62","0.20","1.92","0.10","0.10","7.97","1.72","2.32","3.53","1.31","0.20","8.07","4.44","1.11","16.25","2.12","8.27","6.26","9.79","0.30","0.00","6.05","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.98","6.46","5.95","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.41","3.43","2.32","0.00","0.30","4648","7.76","19.18867924528302","1427","984","61","63.59","11.0","8.4","11.37","10.1","207","3.75","16.854634146341464","469","17.94","21","0.43","0","20","35","83","0","127","60","7","2","8","173","95","4","61","0","0","59","13","30","3","1","9","33","0","31","89","28","15","12","7","3","4","2","3"
"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/la-me-foreign-students-20131111-story.html","Foreign students continue to flock to U.S. colleges","The number of international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities grew to a record high last year and USC remained their most popular destination, according to a new study.

The private university had 9,840 international students, about 1,400 more than UCLA, which ranked sixth in the survey conducted by the New York nonprofit Institute of International Education, in partnership with the U.S. State Department.

USC has had the largest number of foreign students for a dozen years in a row.

FOR THE RECORD:

Foreign students: An article in the Nov. 11 LATExtra section about the number of international students studying in the United States implied that Saudi Arabians were one of the four biggest student groups at USC in 2012. Saudi Arabians did not rank in the top four. —



Overall, the number of international students in U.S. institutions increased by about 7% last year to nearly 820,000. The largest group came from China, which sent about 236,000 students, nearly double the number of students from India, the second-largest group.

Several countries — including Iran, Brazil and Kuwait — increased their number of students in the U.S. by at least 20%, but ""most of the growth was fueled by the undergraduate Chinese students,"" said Rajika Bhandari, deputy vice president for research and evaluation at the Institute of International Education.

After two USC Chinese graduate students were fatally shot in April 2012, it was unclear whether the violence would lead to a drop in Chinese enrollment. But that group grew by about 800 students, according to USC statistics. The survey found there were nearly 3,800 Chinese students at USC last fall.

The other countries with the largest groups of students at USC are South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Canada.

California attracted the largest number of foreign students nationwide, with about 111,000, followed by New York and Texas, which had 88,000 and 63,000 international students, respectively.

The University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign had the second-most international students with 9,800. Purdue University's main campus had 9,500 foreign students, placing it third, while New York and Columbia universities ranked fourth and fifth in the survey, respectively.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/os-famu-band-plea-conference-20131113-story.html","Two former FAMU band members enter pleas","The musician described by prosecutors as the ""most enthusiastic"" hazing participant in a Florida A&M University drum major's beating death pleaded no contest to manslaughter Wednesday.

Jessie Baskin faces up to nine years in prison.

He gave no confession in Orange County circuit court but signed a plea accepting criminal responsibility for killing 26-year-old Robert Champion, the drum major who was punched, kicked, pushed and bludgeoned to death Nov. 19, 2011, after a football game in Orlando.

Champion had climbed onto the bus knowing that he was facing a ritual hazing, a long-standing tradition within the band.

Nine co-defendants have now entered pleas. Most of the others pleaded guilty or no contest to lesser charges. Baskin is one of only two to enter a plea to manslaughter. No co-defendant has been ordered to prison.

Earlier, Circuit Judge Marc Lubet told Baskin that he would impose a sentence of no more than nine years in prison, even though the charge carries a possible sentence of 15, and might give him less, should the former FAMU student present compelling evidence.

Defense attorney Chris L. Smith asked for a half-day to present that evidence. Lubet set the date for Feb. 4.

State Attorney Jeff Ashton, now lead prosecutor in the case, said, ""Mr. Baskin is the one person who is most consistently identified as the most enthusiastic participant.""

The Miami 22-year-old landed ""blows with hands and feet,"" the prosecutor said.

A co-defendant, fellow drum major Shawn Turner, earlier said in a sworn statement that other musicians had to pull Baskin off Champion.

Ashton said he wants the case to send a message: ""Hazing will only end when people know the law will be enforced.""

Also Wednesday, another co-defendant, 21-year-old Harold Finley of Riviera Beach, pleaded guilty to hazing and was sentenced to one year of house arrest followed by four years of probation.

Ashton said Finley did not hit Champion but took part in the hazing.

The victim's mother, Pamela Champion, who was monitoring the hearing by phone, accused Finley of ""vicious and inhumane acts. …. You and others are responsible for killing my son. … I pray that God will have mercy on you.""

Lubet tacked an addendum onto Finley's sentence, as he has with other co-defendants: He ordered him to finish college.

Champion died after a hazing known as ""Crossing Bus C,"" in which he attempted to run from the front of the percussion section's bus to the back through a gantlet of band members.

The hazing scandal put the band out of business for two years. It was reinstated in August. The scandal also led to the ousters of the band director and FAMU's president.

Champion's parents have sued the university for wrongful death, alleging school officials for years negligently allowed a culture of hazing within the internationally famous marching band.

Attorneys for six other former band members appeared in court Wednesday but told the judge they would not enter pleas. They represented Dante Martin of Tampa, 26, described by detectives and ex-band members as the ""Bus C President"" who was responsible for organizing hazing activities; Jarrod Deas, 26, one of Champion's fellow drum majors; Darryl Cearnel, 26; Aaron Golson, 21; Benjamin McNamee, 22; and Henry Nesbitt, 27.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/os-famu-hazing-jessie-baskin-plea-20130702-story.html","Judge: No deal in limiting sentence of FAMU hazing defendant","The Orange County judge presiding over the FAMU hazing cases was unwilling Tuesday to cap at three years a possible prison sentence for an ex-band member charged with felony hazing and manslaughter in the death of Marching 100 drum major Robert Champion.

Circuit Judge Marc Lubet said he wanted to hear from Champion's parents, Pamela and Robert Champion, before weighing a request to limit punishment facing Jessie Baskin, 22, of Miami, whom prosecutors have categorized as a ""beater"" in the fatal hazing that occurred Nov. 19, 2011, in Orlando.

Baskin, who has pleaded not guilty, could be sentenced to 21 years in prison if convicted of all charges and sentenced to the maximum for each offense.

Baskin, identified by Champion's fellow drum majors as someone who kicked Champion during the hazing, is among nine remaining defendants in the scandal. Six others have pleaded no contest to the charges and all but one received sentences of probation and community service.

The sixth, Caleb Jackson, also classified as a beater, has not yet been sentenced but is expected to receive a three-year prison term.

Prosecutors put most of the hazing participants in one of three categories — beaters, helpers or victims. Drum majors Jonathan Boyce, Shawn Turner and Rikki Wills were considered ""helpers"" as they tried to shield Champion from blows and pushed or pulled him through the ritual.

Florida's hazing statute does not make such distinctions. Participating in hazing is illegal in Florida.

Lubet arranged another plea conference for July 11 when the Champions could attend in person or by phone.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/os-famu-hazing-prison-sentences-20130711-story.html","State may seek prison for remaining FAMU hazing defendants","Prosecutors suggested Thursday that they are finished with plea deals that mete out light sentences of probation and community service to ex-band members charged in the hazing death of FAMU drum major Robert Champion.

During a plea conference, assistant state attorney Nicole Pegues told Circuit Judge Marc Lubet that ""three years [in prison] is too little"" for Jessie Baskin and other former members of the Marching 100 band who struck blows during the fatal hazing of Champion.

Witnesses alleged they saw Baskin, 21, kicking Champion during the hazing. He has pleaded not guilty.

The drum major's parents, Pamela and Robert Champion, who participated in the court hearing by telephone from their home in suburban Atlanta, also told the judge they did not want the prison sentence capped at three years as Baskin's lawyer Christopher Smith had hoped.

""What was done was cruel and it's wrong,"" Champion's mother said. ""If we're going to end [hazing], then we need to set an example, [send] a clear message.""

If convicted of manslaughter and felony hazing in Champion's death, Baskin would face a maximum term of 15 years in prison, although state sentencing guidelines recommend at least nine years. A judge could hand out a shorter sentence if presented with compelling arguments.

Champion, 26, died Nov. 19, 2011 after a beating on a bus parked at the Rosen Plaza hotel where the iconic band was staying.

The hazing scandal led prosecutors in Orange County to charge 15 band members in Champion's death and forced university officials to suspend the ensemble, known for its flashy, high-energy performances.

Five ex-band members have received probation and community-service sentences, including Champion's fellow drum majors Jonathan Boyce, Shawn Turner and Rikki Wills. A sixth former member, Caleb Jackson, is expected to receive a three-year prison term for his role.

Though Champion was hit repeatedly during the hazing, known as ""Crossing Bus C,"" none of his fellow band members admitted striking him. Prosecutors nonetheless have classified the hazing defendants according to their alleged roles, and most of those awaiting trial fall into the category of ""beaters,"" those who punched or kicked Champion as they tried to prevent him from making his way from the front of the bus to the back.

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/school-zone/os-seminole-state-tobacco-free-post.html","Seminole State goes tobacco free on Monday","Seminole State College of Florida will be tobacco free when classes begin Monday, as a ban on all tobacco use goes into effect.

The college's board of trustees approved the anti-tobacco policy in April, joining more than 1,000 colleges nationwide that have banned tobacco use on their campuses, officials said.

Seminole's ban goes into effect with the start of the fall 2013 term, which is Monday.

The policy aims to promote ""health and wellness"" among students and employees. The ban prohibits the use of ""tobacco of any kind,"" including cigarettes, cigars and chewing tobacco, on campus. It extends to personnel vehicles -- so no smoking in your car -- while they are on college property.

This week, workers have been removing signs for designated smoking areas to ready for a ""tobacco free collge."" The smoking areas were created in 2006 when the college banned smoking except in those certain spotse designated areas.","2013-08-23 09:49:00","0","12.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","34.0","16.0","0.0","72.0","4.0","15.0","0","152","97.04","55.22","54.71","97.58","19.00","28.95","76.97","40.13","5.26","1.97","0.00","0.00","0.66","0.00","1.32","3.29","7.24","17.11","5.26","1.97","5.26","0.66","11.84","3.29","1.97","1.97","2.63","1.97","5.26","5.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.24","1.32","3.95","0.00","0.66","1.32","1.32","0.66","0.00","0.66","0.00","5.92","0.00","2.63","0.00","4.61","6.58","0.66","1.97","4.61","0.66","0.00","2.63","7.89","0.66","19.08","3.29","9.21","6.58","9.21","0.00","0.00","1.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.74","5.26","5.92","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.29","3.95","1.32","0.00","0.00","740","8.78","19.25","233","150","8","52.39","12.8","10.6","12.82","12.4","40","6.333333333333333","20.186666666666667","102","18.0","0","0.41","0","3","4","15","0","23","5","1","0","1","34","9","0","15","0","0","2","2","3","0","0","0","3","0","4","5","6","5","4","6","2","0","0","2"
"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/florida360/os-fla360-bree-mcmahon-story-story.html","Bree McMahon continues her comeback","Two years ago news broke of a horrific accident involving a local high school soccer player and a fund raising car wash. Any parent who has ever sent their child off to wash cars for their club or sport, would struggle to imagine that such a dreadful accident could ever happen at such an innocuous event as a team car wash.

My family and I have been taking part in car washes for years, helping to raise money for our kid's various sports. In my wildest imagination, I could never have anticipated what happened to Bree McMahon. While washing the car of one of her teammates, her friend's foot slipped off the brake and onto the accelerator, crushing Bree's legs while pinning her against a brick wall. Seventeen surgeries later, Bree is fighting and battling to regain a sense of normalcy in her life.

I was fortunate enough to work on this story from the beginning alongside Sentinel columnist Mike Bianchi. I say fortunate because as horrid as the accident was, watching Bree's recovery gives me hope that we can overcome even the worst that life has to throw at us. She is nothing short of inspirational.

Doctors wanted to amputate both of her legs, but her parents fought and asked for a second opinion. They wanted to give their daughter the chance to save her one remaining leg. They knew her fortitude better than any doctor. They knew she had it in her to overcome even the gravest of hurdles. As a parent, I simply can not fathom having to make the choice to amputate both of my child's legs. Admittedly, I never wanted either of my children to ever attend another car wash again, regardless of how foolish or overly protective that sounds. The gruesome reality of what COULD happen never escapes me now.

Bianchi and I recently visited Bree in Brevard, N.C. where she is a sophomore attending Brevard College, and on the soccer team. She doesn't play in games, but she does work out with the team and help in any way she can.

Her coach, Coach Sugar, (Shigeyoshi Shinohara) says ""She doesn't teach us. She shows us. If you see Bree McMahon, if you have a down in your life, look at this young lady. She is doing it everyday.""

"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/bs-fo-nutrition-farmers-markets-20130625-story.html","Sampling local farmers' markets","Nutritionists from the University of Maryland Medical Center regularly contribute a guest post. The latest post is from Cara Shipley, dietetic intern.

In June all of the farmers' markets, like the Orioles, are in full swing. The definition of ""local"" food varies widely, but it is most commonly referred to as any food that travels less than 100 miles from the farm to your table. Benefits of eating local include fresher, more nutrient-dense produce and a smaller carbon footprint because of decreased transportation time. Here are some tips on where to find the local foods in Baltimore. This list is in no way comprehensive, but it is a good way to begin exploring.

Each farmers' market throughout the city brings its own flavor. We begin our culinary journey in North Baltimore at the 32nd Street Farmers Market in Waverly. It is located at the parking lot on East 32nd and Barclay streets and is open year-round every Saturday from 7 a.m. to noon. It brings a wealth of diversity and caters to people in all walks of life. Here you will find everything from produce to ethnic prepared foods and Zeke's coffee. The Waverly market is one of seven that allows customers shopping with the food stamp benefit debit cards to double their food dollars up to $10 using ""Baltimore Bucks."" This market is one that really seems to be focused on serving the needs of the community. According to its website, in 2012 the market accepted 2,321 debit transactions for SNAP cards totaling $76,870, 8490 Baltimore Bucks Incentive Dollars and increased the WIC redemption rate by giving $1,500 incentive dollars to those clients.

As we move to South Baltimore, we find a very small but industrious market: The Baltimore Museum of Industry's farmers' market runs Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. This market is a convenient location for Federal Hill residents to purchase produce, meat, dairy products like fresh ice cream, plants, flowers and a selection of artisan goods. This small, family-focused market offers fun events such as live music, demonstrations, kids' activities and giveaways.

On the east side of town is the Fells Point Farmers Market, held every Saturday from 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Broadway Square. Although the first farmers' market in Fells Point dates back to the 1700s, the current market is fairly new, beginning in 2011. It has quickly become a favorite due to the accessibility by foot, bike, car (free parking until 10 a.m.), Charm City circulator and water taxi. You will find rich history with a twist: trendy vendors include Atwater's Bakery, Baltimore Waffle Company and Jukai Juices.

The University Farmers Market, located at plaza Park on Paca Street just steps outside of the University of Maryland Medical Center, runs Tuesdays from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Shop with medical professionals and students. The market is small, but features fun treats like Capital Kettle Corn and Gary's Turkey burgers. Not to mention all the food trucks that show up too.

Last, but certainly not least, is the Baltimore Farmers' Market & Bazaar, Maryland's largest producers-only market, which is open Sundays 7 a.m. to noon. Wake up feeling classy with Cafe Latte'da and then make your way over to the farmer vendors get some staples. In addition to usual produce you will find at a farmers' market, this one is hard to beat with its huge selection of specialty meats like lamb, bison, goat and rabbit. And for those feeling less adventurous, there is always plenty of pit beef to go around. There is a wide array of crafty vendors with everything from stained glass to handbags. Just be sure to give yourself time to get through everything this market has to offer. Don't forget to pick up some whole grain bread before heading home. Free parking is on Guilford Avenue and Pleasant Street, adjacent to the bazaar lot.

Whichever market you shop at, each dollar you spend sends a message that in turn affects the demand, availability and ultimately the price of healthy food. If people take the time to get to know the farmers who grow our food and appreciate where it comes from, the world will be a happier, healthier place — starting in Baltimore.","2013-06-25 12:22:00","0","14.0","2.0","3.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","35.0","18.0","0.0","72.0","4.0","15.0","0","725","97.10","66.06","53.45","80.70","17.26","22.07","78.76","40.00","5.79","1.93","0.00","0.69","1.10","0.00","0.14","3.86","7.45","16.00","4.28","2.48","4.28","0.55","10.76","4.83","2.76","0.69","4.14","2.90","3.03","3.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.41","0.14","0.14","0.00","0.00","8.28","2.21","1.66","0.28","1.52","1.52","1.52","1.10","0.41","0.14","0.55","4.14","0.28","1.10","0.00","2.90","5.24","1.10","0.55","2.48","1.24","0.00","0.28","8.97","0.97","18.07","3.17","10.48","4.41","5.24","2.07","0.55","5.52","0.00","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.66","7.17","5.79","0.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.55","0.55","1.93","0.28","0.55","3322","7.8","20.885714285714286","1030","705","41","62.48","11.1","8.8","10.9","10.3","148","6.5","17.277163120567376","395","19.66","2","0.41","0","23","31","73","0","83","51","4","3","4","127","88","0","49","1","0","15","8","22","2","1","3","33","0","25","6","14","3","19","33","5","1","0","2"
