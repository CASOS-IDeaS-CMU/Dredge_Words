"http://realfarmacy.com/213-women-who-took-gardasil-suffered-permanent-disability/","How Many Women Who Took Gardasil Suffered Permanent Disability?!","Naomi Snell, a 28-year-old woman in Melbourne, Australia, is leading a class-action civil lawsuit against drug maker Merck after suffering autoimmune and neurological complications following injections with the HPV vaccine, Gardasil.

After receiving the first of three doses of the vaccine, Naomi suffered convulsions, severe back and neck pain, and lost her ability to walk.

Doctors actually diagnosed her with multiple sclerosis, which was later retracted and labeled a neurological reaction to the vaccine.

Seven other women, who say they have suffered various physical problems, including anaphylaxis and miscarriage, after receiving Gardasil may also join the civil lawsuit, and this is likely only the beginning, as Gardasil is being implicated in a growing number of serious, permanent and sometimes deadly adverse reactions.

Unfortunately, stories like Naomi’s are all too common in relation to Gardasil.

One of the vaccine injury cases featured in the movie The Greater Good is that of Gabi Swank, a 15-year-old honor student who decided to get the Gardasil vaccine after seeing a “Be One Less” Gardasil vaccine advertisement on TV.

Like so many young girls, she wasn’t warned about any possible side effects when she got the shots, which are given as a series of three injections.

At the time the documentary was filmed, she had already suffered two strokes and experienced partial paralysis. She also lost part of her vision and today suffers frequent seizures. When she was in high school, many days she had to use a wheelchair to get around school due to muscle pain and chronic fatigue.

A similar reaction happened to 13-year-old Jenny Tetlock, who began seeing signs of trouble just one month after she was vaccinated against the HPV virus. Fifteen months later, a degenerative muscle disease left her nearly completely paralyzed.

Neurological symptoms such as these were also reported in a study done in 2009 by neurologist Dr. Ian Sutton. He reported five cases of multiple sclerosis-like symptoms emerging shortly after women received the Gardasil vaccine, noting:

“We report five patients who presented with multifocal or atypical demyelinating syndromes within 21 days of immunization with the quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil. Although the target population for vaccination, young females, has an inherently high risk for MS, the temporal association with demyelinating events in these cases may be explained by the potent immuno-stimulatory properties of HPV virus-like particles which comprise the vaccine.”

Further, Judicial Watch, a public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption, recently issued an update on adverse reaction reports relating to Gardasil.

The documents obtained from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) detail 26 new deaths reported to the government following HPV vaccination between September 1, 2010 and September 15, 2011. That’s 26 reported deaths of young, previously healthy, girls after Gardasil vaccination in just one year.

Other serious side effects reported during that time frame included:

Between May 2009 and September 2010, 16 deaths after Gardasil vaccination were reported. For that time frame, there were also 789 reports of “serious” Gardasil adverse reactions, including 213 cases of permanent disability and 25 diagnosed cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome, Judicial Watch reported.

Serious Vaccine Reactions, Deaths, Often Labeled “Coincidence”

While it is not clear exactly what is causing so many adverse reactions, it is known that Gardasil contains genetically engineered virus-like protein particles as well as aluminum, which can affect immune function.

Further, according to the vaccine manufacturer product information insert, the vaccine has not been evaluated for the potential to cause cancer or to be toxic to genes.

In fact, Merck only studied the Gardasil vaccine in fewer than 1,200 girls under 16 prior to it being released to the market under a fast-tracked road to licensure. To date, most of the serious side effects, including deaths, that occurred during the pre-licensure clinical trials and post marketing surveillance have been written off as a “coincidence” by Merck researchers and government health officials.

But on the National Vaccine Information Center’s (NVIC) Web site, you can read about Gabi Swank’s Gardasil reaction and other descriptions of women and girls who have suffered serious health deterioration after Gardasil shots and, in some cases, have died shortly after receiving this vaccine. The growing Gardasil vaccine injury toll has become too large to ignore:

-Christina Tarsell, a 21-year-old college student majoring in studio arts at Bard College, who died suddenly and without explanation shortly after receiving the third Gardasil shot in June 2008.

-Megan, a 20-year-old college student who died suddenly, without explanation, about one month after receiving her third Gardasil shot. No cause of death was found.

-Ashley, a 16-year-old who became chronically ill after receiving Gardasil, and now suffers regular life-threatening episodes of seizure-like activity, difficulty breathing, back spasms, paralysis, dehydration, memory loss and tremors.

Gardasil Protects Against Just FOUR of the 100 Types of HPV Viruses

There are more than 100 types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Of them, about 40 types of HPV are sexually transmitted and 15 of these types are most associated with cervical cancers and genital warts in women and men. HPV infections that remain unidentified and untreated for a long time are also associated with development of vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal and oropharyngeal cancers. Some HPV infections can cause minor skin infections and common warts on your hands and feet.

Certain types of chronic HPV infections, which are not identified or treated for a long time, can lead to cervical cancer. It is only when the HPV virus lingers for many years that abnormal cervical cells could turn into cancer. This is why PAP smears identify cervical changes and can prevent cervical cancer deaths far more effectively than the HPV vaccine ever will, because there’s a sufficient amount of time to find and treat any cervical abnormalities if you’re getting regular PAP smears.

It is important to know, however, that over 90 percent of women infected with HPV clear the infection naturally within two years, at which point cervical cells go back to normal.

The death rate from cervical cancer in the United States is 3 per 100,000 and it is estimated that, in 2011, about 12,000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer and 4,000 died. In 2009, there were about 34,000 deaths from car accidents in the U.S. for a death rate of 11 per 100,000.

Women have a much higher risk of dying in a car accident than dying from cervical cancer!

Cervical cancer rates are even lower in some European countries. The reason why the mortality rate is so low is because — for the vast majority of healthy women living in developed countries like Europe and the U.S. — their immune systems are usually strong enough to naturally clear HPV infection within two years. Again, this happens in more than 90 percent of all cases!

Of course, even if you get HPV vaccine, if you contract one of the 40 or more types of HPV that are sexually transmitted and aren’t included in the vaccine, you will not be protected from HPV infections. And, if you’ve already been exposed to one of the four types of viruses in the vaccine, it doesn’t work against those either.

This means that, even if you accept the risks and get vaccinated, your chances of experiencing some form of HPV infection are still very high. Whether or not the HPV virus will lead to genital warts or cervical cancer or other kinds of health problems, however, depends in large part on the state of your immune system and, in the case of cervical cancer, is affected by whether or not you get routine PAP screenings.

Many Teens Mistakenly Think HPV Vaccine Cuts Risk for All STDs…

Unfortunately, according to a recent study nearly one in four girls who get the HPV vaccine mistakenly believes it will also reduce their risk of getting other sexually transmitted diseases, such as syphilis and gonorrhea. Clearly, more education is needed in this area.

The study polled close to 340 girls, average age nearly 17, after their first of three HPV doses, and their mothers. The poll was intended to determine the girls’ perceived risk of getting HPV after the vaccination, their perceived risk of getting other STDs, and their perceived need for continued safer sex behaviors. While the majority of the girls correctly thought the vaccine would not protect them against STDs other than HPV, 24 percent responded they thought the vaccine would reduce their risk of other STDs. According to the authors, those with this misperception were also less likely to be informed about HPV infection and the HPV vaccine in general.

According to the authors:

“Education about HPV vaccines and encouraging communication between girls and their mothers may prevent misperceptions among these adolescents.”

If You Live in California, Your Minor Daughter or Son Can Be Given Gardasil Vaccine Without Your Knowledge or Consent

In October 2011, California Governor Jerry Brown signed bill AB499 that permits minor children as young as 12 years old to be vaccinated with sexually transmitted disease (STD) vaccines like Gardasil — without parental knowledge or parental consent. This means that, if you live in California, school or medical personnel will soon be allowed to give your child Gardasil, hepatitis B vaccine and future vaccines for STD’s without you ever knowing it.

At issue, of course, is whether 12-year-olds are mature enough to fully analyze the benefits versus risks of vaccination (or any medical treatment for that matter), or recognize the benefits of alternatives to STD prevention, such as abstinence or use of condoms. Meanwhile, a child could suffer a serious vaccine reaction and the parent, not knowing the child had been vaccinated, could mistake it for the flu or another less serious health problem, delaying getting the child to an emergency room until it is too late.

Of course, also at issue is whether this law violates long held legal rights for parents to be responsible for making important medical decisions for their children, especially when risk-taking is involved. If a child is injured from complications of a medical procedure or use of a pharmaceutical product, it is the parent who will be legally and financially responsible for providing care for the child. Therefore, the legal right for parents to exercise informed consent to medical risk-taking for minor children, which includes giving consent for use of a pharmaceutical product, such as a vaccine, that carries a risk of injury or death, is an important legal right to defend and protect in America.

The National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is currently exploring legal options for overturning this new law, which violates parental informed consent rights.

Will Merck Get its Day in Court?

The class-action civil lawsuit in Australia being brought against Merck for injuries and deaths following Gardasil vaccination may help to bring more attention to the risks of this vaccine, which was fast-tracked in the U.S. and brought to market without adequate scientific evidence proving safety and effectiveness. Like in Australia, there are many girls and women in the U.S. speaking out about what happened to them after getting Gardasil shots. If you or a loved one has been harmed by Gardasil or any other vaccine or pharmaceutical product, please consider sharing your story with others so there is greater public awareness about vaccine and prescription drug risks.

Of course, Merck is no stranger to legal action. The company paid out billions in lawsuit claims to tens of thousands harmed by the drug Vioxx, and over the years has had more than $5.5 billion in judgments and fines levied against it. Unfortunately, in the U.S. Merck is protected from civil lawsuits for Gardasil vaccine injuries and deaths because of the liability shield granted to pharmaceutical companies by the U.S. government.

Barbara Loe Fisher, founder of the National Vaccine Information Center, explains:

“In 1986, there were three major drug corporations selling vaccines in the U.S. (Merck, Lederle, Connaught) and now there are eight (Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Astra Zeneca, CSL Biotherapies, Emergent BioSolutions).

That is because, in 1986, Pharma blackmailed Congress into giving them partial liability protection from vaccine injury lawsuits by suggesting they would have to abandon the U.S. childhood vaccine market without a liability shield.

In February of this year [2011], drug companies got what they wanted all along: the U.S. Supreme Court gave Pharma total immunity from lawsuits – even if they could have made a vaccine less harmful.

Vaccines, said the Court, are “unavoidably unsafe.”

So if your child is brain injured by a vaccine that you may not have wanted your child to get in the first place, all you can do is file a claim in the federal vaccine injury compensation program. Even though the program has awarded more than $2 billion dollars to vaccine victims, two out of three plaintiffs are turned away empty handed.

With no liability or accountability for those making, licensing, selling and giving vaccines in America, there are no checks and balances to ensure that vaccines are safe and effective. Doctors, who have been taught to believe that infectious microorganisms should be eradicated from the earth with the mandatory use of multiple vaccines, are as ripe for exploitation as the people they vaccinate.”

What You Can Do to Make a Difference

While it seems “old-fashioned,” the only truly effective actions you can take to protect the right to informed consent to vaccination and expand vaccine exemptions, is to get personally involved in educating your state legislators and the leaders in your community.

THINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY.

Mass vaccination policies are made at the federal level but vaccine laws are made at the state level, and it is at the state level where your action to protect your vaccine choice rights can have the greatest impact.

Signing up for NVIC’s free Advocacy Portal at www.NVICAdvocacy.org not only gives you access to practical, useful information to help you become an effective vaccine choice advocate in your own community, but when national vaccine issues come up, you will have the up-to-date information and call to action items you need at your fingertips to make sure your voice is heard.

So please, as your first step, sign up for the NVIC Advocacy Portal.

Contact Your Elected Officials

NVIC will help you learn how to effectively write or email your elected state representatives and share your concerns. You might want to call them, or better yet, make an appointment to visit them in person in their office. Don’t let them forget you!

It is so important for you to reach out and make sure your concerns get put on the radar screens of the leaders and opinion makers in your community, especially the politicians you elect and are directly involved in making vaccine laws in your state. These are your elected representatives, so you have a right and a responsibility to let them know what’s really happening in your life and the lives of people you know when it comes to vaccine mandates. Be sure to share the “real life” experiences that you or people you know have had with vaccination.

Share Your Story with the Media and People You Know

If you or a family member has suffered a serious vaccine reaction, injury or death, please consider sharing your experience with others. If we don’t share information and experiences with each other, everybody feels alone and afraid to speak up. Write a letter to the editor if you have a different perspective on a vaccine story that appears in your local newspaper. Make a call in to a radio talk show that is only presenting one side of the vaccine story.

I must be frank with you – you have to be brave because you might be strongly criticized for daring to talk about the “other side” of the vaccine story. Be prepared for it and have the courage to not back down. Only by sharing our perspective and what we know to be true about vaccination will the public conversation about vaccination open up so people are not afraid to talk about it.

We cannot allow the drug companies and medical trade associations funded by drug companies to dominate the conversation about vaccination. The vaccine injured cannot be swept under the carpet and treated like nothing more than “statistically acceptable collateral damage” of national one-size-fits-all mass vaccination policies that put way too many people at risk for injury and death. We shouldn’t be treating people like guinea pigs instead of human beings.

Internet Resources Where You Can Learn More

I encourage you to visit the following web pages on the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) website at www.NVIC.org:

–Vaccine Freedom Wall: View or post descriptions of harassment by doctors or government officials for making independent vaccine choices.

Connect with Your Doctor or Find a New One that Will Listen and Care

If your pediatrician or doctor refuses to provide medical care to you or your child unless you agree to get vaccines you don’t want, I strongly encourage you to have the courage to find another doctor. Harassment, intimidation, and refusal of medical care is becoming the modus operandi of the medical establishment in an effort to stop the change in attitude of many parents about vaccinations after they become truly educated about health and vaccination.

However, there is hope.

At least 15 percent of young doctors recently polled admit that they’re starting to adopt a more individualized approach to vaccinations in direct response to the vaccine safety concerns of parents. It is good news that there is a growing number of smart young doctors, who prefer to work as partners with parents in making personalized vaccine decisions for children, including delaying vaccinations or giving children fewer vaccines on the same day or continuing to provide medical care for those families, who decline use of one or more vaccines.

So take the time to locate a doctor, who treats you with compassion and respect and is willing to work with you to do what is right for your child.","2013-07-17 05:47:32","0","183.0","53.0","76.0","0.0","70.0","0.0","98.0","41.0","0.0","221.0","0.0","47.0","2","3101","86.89","76.01","26.61","19.96","28.71","28.18","80.65","44.47","7.84","4.06","0.10","0.19","2.55","0.42","0.81","3.77","6.13","15.09","6.48","4.03","6.61","1.06","12.16","4.77","3.00","1.52","3.16","2.10","5.19","2.39","2.77","0.58","0.26","0.61","9.58","0.52","0.10","1.19","0.10","12.38","3.19","2.48","1.55","2.87","1.00","4.10","1.23","0.42","0.26","0.23","5.19","0.87","4.58","0.58","0.03","8.00","1.52","0.84","3.55","1.10","1.48","2.74","7.93","0.77","11.83","1.52","5.93","4.68","4.06","0.26","0.16","0.52","0.00","0.77","0.10","0.00","0.03","0.03","0.03","0.00","13.96","4.19","5.93","0.32","0.00","0.03","0.10","1.16","0.77","0.61","0.71","0.13","15416","8.03","30.057692307692307","4825","3063","118","45.09","14.3","13.4","13.29","16.1","603","12.125","20.274632713026445","1096","26.62","76","0.42","2","129","86","232","0","401","252","16","3","36","477","288","2","248","0","0","98","45","130","6","1","10","96","0","119","66","81","86","74","78","20","22","0","11"

Because I had been through the Pentagon right after 9/11. About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, “Sir, you’ve got to come in and talk to me a second.” I said, “Well, you’re too busy.” He said, “No, no.” He says, “We’ve made the decision we’re going to war with Iraq.” This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, “We’re going to war with Iraq? Why?” He said, “I don’t know.” He said, “I guess they don’t know what else to do.” So I said, “Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?” He said, “No, no.” He says, “There’s nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.” He said, “I guess it’s like we don’t know what to do about terrorists, but we’ve got a good military and we can take down governments.” And he said, “I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.”

So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, “Are we still going to war with Iraq?” And he said, “Oh, it’s worse than that.” He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, “I just got this down from upstairs” — meaning the Secretary of Defense’s office — “today.” And he said, “This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.” I said, “Is it classified?” He said, “Yes, sir.” I said, “Well, don’t show it to me.” And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, “You remember that?” He said, “Sir, I didn’t show you that memo! I didn’t show it to you!”","2013-09-05 10:46:15","0","51.0","32.0","76.0","0.0","64.0","0.0","72.0","41.0","0.0","165.0","0.0","37.0","2","367","40.96","85.61","29.17","14.48","11.84","10.08","89.92","57.49","21.25","16.62","6.54","2.45","1.63","5.18","0.82","4.63","4.90","14.71","7.36","5.18","6.54","3.00","23.16","2.45","1.91","1.36","2.45","1.36","3.00","1.09","1.91","0.27","1.09","0.00","18.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.99","8.72","2.45","1.91","0.54","2.18","0.54","2.18","7.90","1.91","5.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.26","2.72","0.27","4.09","1.63","0.54","11.99","11.17","1.36","12.26","2.45","5.18","4.90","3.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.09","1.36","0.00","0.00","0.27","1.09","0.00","38.15","6.27","11.99","0.27","0.00","1.63","0.54","0.27","11.99","4.63","0.00","0.54","1369","5.79","34.90909090909091","441","366","30","92.93","7.7","3.3","5.84","4.2","36","4.9375","10.814426229508198","184","28.09","20","0.58","0","17","8","26","0","36","12","1","0","1","32","37","0","8","0","0","65","1","17","0","0","6","18","0","14","38","9","2","20","9","1","3","0","2"

"http://realfarmacy.com/yes-people-want-gmo-food-labeled/","Yes, People Want GMO Food Labeled","Americans overwhelmingly support labeling foods that have been genetically modified or engineered, according to a New York Times poll conducted this year, with 93 percent of respondents saying that foods containing such ingredients should be identified.

Three-quarters of Americans expressed concern about genetically modified organisms in their food, with most of them worried about the effects on people’s health.

Thirty-seven percent of those worried about G.M.O.’s said they feared that such foods cause cancer or allergies, although scientific studies continue to show that there is no added risk.

Among those with concerns, 26 percent said these foods are not safe to eat, or are toxic, while 13 percent were worried about environmental problems that they fear might be caused by genetic engineering.

Nearly half of Americans said they were aware that a large amount of the processed or packaged foods they now buy at the grocery store contains genetically modified ingredients. And although just a handful of G.M.O. crops are on the market, about 4 in 10 respondents said they thought that most or a lot of their fruits and vegetables were genetically modified.

"https://realfarmacy.com/onions-harnessing-powerful-anti-inflammatory-properties/","Onions: Harnessing Powerful Anti-Inflammatory Properties","What really produces the anti-inflammatory properties in onions are antioxidant phytonutrients. Compounds like quercetin and anthocyanin work to prevent the oxidation of fatty acids. They also act to reduce inflammation throughout the body.

Quercetin, according to Arthritis Today, has been shown to inhibit or stop leukotrines, histamines, and prostaglandins (inflammation causers) in both rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis. Additionally, quercetin has been recognized for inhibiting the inflammatory enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, which helps prevent inflammation.

Another Argentinian study on rats showed that both garlic and onions have the ability to reduce inflammation in animals that had developed insulin resistance after a steady diet of fructose. According to those researchers:

“These results highlight the importance of the consumption of natural vegetables and also contribute to the understanding of the beneficial effects of functional foods in the prevention of METS (metabolic syndrome).”

"http://realfarmacy.com/the-downward-spiral-gmo-crops-and-superbugs/","The Downward Spiral: GMO Crops and Superbugs","Superweeds are not the only catastrophe resulting from the biotech industry’s drive to flood our fields with chemicals and GM crops. There is scientific evidence that the western corn rootworm, a major pest of corn monoculture, has developed resistance to Bt corn. Of course, Monsanto denies this.

Bt corn is genetically engineered to emit a toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis (a microorganism commonly used for biological pest control). This Monsanto product now makes up 65 percent of the corn planted in the U.S. Maternal and fetal exposure to Bt toxin has been documented, and the presence of this toxin in so much of our processed food may be contributing to rising cases of gastrointestinal and autoimmune problems.

The biotech industry spends millions every year lobbying Congress to protect its ironclad grip on the agricultural industry. Apparently it has equal sway with the EPA. A majority of independent science advisers told the EPA that farmers should use 50% of their cropland for a “refuge” to suppress the emergence of Bt resistant pests. But the biotech industry managed to convince EPA to set only a 20% refuge requirement.

A “refuge” is an area planted with non-Bt crops which provides a supply of insects that remain susceptible to Bt. Insects from the refuge will breed with insects from the Bt fields and produce non-resistant offspring, thus reducing the emergence of resistant populations.

But Monsanto is only concerned with profits and successfully convinced EPA to dramatically reduce the refuge requirements, so 30% more field space can be planted with their product. This has likely contributed to the emergence of Bt-resistant pests.

Of course, Monsanto has a plan. They have developed a newer GM corn with two strains of Bt toxin plus the RoundUp Ready gene. Now we can have not one but two Bt toxins in our blood and rest assured that the corn has been drenched with glyphosate as well!

Superweeds and superbugs are two of the ways in which GM foods are taking our agricultural system into a downward spiral. Evolutionary arms races between plants and animals have been going on for all of life’s history, but the biotech industry is giving enormous advantage to crop pests and weeds.

The preeminence of herbicide-resistant and toxin-emitting crops also means that alternative methods of Integrated Pest Management, such as crop rotation that significantly reduces pest outbreaks, are virtually ignored by the industry.

In the face of this we must practice our own sound pest management strategies and spread the word to farmers who may be dazzled by Monsanto propaganda. Scientific research will keep exposing the biotech industry’s false claims that they own the path to sustainability.

"http://realfarmacy.com/indian-farmers-growing-record-yields-with-no-gmo-crops-or-pesticides/","Indian Farmers Growing Record Yields With No GMO Crops or Pesticides","Contrary to claims by Monsanto and government conspirators, we can indeed meet the world’s hunger without the use of genetically modified seed and manufactured chemicals. Bumper crops of rice, potatoes, and wheat are being grown in India using methods of Agroecology.

Agroecology is a dynamic agricultural approach that uses scientific information and local knowledge to produce practical methods that are low-cost and ecologically sound. This is quite a contrast to the “one size fits all” approach of GMO crops and chemical inputs being peddled by Monsanto and friends.

A particular kind of agroecology called System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is being applied in India to produce the record-setting yields.

SRI was developed in the 1980’s in Madagascar by Fr. Henri de Laulanié, S.J. He sought to improve their agricultural systems without being dependent on external inputs, as poverty was a widespread problem. Fr. Laulanié established a non-governmental organization that began working with the Cornell International Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development in 1994.

Now, SRI “is being hailed as one of the most significant developments of the past 50 years for the world’s 500 million small-scale farmers and the two billion people who depend on them.”

SRI is basically a change in the management of plants, soil, water and nutrients for irrigated rice. Seedlings are planted at a younger stage and spaced farther apart to encourage greater root and canopy growth and to increase yield per plant. These principles have more recently been applied to other crops like wheat, sugar cane, and millet, where it is known as System of Crop Intensification (SCI).

Water is carefully managed and applied at precise stages. Organic matter such as composted manure is routinely introduced to maintain tilth and microbial development. Even the process of weeding contributes to soil improvements. A simple rotary hoe used at certain times puts decomposed weeds back into the soil, aerates the soil, and stimulates root growth by root pruning.

It is basically using resources more wisely. SRI and SCI offer a long-term, sustainable future of agriculture for no extra cost, instead of patented GMO seeds and proprietary chemicals to enslave farmers in debt.

“Farmers use less seeds, less water and less chemicals but they get more without having to invest more. This is revolutionary,” said Dr Surendra Chaurassa from Bihar’s agriculture ministry. “I did not believe it to start with, but now I think it can potentially change the way everyone farms. I would want every state to promote it. If we get 30-40% increase in yields, that is more than enough to recommend it.”

Movements are growing around the world to embrace sustainable, efficient, and localized systems of agriculture. There is growing resistance to the efforts of Monsanto, western governments, and billionaire bankrollers to shove GMO crops down the world’s throat. The realities of local economies and the increasing knowledge of informed citizens will overcome the GMO juggernaut.

"http://realfarmacy.com/3-lies-your-doctor-may-tell-you-about-joint-pain/","3 Lies Your Doctor May Tell You About Joint Pain","Many people seem to accept as fate that they will become less active as they get older. They unwittingly believe that it’s normal to be plagued by stiffness, soreness and pain as they age. Well, I’m here to tell you that this false belief can cause you to suffer unnecessarily.

Imagine what your life would be like without joint pain. What if throbbing, aching joints never made you think twice about doing the activities you used to enjoy? Imagine being able to play 18 holes of golf effortlessly or sit through a movie without getting stiff. How about being able to get out of bed in the morning without feeling those creaks and pops, ready to take on the day?

Staying Active Is the Fountain of Youth

Here’s a simple truth to remember. Nothing does more for your quality of life and longevity than staying active as you age. And what usually keeps people from staying active is some combination of believing that aches and pains are a NORMAL part of the aging process, and quite simply, bad advice from their doctors. Despite what your doctor might tell you, there’s an underlying cause for joint pain that may have nothing to do with your age. (More on that later). But first, it’s important to understand that the conventional approach to joint pain is basically to band-aid the issue with painkillers.



Don’t Let Big Pharma Take Away Your Best Years

The current medical mentality on pain management has spurred a multibillion-dollar industry for Big Pharma. However, studies show that long-term use of seemingly “harmless” over-the-counter pills, such as ibuprofen, can actually weaken your joints over time, and prescription pain pills have a well-established track record of causing serious damage and even death. You may recall the tragedy that unfolded around the FDA-approved painkiller Vioxx, which claimed as many as 55,000 lives(and possibly up to 100,000) before the FDA banned it. It makes me wonder, is the next Vioxx lurking out there?

I’m on a mission to let people know that they have a choice when it comes to managing joint pain. Despite what your doctor might say, you don’t have to stop exercising and take painkilling medications just to maintain an acceptable quality of life as you get older. And any way you slice it, taking painkillers long term, even ibuprofen, is NOT safe.

LIE # 1: Exercise Makes Joint Pain Worse

If you’re suffering from any kind of joint pain, the commonly held belief is that additional “wear and tear” will make it worse. But the problem with this idea is that it doesn’t take into account the body’s inherent ability to repair damage and that physical activity actually stimulates this repair. The fact is, inactivity is known to weaken muscles and decrease joint flexibility.

Yet, strangely, if you go to your doctor complaining of joint pain, you’ll probably be told to “rest up.” However, it’s scientific fact that low-impact exercise, such as walking or biking, is highly beneficial to your joints because it increases circulation, which in turn enhances your body’s natural ability heal joint tissue and protect it from further damage.

But what if the pain is too great to consider being active? Keep reading, as I’ll reveal how you can safely begin to heal your joints so that you can start exercising slowly.

LIE # 2: Painkillers Are a Safe, Long-Term Solution

At their doctor’s suggestion, many people take over-the-counter pain medications like aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen day after day, under the assumption that it’s perfectly safe to do so. You can blame this at least in part on those fancy pharmaceutical ads that make it seem like these pills are side effect-free. But this is far from the truth. What those ads won’t tell you, and what your doctor may not know, is that these pills have serious negative health consequences when taken for long periods of time. For example, shocking new research shows that long-term use of ibuprofen may actually damage your joints over time, since one way it reduces pain is by suppressing the natural healing process. These pills also have other serious side effects including liver and kidney damage, stomach bleeding, ulcers and increased heart attack and stroke risk.

LIE # 3: Natural Products Don’t Work

Here’s a funny thing about doctors. Recent surveys show that the majority of them take supplements on a daily basis, but many balk at the notion of recommending them to their patients. But when it comes to managing joint pain, the fact is that thousands of scientific studies prove that natural products do work — often times better than prescription drugs.

Isn’t it a doctor’s responsibility to recommend the most effective and safest solution? Let me remind you that properly prescribed pharmaceutical drugs are thought to kill approximately 100,000 people each year. Guess how many people died from taking dietary supplements last year? The government’s own CDC reports ZERO. For this reason, I contend that any doctor who fails to recommend natural joint health products, at least as an option to more dangerous over-the-counter or prescription pills, is committing a form of malpractice. After all, doctors take an oath in which they vow to heal — not write prescriptions.

Does Your Joint Supplement Belong in the ’80s?

The combination of glucosamine and chondroitin has become the most widely used natural remedy for joint pain — and for a good reason. Hundreds of studies have shown that it’s safe, helps to protect and rebuild cartilage and is effective to some degree for a large portion of joint pain sufferers. That being said, the research on joint health has taken major steps forward since glucosamine-chondroitin was first popularized in the 80s.

One of the major discoveries in recent years is that supplementing with hyaluronic acid (also known as HA) can revitalize synovial fluid, a thick gel-like substance that surrounds cartilage, acting as a lubricant and shock absorber. Nowadays, a number of popular joint-support formulas contain some combination of glucosamine, chondroitin and HA. However, while important, these three ingredients don’t address what many leading experts now believe to be the root cause of 90% of joint-pain problems.

Most Supplements Fail to Address This Critical Issue

Temporary inflammation is a normal part of your body’s natural healing process. But when inflammation becomes chronic, the health consequences can be dire. Unfortunately, as a combined result of exposure to toxins, consumption of processed foods and other factors, many people unknowingly suffer from “invisible” chronic low-grade inflammation. It’s now thought this is one of the leading causes of joint pain and discomfort throughout your body.

The problem I have with most joint-support supplements is that their ingredients are designed to focus only on the joints themselves and don’t have any ingredients that fight the inflammation that is causing the pain. If you don’t address the larger systemwide issue, then you’re only fixing a small part of a larger problem. That’s why the very best joint-support supplements out there are packed with natural inflammation fighters. It’s simply the very best way to ensure immediate and long-lasting relief for your entire body, not just specific areas.

Fascinating new research shows that there are a number of powerful and perfectly safe herbs that work amazingly well at beating back chronic low-grade inflammation and healing your whole body with amazing effectiveness. These herbs have been used in traditional medicine around the world for thousands of years. But it’s not just anecdotes and folklore. Breakthrough scientific studies are proving that these ancient remedies can be safer and more effective than the toxic potions conjured up by modern medicine.

I’ve read thousands of studies on various inflammation-fighting herbs and have experimented with dozens of them myself over the years. There are many good ones out there, so where do you start?

The five herbal inflammation-fighters that have consistently stood out from all the rest are boswellia, curcumin, ginger, tart cherry and bromelain. Let me explain why.



The Ancient Herbal Solution to Joint Pain

Hundreds of years ago in India, when people complained of aching joints and muscles, Ayurvedic healers prescribed an extract made from the unique bark of the Boswellia tree. Today, we know much more about this ancient herbal remedy and the compound, called Boswellia serrata, has been proven to be a powerful inflammation fighter capable of providing fast, long-lasting relief. In a landmark gold-standard study conducted at UC Davis, boswellia was shown to ease knee pain and stiffness within just seven days. And in a breakthrough study just completed last year, researchers found that boswellia inhibits the production of key inflammatory molecules, which helps to prevent the breakdown of cartilage!

The Amazing Healing Spices of Life

The great land of India has gifted us with a few powerful all-around inflammation fighters. Curcumin, a compound found in the curry spice turmeric, has been proven in studies to inhibit the synthesis of inflammatory substances throughout the body, decreasing pain and stiffness while enhancing immunity and even protecting the brain against cognitive decline. Ginger is another powerful spice that has many of the same benefits as curcumin and demonstrates remarkable anti-inflammatory properties. In my experience, curcumin and ginger synergistically work together as a dynamic duo, fighting back inflammation with ease and providing fast-acting pain relief.



What Pineapple Upside-Down Cake Has To Do with Joint Pain

A pineapple and cherry-studded upside-down cake may be a far cry from a joint health solution, but it sure is delicious. Interestingly though, pineapple has been used for centuries to reduce pain and inflammation. It turns out that an enzyme found in pineapples called bromelain does, in fact, have scientifically proven medicinal benefits. Studies have shown that bromelain reduces swelling, bruising, healing time and pain. Similarly, cherries also contain unique anti-inflammatory antioxidant compounds that specifically target muscle tissue, making cherry extract an important component of any joint-healing strategy. According to researchers at Oregon Health & Science University, cherry extract may be a safer way to treat muscle pain and inflammation than over-the-counter pain relievers.



The Sulfur Solution to Inflammation

In addition to the top five herbal inflammation-fighters, many people (myself included) have had incredible success using a natural form of sulfur called MSM to beat back inflammation and increase joint flexibility. Sulfur is critical to the health of your joints, yet most of us are actually deficient because it’s become largely removed in our food supply due to soil depletion. MSM works to soothe joints by making cartilage cells pliable, which ensures that harmful substances flow out and nutrients flow in, which speeds up the regeneration of the cartilage that cushions your joints. In fact, a recent gold-standard clinical trial, showed without a doubt that MSM provided significant reductions in knee pain and back pain.

"http://realfarmacy.com/45-uses-for-lemons-that-will-blow-your-socks-off/","45 Uses For Lemons That Will Blow Your Socks Off","Most people are familiar with the traditional uses for lemons to soothe sore throats and add some citrus flavor to our foods.

However the diversity of applications for lemons far exceeds general knowledge and once you read the following list, you’ll likely want to stock at least a few lemons in your kitchen 24-7.

1. Freshen the Fridge

Remove refrigerator odors with ease. Dab lemon juice on a cotton ball or sponge and leave it in the fridge for several hours. Make sure to toss out any malodorous items that might be causing the bad smell.

2. High Blood Pressure

Lemon contains potassium which controls high blood pressure and reduces the effect of nausea and dizziness.

3. Prevent Cauliflower From Turning Brown

Cauliflower tend to turn brown with even the slightest cooking. You can make sure the white vegetables stay white by squeezing a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice on them before heating.

4. Mental Health

Lemon water can also prep up your mood and relieve you from depression and stress. Long distance walkers and world travelers as well as explorers look upon the lemon as a Godsend. When fatigue begins, a lemon is sucked through a hole in the top. Quick acting medicine it is, giving almost unbelievable refreshments.

5. Refresh Cutting Boards

No wonder your kitchen cutting board smells! After all, you use it to chop onions, crush garlic, and prepare fish. To get rid of the smell and help sanitize the cutting board, rub it all over with the cut side of half a lemon or wash it in undiluted juice straight from the bottle.

6. Respiratory Problems

Lemon water can reduce phlegm; and can also help you breathe properly and aids a person suffering with asthma.

7. Treating Arthritis and Rheumatism

Lemon is a diuretic – assists in the production of urine which helps you to reduce inflammation by flushing out toxins and bacteria while also giving you relief from arthritis and rheumatism.

8. Prevents Kidney Stones

Regular consumption of the refreshing drink — or even lemon juice mixed with water — may increase the production of urinary citrate, a chemical in the urine that prevents the formation of crystals that may build up into kidney stones.

9. Keep Insects Out of the Kitchen

You don’t need insecticides or ant traps to ant-proof your kitchen. Just give it the lemon treatment. First squirt some lemon juice on door thresholds and windowsills. Then squeeze lemon juice into any holes or cracks where the ants are getting in. Finally, scatter small slices of lemon peel around the outdoor entrance. The ants will get the message that they aren’t welcome. Lemons are also effective against roaches and fleas: Simply mix the juice of 4 lemons (along with the rinds) with 1/2 gallon (2 liters) water and wash your floors with it; then watch the fleas and roaches flee. They hate the smell.

10. Anti-Aging

Lemon water reduces the production of free radicals which are responsible for aging skin and skin damage. Lemon water is calorie free and an antioxidant.

11. Fruit and Vegetable Wash

You never know what kind of pesticides or dirt may be lurking on the skin of your favorite fruits and vegetables. Slice your lemon and squeeze out one tablespoon of lemon juice into your spray bottle. The lemon juice is a natural disinfectant and will leave your fruits and vegetables smelling nice too.

12. Treat Infections

Lemon water can fight throat infections thanks to its antibacterial property. If salt water does not work for you, try lime and water for gargling.

13. Deodorize Your Garbage

If your garbage is beginning to smell yucky, here’s an easy way to deodorize it: Save leftover lemon and orange peels and toss them at the base under the bag. To keep it smelling fresh, repeat once every couple of weeks.

14. Keep Guacamole Green

You’ve been making guacamole all day long for the big party, and you don’t want it to turn brown on top before the guests arrive. The solution: Sprinkle a liberal amount of fresh lemon juice over it and it will stay fresh and green. The flavor of the lemon juice is a natural complement to the avocados in the guacamole. Make the fruit salad hours in advance too. Just squeeze some lemon juice onto the apple slices, and they’ll stay snowy white.

15. Purges The Blood

We consume a lot of junk food or food with a lot of preservatives and artificial flavors. This builds up a lot of toxins in the blood and body but daily consumption of lemon water helps to purify the blood.

16. Make Soggy Lettuce Crisp

Don’t toss that soggy lettuce into the garbage. With the help of a little lemon juice you can toss it in a salad instead. Add the juice of half a lemon to a bowl of cold water. Then put the soggy lettuce in it and refrigerate for 1 hour. Make sure to dry the leaves completely before putting them into salads or sandwiches.

17. Oral Health

Lemon juice also stops bleeding gums and reduces toothaches

18. Lighten Age Spots

Why buy expensive creams when you’ve got lemon juice? To lighten liver spots or freckles, try applying lemon juice directly to the area. Let it sit for 15 minutes and then rinse your skin clean. It’s a safe and effective skin-lightening agent.

19. Create Blonde Highlights

For salon-worthy highlights, add 1/4 cup lemon juice to 3/4 cup water and rinse your hair with the mixture. Then, sit in the sun until your hair dries. To maximize the effect, repeat once daily for up to a week.

20. Make a Room Scent/Humidifier

Freshen and moisturize the air in your home on dry winter days. Make your own room scent that also doubles as a humidifier. If you have a wood-burning stove, place an enameled cast-iron pot or bowl on top, fill with water, and add lemon (and/or orange) peels, cinnamon sticks, cloves, and apple skins. No wood-burning stove? Use your stovetop instead and just simmer the water periodically.

21. Clean and Whiten Nails

Pamper your hands without a manicurist. Add the juice of 1/2 lemon to 1 cup warm water and soak your fingertips in the mixture for 5 minutes. After pushing back the cuticles, rub some lemon peel back and forth against the nail.

22. Cleanse Your Face

Zap zits naturally by dabbing lemon juice on blackheads to draw them out during the day. You can also wash your face with lemon juice for a natural cleanse and exfoliation. Your skin should improve after several days of treatment. Lemon water is also a cooling agent, best way to beat the heat.

23. Freshen Your Breath

Make an impromptu mouthwash by rinsing with lemon juice straight from the bottle. Swallow for longer-lasting fresh breath. The citric acid in the juice alters the pH level in your mouth, killing bacteria that causes bad breath. Rinse after a few minutes because long-term exposure to the acid in lemons can harm tooth enamel.

24. Treat Flaky Dandruff

If itchy, scaly dandruff has you scratching your head, relief may be no farther away than your refrigerator. Just massage two tablespoons lemon juice into your scalp and rinse with water. Then stir one teaspoon lemon juice into one cup water and rinse your hair with it. Repeat daily until your dandruff disappears.

25. Get Rid of Tough Stains on Marble

You probably think of marble as stone, but it is really petrified calcium (also known as old seashells). That explains why it is so porous and easily stained and damaged. Those stains can be hard to remove. If washing won’t remove a stubborn stain, try this: Cut a lemon in half, dip the exposed flesh into some table salt, and rub it vigorously on the stain. But do this only as a last resort; acid can damage marble. Rinse well. Use These Lemons To Clean – Easy and Effective

26. Remove Berry Stains

It sure was fun to pick your own berries, but now your fingers are stained with berry juice that won’t come off no matter how much you scrub with soap and water. Try washing your hands with undiluted lemon juice, then wait a few minutes and wash with warm, soapy water. Repeat until your hands are stain-free.

27. Soften Dry, Scaly Elbows

Itchy elbows are bad enough, but they look terrible too. For better looking (and feeling) elbows, mix baking soda and lemon juice to make an abrasive paste, then rub it into your elbows for a soothing, smoothing, and exfoliating treatment. Rinse your extremities in a mixture of equal parts lemon juice and water, then massage with olive oil and dab dry with a soft cloth.

28. Headaches

Lemon juice with a few teaspoons of hot tea added is the treatment of a sophisticated New York bartender, for those who suffer with hangover headaches–and from headaches due to many other causes. He converts his customers to this regime, and weans them away from drug remedies completely.

29. Chills and Fevers

Chills and fevers may be due to a variety of causes; never the less the lemon is always a helpful remedy. Spanish physicians regard it as an infallible friend.

30. Diptheria

Skip the vaccine for this disease. Lemon Juice Treatment still proves as one of the most powerful antiseptics and the strong digestive qualities of the fruit are admired around the world. With the juice every hour or two, and at the same time, 1/2 to 1 tsp. should be swallowed. This cuts loose the false membrane in the throat and permits it to come out.

31. Vaginal Hygiene

Diluted lemon juice makes a safe and sane method of vaginal hygiene. Though it is a powerful antiseptic it is nevertheless free from irritating drugs in douches and suppositories.

32. Forget The Moth Balls

A charming French custom to keep closets free from moths is to take ripe lemons and stick them with cloves all over the skin. The heavily studded lemons slowly dry with their cloves, leaving a marvelous odor throughout the closets and rooms.

33. Stomach Health

Digestive problems are the most common ailments but warm water and lime juice is the solution to most digestive problems. Lemon juice helps to purify the blood, reduces your chances of indigestion, constipation, eliminates toxins from the body, adds digestion and reduces phlegm.

34. Disinfect Cuts and Scrapes

Stop bleeding and disinfect minor cuts and scraps by pouring a few drops of lemon juice directly on the cut. You can also apply the juice with a cotton ball and hold firmly in place for one minute.

35. Soothe Poison Ivy Rash

You won’t need an ocean of calamine lotion the next time poison ivy comes a-creeping. Just apply lemon juice directly to the affected area to soothe itching and alleviate the rash.

36. Remove Warts

You’ve tried countless remedies to banish warts and nothing seems to work. Next time, apply a dab of lemon juice directly to the wart using a cotton swab. Repeat for several days until the acids in the lemon juice dissolve the wart completely.

37. Bleach Delicate Fabrics

Avoid additional bleach stains by swapping ordinary household chlorine bleach with lemon juice, which is milder but no less effective. Soak your delicates in a mixture of lemon juice and baking soda for at least half an hour before washing.

38. Clean Tarnished Brass and Polish Chrome

Say good-bye to tarnish on brass, copper, or stainless steel. Make a paste of lemon juice and salt (or substitute baking soda or cream of tartar for the salt) and coat the affected area. Let it stay on for 5 minutes. Then wash in warm water, rinse, and polish dry. Use the same mixture to clean metal kitchen sinks too. Apply the paste, scrub gently, and rinse. Get rid of mineral deposits and polish chrome faucets and other tarnished chrome. Simply rub lemon rind over the chrome and watch it shine! Rinse well and dry with a soft cloth.

39. Replace Your Dry Cleaner

Ditch the expensive dry-cleaning bills (and harsh chemicals) with this homegrown trick. Simply scrub the stained area on shirts and blouses with equal parts lemon juice and water. Your “pits” will be good as new, and smell nice too.

40. Boost Laundry Detergent

For more powerful cleaning action, pour 1 cup lemon juice into the washer during the wash cycle. The natural bleaching action of the juice will zap stains and remove rust and mineral discolorations from cotton T-shirts and briefs and will leave your clothes smelling fresh. Your clothes will turn out brighter and also come out smelling lemon-fresh.

41. Rid Clothes of Mildew

Have you ever unpacked clothes you stored all winter and discovered some are stained with mildew? To get rid of it, make a paste of lemon juice and salt and rub it on the affected area, then dry the clothes in sunlight. Repeat the process until the stain is gone.

42. Eliminate Fireplace Odor

There’s nothing cozier on a cold winter night than a warm fire burning in the fireplace â€” unless the fire happens to smell horrible. Next time you have a fire that sends a stench into the room, try throwing a few lemon peels into the flames. Or simply burn some lemon peels along with your firewood as a preventive measure.

43. Neutralize Cat-Box Odor

You don’t have to use an aerosol spray to neutralize foul-smelling cat-box odors or freshen the air in your bathroom. Just cut a couple of lemons in half. Then place them, cut side up, in a dish in the room, and the air will soon smell lemon-fresh.

44. Deodorize a Humidifier

When your humidifier starts to smell funky, deodorize it with ease: Just pour 3 or 4 teaspoons lemon juice into the water. It will not only remove the off odor but will replace it with a lemon-fresh fragrance. Repeat every couple of weeks to keep the odor from returning.

45. Reduce Asthma Symptoms

In addition to a general detoxifying diet, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice before each meal, and before retiring can reduce asthma symptoms.

* If you do consume lemon peel, stick to organic lemons to reduce your pesticide exposure.

"http://realfarmacy.com/government-funded-study-on-cannabis-proves-government-wrong/","Government Funded Study on Cannabis, Proves Government Wrong","A recent study conducted by the University of California, Center for Medicinal Cannabis, sheds light on government prohibition of marijuana and its ridiculous implications. The irony here is that this study, published in The Open Neurology Journal, was sponsored by government.

The hypocrisy of marijuana remaining a Schedule 1 drug, “No Medical Use Whatsoever,” seems criminal when considering that pharmaceutical companies reproduce a chemical version of THC and are able to market and sell it as such. Marinol is a pharmaceutical chemical drug produced by Solvay Pharmaceuticals Inc. It contains the exact molecular structure of the THC molecule and has the same effects of marijuana. However you cannot grow Marinol in your backyard. You cannot make obscene profits from the patent of a plant, because luckily, the state has not granted their mega –corporations the ability to patent nature, yet. The contradiction here is that you can make nature illegal, and then recreate nature in a lab using chemicals, put that illegal part of nature, available for profit, into a pill and make millions.

The government funded study, appropriately titled, Medical Marijuana: Clearing Away the Smoke, concludes: “Based on evidence currently available the Schedule I classification is not tenable; it is not accurate that cannabis has no medical value, or that information on safety is lacking…. The continuing conflict between scientific evidence and political ideology will hopefully be reconciled in a judicious manner.”

NSA.gov has been unavailable globally as of late Friday afternoon, and Twitter accounts belonging to people loosely affiliated with the Anonymous hacktivism movement have suggested they are responsible.

Twitter users @AnonymousOwn3r and @TruthIzSexy both were quick to comment on the matter, and implied that a distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS, may have been waged as an act of protest against the NSA.

(Medical Daily) People often don’t know much medical care truly costs and usually concern themselves with the co-pay required after an office visit. But the dark underbelly of insurance systems is that medical costs have skyrocketed and patients without medical insurance have to pay astronomical prices because of politics and not because of cost of care. This is one of the factors that led a Portland, Maine physician to stop accepting insurance, private or governmental, from his patients.

Dr. Michael Ciampi changed the policy in his office on April 1 of this year, knowing that he would be better serving his patients by not being told what to do by insurance companies and government health care systems. The doctor has posted prices of office visits and procedures on the website of his practice. What would seem astronomical, $150 for an office visit, is actually cheap if one considers how much is paid for health insurance in premiums each year.

Dr. Ciampi told the Bangor Daily News that of his 2,000 patients, only a few hundred decided to stop coming to the office because of the policy change. The doctor is free to now make house calls and charge affordable rates to patients who cannot afford health care.

TheLunchTray.com

How is it economically feasible to ship chicken all the way to China and back, just to cook it?

Many readers were baffled by the economics of an arrangement in which U.S. poultry is sent to China and back for processing. While a spokesperson for the National Chicken Council has said that few American poultry suppliers will take advantage of the opportunity, Toby Moore, a spokesman for the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, has been quoted as saying that, due to lower labor costs in China, ”[t]here will probably be some company that can see some niche market” in the arrangement. Tony Corbo of Food & Water Watch also noted that a Chinese processor could possibly sell locally parts of the chicken that are more desirable in China than in the United States, such as the feet and dark meat, and this could play into the economic feasibility of the arrangement.

Is USDA going to also lift the export ban on raw, Chinese-raised and -slaughtered poultry?

Allowing China to process our poultry is widely seen as the first step toward ultimately allowing China to export into the United States its own raw poultry.

There are questions, however, regarding the timing of such a development. On September 9, Politico reported that Al Almanza, administrator of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, informed Politico that USDA inspectors have already started inspecting Chinese slaughtering facilities, “a key prerequisite for China to begin selling its own, homegrown chicken to the U.S.”

If there are any safety concerns at all, why are we opening our markets to Chinese poultry?

As noted in my first post on this issue, the opening up of our markets to Chinese-processed (and later, Chinese-raised) poultry is a calculated effort to induce China to open its lucrative beef market to U.S. beef, which is presently banned in China due to a mad cow scare in 2003.

But the beef industry is not alone in pushing for the importation of Chinese chicken into the United States. With an eye toward a general (and profitable) liberalization of trade relations with China, the corporations and trade groups in support of this action constitute a veritable Who’s Who of American agriculture and food manufacturing: Monsanto, the Grocery Manufacturers’ Association, Cargill, Kraft, Tyson and many others, as well as representatives of the beef industry such as the American Meat Institute and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. (Take a look at the list of signatories on these 2009 industry-drafted letters on Chinese poultry importation, written to President Obama and Agriculture Secretary Vilsack.) It’s perhaps also worth noting that Cargill has recently opened a $250 million poultry processing plant in China.

What can I do to express my concerns about Chinese-processed poultry and/or the importation of Chinese poultry?

There are two avenues for readers to express their concern about Chinese-processed and Chinese-raised poultry in the United States.

With respect to school food,USDA has informed me that school districts have, at the present time, the option to purchase food products that are 100% domestically grown and processed. This is probably the most direct means of keeping Chinese chicken out of school food, though of course it requires action in every school district. A more efficient approach would have each state’s school food authority (“SFA,” i.e., the state agency charged with administering the National School Lunch Program, usually the state department of education) expressly require that its districts purchase only domestically raised and processed meats. I don’t know at the present time if this is possible, but if any Lunch Tray readers take the initiative and contact their state’s SFA to discuss this, I’d love to know what response you receive. I’ll do the same with the Texas Department of Agriculture, which is my state’s SFA.

As for the importation of Chinese-raised poultry, before this can happen, USDA will need to submit a proposed rule for public comment. This will obviously be a critical time to let USDA know how consumers feel about this proposal, as a needed counterweight to the lobbying of powerful industries evidenced in the two letters cited above. I will certainly let you know when and if USDA issues this proposed rule.

"https://realfarmacy.com/5-amazing-properties-of-sunlight/","5 Amazing Properties of Sunlight","Sunlight is well-known to provide us with vitamin D, but did you know that it kills pain, keeps us alert at night, burns fat and more?

Our biological connection and dependence to the sun is so profound, that the very variation in human skin color from African, melanin-saturated dark skin, to the relatively melanin de-pigmented, Caucasian lighter-skin, is a byproduct of the offspring of our last common ancestor from Africa (as determined by mitochondrial DNA) migrating towards sunlight-impoverished higher latitudes, which began approximately 60,000 years ago. In order to compensate for the lower availability of sunlight, the body rapidly adjusted, essentially requiring the removal of the natural “sunscreen” melanin from the skin, which interferes with vitamin D production; vitamin D, of course, is involved in the regulation of over 2,000 genes, and therefore is more like a hormone, without which our entire genetic infrastructure becomes destabilized.

While the health benefits of vitamin D are well-documented (GreenMedInfo.com has identified over 200 health conditions that may benefit from optimizing vitamin D levels: Vitamin D Health Benefits page, and Henry Lahore’s Vitamin D Wiki has far more), the therapeutic properties of sunlight are only now being explored in greater depth by the research community.

"http://realfarmacy.com/the-10-biggest-health-care-lies-in-america/","The 10 Biggest Health Care Lies in America","by MIKE ADAMS

Mainstream health care isn’t based on “health” or “caring.” It’s actually based on an engrained system of medical mythology that’s practiced — and defended — by those who profit from the continuation of sickness and disease. This system of medical mythology might also simply be called “lies”, and today I’m sharing with NaturalNews readers the top ten lies that are still followed and promoted under mainstream health care in America today.

Lie #1) Vaccines make you healthy

Vaccines have emerged as the greatest and most insidious mythology yet fabricated by western medicine. The idea that vaccines protect you from infectious disease is blatantly false in the long term because this year’s flu shot actually makes you more susceptible to next year’s influenza

On top of that, even the theoretical short-term effectiveness of vaccines is dwarfed by the far more effective protection offered by vitamin D and other immune-modulating nutrients.

Lie #2) Pharmaceuticals prevent disease

The big push by Big Pharma is now focused on treating healthy people with drugs as if pharmaceuticals were nutrients that could somehow prevent disease. This is the new push with cholesterol drugs: Give ‘em to everyone, whether they have high cholesterol or not!

But pharmaceuticals don’t prevent disease, and medications are not vitamins. Your body has no biological need for any pharmaceuticals at all. People who believe they need pharmaceuticals have simply been the victims of “fabricated consent” engineered by Big Pharma’s clever advertising and P.R. spin.

Lie #3) Doctors are experts in health

Doctors don’t even study health; they study disease. Modern doctors are taught virtually nothing about nutrition, wellness or disease prevention. Expecting a doctor to guide you on health issues is sort of like expecting your accountant to pilot a jet airliner — it’s simply not something he or she has ever been trained in.

That’s not to say doctors aren’t intelligent people. Most of them have high IQs. But even a genius can’t teach you something they know nothing about.

Lie #4) You have no role in your own healing

Doctors, drug companies and health authorities all want you to believe that your health is determined by their interventions. If you believe them, you have virtually no role in your own health or healing — it’s all managed by their drugs, their screening, their surgeries and their interventions.

Lie #5) Disease is a matter of bad luck or bad genes

Western medicine wants you to believe in the mythology of spontaneous disease — disease that strikes without cause. This is equivalent to saying that disease is some sort of voodoo black magic and that patients have no way to prevent disease through their own diets or lifestyle choices.

It’s funny, actually: Western medicine claims to be driven by scientific, rational thinking, and yet the entire industry still fails to acknowledge that chronic disease always has a cause and that most of the time, that cause has everything to do with nutritional deficiencies, exposure to toxic chemicals and a lack of exercise.

Disease is almost never a matter of bad luck or bad genes.

Lie #6) Screening equals prevention

Western medicine doesn’t believe in disease prevention. Rather, the industry believes in screening while calling it prevention. But screening isn’t prevention by even the wildest stretch of the imagination. In fact, virtually all the popular screening methodologies actually promote diseases.

Mammography, for example, emits so much radiation that it causes breast cancer in tens of thousands of women each year. Imaging dyes used in radiological scans can cause horrific side effects, and psychiatric “disorder” screening is little more than a thinly-disguised patient recruitment scheme disguised as medicine.

Real prevention of disease must involve disease prevention through nutrition, patient education about the causes of disease and lifelong changes in eating habits. Yet western medicine teaches absolutely none of these things. Heck, it doesn’t even believe in such ideas.

Lie #7) Health insurance will keep you healthy

This is a favorite lie of those who recently pushed for the Big Pharma-sponsored health care reform that has swept across America. The lie supposes that merely having health insurance will provide some sort of magical protection against disease. But in reality, health insurance doesn’t make you healthy! It is only YOU and your choices about foods, exposures to toxic chemicals, pursuit of exercise and time in nature that can make you healthy.

Health insurance is, in effect, a wager that you will get sick. How does gambling on your sickness provide any protection whatsoever for your health? It doesn’t. Personally, I’d rather bet on health than sickness, and the way to do that is to invest in nutritional supplements, organic produce, superfoods, physical fitness and non-toxic personal care products.

Lie #8) Hospitals are places of health and healing

If you want to stay healthy or get healthy, a hospital is the very last place you want to find yourself: They are unhappy, unhealthy places that are infested with antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Hospitals usually serve disease-promoting foods and lack health-enhancing sunlight, and potentially deadly mistakes with pharmaceuticals or surgical procedures now appear to be frighteningly common in U.S. hospitals.

Certainly, emergency rooms in hospitals play an important role in urgent care for injuries and accidents — and emergency room physicians do an amazing job saving lives — but for people with chronic, degenerative disease, a hospital is a very dangerous place to be. Unless you really need immediate critical care, try to avoid hospitals.

Lie #9) Conventional medicine is “advanced” state-of-the-art medicine

Even though doctors and health authorities try to pass off western medicine as being “advanced” or “modern,” the whole system is actually pathetically outdated and stuck in the germ theory of disease. Western medicine has yet to even acknowledge the role of nutrition in preventing disease — something that has been scientifically documented for at least the last several decades. Western medicine fails to acknowledge mind-body medicine and hilariously believes the mind plays virtually no role in healing.

Neither does western medicine acknowledge the bio energy field of living systems, nor that organ transplants carry memories, nor that living food is qualitatively different from dead food. Seriously: Conventional doctors still believe that dead food is exactly the same as living food! (And the USDA food pyramid still makes no distinction between the two…)

“Modern” medicine isn’t so modern, it turns out. It is, in fact, hopelessly outdated and desperately needs to upgrade its approach to health and wellness if it hopes to survive the next hundred years.

Lie #10) More research is needed to find “cures”

This lie is especially hilarious because western medicine does not believe in any “cure” for any disease. They aren’t even looking for cures! This lie has been repeated since the 1960′s, when cancer scientists claimed they were only a few years away from curing cancer. Today, four decades later, can you think of a single major disease that western medicine has cured? There aren’t any.

That’s because drug companies make money from sick people, not cured people. A patient cured is a patient lost. It is far more profitable to keep patients sick and pretend to “manage” their disease through a lifetime of pharmaceuticals. So when drug companies and disease non-profits claim to be searching for a “cure,” what they’re really doing is taking your money to fund more drug research to patent more medications that don’t actually cure anything.

Remember this the next time you’re asked to donate to some search for “the cure.” The cures already exist in nutrition, herbal remedies and naturopathic medicine, but Big Pharma and the conventional medicine cartel isn’t interested in real cures — they only want to promote the idea of a cure while pumping patients full of drugs that don’t cure anything.

Beyond the ten lies

When it comes to western health care, there are more than 10 lies, of course, but these big 10 lies are perhaps the most relevant to your own health decisions. By avoiding being suckered in by these lies, you can take charge of your own health and avoid the health care scam by staying healthy!

Staying healthy isn’t as difficult as you think, and it doesn’t require health insurance or disease screening. It only requires making informed, intelligent decisions about what to eat, what to put on your skin and how to get more sunshine and physical exercise. Once you do these basic things, you’ll find that you are no longer held victim by a western medicine health care system based on lies and outdated medical mythology.

It’s time for a revolution in medicine… a revolution that finally advances past the mental roadblock of a system of medical mythology stuck in the 1940′s. Don’t get me wrong, 1940′s medicine was great in the 1940′s. But this is no longer the 1940′s, and the germ theory of disease is hopelessly outdated when it comes to the primary diseases that are striking the population today. Yet the profiteers of our dishonest, outmoded health care system are doing everything in their power to keep us all stranded in the past, a past based on treating the body like a chemical battleground and attacking every disease with a patented pharmaceutical.

That whole approach to health care is so far outdated that it’s hilarious it can still be pushed with a straight face. No wonder doctors only spend an average of two minutes with patients these days. That’s the limit of how long they can hold their faces without breaking out in laughter at how stupid this whole “treat the symptoms and forget the causes” approach to health care really is. Even they know it! That’s why most doctors actually eat superfoods and take vitamins themselves, even if they never dare suggest it to patients.

True fact: It is illegal in every U.S. state for a doctor to recommend any vitamin, nutrient or food for the prevention or treatment of any disease. Doing so can cause a doctor to have his medical license permanently revoked. How crazy and outdated is that?

"http://realfarmacy.com/next-up-in-the-gmo-line-apples-and-dicamba-drenched-crops/","Next Up in the GMO Line: Apples and Dicamba-Drenched Crops","Emboldened by the U.S. government’s repeated willingness to unleash genetically modified food on its citizens, biotech companies have big plans for our future.

A Canadian biotech company called Okanagan Specialty Fruits developed a GM apple currently under review by the FDA. This would be one of the first genetically modified fruits on store shelves in the U.S. The “Arctic Apple” would not turn brown after being sliced or bitten into.

It seems almost funny, considering that people have never seemed to have a problem with this bit of browning during the apple’s thousands of years in cultivated existence.

Of course, the company touts all sorts of benefits the FrankenApple would provide. It would allow sliced apples to be sold in bags for convenient school lunches (it’s for the kids!), and restaurants could abandon the need to use preservatives to keep their fruit salads fresh (what about all the other fruits in there?).

Apple growers are worried because the introduction of a GMO fruit would force them to implement costly measures to protect against cross-contamination and would decrease sales to foreign markets where GMO labeling and restrictions exist.

Perhaps even scarier than a GM apple is the almost certain prospect of Monsanto’s next herbicide-resistant crop. Monsanto must be very assured of government approval, because they’ve already planted the stuff at “Ground-Breaker” demonstration plots in North and South Dakota for farm media.

The new GM crop is a soybean resistant to dicamba, a more toxic and more volatile herbicide than RoundUp. This development is causing extreme concern among farmers and concerned citizens due to the high volatility of dicamba during spraying. It is known to drift for miles, even 100 miles in one case where it damaged 15,000 acres of cotton and pomegranate orchard.

Monsanto has said they are working on a new formulation of dicamba that isn’t as volatile. Needless to say, folks aren’t buying the reassurances. Monsanto also issued guidelines for cleaning dicamba sprayer tanks that are so onerous and time-consuming it is hard to believe people will be able to follow them adequately.

Considering the astronomical rise in RoundUp sales after the RoundUp Ready system was introduced during the 1990s, Monsanto can look forward to huge profits as it sells another patented life form to dependent farmers along with patented chemicals.

And we can look forward to millions of acres of farmland being drenched in a more toxic and volatile herbicide, creating runoff into aquatic ecosystems and damaging crops and vegetable gardens of the unfortunate people who live nearby.

Let’s not forget that the industrial agriculture demand for another herbicide-resistant crop is due to the fact that weeds have developed resistance to RoundUp, the key component of Monsanto’s first foray into GMO herbicide resistance.

Monsanto creates the problem, then genetically engineers a solution to it, all the while making farmers dependent on their products. And when weeds develop resistance to dicamba, we can be assured that Monsanto is working on the next “solution.”

cornucopia.org

Why do we need more farmers? What is the driving force behind USDA policy? In an infuriating epiphany I have yet to metabolize, I found out Wednesday in a private policy-generation meeting with Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McCauliffe. I did and still do consider it a distinct honor for his staff to invite me as one of the 25 dignitaries in Virginia Agriculture for this think-tank session in Richmond.

It was a who’s who of Virginia agriculture: Farm Bureau, Va. Agribusiness Council, Va. Forestry Association, Va. Poultry Federation, Va. Cattlemen’s Ass., deans from Virginia Tech and Virginia State–you get the picture.

It was the first meeting of this kind I’ve ever attended that offered no water. The only thing to drink were soft drinks. Lunch was served in styrofoam clam shells–Lay’s potato chips, sandwiches, potato salad and chocolate chip cookie. It didn’t look very safe to me, so I didn’t partake. But I’d have liked a drink of water. In another circumstance, I might eat this stuff, but with these folks, felt it important to make a point.

Why do they all assume nobody wants water, nobody cares about styrofoam, everybody wants potato chips and we all want industrial meat-like slabs on white bread?

But I digress. The big surprise occurred a few minutes into the meeting: US Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack walked in. He was in Terry McCauliffe love-in mode. And here is what he told us: for the first time–2012– rural America lost population in real numbers–not as a percentage but in real numbers. It’s down to 16 percent of total population.

I’m sitting there thinking he’s going to say that number needs to go up so we have more people to love and steward the landscape. More people to care for earthworms. More people to grow food and fiber.

Are you ready for the shoe to drop? The epiphany? What could the US Secretary of Agriculture, at the highest strategic planning sessions of our land, be challenged by other leaders to change this figure, to get more people in rural America, to encourage farming and help more farms get started? What could be the driving reason to have more farmers? Why does he go to bed at night trying to figure out how to increase farmers? How does the President and other cabinet members view his role as the nation’s farming czar?

What could be the most important contribution that increasing farmers could offer to the nation? Better food? Better soil development? Better care for animals? Better care for plants?

Are you ready? Here’s his answer: although rural America only has 16 percent of the population, it gives 40 percent of the personnel to the military. Say what? You mean when it’s all said and done, at the end of the day, the bottom line–you know all the cliches–the whole reason for increasing farms is to provide cannon fodder for American imperial might. He said rural kids grow up with a sense of wanting to give something back, and if we lose that value system, we’ll lose our military might.

So folks, it all boils down to American military muscle. It’s not about food, healing the land, stewarding precious soil and resources; it’s all about making sure we keep a steady stream of youngsters going into the military. This puts an amazing twist on things. You see, I think we should have many more farmers, and have spent a lifetime trying to encourage, empower, and educate young people to go into farming. It never occurred to me that this agenda was the key to American military power.

Lest I be misread, I am not opposed to defending family. I am not opposed to fighting for sacred causes. I am violently opposed to non-sacred fighting and meddling in foreign countries, and building empires. The Romans already tried that and failed.

But to think that my agenda is key to building the American military–now that’s a cause for pause. I will redouble my efforts to help folks remember why we need more farmers. It’s not to provide cannon fodder for Wall Street imperialistic agendas. It’s to grow food that nourishes, land that’s aesthetically and aromatically sensually romantic, build soil, hydrate raped landscapes, and convert more solar energy into biomass than nature would in a static state.

I can think of many, many righteous and noble reasons to have more farms. Why couldn’t he have mentioned any of these? Any?

No, the reason for more farms is to make sure we get people signing up at the recruitment office. That’s the way he sees me as a farmer. Not a food producer. When the president and his cabinet have their private conflabs, they don’t see farmers as food producers, as stewards of the landscape, as resource leveragers.

No, they view us as insurance for military muscle, for American empire building and soldier hubris. Is this outrageous? Do I have a right to be angry? Like me, this raw and bold show of the government’s farming agenda should make us all feel betrayed, belittled, and our great nation besmirched.

Perhaps, just perhaps, really good farms don’t feed this military personnel pipeline. I’d like to think our kind of farming has more righteous goals and sacred objectives. Vilsack did not separate good farmers from bad farmers. Since we have far more bad farmers than good ones, perhaps the statistic would not hold up if we had more farmers who viewed the earth as something to heal instead of hurt, as a partner to caress instead of rape.

That America’s farms are viewed by our leaders as just another artery leading into military might is unspeakably demeaning and disheartening.

"http://realfarmacy.com/pepperidge-farm-gmo-goldfish/","Pepperidge Farm named in class action lawsuit over GMOs in Goldfish® Crackers","gotaclassaction.com :

Pepperidge Farm markets, advertises, sells and distributes “Natural” Cheddar Goldfish® Crackers.

According to the complaint, Defendant made and continues to make false and misleading claims regarding its representation that the Product is “Natural.” Defendant has mistakenly or misleadingly represented that the Product is “Natural,” when in fact, it is not, because it contains bio-engineered food, more commonly known as Genetically Modified Organisms (“GMOs”) in the form of GMO soy and/or soy derivatives.

As alleged, Defendant’s “Natural” statement prominently displayed on the Product’s packaging and/or labeling is false, misleading, and likely to deceive reasonable consumers, such as Plaintiff and members of the Class, because the Product is not “Natural,” due to the presence of soybean oil in the Product.

GMOs are plants that grow from seeds in which DNA splicing has been used to place genes from another source into a plant. Contrary to Defendant’s express or implied representations, the Product uses plants or plant derivatives grown or created from GMOs. Defendant’s marketing of the Product as “Natural” is false, because GMOs’ genetic makeup has been altered through biotechnology to exhibit characteristics that do not otherwise occur in nature.

The complaint seeks an Order prohibiting Defendant from including genetically modified ingredients in its “Natural” Products or, in the alternative, from representing the Products are “Natural” when they are not, because bio-engineered soy is not “Natural.”","2013-06-28 16:10:41","0","55.0","35.0","76.0","0.0","66.0","0.0","74.0","41.0","0.0","167.0","0.0","38.0","2","230","85.56","27.14","14.99","1.00","28.75","39.57","72.17","44.78","4.78","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.43","4.35","6.96","13.91","6.96","1.74","10.87","2.17","13.48","6.09","2.17","1.30","0.00","0.87","4.78","0.43","4.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.13","1.30","10.87","0.43","3.48","0.43","6.09","0.87","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.87","4.35","0.43","0.43","0.87","0.00","2.61","3.04","8.26","0.00","7.83","0.87","4.78","1.74","5.65","0.43","0.00","1.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","25.65","3.91","7.83","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.87","8.70","2.17","0.87","0.87","1261","10.29","33.42857142857143","405","225","8","26.03","18.2","16.6","17.35","20.5","75","12.375","26.573333333333338","128","27.71","2","0.44","0","14","0","17","0","29","16","0","0","0","34","33","2","13","0","0","3","2","11","1","0","0","7","0","5","2","5","12","6","17","3","0","0","2"

"http://realfarmacy.com/senate-rejects-gmo-labeling-bill/","Senate Rejects GMO Labeling Bill","WASHINGTON – On Thursday, the U.S. Senate voted 71 to 27 against an amendment to the farm bill that would have simply allowed states to decide for themselves if they wanted to require the labeling of foods that contain harmful genetically modified ingredients.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the chair of the Agriculture Committee, spoke on behalf of the biotech giant seizing the opportunity to focus primarily on the myth that genetically modified ingredients feed the hungry people of the world, ignoring the fact that 64 countries now require GMO labeling.

“This particular amendment would interfere with the FDA’s science-based process to determine what food labeling is necessary for consumers,” Stabenow said.

“It’s also important to note that around the world now we are seeing genetically modified crops that have the ability to resist crop diseases and improve nutritional content and survive drought conditions in many developing countries,” she added.

Unable to make the connection with how allowing states to label GMO foods would interfere with corporate biotech operations abroad, she instead took the opportunity to show that the chair of the Agriculture Committee is marching lockstep with the Gates Foundation.

“We see wonderful work being done by foundations like the Gates Foundation and others, that are using new techniques to be able to feed hungry people,” she said.

This “wonderful work” as the Senator puts it is nothing more than a centralized, globalized food system and it is a recipe for disaster.

Farmers growing GMO crops are denied their traditional right to save seeds for the next year. If biotech fails, they will be unable to replant.

What about soil infertility? GMO agriculture is chemical intensive, the use of the herbicide glyphosate builds-up causing sterility in the soil, not to mention the loss of biodiversity. So far, 75% of seed diversity, has already been lost to industrial farming.

Biodiversity is real food security and mono-cropping has always proven unsustainable in the past, take the Irish potato famine for instance.","2013-05-24 12:49:32","0","58.0","32.0","76.0","0.0","66.0","0.0","76.0","41.0","0.0","176.0","0.0","42.0","2","332","94.19","59.52","5.58","36.35","23.71","29.22","75.30","43.98","7.53","2.71","0.00","0.60","0.00","0.90","1.20","4.82","9.34","14.46","7.53","3.31","3.31","0.60","13.25","3.61","1.51","0.90","1.20","0.90","4.22","2.41","1.81","0.00","0.00","0.90","4.52","0.00","0.00","0.90","0.00","7.83","0.90","2.41","1.81","0.60","1.51","2.11","1.81","0.90","0.90","0.00","4.52","0.00","1.51","0.00","3.01","8.73","0.90","3.92","2.71","1.51","1.20","3.92","8.43","0.30","11.14","0.60","7.23","3.01","4.82","0.00","0.60","0.60","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.06","4.82","4.82","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","1.20","2.41","0.60","0.60","0.30","1696","8.99","25.76923076923077","524","329","15","49.25","14.4","11.8","13.81","14.8","89","10.5","21.58066869300912","208","22.85","9","0.41","0","5","4","33","0","35","25","1","0","4","57","28","0","20","0","0","11","1","14","0","0","1","17","0","21","9","11","11","7","12","5","2","0","1"

In the grand scheme of all that is wrong with modern agriculture, the unnatural transition that turned cattle (which naturally eat grass) into grain-eating ruminants is at the top of the list. In the twisted realm of agribusiness, raising grass-fed cows, especially in the heart of ‘corn country’ (the Midwest) is now regarded as a specialty industry “for the crazies,” as the New York Times recently reported. 1 “Where the great cattle herds once roamed, grass finishing — an intricate and lengthy ballet involving the balance of protein and energy derived from the stalk, with the flavor rendered by earth, plants and even stress — is a nearly lost art. …said Fred Kirschenmann, a distinguished fellow at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University… ‘The attitude out there is that grass-fed is for the crazies.’” Yet, far from being ‘crazy,’ grass-fed beef represents a sought-after solution to unsustainable agricultural practices – one that could not only drastically reduce pollution but also produce a nutritionally superior meat. While far from the norm at this point, a new appreciation for grass-fed meat, and all that it stands for, is steadily growing and these so-called ‘unconventional’ ranchers are now becoming mainstays in the industry.

Change to the Cattle Industry Must Come ‘From Educated People From the Outside’

Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), in which the majority of US beef (and pork, chicken and eggs) is raised, contribute directly to global warming by releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere – in fact, more than the entire global transportation industry. They also contribute to climate disruption by their impact on deforestation and draining of wetlands, and because of the nitrous oxide emissions from huge amounts of pesticides used to grow the genetically engineered corn and soy fed to animals raised in CAFOs. The cows are fattened for slaughter on giant feed lots as quickly as possible (on average between 14 and 18 months) with the help of grains, as CAFOs represent a corporate-controlled system characterized by large-scale, centralized, low profit-margin production, processing and distribution systems. Contrary to popular arguments, factory farming is not a cheap, efficient solution to world hunger. Feeding huge numbers of confined animals actually uses more food, in the form of grains that could feed humans, than it produces. For every 100 food calories of edible crops fed to livestock, we get back just 30 calories in the form of meat and dairy. That’s a 70 percent loss. With the Earth’s population predicted to reach 9 billion by mid-century, the planet can no longer afford this reckless, unhealthy and environmentally disastrous farming system. And as Prescott Frost, great-grandson of poet Robert Frost who has entered the grass-fed meat business, told the New York Times: 2 “’If change is going to come to the cattle industry, it’s got to come from educated people from the outside,’ Mr. Frost said, quoting from Allan Nation, the publisher of The Stockman Grass Farmer, considered the grazier’s bible.”

Grass-Fed Beef Is Better for You, Better for the Planet and Better for the Cows

A joint effort between the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Clemson University researchers determined a total of 10 key areas where grass-fed is better than grain-fed beef for human health. 3 In a side-by-side comparison, they determined that grass-fed beef was: -Lower in total fat -Higher in total omega-3s -Higher in the minerals calcium, magnesium, and potassium -Higher in the B-vitamins thiamin and riboflavin -Higher in vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) -A healthier ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids (1.65 vs 4.84) -Higher in CLA (cis-9 trans-11), a potential cancer fighter -Higher in vaccenic acid (which can be transformed into CLA) -Higher in beta-carotene Another troubling aspect of grain-fed cattle involves the well-being of the animal and, consequently, the health effect this has on you. Common consequences among grain-fed cattle include: 4 1. Acidosis. During the normal digestive process, bacteria in the rumen of cattle produce a variety of acids. Saliva neutralizes the acidity from grass-based diets, but grain-based eating in feedlots prohibits saliva production. The net result is “acid indigestion.” Animals with this condition are plagued with diarrhea, go off their feed, pant, salivate excessively, kick at their bellies, and eat dirt. Over time, acidosis can lead to a condition called “rumenitis,” an inflammatory response to too much acid and too little roughage and results in inefficient nutrient absorption. 2. Liver abscesses. From 15 to 30 percent of feedlot cattle have liver abscesses, which result when bacteria may leak out through ulcerated rumen in cattle and are ultimately transported to the liver.



3. Bloat. During digestion, cows produce gas and when they are on pasture, they belch up the gas without any difficulty. Grain-based feeding causes these gasses to become trapped, and results in bloat. In more serious cases of bloat, the rumen becomes so distended with gas that the animal is unable to breathe and dies from asphyxiation.



4. Feedlot polio. A highly acidic digestive environment may result in the production of an enzyme called “thiaminase,” which destroys vitamin B1, starving the brain of energy and creating paralysis.



5. Dust pneumonia. In dry weather, the feedlot can become a dust bowl, which springs the cattle’s immune system into action and keeps it running on a constant basis, ultimately resulting in respiratory ailments and even death.

Real Farmers Are ‘Grass Farmers’

Virginia farmer Joel Salatin is a living example of how incredibly successful and sustainable natural farming can be. He produces beef, chicken, eggs, turkey, rabbits and vegetables. Yet, Joel calls himself a grass farmer, for it is the grass that transforms the sun into energy that his animals then feed on. By closely observing nature, Joel created a rotational grazing system that not only allows the land to heal but also allows the animals to behave the way the were meant to — expressing their “chicken-ness” or “pig-ness,” as Joel would say.

Cows are moved every day, which mimics their natural patterns and promotes revegetation. Sanitation is accomplished by birds. The birds (chickens and turkeys) arrive three days after the cows leave — via the Eggmobile — and scratch around in the pasture, doing what chickens do best.

No pesticides. No herbicides. No antibiotics. No seed spreading. Salatin hasn’t planted a seed or purchased a chemical fertilizer in 50 years. He just lets herbivores be herbivores and cooperates with nature, instead of fighting it. It’s a different and refreshing philosophy. When cows are raised on a ‘salad bar’ of natural grasses, the meat takes on different flavors that cannot be achieved with grain. Frost told the New York Times: 5

“’When the wine industry started out in California, nobody had a language for what a bouquet was,’ Mr. Frost, 55, said. ‘Vintners had to come up with a way an audience could have a conversation about hints of raspberries, of chamomile. And that’s what we have to do with beef.'”

Farming done in this type of sustainable manner can be incredibly profitable, too. Instead of making $150 per acre per year from a crop that produces food for three months, but lays fallow for the rest of the year, Salatin’s making $3,000 per acre by rotating crops throughout the year, thereby making use of his land all 12 months — and maintaining its ecological balance at the same time. This generates complementary income streams for the small farmer and allows them to compete with CAFO operations, while protecting the land from ecological disasters.

Did You Know…that drinking water in the morning immediately upon waking up can have amazing therapeutic effects for a multitude of health conditions—ranging from pain to asthma to cancer?

This remarkable water therapy originates from ancient Ayurvedic medicine. In Sanskrit, the name for the practice is Usha Paana Chikitsa, which roughly translates to “early morning water treatment.”

Can Water Wash Away Disease?

It has long been known that drinking water first thing in the morning on an empty stomach purifies the body’s internal system. An especially important result of this treatment is that it cleanses the colon, which makes the body much more able to absorb nutrients from food.

This is achieved through the production of new blood, or haematopaises. This fresh blood has an immense restorative effect in the body and can even cure existing ailments.

An Unlikely Prison Discovery—Water as Potent Medicine

Dr. Fereydoon Batmanghelidj discovered the healing powers of water and the link between dehydration and chronic illness 17 years ago. He was then serving a jail sentence as a political prisoner in Iran.

During his imprisonment, Dr. Batmanghelidj used the only medicine available to him—which was water—to successfully treat 3,000 fellow prisoners who were suffering from stress-induced peptic ulcers.

After his release from prison, Dr. Batmanghelidj—who trained in medicine at St. Mary’s Hospital Medical School of London—turned his full-time attention to the study of dehydration and its negative health effects. His subsequent discoveries have restored health for hundreds of thousands of individuals who were suffering from unidentified dehydration-related diseases.

In addition to presenting at international and world conferences, Dr. Batmanghelidj has published his findings in a number of scientific journals. He has compiled his research for the general public in two books, Your Body’s Many Cries for Water, and How to Deal with Back Pain and Rheumatoid Joint Pain.

He has even produced a video on back pain and audiotapes of his lectures—all of which have been peer and media reviewed and acclaimed both nationally and internationally.

Dehydration’s Many Disguises

According to Batmanghelidj, the body’s biological thirst signals can be mistaken for signs and symptoms of other illnesses. If we treat the root cause of these—dehydration—we can avoid costly and unnecessary medical interventions and enjoy long-term wellbeing.

“Humans seem to lose their thirst sensation and the critical perception of needing water,” wrote Batmanghelidj in one of his two books on chronic dehydration and water therapy. “Not recognizing their need for water,” he continued, “they gradually become increasingly and chronically dehydrated with the progress of age.”

Further confusion results when the body produces complicated secondary symptoms of dehydration. Many doctors misinterpret those secondary symptoms as unrelated diseases.

These conditions include, but are not limited to:

o Dyspepsia

o Rheumatoid arthritis

o Angina

o Migraine and headaches

o Colitis

o Constipation

o Hypertension

o Anemia

o Obesity

o Sinusitis

o Pulmonary tuberculosis

o Asthma

o Kidney stones

o Diabetes

o Irregular menstruation

o Leukemia

o Uterine cancer

o Breast cancer

A Japanese medical society has also found water therapy to be a 100% cure for arthritis…epilepsy…bronchitis…uberculosis…meningitis…diarrhea…throat diseases…and many other ailments.

Research proves that water therapy can cure these conditions very rapidly on its own—with no other medical treatments! According to the research, water therapy alleviates constipation within a single day, diabetes within one week, and hypertension and even cancer within a month.

How to Maximize the Benefits of Water Therapy

Drinking water in the morning is simple to put into practice, and virtually free! However, there are some important rules to remember. The basic protocol recommend by experts is as follows:

1. Immediately upon waking in the morning, drink 1.50 liters of water, which is equivalent to 5-6 glasses of water.

2. Do not eat or drink anything else for 1 hour prior to and after drinking the water.

3. Do not consume any alcoholic beverages the night before.

At first, it may be difficult to drink 1.50 liters of water at one time; however, your body will gradually get accustomed to the protocol.

When starting out, you may want to make it easier by modifying the protocol slightly, as follows: Drink 4 glasses, then pause for 2 minutes, then drink the last 2 glasses.

It goes without saying that the better the quality of water you consume, the better the results you’ll experience from water therapy.

"http://realfarmacy.com/even-the-ny-times-is-now-rejecting-monsanto-gmo-science/","Even the NY Times is now rejecting Monsanto GMO science","by Jon Rappoport nomorefakenews.com

This isn’t a leak. It isn’t a timid flow. It’s a flood.

I’m talking about about the criticism of Monsanto’s so-called science of genetically-engineered food.

For the past 20 years, independent researchers have been attacking Monsanto science in various ways, and finally the NY Times has joined the crowd.

But it’s the way Mark Bittman, lead food columnist for the Times magazine, does it that really crashes the whole GMO delusion. Writing in his April 2 column, “Why Do G.M.O.’s Need Protection?”, Bittman leads with this:

“Genetic engineering in agriculture has disappointed many people who once had hopes for it.”

As in: the party’s over, turn out the lights.

Bittman explains: “…genetic engineering, or, more properly, transgenic engineering – in which a gene, usually from another species of plant, bacterium or animal, is inserted into a plant in the hope of positively changing its nature – has been disappointing.”

As if this weren’t enough, Bittman spells it out more specifically: “In the nearly 20 years of applied use of G.E. in agriculture there have been two notable ‘successes,’ along with a few less notable ones. These are crops resistant to Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide (Monsanto develops both the seeds and the herbicide to which they’re resistant) and crops that contain their own insecticide. The first have already failed, as so-called superweeds have developed resistance to Roundup, and the second are showing signs of failing, as insects are able to develop resistance to the inserted Bt toxin — originally a bacterial toxin — faster than new crop variations can be generated.”

Bittman goes on to write that superweed resistance was a foregone conclusion; scientists understood, from the earliest days of GMOs, that spraying generations of these weeds with Roundup would give us exactly what we have today: failure of the technology to prevent what it was designed to prevent. The weeds wouldn’t die out. They would retool and thrive.

“The result is that the biggest crisis in monocrop agriculture – something like 90 percent of all soybeans and 70 percent of corn is grown using Roundup Ready seed – lies in glyphosate’s inability to any longer provide total or even predictable control, because around a dozen weed species have developed resistance to it.” Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup.

Just as the weeds developed resistance and immunity to the herbicide, insects that were supposed to be killed by the toxin engineered into Monsanto’s BT crops are also surviving.

Five years ago, it would have been unthinkable that the NY Times would print such a complete rejection of GMO plant technology. Now, it’s “well, everybody knows.”

The Times sees no point in holding back any longer.

[Related: Vermont senator continues fight for GMO labeling, defeat of Monsanto Protection Act]

Of course, if it were a newspaper with any real courage, it would launch a whole series of front-page pieces on this enormous failure, and the gigantic fraud that lies behind it. Then the Times might actually see its readership improve.

Momentum is something its editors understand well enough. You set your hounds loose on a story, you send them out with a mandate to expose failure, fraud, and crime down to their roots, and you know that, in the ensuing months, formerly reticent researchers and corporate employees and government officials will appear out of the woodwork confessing their insider knowledge.

The story will deepen. It will take on new branches. The revelations will indict the corporation (Monsanto), its government partners, and the scientists who falsified and hid data.

In this case, the FDA and the USDA will come in for major hits. They will backtrack and lie and mis-explain, for a while, and then, like buds in the spring, agency employees will emerge and admit the truth. These agencies were co-conspirators.

And once the story unravels far enough, the human health hazards and destruction wreaked by GMOs will take center stage. All the bland pronouncements about “nobody has gotten sick from GMOs” will evaporate in the wind.

It won’t simply be, “Well, we never tested health dangers adequately,” it’ll be, “We knew there was trouble from the get-go.”

Yes, the Times could make all this happen. But it won’t. There are two basic reasons. First, it considers Big Ag too big to fail. There is now so much acreage in America tied up in GMO crops that to reject the whole show would cause titanic eruptions on many levels.

And second, the Times is part of the very establishment that views the GMO industry as a way of bringing Globalism to fruition for the whole planet.

Centralizing the food supply in a few hands means the population of the world, in the near future, will eat or not eat according to the dictates of a few unelected men. Redistribution of basic resources to the people of Earth, from such a control point, is what Globalism is all about:

“Naturally, we love you all, but decisions must be made. You people over here will live well, you people over there will live not so well, and you people back there will live not at all.

“This is our best judgment. Don’t worry, be happy.”

"http://realfarmacy.com/marijuana-the-high-fallacy-of-prohibition/","Marijuana: The High Fallacy of Prohibition","The Hemp Industries Association, Vote Hemp, several American manufacturers, and allied companies and organizations have just wrapped up Hemp History Week. This is a great time to reflect on the outright idiocy of marijuana laws and enforcement.

Those that stand against an individual’s right to grow or otherwise ingest a plant will do the world a service by applying critical thought to their irrational position. Hindering an individual’s freedom while simultaneously oppressing an entire clean energy, clothing, paper, plastic, medicinal, and composite material industry is not only illogical, it is downright fascist. It is no wonder that the Constitution is under so much attack from today’s bureaucrats; for it is written on hemp, the very enemy of the authoritarian personal liberty regulators.

This video (Marijuana and Swat Teams) shows a SWAT team raiding a family’s home. (WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT) The father is thrown on the floor and beaten, the kids are taken, and their beloved family dog is brutally gunned down. This family was obviously a threat to society because they were in possession of a grinder, a pipe, and a small amount of marijuana.

When will we realize that the enforcement of laws designed for victimless acts and personal choice only tends to hinder freedom and in fact creates a senseless string of victims as a side effect?

[RELATED VIDEO HERE: Marijuana and Swat Teams]

Never in the history of man has anyone, ever, overdosed on marijuana. Even in studies involving lab animals that were given 100’s of times more marijuana than a human could possibly intake, did they die.

At any one time, 59,300 prisoners charged with or convicted of violating marijuana laws are behind bars. Of those, 17,000 are behind bars for possession ONLY, not trafficking. Enforcing marijuana laws costs an estimated $10-15 billion in direct costs alone. Not to mention the sustained costs of incarceration of the individual who has done nothing to harm anyone. It is estimated that the money spent enforcing useless marijuana laws is double what we spend on education in this country.

The prohibition of marijuana drives the black market for it. The laws that are in place to make it illegal actually CREATE CRIME by eliminating free market competition thereby creating an incentive for the unethical and monopolistic criminal distribution. It in essence creates a cartel for the ones willing to risk the cultivation. The exact same thing happened with the prohibition of alcohol in the early part of the 20th century. It allowed for organized crime to rise and prosper by supplying the demand for alcohol through underground transactions. The prohibition of alcohol was reversed and it was made legal again, so why hasn’t this happened with marijuana?

Marinol is a pharmaceutical chemical drug produced by Solvay Pharmaceuticals Inc. It contains the exact molecular structure of the THC molecule and has the same effects of marijuana. However you cannot grow Marinol in your backyard. You cannot make obscene profits from the patent of a plant, because luckily, the state has not granted their mega –corporations the ability to patent nature, yet. The contradiction here is that you can make nature illegal, and then recreate nature in a lab using chemicals, put that illegal part of nature, available for profit, into a pill and make millions. Do you see the inconsistency here?

The hemp plant is quite possibly the most useful plant ever grown by mankind. There are literally hundreds of uses for the hemp plant ranging from paper to bio-fuel. The Declaration of Independence is written on hemp and is still in the same shape now as it was when the founders wrote on it over 200 years ago.

Hemp is the strongest natural fiber known to man. Hemp hurds, the woody stalk, can be made into paper, fuels, and even plastics and far cleaner and safer for the environment than petroleum. Hemp would stop deforestation, provide renewable fuel, provide clean plastics, and highly nutritional foods. However, in the United States, you can purchase, import, export, wear, eat, sell, and use hemp, but it is completely illegal to grow in all states, with the groundbreaking exception of Colorado. By the way industrialized hemp has no drug properties whatsoever, it CANNOT get you high. Does this make sense?

We must ask ourselves why.

Marijuana has been proven over and over again NOT to cause any damage to the brain, whatsoever. Never has anyone ever contracted lung cancer from marijuana smoking. It has benefits and uses that are enormously advantageous to mankind, from medicinal, to spiritual, to industrial, and it is ILLEGAL. We must ask ourselves why. Why, since the inception of the “war on drugs” has the prison system become privatized and increased almost 1000 percent? Why does this country have 5 percent of the world’s population, and 25 percent of the world’s prison population? Why is it legal for pharmaceutical companies to sell mind altering dangerous chemicals, yet we cannot grow a plant in our backyards? Why is it that cigarette related deaths top 400,000, pharmaceutical deaths top 100,000 annually, and they are completely legal, while marijuana has never ever killed anyone ever? Why?

More and more people are asking these questions and the results of such intrigue, Colorado and Washington State, are proving to be quite heartening. However, this is just the beginning. The ground breaking hemp crop being planted in Colorado by farmer Ryan Loflin has the ability for unrestrained potential. Once the rest of the nation sees the myriad of benefits from this one 60 acre crop, more questions will be asked, more crops will be planted, and a peaceful and clean industrial revolution, will begin freeing humanity from the bondage of unsustainability.

21st Century Wire says…

In a shocking admission on the Greta Van Susteren Show, one of the Martin family attorneys, Jasmine Rand, of law firm Parks & Crump, stated that she holds a larger role as a ‘social engineer‘ outside of her duties as an attorney…



IMAGE: Trayvon attorney Jasmine Rand, wearing a hoodie on national TV.

As more information has come to light, there seems to be evidence of a social agenda or manipulation surrounding the Zimmerman case. It appears as if a highly organized apparatus has been culled together to challenge the moral fabric of this country, intentionally creating division.

In the video below, attorney Jasmine Rand is seen undermining the court system with her harsh criticism of the jury in the Zimmerman trial…

Attorney Jasmine Rand: “I have a greater duty beyond being an attorney and that’s to be a social engineer.”

Rand’s social engineering around this case has been impressive to say the least. Her phrase, “Not guilty does not mean innocent”, has now been parroted across the media and is now officially part of the America’s amateur legal lexicon.

Her phrase appears to be customized for this particular case, but it’s appeal is general, and is designed to rebuke the decision of the jury, and delegitamize the local court’s decision. More than any other, this phrase has empowered tweeting mobs.



Rand’s actions were appalling and worse, it appears she played a critical role in a public relations campaign to attack Zimmerman’s character. Just recently, she was seen on CNN wearing a hoodie, only fueling the national reaction after the verdict in the Zimmerman trial.



MSM BANNED IMAGE: The public image of Trayvon Martin has been characterised as that of a 14 yr old innocent child.

‘Justice for Trayvon’: Engineering politically correct mobs

This case is many times more relevant to both racial profiling and stand your ground laws – than the Zimmerman case, but neither the White House, nor the corporate media have thrown their resources at it. Engineering political correctness requires enforcement over the most marginal of cases – where politically correct ideas and beliefs take precedent over empirical facts.



PHOTO: Jordan Russell Davis

In November of 2012, a 17 year-old young black man named Jordan Davis was said to have been gunned down by a 46 year-old white male named Michael Dunn. The shooting occurred over a dispute at a convenience store, as Dunn claimed his life was threatened and that he thought the teen had brandished a firearm. According to Police, they were not able to obtain evidence to support Dunn’s claim. Dunn’s case is still in its early stages, as there have been several judges who have had to step down from overseeing the trial so far.

So why was the Trayvon Martin shooting chosen by the establishment as the vehicle for a national race war, and not Davis?

Why haven’t Obama, the DOJ, Al Sharpton, or MSNBC politicized the tragic death of Jordan Davis? Is his story not sexy, controversial – or worthy enough, in order to warrant all the resources which have been invested into the national Trayvon campaign?

Is this proof that high level media operations have steered the public outcry, thus engineering a particular public reaction over specific events?

For social engineers keen on enforcing group-think compliance to new politically correct standards of thought, it would be a greater victory to over-inflate a marginally damning case like Trayvon-Zimmerman, rather than to target an obvious case like that of Jordan Davis. More political capital can be extracted from Zimmerman case precisely because it is a house of cards, of which politically correct mobs will say and do anything in order to keep it from collapsing.

The fact that George Zimmerman is not even white, but has been portrayed as “white” by party leaders, media and the mobs – should tell observers all they need to know about the social engineering present in this media-driven campaign.

Partisan Mobs and their Party Leaders

Today we saw the lust for gaining Democrat Party political capital ‘over race’ reach dizzying new lows, as DOJ head Eric Holder, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and professional agitator Al Sharpton took to the road, speaking to ‘Justice for Trayvon’ crowds, and playing their part to fan public dissent over the ‘not guilty‘ verdict in the Zimmerman trial.



IMAGE: Professional race mob agitator and White House adviser, Rev Al Sharpton.

In a recent article by Crystal Wright for the Guardian, entitled, “Beyond George Zimmerman: Where’s the outrage about black on black crime?” we see a closer look at crime statistics in the Chicago inner city, shedding light on the criminal bias by government agencies:

“Why aren’t so-called black leaders outraged and marching over the recent shooting rampage in Chicago. During the 4 July holiday weekend, including the Wednesday leading up to it, 62 people were wounded by gun violence in Chicago and 12 others killed. The holiday shooting spree raised Chicago’s homicide tally to 200 for the year. Last year about 500 people were killed, and most of those killing and being killed in Chicago are black. According to the Chicago Tribune, “blacks make up about 33% of the city’s population, they accounted for nearly 78% of the homicide victims through the first six months of 2012”.

Continuing, Crystal Wright added: “With the mainstream media’s national attention on the Zimmerman murder trail, I think it’s stunning that scant, if any, attention was given to the violence raging in Chicago or other cities across the country. As I’ve said many times during this case, Americans, especially black Americans, have come to accept blacks killing other blacks as normal.”



IMAGE: Political correctness among white liberal Democrats is the driving force behind America’s simmering race war.

We need to challenge the group think of society and learn to see the motivations and machinations of political opportunists. Social manipulation comes in many forms.

Make no mistake – the Justice for Trayvon campaign is ultimately about Gun Control in America. Watch this space, because that is where this discussion will ultimately be driven by the radical leftists in Washington DC and White House-run TV broadcaster MSNBC.

Right now, riotous rage is boiling over in cities all over America, but why hasn’t America’s “first black President’ stepped up to either calm mobs, or to condemn such actions?



The answer to that question should be self-explanatory.

21st Century Wire says…

What? The CIA might be corrupt and involved in an assassination?

The cover-up continues to this day…



No LAPD protection for Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in Southern California. In fact, they weren’t even in the neighborhood.

But at least two CIA assassination experts were in the audience that night and a CIA man was given control over the LAPD homicide investigation.

So why do people still fall for the lone gunman theory again?

.

“There’s no question in my mind that elements of the CIA were involved”

.

Brasscheck TV



The most disinterested emergency dispatcher in history…

.

It’s hard to imagine how a public event with this high a profile could take place without at least some police presence. But this recording shows it clearly. Not only were there no police at the event providing security, the hotel had to convince the police to send police to the scene.

But there were plenty of CIA agents there that night – some with overseas assassination experience – in the audience.

Editor’s Note: Anyone who reacts to this verdict as “racist” has fallen helplessly into a politically correct, psychological operation by corporate media and political opportunists who seek to capitalize on division – the very same corporate media that have disingenuously labeled Zimmerman a “white hispanic” just so he could fit into their prefabricated ‘race hate’ narrative.

21st Century Wire says…

Jurors in the George Zimmerman trial reached a verdict just before 10pm EST on Saturday night – turning in a not guilty verdict.



Details are still forthcoming about a retrial in either a criminal or civil court, as well as a DOJ prosecution effort through federal courts.

Due to the racially charged atmosphere surrounding the case, the country remains on edge this weekend with many cities bracing themselves for racially motivated, random reprisal attacks and riots in retaliation to the Zimmerman decision.

White House Adviser, political activist and professional agitator, Al Sharpton, has called the jury’s verdict “an atrocity”, and has vowed to mobilise his ‘supporters’ crowd down in Florida in the coming days, a move which will almost certainly inflame the situation and stir-up a sustained media storm during the coming weeks. Sharpton stated:

“I will convene an emergency call with preachers tonight to discuss next steps and I intend to head to Florida in the next few days.”

The ‘New Black Panthers’

New Black Panther leader Samir Shabazz publicly stated earlier this week that his organisation is preparing to ‘take the fight to white people’ living in American suburbs:

“This time we’re doing it right… This time we’re not burning down our communities. This time we’re going out to Whitey’s suburbs and burning down HIS community. We’re going to make Whitey feel the pain.”

Shabazz, who has also made comments insinuating about ‘killing white babies’, also remarked about how he would “love nothing more than to come home with a cracker’s head in my book bag.”

It’s important to note here that the ‘New Black Panthers’ (NBP) have no actual affiliation, or any endorsement from the original Black Panther Movement, which is survived by the Dr. Huey P. Newton Foundation. Critics have accused the Tampa, FLA-based group of hijacking the name in order to invent credibility and gain support from the black community at large.

Many pundits have speculated as to why none of the NBP leaders have been arrested or held for questioning by federal authorities after to publicly inciting racial violence in both 2012, and in 2013 – as being down to the possibility that at least one of the NBP leaders is in fact reporting to a US federal agency like the FBI under a ‘informant status’. Listen to an NBP radio interview which aired on Florida radio last April:

Problem, reaction, solution

As a direct result of the politicization and racial tension which was injected at the early stages of the Zimmerman case, the conversation has festered into a black vs. white narrative. President Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, and Presidential Adviser Al Sharpton, all weighed-in early on the Zimmerman-Martin Affair in 2012, which has fuel a media-driven, racially charged national conversation over the case in Sanford, Florida.

National broadcaster NBC also helped to polarise coverage early on by first doctoring and then airing audio clips of George Zimmerman’s 911 call to the police, which they were forced to admit gave the impression that the caller, Zimmerman, was ‘racially profiling’ the victim Trayvon Martin.

According to documents obtained by Judicial Watch, it has also been revealed that AG Eric Holder’s Department of Justice (DOJ) secretly spent thousands in federal tax dollars in order to prop-up ‘Trayvon support demonstrations in Sanford last year, which contributed to politically charging and injecting race into the case.

The public reaction has been that of outrage and division ever since, inspiring an explosion of racial threats from different media quarters, including social media. The threat of potential civil unrest and random attacks has apparently given law enforcement emergency powers to apprehend anyone insinuating threats on Twitter and Facebook.

The Lake County News-Sun has already reported how a Chicago-area teen has been charged with a felony for tweeting that he’d ‘shoot everyone in his town if George Zimmerman is set free’. See tweet here:



Other emergency enforcement measures around the country are likely to include “Shelter in place” directives by police, forced curfews, checkpoints, house to house searches and fire arm confiscations, and perhaps a declaration of temporary Marshal Law in some urban areas should violence begin break out resembling an Rodney King/LA riot situation.

RESULT: Less rights, less privacy and less freedom.



What other black leaders are saying about the verdict

In stark contrast to the political agitation from White House advisers like Al Sharpton being are all over the mainstream media, other black leaders have been weighing in on the Zimmerman verdict with a considerable more leveled head.

Project 21 was formed in 1992 when the riots following the verdict in the Rodney King case revealed a need to highlight the diversity of opinion within the black community. Here is what the black community advocacy members from Project 21 are saying:



“Six women, some of them mothers themselves, found George Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder and manslaughter in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Although Mr. Zimmerman was acquitted, there are no winners in this tragic case. A teenager is deceased and a young man’s family is mourning. George Zimmerman will never have a normal life again. I call for all sides to respect the verdict reached by a jury of Mr. Zimmerman’s peers and honor Trayvon’s memory by letting peace prevail in the streets.”

– Christopher Arps – managing partner of a digital media and political consulting firm and a co-founder of the black political networking website Move-On-Up.org.

“To celebrate justice rendered in this case is not an admission or an articulation that Trayvon Martin deserved what happened to him that fateful night in February of 2012. As most will acknowledge, it’s a sad and unfortunate thing that Martin lost his life and that his parents had to bury their son. The jury ruled – considering the evidence presented – rightly in my opinion. George Zimmerman is innocent of the filed charges against him. Despite the considerable emotion surrounding this case, justice has been served. It is not ‘justice for Trayvon.’ Nor it is ‘justice for George.’ It is simply justice.”



– Derryck Green – graduate student, with an M.A. in Theological Studies and is currently pursuing his doctorate in ministry.

“The justice system did what it is supposed to do – get to the bottom of what happened. Agree or not, our system works. George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin, by his own admission. He has to live with that, and I believe God will judge him for that action. But the jury decided that action did not rise to the level of manslaughter or murder. I accept and respect that. We all should, whether or not we agree with it.”



– Coby Dillard is a founder of the Hampton Roads Tea Party in southern Virginia, a regular columnist for the Norfolk Virginian Pilot and a Navy veteran.

“George Zimmerman has been found not guilty. Regardless of how people feel about it, we must still show love and have compassion one for another.”



– Demetrius Minor, a former White House intern, is an evangelist and motivational speaker.

Here is what some other members of the black community are also saying about the situation…

VIDEO 1: Another alternative view from black America from YouTube artist ‘Painless Risen’.

Judging by the diversity of opinion within the black community, the tone struck by the White House, the Sharptons and Jacksons of the world, and of course MSNBC – could be a very long way from echoing the true sentiment of the black community in America.

The crux of the whole media and political agitation campaign rests on the accusation of “racial profiling” by Zimmerman against Martin, yet no one can proof such a claim. Stefan Molyneux, host of Freedomain Radio, discusses the background, evidence and reality of the situation:

Many commentators feel there is a real danger in the media whirl-wind being stirred up by this case, as the subsequent sectarian public reactions threaten to set back race relations at least 20-30 years in America, as seen in the Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman case, where “black vs white” has been inserted as the overwhelming theme by social influencers in both the media and politics. The result would push the nation toward a race war that would quickly morph into class warfare

The other knock-on effect which the corporate media and political agitators are not talking about yet are the secondary effects of random black-on-white reprisals – namely, fueling secondary white reprisals, and providing new relevancy to backward, archaic white supremest groups in the process.

Any rioting or revenge attacks which might take place as a result of this verdict could very well backfire on the current US administration who played in active role in carrying the current situation to where it is today.

Events taking place and policies enacted in the wake of this media-driven, national upheaval – will determine what was the real agenda that begun back in April 2012, which is still in motion.

21st Century Wire says…

It’s incredible how some politicians have used the Guantanamo Bay detention center for their own election ends, but it should be clear by now that none of them have the will, or the intention, to do the right thing and shut down this black mark on American history.

If there’s one single issue that exposes the political fraud of the Obama phenomenon more than any other, it’s Gitmo.

Why is it still open? The answer is simple: Gitmo allows the US government to run a black site offshore and away from the sort of laws that govern a civilized 21st century society. It also allows the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies to turn, groom and redeploy certain privateer jihadist-terror leaders back out into the field to play their role in the global war on terror. This is from an earlier 21WIRE report:

“It’s worth noting also that like Libya’s new militant governor of Tripoli, Abdel Hakim Belhadj (al Qaeda leader), and Chechen terrorist group Kata’ib Mohadzherin’s leader Airat Vakhitov were both imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba circa 2002, after being captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Both were released and filtered back into fighting regions to organise al Qaeda-type Islamist groups – both active in countries which the US and NATO have been actively vying for regime change – in Libya and Syria, respectively. You can draw your own conclusions here about what Guantanamo is in reality.”

Yes, you heard that correctly – a Chechen terrorist leader was groomed and released, and is now being supported by the US, currently on someone’s payroll in Syria. Yes, they they may be terrorists, but they’re our terrorists – or so the logic of the 21st century privateer goes…



Many others who are being held indefinitely without charge for years in Gitmo, including those currently on hunger strike – are known to innocent, but they are still held nonetheless because to release hundreds of innocent detainees would “cause embarrassment in Washington” and people might ask what was the point in the first place.

The President ran and was elected on blaming Bush and promised voters he’d be closing Gitmo over 5 years ago, but it’s clear that he had no intention of closing it – otherwise, the King of Executive Orders would have already shut it down.

Meanwhile, the America’s liberal defense league are still blaming Bush.

Now it’s ‘Obamacare in Cuba’, and that’s costing American taxpayers nearly $1 million per head annually…

‘Astronomical costs’: Gitmo consumes $900,000 per prisoner annually





RT

Maintenance of Guantanamo has been revealed to cost over $150 million each year, with immediate estimates citing it one of the most expensive prisons in the world. This comes as the hunger strike at the detention facility is far from over.

Follow RT’s day-by-day timeline of the Gitmo hunger strike

The prison camp situated at the US naval base in Cuba costs over $900,000 annually per prisoner, placing it far above the country’s maximum security prisons, which in comparison, cost $60,000 to $70,000 per prisoner. With 166 detainees, Gitmo devours over $150 million each year.

“That … may be what finally get us to actually close the prison. I mean the costs are astronomical, when you compare them to what it would cost to detain somebody in the United States,” Ken Gude, chief of staff and vice president at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank told Reuters.

The expense of maintaining the camp has led Obama to reiterate the necessity to close the prison, instated during the Republican presidency of George W. Bush, after having failed to fulfill his initial election promise to close the prison within a year of taking office as he had promised.

The cost of the camp is so astronomical because the offshore location of the detention center and weak international ties between Cuba and America, mean that food, construction materials and other goods have to be shipped in from outside.

Debate over the prison’s expenses has peaked during the course of budget battles between Obama and the Republican-dominated House of Representatives. Broad-scale spending cuts and the ‘sequestration’ of $109 billion have been set in place.

The $900,000 annual cost per prisoner equates to the pay that was allocated to nearly seven states to help serve home delivered meals to the elderly, reports Reuters. Some $129,497 per state has been cut through sequestration.

“No one has any particular affection for Guantanamo Bay, but no one has come up with a practical solution that’s better,” a Republican aide with the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee observed.

Out of 166 detainees, as many as 130 are now currently taking part in a mass hunger-strike, their lawyers say. Official reports state that one hundred have joined the action.

The strike began around February 6 and was instigated by widespread searches of detainees’ Korans – perceived as religious desecration – as well as searches and confiscation of other personal items, according to the strikers’ lawyers. Later, it grew into a protest against indefinite detention.

The weakened state of the inmates has led to the authorities force-feeding them through nasal tubes – a practice which was condemned by the UN’s human rights office as a form of torture earlier this week.



“If it’s perceived as torture or inhuman treatment – and it’s the case, it’s painful – then it is prohibited by international law,” Rupert Coville, spokesman for the UN high commissioner for human rights told AFP on Wednesday.

American officials themselves have spoken out against the way in which the prison is administered.

“Our taskforce was unanimous – we just do not believe that it fits into the laws and the ethics and the values of America to have indefinite detention, and to not allow a court of law – an adjudication of the charges against a person – to go through an orderly process,” America’s former ambassador to Mexico, James Jones, told RT on Friday.

He later pointed out that officials in charge have no reason to be holding more than half of the detainees.

“We have actually prosecuted similar cases against other countries who have not followed what we say we ought to do, and we’re not following and practicing what we are preaching,” he said.

George Zimmerman’s gun will remain as evidence with the Sanford police department, under the directive of DOJ head Eric Holder until a full civil investigation is complete.

This latest federal ‘witch hunt‘ by the DOJ provides a convenient escape hatch from the litany of scandals they have been mired in (like Operation Fast and Furious) – and will ultimately be used to put the federal focus on an individuals ability to defend themselves and more specifically their ability to use firearms.

The new civil case against Zimmerman is just a distraction that will fuel the many divide and conquer strategies that we have outlined.

Thankfully, there’s this old CSPAN tape that refuses to go away…

Justice Department places ‘hold’ on Trayvon Martin trial evidence,

including George Zimmerman’s gun – which Florida law says must be returned to him



Daily Mail

The U.S. Department of Justice, overseen by Attorney General Eric Holder, has ordered the Sanford, Florida police department to keep possession of all the evidence from George Zimmerman’s second-degree murder trial – including the exonerated neighborhood watch volunteer’s gun.

Sanford police confirmed on Thursday that the DOJ asked the agency not to return any pieces of evidence to their owners. Zimmerman was expected to get his firearm back by month’s end.

The development is a sign that the criminal section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division is seriously investigating Zimmerman to determine if federal civil rights charges should be filed.

Assistant state attorney Bernie de la Rionda showed the jury George Zimmerman’s gun during his closing argument on July 11. Jurors ruled that Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin with the weapon while he was defending himself. Zimmerman was acquitted of murder and manslaughter on Sunday in a Florida courtroom, but civil rights violations provide an exception to the U.S. Constitution’s protection against double jeopardy after a defendant has been found ‘not guilty’ in a state or local jurisdiction.

21st Century Wire says…

Who really killed Robert Kennedy? Was it just another random, lone gunman?



It not only suits the odds, but it’s also logical to see a relationship between the murders of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. It stands to reason -based on the true political motivations behind each of these murders – that they may very well have been organized by the same group of powerful men. Those same powers are still running Washington DC today.

After the murder, of course, you need the cover-up…

It’s a simple story…



Brasscheck TV



Robert Kennedy vehemently opposed the Vietnam War.

He had a very real chance of becoming President.

Instead he got a bullet in the back of the head at close range – from someone shooting in front of him over 10 feet away (another “magic” bullet I guess).

Johnson was President when this happened. J. Edgar Hoover was FBI Director. The CIA was not reformed as was President Kennedy’s stated wish the month before he was murdered in Dallas, Texas in broad daylight.

.



Vincent Bugliosi’s buddies at LAPD handled the investigation (i.e. framing and evidence tampering and destruction).

It used to be a joke, but that joke is coming to a government near you. Paying tax for sunshine? Does the sun have a lobbyist group we don’t know about?

Expect more of this as fascist oligarchs accumulate ever more wealth and power, particularly such a time when economic suffering reaches its tipping point.

Taxes on the water we use, followed by the sunshine, and eventually, clean air will also be some kind of corporate premium service.

Maybe it’s time the people impose a super tax our corrupt, self-serving political oligarchs for all the hot air coming out of their mouths, and all the shares they own in energy firms.

RT Reports…

The number of people living in extreme poverty in Spain has doubled in just five years – according to a new report from charity groups there. Around three million Spaniards now have to survive on under 307 euros per month, while the cost of living continues to climb.

That’s as the number of families where not one person is employed, has gone up five-fold since the start of crisis, that’s 1 point 8 million households.

And now the Spanish government is set to become the first in Europe to tax something that’s been free and available to everyone since the dawn of time – sunlight. Madrid wants to impose a levy on solar power, to help plug its yawning energy debt, as Sara Firth reports.

21st Century Wire says…

The US, Saudi Arabia and Israel Axis has been busy incubating a new cult, with followers converging in Syria…



Washington’s hands are tied as far as a new military invasions and occupations are concerned. Ditto with Israel.

Instead, energies have been focused towards creating a honey pot in Syria for a generation of Islamic fanatics and fighters arriving from around the globe. To achieve this, a cult was created which appears to offer its militant entrants a new version of radical Islam.

Jihadist fighters are presently multiplying in Syria, as well as in places like Libya, Lebanon and Iraq, all convinced by way of romance, adventure, money and future spoils – to take up arms against secular governments, in hopes to trip the light fantastic towards a Sharia society.

As a general rule, cults are anything but transparent. This is part of the attraction – to blend your individuality into a larger pool – to become part of something larger, and more powerful. All faces covered, hiding behind a black ‘al Qaeda’ flag – only it’s hard to know who is behind this black mask – a farmer, a Syrian defector, a jihadists, a Libyan, a Saudi, an Afghan, a Blackwater mercenary, a Mossad operative, or an ex-SAS soldier? Ad radical female fighters into this mix and it makes it all the more potent.

Violence, death squads, bombings – romantic to some, but in reality, they are fueled by glorious posts on Twitter, Facebook – and cash. It seems each and every faction involved is willing to make a ‘deal with devil’ in order to realise their own objective. A dangerous game to play.

For the Wahabists in Saudi Arabia, it suits their vision of a new theocratic Middle East caliphate – with a Monarch presiding over the masses.

For the US and Israel, it means they can breed a future enemy – with tensions high they have the guarantee of continued hostilities across the region, more arms and equipment rolling in, and dollars rolling out. A further isolation of Iran suits all parties in question.

A fractured Syria will be easier to control, perhaps new borders can be drawn, asset divided again, and just like Sykes and Picot, some contemporary Western name can write his, or her name into the history books.

This schizophrenic outlook will eventually reach its breaking point. Out of chaos, comes order – or so they say.

The latest from Lebanon…

Americans ‘have made up a new Islam’



Nadezhda Kevorkova

RT.com

The US government is trying to destroy the Muslim world from the inside by creating a so-called “American Islam” that leaves just the shell of the religion, Lebanese politician and analyst Dr. Nacib Hoteit told RT.

Hoteit told RT’s Nadezhda Kevorkova about the three pillars of the American model of New Islam, why the US is purging Christians from the Middle East and how the Syrian rebels’ interests fall into line with those of the US and Israel.

RT: Will the US let the Syrian government win?

Nacib Hoteit: It won’t. But the opposition can’t win, either.

RT: So what are the possible future scenarios?

NH: From a realistic perspective, the US will have to make a break. Now it needs to adapt to the new global status quo. They have to maintain a relationship with Russia and respect BRICS. A decade will pass before the Americans recognize they are not the only masters of the world.

But Americans do not take defeat easily. And when they leave, they will start a fire. Angry at Russia and Iran for outdoing them, they will start fighting them.

There are myriads of Takfirists [a Sunni sect that accuses other Muslims of apostasy], who will go back to their home countries and ignite the flames of feud.

The issue of Palestine has been frozen. Israel has suffered a defeat in Syria and wants to win its positions back. If Hamas returns from Qatar and joins forces with the Resistance Front, this would make other scenarios possible. He who has the weapons sets the tune in Palestine. There is no peaceful solution here.

RT: Is there a danger that the Syrian conflict may spill over to Lebanon?

NH: The spillover has already started. The recent blasts in the Dahiyeh neighborhood of Beirut and in Tripoli are both reverberations of the Syrian crisis. There are structures inside Lebanon that work for Syria. And opinions on Syria are highly divergent inside the country. Add to this the 1.3 million refugees, which is a major problem.

Since 1945, every successful or failed coup in Syria has been staged in Beirut. Right now, Lebanon is a backyard for the armed anti-Assad opposition. The people who come here as tourists are also involved in shipping arms to the opposition.

RT: So who are these people that continue arming the Syrian opposition?

NH: The majority are Syrians. Others come from Saudi Arabia, Libya and Kuwait. They can easily get into Tripoli. Chechens or Afghans might have difficulty getting there, because they have a different background. But Arabs know our traditions.

RT: How does the situation in Syria affect the voters in Lebanon?

NH: The entire Lebanese electorate – including the Sunni, Shia, Christians – is politically divided between the March 8 and March 14 coalitions. About 55 percent vote for March 8 and 40 percent for March 14.

Most Shiites and Armenians support the March 8 Alliance. So do some Sunnis and many Orthodox Christians.

Other Sunnis support the rival bloc. Some are neutral.

Samir Geagea and Bachir Gemayel, representing the Druze and the Maronite Catholics respectively, back the March 14 coalition.

In Lebanon, every community is divided – except for the Shia, with only 1 or 2 percent opposing March 8, but even these clans have little influence or unity. But even with their divergent political agendas and preferred methods, the Shia groups oppose Israel and support Resistance.

‘Resistance to Israel is in every Lebanese household’

RT: The Syrian opposition claims there is no resistance to Israel in Lebanon.

NH: There is resistance in every household. At least one member of each family is armed and ready to fight. But this is not necessarily armed resistance. It is also an economic and cultural way to oppose global pressure and preserve our lifestyle and tradition.

RT: The irony is that the Syrian rebels, Israel and the US equally hate Hezbollah, angered by its reluctance to support occupation of Syria. What contribution has the Resistance movement made to the situation in Syria?

NH: Propaganda is fueling a feud between the Sunni and Shia because the US’s and Israel’s policy in Syria has failed.

There are actually not so many Hezbollah activists in Syria. And they are not Hollywood superheroes – they are ordinary people.

There are two stages of the Syrian conflict. The first one started as the people rose against the ruling regime. At that time, Hezbollah acted as a balancing power that convinced the government [in Syria] to give peaceful protesters a pass.

Together with the Ikhwan and Hamas they did their best to grant rights to the people. Hezbollah mediated the release of prisoners. For about 18 months, Hezbollah took no military action.

The second stage came when the US decided to remove Assad and build a new regime in Syria, rooting out the anti-Israeli Resistance in the region. And they had to bring everyone together to fight this new threat.

Near [the Syrian border town of] Qusayr, rebels attacked 10 Lebanese villages, killing the locals and burning down their houses. The Lebanese government failed to respond. [Most of those who live on the Syrian border are Lebanese citizens.]

Hezbollah started protecting 22 Shia villages, that’s 30,000 people. Hezbollah found an Israeli cell in al-Qusayr, from where they intended to fight against the Resistance. There were reports that Israel plans an attack on the Beqaa Valley to disrupt communication between Shia villages. In al-Qusayr they set up an arms cache for the Syrian opposition.

Hezbollah dealt with the phalangists [a term for all those in Lebanon who cooperate with Israel] with efficiency and precision.

They are also present in Mosque of Sayyidah Zaynab [near Damascus], Prophet Muhammad’s granddaughter. Phalangists laid waste to her tomb and blew up the mosque. Every Shia must protect this place. When she herself was captured, there was no one to protect her. Kidnapping a woman is a crime both in the West and in the East. Now protecting Zaynab’s tomb is every Shia’s obligation.

There’s no Hezbollah in other Syrian cities.

‘No unified front, no united leadership’

RT: From time to time the propaganda machine claims that there are Iranians and Russians fighting in Syria.

NH: Iranian military experts have been in Syria since 1982, but there are very few of them. There are no Russian military experts in Syria.

RT: We hear reports about Chechens fighting in Syria. How do they get there?

NH: They come through Turkey and Jordan. The Chechen fighters are concentrated in Aleppo. Many of them fought in Iraq. They’re the core of the Chechen-Afghan group.

Jabhat al-Nusra is part of Al-Qaeda, but its motivation is more based on religion. Among its members are both Lebanese and Palestinian people. Twenty-five Palestinians, I mean Israeli citizens, and some from Palestinian refugee camps.

There are Muslim groups of 100-200 near Saïda, Jund al-Sham and Osno Ansap. They gather 20-30 people and send them to the frontlines.

It’s only small groups that are fighting, there’s no unified front, no united leadership. There was this one “hero” – he had five subordinates and figured he was in charge of a front.

RT: So, there are small groups without a unified front, but the Syrian war has been raging for two and a half years. Who has been orchestrating it?

NH: The USA plays the leading role here. Back when the Afghan war began, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as a national security advisor under President Carter, said that America is facing a choice: either to dominate the world or lead it. They tried the first option, but ended up in Afghanistan and Iraq. To try the second one, they need Obama and a civil war in every little state.

In Lebanon, it’s Takfiris and the American intelligence agents that are trying to pit people against each other.

The French taught these techniques to their people in North Africa, and the Americans adopted this method. They gather Arabs and arm them with weapons and Takfiri ideology.

‘Gulf countries sent their prisoners to fight in Syria’

RT: How is it possible for the US to direct this process? It’s hardly popular in the Arab world, especially after 9/11.

NH: The Americans dragged Arabs to Afghanistan to fight against the USSR. They went to el-Sadat and forced him to release [Al-Qaeda leader] al-Zawahiri. They formed special Arab units trained in Afghanistan. The USA invaded Iraq and brought al-Qaeda there with them.

Saudi Arabia is al-Qaeda’s main sponsor. The prisons in the Gulf countries stand empty now – all the prisoners were sent to fight in Syria.

The Americans took notice of the poor in Libya, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia, gave them religious slogans and wages. But these people didn’t really have a choice.

The USA is the main player in the international arena, and it plays people and societies as if they were pawns. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are just pawns as well.

They introduced three elements into their new Islam – Takfiris, money and Jihad Al-Nikah.

‘Americans destroy Muslims from the inside’

RT: Could you explain what Jihad Al-Nikah is?

NH: It’s when women are urged to come to Syria to temporarily become the rebels’ wives. About a hundred Tunisian women came back pregnant.

In Syria, women were kidnapped to service soldiers. This has never happened in Islam. This revolution will not succeed.

The only thing phalangists are talking about in Syria are male and female genitals. Their fatwas are all about that. Saudi Sheikh al-Luhaydan says that driving has a negative effect on childbearing. As if Islam boils down to genitals and intercourse.

Their slogans are nowhere near Muslim tenets. Sunni groups are opposing Sunnis, opposing their own. The USA can’t wage a war here, so they made up this new Islam.

The British were the first to try and create a new Islam, with a tie.

American Islam is as artificial a construct as Christian Zionists. And Jihad Al-Nikah is the main evidence that this isn’t the true Islam.

Instead of liberating Palestine, you can send women to Syria. It is the most dangerous way of brainwashing Muslims.

Americans propagate war in every family, propagate sexual relationship, they destroy Muslims from the inside. They say that Muslims should be liberated but in fact they are eliminating the essence of Islam leaving just the shell of the religion. Passing Islam to Salafis and leaving Muslims in savagery. They regard women as a source of satisfaction. They don’t regard the US and Israel as enemies and occupiers – but as those who will let them liberate the territories from the otherwise-minded. They believe they will establish a lot of emirates, appoint emirs and banish Christians.

Americans and Israelis want the kind of Islam based on takfir.

RT: How can you explain the fact that Muslims from all over the world have been called to Syria – to the country that never saw clashes between religious communities and whose Christian community is so strong and lives side by side with Muslims?

NH: The US acts against Christians in the East on purpose. In Palestine, Israel cooperated with the US – they wanted to banish Christians out of there. Driving Christians away from Palestine has been continuing since the occupation – they went to great lengths in order to make 120,000 Christians leave Bethlehem in particular.

When the US occupied Iraq, Israelis were in charge of driving away Christians from there and they succeeded.

So there was just Syria left and they switched their attention to it. But in Syria it can only be done by destroying Islam from the inside, removing science and culture.

RT: How will US-Russian agreements on chemical weapons affect the region?

NH: The agreement between the US and Russia is much wider and deals not only with chemical weapons. They discussed plenty of aspects: Iran’s nuclear program, Bahrain, Syria, Yemen, the Caucasus. The draft is prepared. The issue of chemical weapons in Syria is a way to enter another issue – chemical weapons of Israel. They even addressed such details as the “Death to America” slogan in Iran.

Clashes between different groups in Syria take place in the run-up to the Geneva-2 conference. The Jaish group threatened to blow up cars at the border if Turkey doesn’t open a checkpoint.

RT: Is the military tension at the Lebanese-Syrian border now less acute?

NH: It has subsided significantly. The Ercel township is the only checkpoint for weapons. The Lebanese army will shut it down by force.

Starting from August 21, the Syrian Army has been clearing the territory of Syria but the mass media don’t touch this issue. They all are focused on Iran, while the Syrian Army is conducting an attack.

The hysteria around chemical weapons of August 21 was rooted in two things: first, there was an ambush laid for guerillas, and second, the army carried out a successful offensive.

We think that the security services, after 2 1/2 years of war, have realized that the phalangists can’t win.

Saudi intelligence chief Prince Bandar had a deadline till October for dismissing Assad – he wanted to become the king of Saudi Arabia. Bandar takes orders from the US – he is an American who seeks to get the Saudi Arabian throne.

You need two legs to keep walking: one leg is Bandar, the other is Abdullah. But there are also princes – the offspring who seek to get their slice of the pie. Saudi Interior Minister Mohammed bin Nayef is al-Qaeda’s enemy. Bandar is its leader. They both act [with] the permission of the US. You need different shoes to walk in different lands.

RT: Is there any information about the two kidnapped bishops?

NH: We don’t know anything. We have no idea why they have been kidnapped. We believe Turkish security services have a hand in it. One of the bishops is the Patriarch’s brother. It was a blow targeted directly at the Orthodox Church, since it goes against war and is the pillar of conciliation in Syria. The slogan of the Church in Aleppo was “peace and accord in Syria.” The Patriarch’s brother played a very important role in the process of conciliation.

Their kidnapping has a knock-on effect on Russia, too. We believe that Turkey is responsible for that, which gives us hope that the bishops are alive. This is the second part of Turkey’s plan, because they have failed in the first one, which implied quickly occupying Syria.

RT: Some said the bishops had been kidnapped by the Chechens, some said they had been killed.

NH: All these small groups are not independent – they are not autonomous, each has a leader who gives orders.

RT: Do you think there may be a leader who ordered the killing of the Italian monks?

NH: The Italian monk was killed during the attack on a cloister in Rakka – there was a real mess there.

But talking about the bishops, the Chechens couldn’t have acted independently, not obeying their leaders. Otherwise they will lose their arms corridor. Turkey keeps these groups under control, looking as if butter wouldn’t melt in its mouth. It happened a few times, including the incident with chemical weapons. How come there was sarin, the one that was found in the homes of the militants from Jabhat al-Nusra? It was real sarin. But Turkey’s court discharged those people in two weeks, saying they had no idea what kind of weapon they had.

‘INDIANS, GOOD’…

David Cameron voiced his determination today to make it easier for Indian businessmen and students to work, study and invest in the UK as he arrived in Mumbai at the head of the largest trade mission ever to travel overseas with a prime minister.

But Cameron made clear that in return, he wanted India to tear down outdated barriers to investment to help UK-based companies in areas like insurance and banking to establish a foothold in the fast-growing economy.

Speaking on the first day of his second visit to India as PM, Cameron revealed he was talking to the government in Delhi about the prospects for a new corridor of development between Mumbai and Bangalore, featuring new towns and infrastructure, which could provide opportunities for British planners, architects, construction firms and finance specialists.

… ‘BUT ROMANIANS, BAD‘

David Cameron will try and get the EU to change its rules to stop benefits being paid to arriving immigrants. The Sun reports Iain Duncan Smith sa saying: “We have one big battle here. It’s all to do with the European Union. The prime minister’s very strong on this one. People shouldn’t use the free movement rules just to travel around looking for the best benefit that they can get.”

According to IDS the changes may not be as difficult as they would seem at first glance, as Cameron has the support of Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries.

But Ed Miliband, who is on his own mini-foreign tour this week, has warned against raising false expectations. He told told BBC Radio 5Live’s Pienaar’s Politics: “I think that the way you should always approach these issues is talk about what you can do, don’t start floating things unless you know that they are actually possible to be done.

“We said around the issue of Romania and Bulgaria of course we should look at the benefits issue and access to benefits. All of those issues should be looked at but let’s look at what can be done because I think it’s very, very important that you don’t raise people’s expectations and then find that you can’t actually make a difference.","2013-02-18 12:19:04","0","7.0","7.0","0.0","0.0","8.0","0.0","70.0","69.0","0.0","30.0","0.0","2.0","0","366","81.55","73.51","12.88","71.88","28.15","22.95","80.33","48.63","10.93","5.74","0.55","1.09","1.37","1.91","0.82","5.19","6.28","16.12","8.47","3.28","6.28","1.37","16.67","4.64","2.73","1.09","1.37","0.55","4.64","3.55","1.09","0.00","0.27","0.00","8.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.91","11.75","1.91","2.19","2.46","1.09","1.37","3.01","3.28","1.91","1.37","0.00","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.66","1.64","1.91","4.10","3.01","1.09","3.01","11.48","1.64","13.11","3.01","6.01","4.10","5.46","0.82","0.00","2.73","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.75","4.10","4.10","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.82","1.91","3.28","0.00","0.00","1713","8.59","31.333333333333332","522","363","13","60.08","14.1","11.8","11.61","15.8","82","15.5","22.19581267217631","232","27.33","13","0.47","0","14","3","29","0","48","25","1","2","11","43","43","1","27","0","0","20","4","13","0","0","1","17","0","30","9","11","7","7","6","1","3","0","0"

Russia says arming foreign-backed militants fighting against the Syrian government is in violation of international law.

“Arming the opposition is in breach of international law,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a joint press conference with his British counterpart William Hague in London on Wednesday.

The conference was also attended by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and his British counterpart Philip Hammond.

“International law does not allow, does not permit supplies of arms to non-governmental actors and in our point of view it is a violation of international law,” Lavrov said.

The Russian foreign minister reiterated that it is only up to Syrians to decide the future of their nation.

He also rejected any chance of Moscow pressuring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad into stepping down.

Lavrov made the remarks one day after British Prime Minister David Cameron said London would mull ignoring a European Union arms embargo on Syria in order to pave the way for sending weapons to the militants fighting against the government.

On March 8, the Russian diplomat said Moscow is opposed to any preconditions to halt the ongoing turmoil in Syria since his country’s top priority is to save lives.

Lavrov said those who say Assad must disappear before the start of any talks have a different priority than the lives of the Syrian people.

On March 11, a member of Syria’s opposition bloc, known as the National Coalition, held talks with Lavrov in Moscow in an effort to persuade Russia to back calls for Assad’s resignation.

Many people, including large numbers of security personnel, have lost their lives in the foreign-backed unrest that erupted in Syria in March 2011.

21st Century Wire says…

UPDATED 12PM EST

An incident took place on Saturday evening….

Early reports were that a flare may have been planted in the engine. Apparently, the vehicle’s occupants escaped ‘within an inch of their lives.’

According to local law enforcement in greater Kansas City, a police report is pending, and more information should be available on details of the incident as soon as a statement is released (TBA).

Is the establishment targeting this American patriot? This activist believes he has a remedy to protect the American people from an out of control Federal government. Perhaps some people do not want his message to gain any steam.

Considering he is on the road, changing locations daily, this threat to Ernest Lee could be serious, sophisticated and organized, and one can only imagine where these attacks may be coming from.

More details from BIN below…

Before It’s News

When Activism Becomes Deadly

Ernest “General” Lee, the man who was thrust into the media spotlight as one of the lead organizers for the trucker protest this past October, and is who is now traveling across the country calling for an Article-V Convention, had a near fatal attempt made against his life and the life of those riding along with him in his RV on Saturday, November 16, 2013, in Kansas City Missouri.

The General explained that he was attempting to make a turn when he heard a loud hissing noise as the engines stalled. Everyone exited the RV and saw right away a fire had started in the engine. The group observed something fall out of the the engine onto the ground and roll out onto the pavement. Watch first video:

When police arrived on the scene they identified the object as a possible road flare that had fallen out of the engine compartment. Fire dispatch arrived ten minutes after the initial call for help and as General Lee put it, “They were nine minutes too late”.

According to General Lee, the investigation team in Kansas City is reporting it may have been more than one road flare shoved into the engine compartment that caused that amount of damage so quickly. Watch second video:

General Lee says, this attempt has set him back a little but that he has no plans to let it stop him. He intends to move onward.

Along with clothing and personal effects the team lost everything, including laptops vital to their mission. A donor stepped forward and donated an RV to get the general and his crew back on the road.

One thing is sure, legitimate activists have been coming under attack as of late.

Multiple attempts have been made to infect top alternative media personalities and activist with email attachments containing child porn. Some of these criminals are even going so far as to hack into the computers of activists they don’t like, gaining passwords to their personal online accounts so they can create fake documents. The documents are then used to back up their online claims of that person being corrupt. Now it looks like it might have gone so far as attempted murder.

The General added that, ” Had we been sleeping when that timer went off, everyone in the RV would be dead.”

(…) Obviously, General Lee (photo, left) would be the perfect target because of the attention he has received while participating in the Trucker Protest, his work with the 1,000 Mile March and Convention of States. He is a man with the charisma and voice of a true leader. The establishment rightly fear men like General Lee.

Historically, men like Lee meet with untimely and suspicious “accidents” that are never explained. Lee is a real threat because he is revolutionary in his thinking, and the people who fear voices like the General’s, will do whatever it takes to shut those voices up.

This is the story of a real patriot who has given up everything because he believes in the principals on which this country was founded.

“All that’s necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.”

21st Century Wire says…

No doubt egged on by the US-UK-Franco Axis – and with no evidence to back up its claim, Syria’s offshore western-backed puppet ‘Opposition’ government-in-waiting has accused Bashar al Assad of transferring chemical weapons to Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Sounds like a familiar play.

Incredibly, even the Israelis are not touching this one. That should tell you something.

Before the Obama-Cameron-Hollande plan for a fast-track attack totally collapsed three weeks ago, this accusation would have been done by the likes of elite water carriers like John Kerry or William Hague, but since being publicly humiliated diplomatically by overwhelming evidence of a ‘rebel’ false flag chemical attack and by Russia’s impressive diplomatic calculus (sorry to steal Obama’s favourite new word), the western Axis powers have been left with no choice but to get the foreign-based Syria western-funded Puppet Opposition to do their PR mudslinging for them.

This is probably the first sensible strategy deployed by the west thus far, because at least these false accusations will not directly affect their credibility as an objective observer, which at present, is hovering somewhere alongside North Korea.



Nasrallah: Accusation is “laughable”.

Reuters reports…

‘Hezbollah denies receiving chemical weapons from Syria’

(Reuters) – Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah denied on Monday that his group had received chemical weapons from Syria.

Last month, members of the “Syrian National Coalition” opposition group accused President Bashar al-Assad of transferring chemical weapons to the Lebanese Shi’ite group to avoid inspection after agreeing to put them under international control.

“This accusation is truly laughable,” Nasrallah said in a televised speech. “We understand the dimensions and background of these accusations, and these have dangerous consequences for Lebanon.

“We decisively and conclusively deny these accusations which have absolutely no basis in truth.”

Syria has agreed to give up its chemical weapons under a plan agreed by the United States and Russia after Western powers blamed Assad’s government for a chemical attack that killed hundreds of people in a Damascus suburb last month.

Israel’s commander on the frontier with Syria, Major-General Yair Golan, said this month that Hezbollah sought precision ground-to-ground rockets, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles from Syria in return for helping Assad, but “as far as we can tell” it did not want his chemical weapons.

Nasrallah called for a political solution in Syria and urged Sunni powers Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Gulf Arab countries that have backed the rebels to “review their positions”.

“A gamble on a military resolution and on military success is a losing and destructive gamble,” he said…

21st Century Wire says…

Although the ‘official’ guestlist for Bilderberg has been made public through the major media for the first time this year, the real interest will be in who is NOT on the list…

Today’s Bilderberg coverage which was streamed live on the Guerilla Media Network, saw the UK’s Liberty Tactics team reveal from reports on the ground in Watford that both Hillary Clinton and her husband, former US President Bill Clinton, were spotted entering Bilderberg’s Grove Hotel today, along with luminaries David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger.



PHOTO: Hello Hillary?

Both the jet-setting Clintons were also present at Kissinger’s 90th birthday party this past Monday night in New York City.

James Britpod from Liberty Tactics explains about Bilderberg’s non-guestlisters who have been spotted, “We do have Hillary, Bill, as well as quite a lot of others”.

Sadly, American Free Press veteran journalist Jim Tucker passed away in April, but as was revealed on Guerilla Media’s live stream today, Tucker’s baton has been passed to his fellow reporter Mark Anderson, including old and new inside contacts within the Bilderberg organisation itself.

When asked about the difficulty in seeing Bilderberg VIP’s through the parade of tinted windows, journalist Anderson aptly explained how, “The dark windows match the dark personalities inside”.

21st Century Wire says… This is how America is dispensing justice with regards to the Gitmo detainees it has tortured to glean self-incriminating “evidence”. This is how the “military courts” do their justice – all done behind closed doors at an off-shore location. The biggest laugh of all is watching the US power structure attempt to pin the 9/11 attacks on the randoms they’ve managed to scoop up over the past 10 years, some of whom are actually Pakistani, Saudi, CIA and British terror assets in the field – as well as a select few who have been re-deployed back into the terrorist theatre overseas, and who are now back working on the payroll. Still chasing that fairy tale of 19 hijackers doing 9/11 – and all the other hilarious conclusions in the official 9/11 story. Bush is gone, this is Obama’s cover-up project now…

Our verdict: Obama is a hypocrite and a liar for continuing the Gitmo farce.

RT

Pre-trial hearings in the Guantanamo Bay war crimes tribunals have been delayed to address the disappearance of defense legal documents from Pentagon computers, military officials said on Thursday.

A weeklong hearing was scheduled to start on Monday for Abd al Rahim al Nashiri – a Saudi Arabian citizen alleged to be the mastermind of the bombing of the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen in 2000. The attack killed 17 US soldiers aboard the ship and wounded 37 others.

But the trial has now been pushed back to June 11, the US naval base said in an order on Thursday.

It comes just one day after Nashiri’s lawyer, Ricard Kammen, urged Army Colonel James Pohl – who oversees the war crimes court – to cancel this week’s hearing.

He said that officials mishandled more than 500,000 defense lawyer emails and appear to be monitoring their internet searches as they prepare their cases. Kammen also addressed the disappearance of documents, which he blamed on a Pentagon server failure.

“We want to put the case on hold…to find the scope of the intrusions,” Kammen said in a Wednesday statement. “Was this the product of negligence or something worse? Also, we need to have the problem fixed.”

Kammen said he was uncertain when the server failure occurred, but said it involved around seven gigabytes of data, or many thousands of pages or documents. He added that information pertaining to his case and others was recovered, but defense teams still need time to review files to make sure nothing was lost or changed.

Forty-eight year old Nashhiri has been held at Guantanamo for six years and seven months. In February 2008, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) confirmed that waterboarding was used on Nashiri and two other prisoners.

Meanwhile, defense lawyers plan to ask Pohl to delay a week of pre-trial hearings for five detainees charged with plotting the September 11 attacks. The hearings are scheduled to begin on April 22.

The attorneys said their confidential documents began vanishing from Pentagon computers in February, and that there was evidence their internal emails had been searched by third parties.



“Three to four weeks’ worth of work is gone, vanished,” Navy Commander Walter Ruiz, who represents 9/11 defendant Mustafa al Hawsawi, said.

He added that what appeared to be a computer folder of prosecution files had turned up on the defense lawyer’s system, though none of them had opened the files.



“I’ll be filing a hand-written motion very shortly to ask for an abatement of the proceedings,” in the 9/11 case, said defense attorney James Connell, who represents defendant Ali Abdul Aziz Ali.

The mysterious situation prompted Colonel Karen Mayberry, defense counsel for the tribunals, to order military and civilian defense lawyers to stop using their government computers for sensitive information and drafts of their work.

In a separate incident, system administrators were searching files at prosecutors’ request and were able to access more than half a million defense files, including confidential attorney-client communications, the lawyers said.

A spokesperson for Human Rights First – a long-term critic of the Guantanamo tribunals – has called the latest situations “absolutely outrageous.”

“This is just further evidence that the military commission system is a sham and that all terrorism trials should be held in real US federal courts on US soil, where the rules are clear, defendants’ rights are respected, and the verdicts will have credibility,”

– Daphne Eviatar said.

In January 2009, US President Barack Obama ordered the facility to be closed within a year, and banned certain interrogation methods.

However, in May of that year, the US Senate refused to allow the prison to be closed until the president provided more detail as to what would be done with the prisoners.

The news of the missing documents comes as dozens of Guantanamo detainees take part in a hunger strike to protest against their conditions, which UN human rights chief Navi Pillay calls a“clear breach of international law.” Thursday marks the 65th day of the hunger strike.

21st Century Wire

Something is very wrong with this picture…

The most disturbing thing about this President’s recent public address to students in Ohio is not just the usual abstract content that’s become a signature of the Party Leader’s speech, but the almost uncanny similarity to Adolph Hitler’s speeches pre-Nuremberg, during the transition into the Nazi’s Third Reich.



The following is no exaggeration, and it is based on the very words of the President of the United States.

Whoever is writing Obama’s speeches is well aware of the power of propaganda, where the flamboyant leader lays out his blank canvas of ‘hope’ and ‘change’, devoid of any real specifics, leaving the audience with no other choice but to project their own ideals on the Party Leader’s empty backdrop. It could be a speech by Chairman Mao, Hitler or Stalin, or simply a popular CEO’s address to the shareholders right before the company is about to be sold off and broken up. The leading effect is the same. A Leader who presents his public with high democratic-sounding concepts like, “our brave, creative, unique experiment in self-rule”, while he concentrates more and more power into his executive branch of government.

Hitler sold his people abstract dreams and threats to the security of the “Fatherland”. Obama sells the same abstracts to his people about their new “Homeland”.

This is what makes Barack Obama unlike any President in US history, he says he’s in the process of changing America, but too few Americans are quick to grasp where exactly his change is heading. “Trust only our government, and reject the voice of the skeptics”, the Party Leader tells his people, as he turns neighbor against neighbor in order to try and preserve the power of the state.

It’s the same slippery slope that so failed states in history have fallen down because rather than being aware of how society was changing, they chose instead to remain fixated on their Party Leader.

Still not convinced? Listen to his latest address to the county’s youth…

U.S. President Barack Obama gives the commencement address to the graduating class at Ohio State University on May 5, 2013 in Columbus, Ohio…

“I dare you, Class of 2013, to do better. I dare you to do better,” Obama said.

Obama also urged the students to “reject these voices” that warn of the evils of government, saying:

“Still, you’ll hear voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that’s the root of all our problems, even as they do their best to gum up the works; or that tyranny always lurks just around the corner. You should reject these voices. Because what they suggest is that our brave, creative, unique experiment in self-rule is just a sham with which we can’t be trusted.

We have never been a people who place all our faith in government to solve our problems, we shouldn’t want it to. But we don’t think the government is the source of all our problems, either. Because we understand that this democracy is ours. As citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us. It’s about what can be done by us, together, through the hard and frustrating but absolutely necessary work of self-government…”

21st Century Wire says…

Just when you thought that US Secretary of State John Kerry couldn’t go any lower, he manages to scout out new depths of political depravity. Now he says he’s prepared to pimp the US military out to his Gulf Arab allies, to fight for their gas fields in Syria…

Press TV reports: “With respect to Arab countries offering to bear costs and to assist, the answer is profoundly yes,” Kerry said on Wednesday in the House of Representatives. “They have. That offer is on the table.”



In response to questions by US lawmakers about the details of the offer, Kerry said, “they have been quite significant. I mean, very significant.”

“In fact, some of them have said that if the U.S. is prepared to go do the whole thing, the way we’ve done it previously in other places, they’ll carry that cost. That’s how dedicated they are to this,” he added.

Nevertheless, Kerry refused to reveal the name of the Arab countries that have offered Washington to cover the cost of its war on Syria as antiwar activists sat behind him hold their red-painted hands aloft.

A truly pathetic display of leadership from an American Secretary of State.

21st Century Wire says…

Cyber crime is big business in the US. It’s used to spy, steal, harass competition, political opponents, or to stage an attack and blamed it on a foreign enemy.

Is the government in on this global criminal industry? Yes, and in bigger ways than you could ever imagine…

This disturbing trend is enabled domestically by an institutionally corrupt US legal system and a police state which are fast working to shut and jail security consultants and white hat hackers who help to expose security flaws and government hegemony over cyber space. The reason for this is because the state wants to be able to operate in secret – as the world’s biggest and most prolific hacking machine. In other words, the US government want hackers to exist, but only hackers who are on their payroll.

Still not convinced? According to McAfee Systems, the United States is home to the largest number of ‘bot-nets’ or “zombie armies” – a hive of computers that are used to generate spam, relay viruses and flood networks and servers with excessive requests to cause it to fail – in the world, and even control remote overseas servers used to hack other computers worldwide.

Want more? Data from Germany’s Deutsche Telekom shows that more attacks against its networks come from the US.

Obama will tell his people that the Chinese are responsible for this hack, or that one. Still think that the US is not the number one cyber threat to the planet in 2013?

Read this shocking report…



The United States government is investing tens of millions of dollars each year on offensive hacking operations in order to exploit vulnerabilities in the computers of its adversaries, Reuters reports.

According to an in-depth article published Friday by journalist Joseph Menn, the US and its Department of Defense contractors are increasingly pursuing efforts to hack the computers of foreign competitors, in turn exposing a rarely discussed aspect of the nation’s clandestine cyber operations.

In a time when the government continues to prosecute alleged domestic computer criminals — so much so that demands for technology law reform have been rampant as of late — Menn says the US is guilty of spending millions on discovering, identifying and exploiting previously unknown security flaws, often gaining unfettered access to the systems and networks of international targets.

As a result, the US has become one of the world’s top players in regards to wreaking havoc over the Internet — even as calls to investigate foreign hackers increase in Congress.

On Tuesday, a bipartisan supported proposal was introduced in Congress specifically to protect US commercial data from being compromised by foreign hackers. According to Menn, however, the American government is just as guilty of cyber crimes as the countries it warns against in introducing the “Deter Cyber Theft Act”.

“Even as the US government confronts rival powers over widespread Internet espionage, it has become the biggest buyer in a burgeoning gray market where hackers and security firms sell tools for breaking into computers,” Menn wrote.

In his report, Menn explained that a large chunk of the country’s current cyber endeavors does not rely on defensive strategy as one might imagine, but instead involves offensive operations launched with the intent of causing harm on the computers of adversaries.

Menn wrote defense contractors “spend at least tens of millions of dollars a year” on simply researching exploits that, if pursued, could put the eyes and ears of the American intelligence company essentially anywhere in the world.

And although the US has not officially gone on the record to acknowledge these shadowy operations, Menn wrote that the nation’s most well-known cyber endeavor — the Stuxnet worm that targeted Iranian nuclear plants — is just one example of the budding attempts to attack foreign entities.

“Computer researchers in the public and private sectors say the US government, acting mainly through defense contractors, has become the dominant player in fostering the shadowy but large-scale commercial market for tools known as exploits, which burrow into hidden computer vulnerabilities,” he wrote.

“In their most common use, exploits are critical but interchangeable components inside bigger programs. Those programs can steal financial account passwords, turn an iPhone into a listening device or, in the case of Stuxnet, sabotage a nuclear facility.”

Menn cited several defense contractors and government officials — many speaking on condition of anonymity — who admitted the increasingly dominant role the US government has in pursuing research on these exploits and using them to attack rival networks.

According to the report, “Reuters reviewed a product catalogue from one large contractor, which was made available on condition the vendor not be named. Scores of programs were listed. Among them was a means to turn any iPhone into a room-wide eavesdropping device. Another was a system for installing spyware on a printer or other device and moving that malware to a nearby computer via radio waves, even when the machines aren’t connected to anything.”

These contractors, he wrote, spend upwards of $100,000 on licensing single operations to governments, including the US. The result has been the development of a thriving industry, largely underground, where exploits are bought and sold before patches are developed to protect against intrusions. These “zero-day exploits”— labeled as such because developers are unaware of the flaw until it’s announced — fetch big bucks from contractors, governments and hackers.

And as the demand for these exploits increases, so do the players in the game. One example cited by Menn is Atlanta-based Endgame Inc., which recently brought in $23 million in funding courtesy of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. But as early as 2011, Endgame and similar entities have been on the radar of hacktivists hell-bent on exposing the largely unknown doings of defense contractors.

When the loose-knit hacking collective Anonymous investigated security consultants HBGary in 2011, they uncovered only the tip of an intricate iceberg made up of former federal employees and other intelligence workers being paid boatloads to give governments exploits that could be used to their advantage. Project PM, the open-source online think tank started by former Anonymous collaborator Barrett Brown, discussed Endgame and its associates in great detail.

From a Business Week article cited by Brown:

“Endgame executives will bring up maps of airports, parliament buildings and corporate offices. The executives then create a list of the computers running inside the facilities, including what software the computers run, and a menu of attacks that could work against those particular systems. Endgame weaponry comes customized by region — the Middle East, Russia, Latin America and China — with manuals, testing software and ‘demo instructions.’ There are even target packs for democratic countries in Europe and other US allies.”

Last year Brown was arrested on unrelated counts and remains in custody six months later with an eventual trial still a ways before him. The US government has since subpoenaed Internet host Cloudflare for records pertaining to Project PM, and has equated the website as a criminal enterprise.

“Project PM served as a forum through which defendant Brown and other individuals sought to discuss their joint and separate activities and engage in, encourage, or facilitate the commission of criminal conduct online,” the government alleged when it fought back attempts from the current Project PM administrator to quash that subpoena.

Brown fired back from prison: “It makes it much more obvious that this investigation and the charges against me has to do with our successful research into what may be criminal activities by firms close to the government.”

If convicted on all counts — more than one dozen including threatening a federal agent andsharing a hyperlink — Brown could be sentenced to 100 years in prison.

“It is virtually impossible to conclude that the obscenely excessive prosecution he now faces is unrelated to that journalism and his related activism,” Glenn Greenwald wrote earlier this year for The Guardian.

Meanwhile, Menn admitted that other investigative computer work — specifically discovering exploits like the one Endgame thrives off of — is an endeavor that discourages people outside of the government and defense industry from entertaining.

“Most companies, including Microsoft, Apple Inc. and Adobe Systems Inc, on principle won’t pay researchers who report flaws, saying they don’t want to encourage hackers,” he wrote. “Those that do offer ‘bounties,’ including Google Inc. and Facebook Inc., say they are hard-pressed to compete financially with defense-industry spending.”

Andrew Auernheimer, a 26-year-old independent security researcher, was recently sentenced to 41 months in prison for identifying and disclosing a harmless exploit on the servers of AT&T that allowed anyone with the know-how to collect the email addresses of thousands of Apple iPad users. After he was convicted, Auernheimer wrote for Wired that the selective prosecution of some security researchers will deter future hackers from ever disclosing exploits, even critical ones that effect national security.

“In an age of rampant cyber espionage and crackdowns on dissidents, the only ethical place to take your zero-day is to someone who will use it in the interests of social justice. And that’s not the vendor, the governments, or the corporations — it’s the individuals,” he wrote. “In a few cases, that individual might be a journalist who can facilitate the public shaming of a web application operator. However, in many cases the harm of disclosure to the un-patched masses (and the loss of the exploit’s potential as a tool against oppressive governments) greatly outweighs any benefit that comes from shaming vendors. In these cases, the antisec philosophy shines as morally superior and you shouldn’t disclose to anyone.”

21st Century Wire says…

As a diplomatic solution for Syria’s chemical stockpile is underway, another dark soul is pushing for more blood in the Middle East…

US Sen. Lindsey Graham was a strong supporter of President Obama’s strike plan on Syria, even though there really was no clear plan at all.

Graham is now seeking a resolution to authorize the president to use military force against Iran. Graham wastes no time wearing his hawkish wings, as he tries to setup the next war after Syria.

Graham like McCain and Kerry is ‘shilling’ for another globalist banker produced conflict, instead of representing the people of the United States…

Sen. Lindsey Graham to seek authorization for U.S. attack on Iran

Sen. Lindsey Graham is one of the strongest advocates of an American military strike against the Assad regime in Syria. He was unhappy when President Obama decided to seek congressional authorization for an attack, and then unhappy when his fellow lawmakers voiced disapproval of the president’s plan. Graham believes the diplomatic path chosen by the administration will lead to a debacle.

Given all that, Graham now says he will work with a bipartisan group of senators to craft a resolution authorizing the president to use military force — not against the Syrian regime but against Iran. In an appearance on Fox News’ Huckabee program over the weekend, Graham argued that such a resolution is essential, because American inaction in Syria will encourage Iran to go forward with its nuclear weapon program, eventually leading toward a Mideast conflagration if the U.S. doesn’t intervene.

“Look how we’ve handled the chemical weapons threat in Syria,” Graham said. “If we duplicate that with the Iranians, they’re going to march toward a nuclear weapon and dare Israel to attack them. So in the next six months, our friends in Israel are going to have to take the Iranians on, unless the United States can send a clear signal to Iran, unlike what we’ve sent to Syria.”

The engineering of fear, and how to deploy it against the people- this is the War on Terror in a nutshell.

“US Senator Diane Feinstein tells us terror threats are escalating. New groups, new tactics… But when asked for details…”

“Can’t say anything. National security, don’t you know.”

Here’s the truth about the “threats”…

Brasscheck TV

There’s a terror war on America alright, but it’s being waged on America not by turbaned men in caves, but by US “intelligence” and “law enforcement” agencies against the minds of the American people.

Anyone with half a brain who has spent even 10 seconds deconstructing the “plots” and “threats” the FBI has supposedly thwarted knows they are utter nonsense. It’s always the same story: Half-wits losers without a clue are corralled into going along with schemes invented and funded by the FBI and then arrested at the last minute… making the FBI heroes and justifying ever more waste of time, money and effort and abuse of citizens by so called law enforcement who are “keeping everybody safe.”

21st Century Wire says…

Projecting microwaves – whether they be from WiFi, 3G phones, Dec phones, TETRA communications systems, or from exotic government applications like weapons, is gambling with the future of humanity.

This risk extends not just to general tissue health, but also to future male and female reproductive capability.

One of many studies returns as conclusive:

“Previous studies on microwave radiation from cell phones found that the radiation from a cell phone can decrease sperm quality, and advised against men carrying cell phones in their pant pocket. This new study is the first to investigate the impact of microwave radiation from wifi-enabled laptops on sperm. In four hours of exposure, the scientists found decreased sperm motility and DNA damage.

The human sperm was exposed to a laptop computer connected to the internet with WiFi, which transmits data using pulsed microwaves.

“It is possible that the radiation generated by WiFi may produce damage in other organs like the ovaries because microwaves pass through human tissue,” says Avandano, “but it is necessary to do more research to prove it.”

“With jaded eyes and features you think they really care.” – The Misfits (Where Eagles Dare)

Glenn Danzig, singer, lyricist and founding member of the horror punk band the Misfits, sounds off about liberal hypocrisy in America…

Another celebrated figure in the music industry is speaking out about the current political climate in America. Danzig joins the likes of Jello Biafra, Billy Corgan, Lauryn Hill and American music legend Charlie Daniels, as a voice for individual sovereignty.



In May of this year, 21WIRE covered a court case involving singer Lauryn Hill, Hill was then subsequently ordered by the court to receive re-education for her “political conspiracies” in addition to the tax related charges she faced.

Will more artists be subject to political re-education?

Danzig’s interview can be read below…



City Pages

Kory Grow

The name Glenn Danzig has lived in metal and punk fans’ vocabularies since 1977, when he started the legendary horror-punk group Misfits. But to music fans who didn’t dwell in the underground, Danzig became Danzig in 1988, with the release of his eponymous band’s self-titled debut. That album was a direct punch in the face to all hair metal bands, and a departure from the reverb-heavy goth punk of Samhain, Glenn’s band between the Misfits and Danzig — thanks to some crisp, direct production by producer extraordinaire Rick Rubin and a focused, bluesy metal sound. It featured the irrepressible “Mother,” which didn’t become a hit until MTV put the 1993 live version of the song in its Buzz Bin. Thanks to heavy touring and Metallica talking about the band, having just covered Misfits’ “Last Caress,” Danzig became an unstoppable force that year.

Now, Danzig is celebrating the milestone of their 25th anniversary with a special tour that stops at Myth on Saturday. “When you go onstage, the energy from the people and from the audience changes a lot of it,” he explains. “When I go out there, I just take their energy and send it back fiftyfold.” Gimme Noise caught up with Danzig to talk about his legacy and his forthcoming covers record, which features a duet he did with Cherie Currie of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra’s “Some Velvet Morning.” Luckily for us, he didn’t mind looking back.

What do you remember about the beginning of Danzig?

There wasn’t really bands like Danzig. There were a lot of big poofy, poseury hair bands. And Danzig was just, like, T-shirts with cut-off sleeves. [Laughs] We had no poofy hair. And we were loud, like metal-punk, I guess you would call it. And most people just said, “This is going to be gone in a week.” And here I am 25 years later. It’s great. [Laughs] And all the hair bands are pretty much a joke, so that’s great, too.

The first Danzig album sounded pretty different from your previous band, Samhain. Why did you tighten it up?

Rick [Rubin] was probably important in that. He helped focus some of my ideas. Of course he had his own ideas about producing. Half those tracks were songs I was writing for Samhain anyway.

What songs evolved from the Samhain demos?

“Twist of Cain” was pretty different. “Mother” was a song I wrote about the PMRC [the Parents Music Resource Center, spearheaded by Tipper Gore]. But I think we’d already been working with Rick when I wrote it. So it was much different. We tore it apart and put it back together.

Metallica’s James Hetfield made some uncredited appearances on the album. How did that come about?

He was hanging out with us in L.A. I had to go back to the studio. He said he wanted to come along. I was like, “Oh, sure! Don’t worry about it.” [Laughs] It was much different then. Because everybody hung out a lot. As bands get bigger and stuff, I don’t think there’s enough time, or people get families and things. And they don’t hang out as much anymore.

I’ve read that he did some howling on “Possession.” Is that what you asked him to do?

I’m pretty sure he just sang the “possession” parts. [Laughs] Yeah, he’s on “Possession,” “Twist of Cain” and probably one other one. He’s not on “Mother.” But he’s on probably one other track.



You mentioned that “Mother” was about the PMRC. Were they a problem for you specifically?

Yeah, you know, Al Gore wanted to tell people what they could listen to and what they couldn’t, what they could record. It was basically coming down to the idea that he wouldn’t let anybody record any music that he didn’t think you should be doing. There was going to be an organization that would tell you what you could and couldn’t record. And certainly if you couldn’t record it, you couldn’t put it out. It was really fascist.

My view on Democrats is that they’re fascists disguised as liberals, or liberal moderates. You’re not allowed to say anything that they don’t agree with. You’re not allowed to do anything. Also, the whole Obama, “I can kill anybody with a drone with no trial,” is kind of disturbing. I’m surprised that more people who are supposedly liberal aren’t more disturbed by it. I think whatever Obama does is OK with them, because he’s Obama. It’s bullshit.

It’s the same thing with the PMRC telling you, “Bands can go on trial for their music.” What’s next, Wagner is going to get arrested? What? He’s dead. [Laughs]

21st Century Wire says…

Free market and libertarian icon Ron Paul has finally jumped into the cryptocurrency debate – on the side of Bitcoin…



As far currencies, or commodities go, Bitcoin ticks all the right boxes for the Paul camp – no inflation, limited money supply, and with no ties to the Central banks.

This week, it broke through the $1000 barrier and is still set to rise in value – all while the US dollar is dropping in value. Critics are wishing it goes away, but it looks like it’s here to stay, for a while anyway.

Here’s what Ron Paul has to say about it…



Jose Pagliery

CNN Money

Imagine a world in which you can buy anything in secret. No banks. No fees. No worries inflation will make today’s money worth less tomorrow.

The digital currency Bitcoin promises all these things. And while it’s far from achieving any of them — its value is unstable and it’s rarely used – some have high hopes.

“There will be alternatives to the dollar, and this might be one of them,” said former U.S. congressman Ron Paul. If people start using bitcoins en masse, “it’ll go down in history as the destroyer of the dollar,” Paul added.



It’s unlikely that Bitcoin would replace the dollar or other government-controlled currencies. But it could serve as a kind of universal alternative currency that is accepted everywhere around the globe. Concerned about the dollar’s inflation? Just move your cash to bitcoins and use them to pay your bills instead. Tired of hefty credit card fees? Bitcoin allows transactions that bypass banks.

Even economists who embrace the power of central banks, like University of Michigan professor Miles Kimball, recognize the currency’s potential.

“Bitcoin really shows governments are behind the curve,” Kimball said. “It demonstrates there’s a demand for an electronic equivalent of cash.”

Bitcoin is hardly the first attempt at a digital currency that operates outside of state boundaries. Ebay’s (EBAY, Fortune 500) PayPal plans to launch a digital interplanetary payment system. There’s also growing support for a concept called seasteading, floating cities on international waters where business and innovation aren’t held back by laws.

Millions of Africans, particularly in Kenya, make payments simply by texting one another. The widely used M-PESA system allows people to bypass banks and electronically transfer cash. Some even use mobile minutes as a form of currency.

Digital payments make buying items internationally a smoother process, because exchange rates are gone and there are no cumbersome bank regulations or fees. It also enables people to make payments in areas without bank access or where carrying cash can be dangerous.

WHERE’S ED? Snowden has been marooned in Moscow’s transit lounge for 4 days now. Is he still in Russia?

Our readers can decide for themselves…

21st Century Wire

REYKJAVIK, Iceland – Yesterday evening June 26th, at approximately 3:00am Iceland time, an in-bound Russian Sukhoi Super Jet 100-95 chartered flight landed at Keflavik International Airport, after being held in a holding pattern for approximately 45 minutes while circling the airport.

Maybe it was just a “wind test”? We contacted local Iceland media who are claiming that aviation authorities are saying it was some sort of a test.

Or was this a privately chartered jet carrying a controversial and unannounced cargo, and waiting for clearance to land?

Interesting, so let’s take a look…





PHOTO: Our man in Iceland took this photo just after 3am last night when this Russian chartered flight landed Keflavik International.

21st Century Wire’s Man in Iceland tracked this flight on FlightRadar24.com last night, and followed-up by documenting the plane itself (above) after landing just after 3:00am Reykjavík local time early this morning. He explained:

“There’s an old military base with hangers there next to Keflavik International Airport, and the Russian plane was hiding there between two hangers. The tail number 97005 matches the flight I tracked coming in”.

“With all the other in-coming flights on FlightRadar24 you could click on the flight and it would reveal the origin of the flight – all except this one. It appeared to be removed, so some of this flight’s data was not being transmitted as with the others – maybe this is because it was a test flight? That’s still a possibility at this point”.

“I went to the arrivals terminal after this flight landed and did not see anyone coming through.”

Based on the information we have so far, this does not appear to be regularly schedule commercial flight, and the flight’s point of origin was concealed on tracking system Flight Radar24. What was this flight about then?

Is Snowden in Iceland already?



Speculation is still rife in the global media as to where Snowden is heading. The possibility that he will be camping out within the confines of the international transit compartment of the Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport for weeks, or months, without either being processed as an asylum seeker in Russia, or moved on to a friendly foreign destination – seems highly unlikely.

Add to this the fact that mainstream media crews with blank checkbooks have swarmed Moscow’s Airport this week and still have NO confirmation of a visual ID in Moscow either. Yesterday, the Telegraph confirmed this:

“The Daily Telegraph and other media scoured Sheremetyevo’s three southern terminals on Wednesday but airport staff, receptionists at a capsule hotel, policemen, Russian consular officials and passengers all claimed they had not seen the American.”

So no press have actually seen Ed Snowden in Moscow. It seems that this high-profile whistleblower’s public status is still being managed by Icelandic based organisation Wikileaks. It appears that Wikileaks is acting as a media liason of sort, giving press updates on Snowden alleged status in Moscow:

“It seemed likely the whistleblower was in a closed area of the airport and WikiLeaks, the organisation that has been supporting Mr Snowden, said he was safe and well.” Could Wikileaks be running the PR smoke and mirrors cover for their cyber-hero Snowden, a potentially asset and golden goose for the organisation? Could all of the press flares be misdirection by Wikileaks in order to conceal his flight to Iceland? Wikileaks have already let slip in public late last week on June 20th that chartered private jets were paid for and ready on standby to transport Snowden to Iceland. Then, only two days ago, Wikileaks appears to have thrown a screen over their private chartered jets claim as their spokesman Olafur Sigurvinsson did a U-turn by announcing that the jets ‘have been canceled: “The three planes that were on standby in Hong Kong have been cancelled. There is nothing happening there. They were cancelled this morning,” Olafur Sigurvinsson, former chief operating officer at WikiLeaks partner firm DataCell, told AFP.” There was also the loud media announcement that Snowden requested asylum status from the Ecuador government led by President Rafael Correa – which could very well be a distraction, this supported by the fact that Ecuador’s foreign minister announced yesterday it could take months to decide on Snowden’s asylum case, leaving him in limbo effectively, stuck in a Russian transit wing with an annulled and invalid US Passport. 21st Century Wire already indicated two days ago that Snowden’s Plan A has always been Iceland, so it’s possible that this mystery jet which has landed in Reykjavík early this morning, might have well have been ferrying the NSA whistleblower extraordinaire to his new Wiki-bunker in Iceland.



Above is a zoomed-in photo of the Sukhoi Super Jet, tail number 97005, on the tarmac this morning in Iceland, which matches the Flight Radar data in the screen shot below.

Below is the flight record of this Russian aircraft which arrived last night:





Still no reports from our man on the ground in Iceland about any visual ID on Ed Snowden himself, but we will keep looking.

But then again, still no visual ID of him in Moscow either. The world will wait and see where he turns up next.

Stay tuned for more reports…

Seattle joined by Charlottesville, Va. in rejecting federal and DHS local drone roll-out

Patrick Henningsen

21st Century Wire

It’s one of those stories that you had to listen twice when you heard the report on the radio, and then, still in a state of suspended disbelief, I rushed to the internet to check and see if indeed it was the case. With the good news, I could just about hear a faint pulse of the American heart beating again.

It’s safe to assume that after this week’s developments, corporate lobbyists, politicians, bureaucrats at the DHS, county sheriffs, city police – and maybe The President perhaps… should at least know by now – that Americans do not want drones flying over their cities and towns. A wave of resistance is currently building…

In Seattle, where residents laid seige to the Seattle Police Department’s plans to use surveillance drones, it appears that following Wednesday night’s Public Safety, Civil Rights and Technology Committee hearing – the program has been scrapped.

.

This news comes on the back of a week of controversy surrounding Obama’s CIA Director nominee, John O. Brennan, seen by many as a pioneer of sorts in the field of US military secret drone assassinations. This has presented an ethical dilemma for President Obama, who ascended to power on a liberal PR wave which is fundamentally at odds with this level of anti-constitutional and illegal policy.

Obama himself signed the bill in early 2012 that enabled some 30,000 drones in the domestic US, to be operated by the Department of Homeland Security and local police departments, Seattle being one such city scheduled for adoption of a junior ‘Skynet’ beta program that even Arnold could be proud of.

Make no mistake about it – there is an Washington DC-based agenda to roll out drones all over the country. Seattle’s Police Department had obtained these two small drones through a federal grant.

Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn explained:

“Today I spoke with Seattle Police Chief John Diaz and we agreed that it was time to end the unmanned aerial vehicle program so that SPD can focus its resources on public safety and the community building work that is the department’s priority. (They) will be returned to the vendor.”

Public protesters gathered in for the October public meeting on the city’s new drone program, which prompted police to quickly retreat on the issue:

“The testimony opposing drones has been overwhelmingly clear that the 11 people who testified this afternoon, all of whom testified against the use of drones, was symbolic of the general reaction we are getting,” said Chairman Bruce Harrell.

Compared to other direct actions, this was a relatively modest effort, which should encourage other citizen groups keeping the encroaching police state at bay – for now at least. Mia Jacobson who represents the citizen group StandUP explains, “If 11 voices can protect the people from flying government robots watching their every move – what can 20 voices do? What can your voice accomplish?”.

In addition to Seattle, the city of Charlottesville, Va., also rejected drones by ordering a two-year moratorium on their use thanks to The Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties group.

According to FOX news: the U.S. Department of Homeland Security drones do enter Washington State airspace occasionally, patrolling the Canadian border east of the Cascade mountains. The two 10,000-pound Predator-B unmanned aircraft are based in North Dakota.

Back on Pennsylvania Ave, Sen. Diane Feinstein who was chairing Obama’s CIA directorate confirmation hearings for drone-master John Brennan, came under some similar pressure from crowds of protesters, some of whom were ‘Code Pink’ anti-war demonstrators who were able to ‘gatecrash’ the DC venue.

Brennan defended US state-sponsored murders by unmanned drones abroad by claiming that drone strikes are used only against targets ‘planning to carry out attacks against the United States’, completely missing out on the extrajudicial nature of the killings (including an estimated 100 children) which is actually causing the whole controversy. Back to square one…

IMAGE: Where Did the Towers Go?

21st Century Wire says…

These four different university studies listed below reveal a lot about the psychology of official story ‘gatekeepers’ and how irrational and emotionally unstable they become when challenged with an alternative view…

****

Recent studies by psychologists and social scientists in the US and UK suggest that contrary to mainstream media stereotypes, those labeled “conspiracy theorists” appear to be saner than those who accept the official versions of contested events.

The most recent study was published on July 8th by psychologists Michael J. Wood and Karen M. Douglas of the University of Kent (UK). Entitled “What about Building 7? A social psychological study of online discussion of 9/11 conspiracy theories,” the study compared “conspiracist” (pro-conspiracy theory) and “conventionalist” (anti-conspiracy) comments at news websites.

The authors were surprised to discover that it is now more conventional to leave so-called conspiracist comments than conventionalist ones: “Of the 2174 comments collected, 1459 were coded as conspiracist and 715 as conventionalist.” In other words, among people who comment on news articles, those who disbelieve government accounts of such events as 9/11 and the JFK assassination outnumber believers by more than two to one. That means it is the pro-conspiracy commenters who are expressing what is now the conventional wisdom, while the anti-conspiracy commenters are becoming a small, beleaguered minority.

Perhaps because their supposedly mainstream views no longer represent the majority, the anti-conspiracy commenters often displayed anger and hostility: “The research… showed that people who favoured the official account of 9/11 were generally more hostile when trying to persuade their rivals.”

Additionally, it turned out that the anti-conspiracy people were not only hostile, but fanatically attached to their own conspiracy theories as well. According to them, their own theory of 9/11 – a conspiracy theory holding that 19 Arabs, none of whom could fly planes with any proficiency, pulled off the crime of the century under the direction of a guy on dialysis in a cave in Afghanistan – was indisputably true. The so-called conspiracists, on the other hand, did not pretend to have a theory that completely explained the events of 9/11: “For people who think 9/11 was a government conspiracy, the focus is not on promoting a specific rival theory, but in trying to debunk the official account.”

In short, the new study by Wood and Douglas suggests that the negative stereotype of the conspiracy theorist – a hostile fanatic wedded to the truth of his own fringe theory – accurately describes the people who defend the official account of 9/11, not those who dispute it.



IMAGE: Few are willing ask why over 1000 car were fried up to a mile from the WTC on 911.

Additionally, the study found that so-called conspiracists discuss historical context (such as viewing the JFK assassination as a precedent for 9/11) more than anti-conspiracists. It also found that the so-called conspiracists to not like to be called “conspiracists” or “conspiracy theorists.”

Both of these findings are amplified in the new book Conspiracy Theory in America by political scientist Lance deHaven-Smith, published earlier this year by the University of Texas Press. Professor deHaven-Smith explains why people don’t like being called “conspiracy theorists”: The term was invented and put into wide circulation by the CIA to smear and defame people questioning the JFK assassination! “The CIA’s campaign to popularize the term ‘conspiracy theory’ and make conspiracy belief a target of ridicule and hostility must be credited, unfortunately, with being one of the most successful propaganda initiatives of all time.”

In other words, people who use the terms “conspiracy theory” and “conspiracy theorist” as an insult are doing so as the result of a well-documented, undisputed, historically-real conspiracy by the CIA to cover up the JFK assassination. That campaign, by the way, was completely illegal, and the CIA officers involved were criminals; the CIA is barred from all domestic activities, yet routinely breaks the law to conduct domestic operations ranging from propaganda to assassinations.

DeHaven-Smith also explains why those who doubt official explanations of high crimes are eager to discuss historical context. He points out that a very large number of conspiracy claims have turned out to be true, and that there appear to be strong relationships between many as-yet-unsolved “state crimes against democracy.” An obvious example is the link between the JFK and RFK assassinations, which both paved the way for presidencies that continued the Vietnam War. According to DeHaven-Smith, we should always discuss the “Kennedy assassinations” in the plural, because the two killings appear to have been aspects of the same larger crime.

Psychologist Laurie Manwell of the University of Guelph agrees that the CIA-designed “conspiracy theory” label impedes cognitive function. She points out, in an article published in American Behavioral Scientist (2010), that anti-conspiracy people are unable to think clearly about such apparent state crimes against democracy as 9/11 due to their inability to process information that conflicts with pre-existing belief.

In the same issue of ABS, University of Buffalo professor Steven Hoffman adds that anti-conspiracy people are typically prey to strong “confirmation bias” – that is, they seek out information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs, while using irrational mechanisms (such as the “conspiracy theory” label) to avoid conflicting information.

The extreme irrationality of those who attack “conspiracy theories” has been ably exposed by Communications professors Ginna Husting and Martin Orr of Boise State University. In a 2007 peer-reviewed article entitled “Dangerous Machinery: ‘Conspiracy Theorist’ as a Transpersonal Strategy of Exclusion,” they wrote:

“If I call you a conspiracy theorist, it matters little whether you have actually claimed that a conspiracy exists or whether you have simply raised an issue that I would rather avoid… By labeling you, I strategically exclude you from the sphere where public speech, debate, and conflict occur.”

But now, thanks to the internet, people who doubt official stories are no longer excluded from public conversation; the CIA’s 44-year-old campaign to stifle debate using the “conspiracy theory” smear is nearly worn-out. In academic studies, as in comments on news articles, pro-conspiracy voices are now more numerous – and more rational – than anti-conspiracy ones.

No wonder the anti-conspiracy people are sounding more and more like a bunch of hostile, paranoid cranks.

21st Century Wire says…

US Congress delivered a possible death blow to Bilderberg and CFR plans to fund and send weaponry to foreign Islamic terrorist mercenaries in Syria.

The effort was being championed in Washington DC by President Obama and his colleagues John McCain and Lindsey Graham, among others.

This latest news will also come as a disappointment to the UK, France and Turkey – all of whom have invested all of their political capital into the destabilisation in Syria, in the hopes of installing a new puppet government to replace the current regime of Bashar al Assad. Israel remains quiet about its own intentions, although many are speculating about Israel’s plans use the ensuing chaos to take land in the Golan Heights region, as well using the conflict as cover to inflict damage on Lebanon’s Hezbollah north of the Israeli border.

What killed their plan to open the doors to a full-on proxy war was concerns over handing weapons to al-Qaeda-affiliated groups like Jabhat al-Nusra, aka the al-Nusra Front – the opposition’s leading terrorist army who are currently being funded by US and UK allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

Congress derails Obama plans to arm Syrian rebels

.

RT

Though the Obama administration has authorized military aid to the rebel opposition currently engaged in a civil war with the government of Bashar Assad, it now appears that the US Congress has essentially blocked that move over terrorism fears.

Members of both the House and Senate intelligence committees have moved to enact stringent restrictions on funding the Syrian rebels, a move sufficient to prevent the White House from delivering on arms shipments according to sources who spoke with The Hill.

In mid-June, following allegations from the White House that the Assad government had used chemical weapons against opposition forces moving to depose him, the Obama administration authorized arms shipments in a marked escalation of US involvement in the region.



IMAGE: Many of the groups in Syria that make up the “opposition” confab are directly linked to al Qaeda.

“This is going to be different in both scope and scale in terms of what we are providing,” said Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser at the time.

Now, according to sources familiar with committee activity, restrictions on that increased aid to Syria’s opposition may have essentially stopped the administration in its tracks.

According to The Hill, lawmakers moved to block the military aid out of fears that weapons would fall into the hands of terrorist groups. US analysts are in particular concerned over the strengthening of the Syrian al-Qaeda-affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the al-Nusra Front.

Though the Obama administration had long stated that the use of chemical weapons by Assad’s government constituted a “red line,” it seems that lawmakers on the intelligence committees are more worried about the regional threat posed by Islamist elements now engaged against Syrian government forces.

Jabhat al-Nusra is thought to control as many as 10,000 supporters within Syria. Meanwhile, it is also believed that Iran is currently training Hezbollah fighters within Syria, in growing tension against the Sunni-backed al-Qaeda affiliates of the Syrian opposition forces.

“Whatever we do, we have to make sure we do it right,” said Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Tuesday.

“If we are going to arm, we have to make sure we have control of what arms are out there and how people are trained to use those arms so they don’t fall into the hands of our enemy al-Qaeda,” added Ruppersberger.

Since the mid-June announcement that the Obama administration would seek to funnel military aid to Syria’s insurgency, it had set out to sell that plan to members of Congress. Both Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden briefed the intelligence panels in June.

Despite efforts by the White House to increase momentum for its new Syria policy, support appeared to be splintered on Tuesday, even amongst members of Congress who were in favor of arming the opposition.

“It’s not clear to me that the administration has a workable policy,” said Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), a member of the Intelligence Committee.

Beyond the key House and Senate intelligence committees, which hold funding oversight, Senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, accused the Obama administration of covertly pushing military aid behind the closed doors of the Intelligence Committee.

“They should come and talk about this openly,” Corker told reporters Tuesday.

“It puts the Intelligence Committee in a very awkward place. All of a sudden, they own it,” he added.

According to The Hill, though Obama administration officials stopped just shy of saying efforts to arm the Syrian opposition had been thwarted, congressional opposition was not likely to make it any easier…

THE SECOND AMENDMENT BROKEN DOWN

Recent mass shootings have started new efforts to further break down the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The people have a right to protect themselves against the government, according to the founding fathers who drafted the document.

“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

“A well regulated Militia,” ~ This phrase’s meaning is open to debate about who does the regulating, with the government and the people both claiming the right to regulate or govern the militia. Should the military be a reflection of the populace, or stronger than its population. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Massacres like Black Wallstreet, M.O.V.E., and the one portayed in the movie Rosewood, depicting the massacre in rural Levy County, Florida, in January 1923, and recent ones could have possibly been prevented by a well armed populace. There have been many shootings stopped by armed citizens. The real “D’jango Unchained”, Dangerfield Newby, was with John Brown at Harper’s Ferry, on October 16, 1859, and illustrated the contrast between The Government’s and The People’s militias, the government won, and slavery continued. The Battles of Lexington and Concord started the American Revolution, and illustrates The People’s Militia winning, and …..

THE BIRTH OF A NATION

The film ”Birth Of A Nation”, was the Clansman‘s portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan as heroes, and their racist violence against the defenseless, as American Knights in white sheets. Without protection, there can be no security.

“being necessary to the security of a free State.” ~ This phrase means that there can be no security without it.

“the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,” ~ This phrase emphasizes the inalienable right to self defense.

“shall not be infringed.” – INFRINGED :

To transgress or exceed the limits of; violate: infringe a contract; infringe a patent, defeat, invalidate.

THE FIRST U.S. GUN CONFISCATION

“The Special Report of the Anti-Slavery Conference of 1867 complained that freedmen were “forbidden to own or bear firearms and thus, rendered defenseless against assaults” by whites. Or as a letter printed in the Jan. 13, 1866 edition of Harper’s Weekly observed: “The militia of this county have seized every gun found in the hands of so-called freedmen in this section of the county.“

This was the second gun confiscation in the history of America, the first sparked the American revolution, which commenced with “The Shot heard around the world!” at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. a date, which is tied to the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, The Waco Texas tragedy, and the wrongful conviction of Youtube’s July 4 Patriot AKA: USMC’s Sgt. Charles Dyer, who help start the organization called “The Oath Keepers” with E. Stewart Rhodes.

MASS SHOOTINGS CONSPIRACY THEORIES

“Guns Kill People” is being heard in the wake of the recent shootings, but would armed teachers have been able to protect the children more effectively? ThaNorthStar wrote an article, dealing with the recently proposed gun laws titled ”Obsessive Fear”, you can read it :

HERE

Internet chatter is abound about conspiracy theories ranging from MKULTRU mind control programming related to the London Interbank Offered Rate ( Libor) scandal which falsely manipulated the interest rates, to plots to enact anti-gun legislation. Does the ILLUMANATI exist? Maybe not technically, but…

OUR HISTORY IS NOT WHAT WE THINK

The Ill Community’s Adrian Brody blessed us with a video that expresses a very convincing theory on human evolution, which not only goes against the theories taught in the public fool system, but also explains the many unexplained aspects of those theories. The video is fast paced. It is full of amazing information that can be independently corroborated by experienced researchers.

"http://thefrt.com/why-do-bankers-rule-the-world-must-see-videos/","Why Do Bankers Rule the World?? Must See VIDEOS!!","In the 2012 edition of Occupy Money released last week, Professor Margrit Kennedy writes that a stunning 35% to 40% of everything we buy goes to interest. This interest goes to bankers, financiers, and bondholders, who take a 35% to 40% cut of our GDP. That helps explain how wealth is systematically transferred from Main Street to Wall Street. The rich get progressively richer at the expense of the poor, not just because of “Wall Street greed” but because of the inexorable mathematics of our private banking system.

This hidden tribute to the banks will come as a surprise to most people, who think that if they pay their credit card bills on time and don’t take out loans, they aren’t paying interest. This, says Dr. Kennedy, is not true. Tradesmen, suppliers, wholesalers and retailers all along the chain of production rely on credit to pay their bills. They must pay for labor and materials before they have a product to sell and before the end buyer pays for the product 90 days later. Each supplier in the chain adds interest to its production costs, which are passed on to the ultimate consumer. Dr. Kennedy cites interest charges ranging from 12% for garbage collection, to 38% for drinking water to, 77% for rent in public housing in her native Germany.

Her figures are drawn from the research of economist Helmut Creutz, writing in German and interpreting Bundesbank publications. They apply to the expenditures of German households for everyday goods and services in 2006; but similar figures are seen in financial sector profits in the United States, where they composed a whopping 40% of U.S. business profits in 2006. That was five times the 7% made by the banking sector in 1980. Bank assets, financial profits, interest, and debt have all been growing exponentially.

http://www.oftwominds.com/blogsept12/cui-bono-Fed9-12.html.

Exponential growth in financial sector profits has occurred at the expense of the non-financial sectors, where incomes have at best grown linearly.

http://lanekenworthy.net/2010/07/20/the-best-inequality-graph-updated/

By 2010, 1% of the population owned 42% of financial wealth, while 80% of the population owned only 5% percent of financial wealth. Dr. Kennedy observes that the bottom 80% pay the hidden interest charges that the top 10% collect, making interest a strongly regressive tax that the poor pay to the rich.

Exponential growth is unsustainable. In nature, sustainable growth progresses in a logarithmic curve that grows increasingly more slowly until it levels off (the red line in the first chart above). Exponential growth does the reverse: it begins slowly and increases over time, until the curve shoots up vertically (the chart below). Exponential growth is seen in parasites, cancers . . . and compound interest. When the parasite runs out of its food source, the growth curve suddenly collapses.

People generally assume that if they pay their bills on time, they aren’t paying compound interest; but again, this isn’t true. Compound interest is baked into the formula for most mortgages, which compose 80% of U.S. loans. And if credit cards aren’t paid within the one-month grace period, interest charges are compounded daily.

Even if you pay within the grace period, you are paying 2% to 3% for the use of the card, since merchants pass their merchant fees on to the consumer. Debit cards, which are the equivalent of writing checks, also involve fees. Visa-MasterCard and the banks at both ends of these interchange transactions charge an average fee of 44 cents per transaction—though the cost to them is about four cents.

How to Recapture the Interest: Own the Bank

The implications of all this are stunning. If we had a financial system that returned the interest collected from the public directly to the public, 35% could be lopped off the price of everything we buy. That means we could buy three items for the current price of two, and that our paychecks could go 50% farther than they go today.

Direct reimbursement to the people is a hard system to work out, but there is a way we could collectively recover the interest paid to banks. We could do it by turning the banks into public utilities and their profits into public assets. Profits would return to the public, either reducing taxes or increasing the availability of public services and infrastructure.

By borrowing from their own publicly-owned banks, governments could eliminate their interest burden altogether. This has been demonstrated elsewhere with stellar results, including in Canada, Australia, and Argentina among other countries.

In 2011, the U.S. federal government paid $454 billion in interest on the federal debt—nearly one-third the total $1,100 billion paid in personal income taxes that year. If the government had been borrowing directly from the Federal Reserve—which has the power to create credit on its books and now rebates its profits directly to the government—personal income taxes could have been cut by a third.

Borrowing from its own central bank interest-free might even allow a government to eliminate its national debt altogether. In Money and Sustainability: The Missing Link(at page 126), Bernard Lietaer and Christian Asperger, et al., cite the example of France. The Treasury borrowed interest-free from the nationalized Banque de France from 1946 to 1973. The law then changed to forbid this practice, requiring the Treasury to borrow instead from the private sector. The authors include a chart showing what would have happened if the French government had continued to borrow interest-free versus what did happen. Rather than dropping from 21% to 8.6% of GDP, the debt shot up from 21% to 78% of GDP.

“No ‘spendthrift government’ can be blamed in this case,” write the authors. “Compound interest explains it all!”

More than Just a Federal Solution

It is not just federal governments that could eliminate their interest charges in this way. State and local governments could do it too.

Consider California. At the end of 2010, it had general obligation and revenue bond debt of $158 billion. Of this, $70 billion, or 44%, was owed for interest. If the state had incurred that debt to its own bank—which then returned the profits to the state—California could be $70 billion richer today. Instead of slashing services, selling off public assets, and laying off employees, it could be adding services and repairing its decaying infrastructure.

The only U.S. state to own its own depository bank today is North Dakota. North Dakota is also the only state to have escaped the 2008 banking crisis, sporting a sizable budget surplus every year since then. It has the lowest unemployment rate in the country, the lowest foreclosure rate, and the lowest default rate on credit card debt.

Globally, 40% of banks are publicly owned, and they are concentrated in countries that also escaped the 2008 banking crisis. These are the BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India, and China—which are home to 40% of the global population. The BRICs grew economically by 92% in the last decade, while Western economies were floundering.

Cities and counties could also set up their own banks; but in the U.S., this model has yet to be developed. In North Dakota, meanwhile, the Bank of North Dakota underwrites the bond issues of municipal governments, saving them from the vagaries of the “bond vigilantes” and speculators, as well as from the high fees of Wall Street underwriters and the risk of coming out on the wrong side of interest rate swaps required by the underwriters as “insurance.”

One of many cities crushed by this Wall Street “insurance” scheme is Philadelphia, which has lost $500 million on interest swaps alone. (How the swaps work and their link to the LIBOR scandal was explained in an earlier article here.) Last week, the Philadelphia City Council held hearings on what to do about these lost revenues. In an October 30th article titled “Can Public Banks End Wall Street Hegemony?”, Willie Osterweil discussed a solution presented at the hearings in a fiery speech by Mike Krauss, a director of the Public Banking Institute.

Krauss’ solution was to do as Iceland did: just walk away. He proposed “a strategic default until the bank negotiates at better terms.” Osterweil called it “radical,” since the city would lose it favorable credit rating and might have trouble borrowing. But Krauss had a solution to that problem: the city could form its own bank and use it to generate credit for the city from public revenues, just as Wall Street banks generate credit from those revenues now.

A Radical Solution Whose Time Has Come

Public banking may be a radical solution, but it is also an obvious one. This is not rocket science. By developing a public banking system, governments can keep the interest and reinvest it locally. According to Kennedy and Creutz, that means public savings of 35% to 40%. Costs can be reduced across the board; taxes can be cut or services can be increased; and market stability can be created for governments, borrowers and consumers. Banking and credit can become public utilities, feeding the economy rather than feeding off it.

Another drawback to being religious, or at least Christians losing out on top jobs





Atheists tend to be more intelligent than religious people, according to a US study.

Researchers found that those with high IQs had greater self-control and were able to do more for themselves – so they do not need the benefits that religion provides.

They also have better self esteem and built more supportive relationships, the study authors said .

The conclusions were the result of a review of 63 scientific studies about religion and intelligence dating between 1928 and last year.

In 53 of these there was a ‘reliable negative relation between intelligence and religiosity’.

In just 10 was that relationship positive.

Even among children, the more intelligent a child was the more probable it was that they would shun the church.

In old age the same trend persisted as well, the research showed.

The University of Rochester psychologists behind the study defined religion as involvement in some or all parts of a belief.

They defined intelligence as the ‘ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience’.

In their conclusions, they said: ‘Most extant explanations (of a negative relation) share one central theme – the premise that religious beliefs are irrational, not anchored in science, not testable and, therefore, unappealing to intelligent people who ‘know better’.

‘Intelligent people typically spend more time in school – a form of self-regulation that may yield long-term benefits.

‘More intelligent people getting higher level jobs and better employment and higher salary may lead to higher self-esteem, and encourage personal control beliefs.’

Study co-author Jordan Silberman, a graduate student of neuroeconomics at the University of Rochester, said: ‘Intelligence may lead to greater self-control ability, self-esteem, perceived control over life events, and supportive relationships, obviating some of the benefits that religion sometimes provides.’

Detailed: The research analysed 63 surveys comparing intelligence levels and religious beliefs between 1928 and 2012

Research from the UK last week showed another drawback to being religious, or at least Christian – you lose out in the race for top jobs.

Official figures show nearly one in four people who have no religious belief now live in homes headed by someone with a senior executive job or a place in one of the professions.

But well under a fifth of Christians are employed in the best-paid and most influential jobs or are married to someone who is, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The last census, carried out in March 2011, showed a fall in the number of people that call themselves Christian in the UK.

Christian numbers in England and Wales, including children, fell by 4.1 million in a decade to 33.2 million.

However there was a 45 per cent rise over the same 10 years in numbers who say they have no religion, to 14.1 million.","2013-08-22 00:00:00","0","37.0","38.0","3.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","33.0","33.0","0.0","117.0","5.0","1.0","1","495","94.76","74.11","43.37","94.19","24.75","28.69","87.68","42.83","6.26","2.22","0.00","0.20","0.20","0.00","1.82","4.04","7.88","15.35","4.85","3.03","5.45","1.41","9.70","7.88","6.26","0.81","4.24","3.43","6.26","5.25","0.81","0.20","0.00","0.40","9.70","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.93","4.85","2.02","0.61","3.84","0.81","2.22","2.02","0.81","0.81","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","11.31","2.22","3.23","5.45","1.82","0.81","3.84","5.05","0.81","13.54","1.62","8.89","3.23","8.08","0.00","0.20","0.81","4.85","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.00","15.56","4.04","6.06","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.62","1.41","1.01","0.81","0.00","2495","8.37","27.666666666666668","767","491","21","47.72","14.4","12.4","14.05","15.5","111","12.375","20.40276985743381","258","24.67","4","0.41","0","21","23","49","0","62","45","10","5","4","77","21","3","39","0","0","11","1","19","6","0","3","14","0","10","22","10","7","23","3","4","4","0","0"

Via Washington Post

The U.S. government began to shut down for the first time in 17 years early Tuesday, after a Congress bitterly divided over President Obama’s signature health-care initiative failed to reach agreement to fund federal agencies.

Hours before a midnight deadline, the Republican House passed its third proposal in two weeks to fund the government for a matter of weeks. Like the previous plans, the new one sought to undermine the Affordable Care Act, this time by delaying enforcement of the “individual mandate,” a cornerstone of the law that requires all Americans to obtain health insurance.

The new measure also sought to strip lawmakers and their aides of long-standing government health benefits.

The Democratic-led Senate quickly rejected that plan on a party-line vote. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) urged House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to abandon the assault on the health-care law and pass a simple bill to keep the government open. Otherwise, Reid warned, “the responsibility for this Republican government shutdown will rest squarely on his shoulders.”

Boehner refused to yield. He instead won approval, in a 1 a.m. largely party-line roll call, requesting a special House-Senate committee to meet in the coming days to resolve differences between the two parties, leaving in limbo the fate of millions of federal workers and the services they provide.

Shortly before midnight, the White House budget office issued a memo instructing agencies to “execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations.”

The impasse means 800,000 federal workers will be furloughed Tuesday. National parks, monuments and museums, as well as most federal offices, will close. Tens of thousands of air-traffic controllers, prison guards and Border Patrol agents will be required to serve without pay. And many congressional hearings — including one scheduled for Tuesday on last month’s Washington Navy Yard shootings — will be postponed.

In a last-minute ray of hope for active-duty troops, Congress on Monday approved and sent to the White House an agreement to keep issuing military paychecks. But Obama warned that the broader economy, which is finally starting to recover from the shocks of the past six years, would take a substantial hit if congressional gridlock shutters “America’s largest employer.”

“Keeping the people’s government open is not a concession to me. Keeping vital services running and hundreds of thousands of Americans on the job is not something you ‘give’ to the other side. It’s our basic responsibility,” Obama said in a statement Monday evening at the White House.

Privately, senior Republicans predicted that the closure would last at least a week. A fraction of today’s House Republicans were on Capitol Hill in 1995 and 1996 when a Republican-led Congress last shut down the government in a dispute over the budget with a Democratic president. Younger lawmakers don’t remember the pain the shutdown caused constituents, senior Republicans said. And many of them now question the conventional wisdom that the closures weakened the GOP presidential candidate in 1996 and nearly cost the party

Democrats predicted that if the shutdown stretches into the weekend, the government-funding dispute could be rolled into an even more serious battle over the $16.7 trillion federal debt limit. The Treasury Department will begin running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills as soon as Oct. 17 unless Congress approves additional borrowing authority. With so little time remaining to avoid what would be the nation’s first default, Democratic aides predicted that negotiations to reopen the government may be merged into the debt-limit talks.

On Monday evening, Obama telephoned Boehner to urge him to reconsider his stance on the health-care law. In a call that lasted nearly 10 minutes, according to Boehner’s office, the president reiterated his insistence that there would be no negotiations over the debt limit, and that Congress must pay the bills it has incurred.

Boehner responded by mocking Obama in a speech on the House floor.

“ ‘I’m not going to negotiate,’ ” he said, quoting Obama. “I would say to the president: This is not about me. It’s not about Republicans here in Congress. It’s about fairness.”

The speech drew applause for the embattled speaker, who argued passionately that Republicans were merely seeking “fairness” for working people. Obama has delayed a mandate for employers to insure workers and delayed other requirements for big unions, Boehner said. “Yet they stick our constituents with a bill they don’t like and a bill they can’t afford,” he said.

Despite the show of unity, Republicans on both sides of the Capitol remain deeply divided about the attack on the health-care law. In the House, a group of more moderate Republicans was seething about the decision to bow to the forces that oppose the Affordable Care Act, led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and his allies on the right, including such outside groups as Heritage Action for America.

On Monday, some publicly urged Boehner to drop the issue and seek the help of House Democrats to pass the simple government-funding bill that the Senate approved last week.

“I don’t want to shut down the government,” said Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), who is trying to become her state’s first GOP senator since the 1950s, adding that she was inclined to support a “clean” funding bill.

Shelly Moore

Frustrations also were simmering among Senate Republicans, who complained that House leaders were pressing the attack in direct opposition to public opinion. Polls show that voters overwhelmingly disapprove of using the threat of a shutdown to defund the health-care law and that blame for a shutdown will fall squarely on Republicans.

“By wanting to repeal Obamacare using this method, it defies what the popular will is,” said Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who campaigned last year on behalf of his party’s national ticket.

“I campaigned in 2012 all over this country for months: ‘Repeal and replace Obamacare.’ That was not the mandate of the voters,” McCain said. “If they wanted to repeal Obamacare, the 2012 election would have been probably significantly different.”

John McCain

Adding to the tension Monday was Boehner’s decision to add the provision that would strip lawmakers, congressional staff members and White House aides of the employer subsidies for health insurance they have received for many years.

Now that lawmakers and their aides must join the new health-insurance exchanges, some conservative groups have criticized the subsidies, worth about $5,000 a year for individual coverage and $10,000 for families, as a “special exemption” from the new law. By including the provision, House leaders hoped to attract conservative support and put pressure on Senate Democrats, who faced the choice of shutting down the government to protect their own perks.

“On what flooding peninsula can you stand when it’s a question of delaying the individual mandate, ending member subsidies and funding the government?” said Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.). If Reid kills it, “the senators he’s going to protect become the subject of incredible scrutiny.”

Even some Republicans were uneasy about the prospect of dealing their aides — and some of their colleagues — the equivalent of a big pay cut. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) called it an “outrage,” adding that Boehner had worked directly with Reid and the Obama administration to make sure the subsidies would stay in place when congressional employees join the exchanges next year.

Richard Durbin

Boehner and his team presented the proposal to rank-and-file Republicans in a closed-door meeting Monday. For more than an hour and a half, lawmakers argued about the plan. They emerged with an unusual number of public dissenters, including Rep. Peter T. King (N.Y.), one of a dozen Republicans who ultimately voted against the proposal.

“I don’t want to be the facilitator of a disastrous process and plan,” he said.

Still, most Republicans endorsed the deal, even if somewhat reluctantly. “I think this is a principled call by leadership and it has the support of the con­ference,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), one of Boehner’s closest friends.

Democrats, meanwhile, were united against any attempt by Republicans to extract concessions now, especially with the larger fight over the debt limit swiftly approaching.

Charles Schumer

“The bottom line is very simple,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “You negotiate on this, they will up the ante for the debt limit.”

"http://thefrt.com/confirmation-courts-quietly-confirm-mmr-vaccine-causes-autism/","CONFIRMATION: Courts Quietly Confirm MMR Vaccine Causes Autism","After decades of passionate debate, parents probably missed the repeated admissions by drug companies and governments alike that vaccines do in fact cause autism. For concerned parents seeking the truth, it’s worth remembering that the exact same people who own the world’s drug companies also own America’s news outlets. Finding propaganda-free information has been difficult, until now.

Dr. Andrew Wakefield

At the center of the fifteen-year controversy is Dr. Andrew Wakefield of Austin, Texas. It was Dr. Wakefield that first publicized the link between stomach disorders and autism, and taking the findings one step further, the link between stomach disorders, autism and the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine.

For that discovery way back in 1996, and a subsequent research paper published by the doctor in 1998, Andrew Wakefield has found himself the victim of a world-wide smear campaign by drug corporations, governments and media companies.

And while Dr. Wakefield has been persecuted and prosecuted to the extent of being unable to legally practice medicine because of his discovery, he has instead become a best-selling author, the founder of the Strategic Autism Initiative, and the Director of the Autism Media Channel.

But in recent months, courts, governments and vaccine manufacturers have quietly conceded the fact that the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine most likely does cause autism and stomach diseases. Pharmaceutical companies have even gone so far as to pay out massive monetary awards, totaling in the millions, to the victims in an attempt to compensate them for damages and to buy their silence.

Grassroots outcry

It was a regular reader named Kathleen that brought this ongoing story to our attention here at Whiteout Press. When asked what her connection to the vaccine-autism battle was, the young reader replied, “I just researched it for a school project a while back and then I stayed on top of it, until I couldn’t stand it anymore. I’m not a parent, nor do I belong to any organization – a mere outside observer.”

This reader isn’t alone. The news that vaccines cause autism has spread across the US despite a coordinated media black-out. She takes her concerns one step further explaining, “All I want is to see this information where the public can access it. I’ve looked everywhere, and no one gives this dire Wakefield situation even ONE small mention.” She goes on to give us another motivation for her activism, “In Washington State, where I’m from, vaccines have become mandatory for school children, which is very frightening!”

Landmark rulings

In December 2012, two landmark decisions were announced that confirmed Dr. Wakefield’s original concern that there is a link between the MMR vaccine, autism and stomach disorders. The news went mostly unreported, but independent outlets like The Liberty Beacon finally began publishing the groundbreaking news.

The website wrote last month, ‘In a recently published December 13, 2012 vaccine court ruling, hundreds of thousands of dollars were awarded to Ryan Mojabi, whose parents described how “MMR vaccinations” caused a “severe and debilitating injury to his brain, diagnosed as Autism Spectrum Disorder (‘ASD’).”’

The Liberty Beacon went on to describe the second court ruling that month, as well as similar previous verdicts writing, ‘Later the same month, the government suffered a second major defeat when young Emily Moller from Houston won compensation following vaccine-related brain injury that, once again, involved MMR and resulted in autism. The cases follow similar successful petitions in the Italian and US courts (including Hannah Poling, Bailey Banks, Misty Hyatt, Kienan Freeman, Valentino Bocca, and Julia Grimes) in which the governments conceded or the court ruled that vaccines had caused brain injury. In turn, this injury led to an ASD diagnosis. MMR vaccine was the common denominator in these cases.’

The report echoes the exact same sentiment that our reader conveyed – Dr. Wakefield has had his career and reputation destroyed over the past 15 years, but has just been vindicated. The account reports, ‘While repeated studies from around the world confirmed Wakefield’s bowel disease in autistic children and his position that safety studies of the MMR are inadequate, Dr. Wakefield ’s career has been destroyed by false allegations. Despite this he continues to work tirelessly to help solve the autism catastrophe.’

The article from The Liberty Beacon closes with a direct quote from Dr. Wakefield himself to the independent grassroots outlet, “There can be very little doubt that vaccines can and do cause autism. In these children, the evidence for an adverse reaction involving brain injury following the MMR that progresses to an autism diagnosis is compelling. It’s now a question of the body count. The parents’ story was right all along. Governments must stop playing with words while children continue to be damaged. My hope is that recognition of the intestinal disease in these children will lead to the relief of their suffering. This is long, long overdue.”

Wakefield attacked again

Since the world has slowly become aware of the dangers of the MMR vaccine, parents around the globe have refused to get their children vaccinated. Earlier this year, the UK government singled out Dr. Wakefield and blamed him for the rising number of measles outbreaks in the country. In an April 2013 interview, he responded publicly.

The website TheRefusers.com published both the video, as well as the written transcript, of Dr. Wakefield’s public response. Below are some excerpts of the doctor’s remarks:

“The important thing to say is that back in 1996-1997 I was made aware of children developing autism, regressive autism, following exposure in many cases to the measles mumps rubella vaccine. Such was my concern about the safety of that vaccine that I went back and reviewed every safety study, every pre-licensing study of the MMR vaccine and other measles-containing vaccines before they were put into children and after. And I was appalled with the quality of that science. It really was totally below par and that has been reiterated by other authoritative sources since.

All I could do as a parent was to say, ‘what would I do for my child?’ That was the only honest answer I could give. My position on that has not changed. So, what happened subsequently? At that time the single measles vaccines were available freely on the National Health Service. Otherwise, I would not have suggested that option. So parents, if they were legitimately concerned about the safety of MMR could go and get the single vaccines. Six months later, the British government unilaterally withdrew the importation license for the single vaccines, therefore depriving parents of having these on the NHS; depriving parents who had legitimate concerns about the safety of MMR from a choice; denying them the opportunity to protect their children in the way that they saw fit.

The news shouldn’t be left wing or right wing, conservative or liberal. It should be the news. It should be independent – Whiteout Press

And I was astonished by this and I said to Dr Elizabeth Miller of the Health Protection Agency, ‘why would you do this, if your principal concern is to protect children from serious infectious disease? Why would you remove an option from parents who are legitimately concerned about the safety of MMR?’ And her answer was extraordinary. She said to me, ‘if we allow parents the option of single vaccines, it would destroy our MMR program.’ In other words, her principal concern seemed to be full protection of the MMR program and not protection of children.”

Dr. Wakefield himself reiterates the final conclusion of the courts in various countries, but censored by the world’s media outlets saying:

“Now this question has been answered not by me, but by the courts, by the vaccine courts in Italy and in the United States of America where it appears that many children over the last thirty years have been awarded millions of dollars for the fact that they have been brain-damaged by MMR vaccine and other vaccines and that brain damage has led to autism. That is a fact.”

"http://thefrt.com/are-the-global-elite-losing-control-what-is-the-illuminati-october-surprise-find-out-inside/","Are The Global Elite Losing Control & What Is The Illuminati October Surprise?? [Find Out Inside]","Karma is coming for the elite in a big way. As the Powers That Be head toward a devastating defeat in their war plans for Syria, signs are emerging that their rule over humanity is rapidly diminishing.

Over the last decade the global elite have been on a mad dash to consolidate power over the world. It’s always been their plan like some evil villain in a comic book, but after 9/11 the plan went into overdrive and then turbo charged during the financial crisis of 2008.

Yet it’s doomed to fail because humans are meant to be guided by their own free will, not controlled like livestock. The more the elite try to control humanity, the more entropy occurs. Entropy, for those who don’t know, is the lack of order or predictability; a gradual decline into disorder.

Although the elite still enjoy a huge wealth advantage over the masses, they are now resigned to behaving like tyrants to maintain control. This, in turn, exposes their dark side which has been cleverly concealed for ages. Not anymore.

People are waking up in droves, at least as fast as the elite can build their full-spectrum prison matrix. Let them try. To paraphrase Victor Hugo, “No army can stop an idea whose time has come.”

Here are ten signs that the elite are losing control over the people:

1. Official lies no longer effective: The lies they tell simply don’t work anymore. There was a time when official lies, especially about war and peace, were believed. Because, after all, how evil would it be to lie about such things? Generally people want to believe they are being told the truth when life and death is at stake. The boy who cried wolf has cried one too many times. Even if they told the truth at this point, very few would believe them.

2. No confidence in politics: US politicians have a paltry approval rating. The trust in government is at all-time lows here and around the world. Mainstream polls show only 10% of the public has confidence in Congress. In other words, 90% don’t believe in them to be competent to govern.

Watch this Town Hall exchange below where a man threatens US Senator John McCain with arrest for treason to his face. This would have never happened just a year or two ago:



3. No confidence in media: The most recent polls show that 77% of the population no longer trusts corporate TV news. Is it any wonder why the establishment media failed to sell the lies about the alleged Syria chemical event? With all their monopoly might over the airwaves, they can no longer claim that black is white simply because officialdom says so.

4. Bankers rejected: Hungary recently became the first country to follow Iceland’s lead by shedding international bankers (IMF) and is considering pursuing prosecution of past prime ministers who enslaved the people with debt.



Look for this trend to continue even if nations decide to default to break free.

5. Vatican abruptly cleaning up its act: Under the previous Pope, Pope Benedict, scandals erupted from the Vatican ranging from covering up pedophile priests to money laundering and fraud. Benedict, in an unprecedented move, abruptly retired to make way for a seemingly much more likable Pope Francis. Pope Francis by all measures is working furiously to reclaim the church’s peaceful and humble reputation. Whether this is genuine or a PR move, it’s telling that the church was forced into such a drastic turnaround to save itself from losing all credibility.

6. Mutiny among soldiers: Finally. Soldiers, who are outlawed from making political statements, are steadily speaking out against US military adventurism. As Einstein famously said “The pioneers of a warless world are the young men (and women) who refuse military service.”

7. Militarized police state: One of the darkest signs that the elite are losing their grip on power is the construction of the militarized police state specifically trained to combat domestic civil unrest. Local cops with tanks and other combat gear are working with Feds at Fusion centers, active Army units are on American soil for the first time in history, the NSA spy grid is being used by the IRS and DEA, and the elimination of due process for Americans under the NDAA are just some of the tyrannical moves made to secure the elite criminals from public backlash. They’re clearly scared, and they should be given what they’ve done to the American people and the Constitution.



8. Serious secession movements everywhere: A state seceding from a larger political entity used to be an ultra-fringe concept, until now. In America, secession movements are winning over the public in parts of Colorado and California. In Europe, serious secession movements are happening in Spain and Scotland, as well as several EU nations flirting with the idea of dropping out of the euro. Decentralization = Entropy!

9. GMO food being rejected everywhere: Control the food and you control the people. True in theory, but much more difficult in practice. GMO leaders like Monsanto are being exposed. All of their economic and political strength cannot defeat the spread of knowledge about the dangers of pesticide-soaked Frankenfoods. GMO fields are being burned in protest in America and around the world, informed nations continue to reject their products, and labeling laws are gaining traction.

10. Cannabis liberation: Many reading this will think marijuana legalization is a superficial development. However, it is a major signpost that the elite’s grip is fading. Enormous resourceshave been spent to keep cannabis illegal. Cannabis has been a powerful medicine for physical, mental, and spiritual health throughout the ages. This single plant represents a huge threat to the power structures and their industries, hence its seemingly senseless illegality. The approaching global reversal of the tyrannical policy of prohibition is the first of many concessions to come.

"http://thefrt.com/kanye-west-pissed-over-ray-j-diss-track/","Kanye West Pissed Over Ray J Diss Track??","Kanye West has not publicly commented on the new Ray-J song yet. But, the word is out and the word is that Kanye is furious over “I Hit It First,” a new song that clearly has Ray talking about Kanyeezy’s Kim Kardashian. Everybody can tell this is a ploy for attention and the source over there Hollywoodlife says Kanye won’t fall into that trap. Here is what hey are saying over at HollywoodLife.com – you know how these sources can be.



Kanye West is not pleased at all with the new song, a source close to Yeezy tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

“Ray J is crazy” for releasing a song that overtly disses Kanye and Kim, a source close to the rapper tells HollywoodLife.com. Kanye is very upset over “I Hit It First,” which contains lyrics like, “Hit it from north/Brought her head down south/Now that I’m finished/She’s on to Mr. West.” He’s infuriated that Ray J would trudge up his and Kim’s sex tape from 2007 just to get a little attention.

But the source assures us that Kanye sees the song for what it truly is — a publicity stunt. ”Kanye don’t condone broke ass, jealous [guys] who be trying to bite off he and Kim’s fame just to stay, wait, just to become relevant.”

Even though Kanye’s fuming, the source states that Yeezy won’t be giving Ray J the attention he wants. So we should probably stop hoping for Kanye to release a diss track of his own (that battle wouldn’t even be fair). Instead, don’t expect much of a response from Kim and Kanye, as Ray J fades back into obscurity.

“Tell him to call Ye when he gets to the $100-million mark,” our source concludes. “Cause guess what — Ye ‘hit that’ first.”

Folks keep us talking, but if we stop talking about them then they should worry!

"http://thefrt.com/just-the-thought-of-science-triggers-moral-behavior/","Just The Thought Of Science Triggers Moral Behavior","Looks like they’ll have something to talk about in the atheist church this Sunday.

Via Scientific American:

Researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara set out to test this possibility. They hypothesized that there is a deep-seated perception of science as a moral pursuit — its emphasis on truth-seeking, impartiality and rationality privileges collective well-being above all else. Their new study, published in the journal PLOSOne, argues that the association between science and morality is so ingrained that merely thinking about it can trigger more moral behavior. The researchers conducted four separate studies to test this. The first sought to establish a simple correlation between the degree to which individuals believed in science and their likelihood of enforcing moral norms when presented with a hypothetical violation. Participants read a vignette of a date-rape and were asked to rate the “wrongness” of the offense before answering a questionnaire measuring their belief in science. Indeed, those reporting greater belief in science condemned the act more harshly.

Of course, a simple correlation is susceptible to multiple alternative explanations. To rule out these possibilities, Studies 2-4 used experimental manipulations to test whether inducing thoughts about science could influence both reported, as well as actual, moral behavior. All made use of a technique called “priming” in which participants are exposed to words relevant to a particular category in order to increase its cognitive accessibility. In other words, showing you words like “logical,” “hypothesis,” “laboratory” and “theory” should make you think about science and any effect the presentation of these words has on subsequent behavior can be attributed to the associations you have with that category.

Participants first completed a word scramble task during which they either had to unscramble some of these science-related words or words that had nothing to do with science. They then either read the date-rape vignette and answered the same questions regarding the severity of that transgression (Study 2), reported the degree to which they intended to perform a variety of altruistic actions over the next month (Study 3), or engaged in a behavioral economics task known as the dictator game (Study 4). In the dictator game the participant is given a sum of money (in this case $5) and told to divide that sum however they please between themselves and an anonymous other participant. The amount that participants give to the other is taken to be an index of their altruistic motivation.

Across all these different measures, the researchers found consistent results. Simply being primed with science-related thoughts increased a) adherence to moral norms, b) real-life future altruistic intentions, and c) altruistic behavior towards an anonymous other. The conceptual association between science and morality appears strong.

Though this finding replicates across different measures and methods, there’s one variable that might limit the generalizability of the effect. There is some evidence suggesting that attitudes towards science vary across political parties with conservatives having become decreasingly trustworthy of science over the past several decades. Though the researchers did include measures of religiosity in their studies, which did not affect the relationship between science and morality, ideally they would have also controlled for political affiliation. It’s not a stretch to imagine that undergraduate students at the University of Santa Barbara disproportionately represent liberals. If so, the relationship between science and morality found here might be stronger in self-described liberals.

That said, there’s also reason to believe that the general public, liberal or conservative, can draw a distinction between the scientific process and its practitioners. In the same way that people might mistrust politicians but still see nobility in the general organizing principles of our political structure, we could hold charitable views of science independent of how it might be conducted.

These results might seem encouraging, particularly to fans of science. But one possible cost of assigning moral weight to science is the degree to which it distorts the way we respond to research conclusions. When faced with a finding that contradicts a cherished belief (e.g. a new study suggesting that humans have, or have not, contributed to global warming), we are more likely to question the integrity of the practitioner. If science is fundamentally moral, then how could it have arrived at such an offensive conclusion? Blame the messenger.

How can we correct this thought process? A greater emphasis on, and better understanding of, the method might do the trick. It’s significantly harder to deny the import of challenging findings when you have the tools necessary to evaluate the process by which scientists arrived at their results. That new study on global warming is tougher to dismiss when you know (and care enough to check) that the methods used are sound, regardless of what you think the authors’ motivations might be. In the absence of such knowledge, the virtue assigned to “science” might also be a motivational force for ideological distortion, the precise opposite of impartial truth-seeking.

"http://thefrt.com/it-is-not-a-game-the-enslavement-society-corporate-greed-private-prisons/","IT IS NOT A GAME: The Enslavement Society, Corporate Greed & Private Prisons [VIDEO]","What more time-honored practice in the long history of state sponsored servitude than the institutionalization of prisoners? Incarceration for offenses against government laws is a cornerstone for power and survivability of any regime. Prisons may have been hellholes over the centuries, but seldom has the internment of convicted lawbreakers been a growth industry for private profit. It almost makes one wonder exactly who are the crooks. While most hard-pressed citizens want a safe and secure society, few ever give even a passing thought to the insatiable corporatist criminalization of thecriminal justice system. Just how many Americans agree with the proposition, if you did the crime, you need to serve the time.

All loyal law and order proponents can take pride in the one area where the imperium of government discipline still ranks first among nations. A Global Research article – The Prison Industry in the United States: Big Business or a New Form of Slavery? – points out some staggering facts.

“There are approximately 2 million inmates in state, federal and private prisons throughout the country. According to California Prison Focus, “no other society in human history has imprisoned so many of its own citizens.” The figures show that the United States has locked up more people than any other country: a half million more than China, which has a population five times greater than the U.S. Statistics reveal that the United States holds 25% of the world’s prison population, but only 5% of the world’s people. From less than 300,000 inmates in 1972, the jail population grew to 2 million by the year 2000. In 1990 it was one million. Ten years ago there were only five private prisons in the country, with a population of 2,000 inmates; now, there are 100, with 62,000 inmates. It is expected that by the coming decade, the number will hit 360,000, according to reports.”

Just imagine the hidden solution to the high unemployment economy is staring in our faces without even a hint of public reaction. The ultimate entrepreneurial partnership allows for corporate security firms to house government dissenters or rebellious non-conformers.

“Private prisons are the biggest business in the prison industry complex. About 18 corporations guard 10,000 prisoners in 27 states. The two largest are Correctional Corporation of America (CCA) and Wackenhut, which together control 75%. Private prisons receive a guaranteed amount of money for each prisoner, independent of what it costs to maintain each one. According to Russell Boraas, a private prison administrator in Virginia, “the secret to low operating costs is having a minimal number of guards for the maximum number of prisoners.” The CCA has an ultra-modern prison in Lawrenceville, Virginia, where five guards on dayshift and two at night watch over 750 prisoners. In these prisons, inmates may get their sentences reduced for “good behavior,” but for any infraction, they get 30 days added – which means more profits for CCA.”

The dramatic increases in prison population are not from violent convicts or rapists and killers. The majority of offense categories are property, drug and especially public-order related. The goal of social rehabilitation is a quaint concept of another era. The pretense of reclamation from a conviction of prosecutorial discretion is a standard that few DA’s or judges ever consider. Sentencing guidelines are based upon retribution and punishment, in order to keep the prisons filled with a growing number of new inmates. The supposition is that if you are charged with a crime, the suspect will plea bargain or the jury will follow the directions of the government and convict.

For 2011, the US Department of Justice reported a 93% conviction rate. Such a record implies a culture of criminalization or a hard road for an innocent suspect to navigate. No wonder, the private company screws are such staunch supporters of the transgression and disorder society.

The video, Private prisons – the most profitable real estate in the US? – provides a distressing analysis of the consequences of incentivizing revenue return motivated companies as the jailer overseers.

From the report Prison Labor and Crime in the U.S. – Industry, Privatization, Inmate Facts and Stats – Prison Industries and Inmate Labor – section:

“Many companies are now directly involved in some form of profiting off of incarceration or the labor of inmates. Since 1980 when there was only one prison industry operating as a privatized entity, there are now thirty eight states and at least five county jails with privatized prison industry productions or factory operations. Together state and federal factories now number over three hundred nationwide with between six hundred thousand and one million inmates working in some form of manufacturing or services. Hundreds of companies using inmate labor for manufacturing, services and other duties are now partnered with these operations. This is done under the federal Prison Industries Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP) under 18 USC 1761(c).

Clearly companies, businesses and corporations have become heavily invested in, and dependent upon incarceration for cheap labor and profit. In 2009 total sales of prisoner made products totaled $2.4 billion. Some research places that figure as high as $5 billion and this is in addition to the “prison industry” figure of $34 billion used previously.”

Another RT video details the Prison labor booms in US as low-cost inmates bring billions. Is society really safer from the dramatic increase in the prison population, or is this method of crowding a growing herd of cheap labor simply a strategy to enrich politically connected companies?

As the rapid implosion of the economy accelerates, the prospect of even greater numbers of government prosecutions will surely increase. How many Jean Valjean’s are there in Les Misérables penal confines baking bread?

Now if you are sympathy challenged and are as hard as the rocks that need to be broken, why is the political class virtually exempt from accountability. Remember the once popular bumper sticker; “I’ll Buckle Up When Ted Bundy Does”. Well, no compassion for a serial killer is certainly understandable and proper.

However, where is the justice when a professional bankster felon like Jon Corzineskates after his crimes in the MF Global theft? The rules for ex Goldman Sacks predators allows for financing publicly traded private jail companies, but are exempt of ever working on the assembly line making license plates. What is next: a hedge fund totally devoted to the management of a privatized infrastructure of FEMA camps.

Michael Snyder writes in The Economic Collapse article, Private Prisons: The More Americans They Put Behind Bars The More Money They Make.

“If you can believe it, three of the largest private prison companies have spentapproximately $45,000,000 combined on lobbying and campaign contributions over the past decade.

Just look at what has happened to the U.S. prison population over the past several decades. Prior to 1980, there were virtually no private prisons in the United States. But since that time, we have seen the overall prison population and the private prison population absolutely explode.

For example, between 1990 and 2009 the number of Americans in private prisons grew by about 1600 percent.

Overall, the U.S. prison population more than quadrupled between 1980 and 2007.”

Hard core criminals that violate civic community standards and endanger public safety should pay a price for their transgressions. Conversely, political prisoners that challenge the crony corruption within the governmental hierarchy do not deserve a sentence in a sweatshop.

With the abandonment of a police ethic that was dedicated to keeping the peace for an apparatus of law enforcement for arbitrary and dishonest statutes, which only serve the privileged elites; our society is sentenced to a death penalty. Slavery was eliminated a century ago, right? Thus far, that message has not filtered down to the penal plantation. An inmate deserves the solitude of solitary confinement.

The most effective private prison is the one that interns the personal guilt of wicked deeds. If public officials would act upon the moral judgments of their conscience, the perversion within the laws that they pass, adjudicate or administer, would exempt or reduce the unequal application of legitimate legislation, now deemed as criminal acts.

Human nature being what it is; evil acts are instinctive within malevolent souls. Accepting a corrosive punitive system, that enriches private companies, is a horrible departure that prison is a valid tool that protects society. The most dangerous and violent forfeit their social freedom by their predatory actions. However, the sheer numbers of confined prisoners does not justify a structure that exploits a captured population for forced labor.

Do we really need to criminalize society as the price to coexist in the era of Guantanamo justice? America once strived to maintain a balance among competing factions. Today there are only Statists that absolve government transgressions as acceptable and the dissenters that are now in the sights for retribution and eventual arrest. The criminalization of citizens for capricious infractions is the sign of a doomed society.

[VIDEO]","A monumental discovery with four years of comprehensive geo-archaeological research has failed to reach mainstream audiences for some reason. The most active pyramid site in the world dating the pyramid complex back 25,000 years has also released scientific evidence supporting the theory that the pyramids were used as an energy source. The recent study reveals energy beams transmitting electromagnetic signals unexplainable by our science in what is now documented as the largest Pyramid complex in the world. Overwhelming evidence, supported by scientific research from all over the archeological community proves that our recorded history is wrong concerning ancient cultures which in turn changes religion, science and academics.

[youtuber youtube=’http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4enlmAceRdA’]

Dr. Osmanagich has investigated pyramids all over the world, however his recent discovery of the Bosnian pyramids in Visoko, are nothing more than remarkable. What may be more remarkable is how he has been attacked in the media, by scientists and researchers for his incredible find.

The very first thing world powers do when their control systems are threatened (and they can’t elimate the idea) is they create a misinformation system to make people believe that powerful new or ancient technologies are a hoax. Prominent archaeologists have attempted smear campaigns on Dr. Osmanagich’s work out of fear of how the impact of his discoveries will make on their own work.

It’s more than time to rewrite our history books, however there are such vast divisions between the old paradigm thinking and the new, that conflicts between the two camps have continued to cause the regression in the understanding of ancient technology rather than its advancement.

Take note of the following facts Dr. Osmanagich details in the above video:

1) These are the first pyramids in Europe

2) They are the biggest and largest on the planet

3) The cardinal sides have the most precise orientation on the planet

4) The concrete found is better than the best available concrete today

5) They are the oldest pyramids on the planet

6) Underneath the pyramids is the most extensive, prehistorical network of tunnels and chambers ever found

7) In these tunnels they have discovered huge cermaric blocks weighing in excess of 18,000 pounds

The discovery of the Bosnian Valley of the Pyramids changes the understanding of European and world history forever. This also goes for the oldest and strongest concrete dated and the largest network of underground tunnels and chambers.

Radiocarbon dating that proves the Bosnian Pyramid Complex dates back at least 25,000 years has been revealed by an international team of scientists led by Dr. Sam Osmanagich. Discovered in 2005, the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun Archaeological Park, which houses the largest pyramid in the world, is now the most active archaeological site on the planet. The team’s findings also reveal an energy beam, 13 feet in radius that transmits an unexplainable electromagnetic signal measuring 28 kilohertz coming from the center of the Pyramid of the Sun. This phenomenon has been independently confirmed by physicist Dr. Slobodan Mizdrak, Ph.D. from Croatia, professor Paolo Debertolis, anthropologist from University of Trieste in Italy, sound engineer Heikki Savolainen from Finland and electrical engineer GoranMarjanovic from Serbia.

The energy beam is theorized by Dr. Osmanagich as the reason the pyramids were built; to provide ancient civilizations a powerful source of clean energy. This is already a widely supported theory set forth by the book “The Giza Power Plant” by Christopher Dunn published in 1998. The Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun is 30% larger than the largest pyramid at Giza and recent excavation has uncovered an extensive pre-historical underground labyrinth system, further evidence supporting the power plant theory.

Is it possible that the fossil fuel based energy system we now rely on could have been prevented if inventor Nicola Tesla’s work on free energy hadn’t been suppressed? Tesla’s (1856-1943) patented free energy methods were rejected due to their inability to be metered and monetized. “We urgently need to change our mistaken point of view that our ancestors were stupid and accept that they had an advanced understanding of the fabric of nature and the universe, just like Nikola Tesla, whose ideas were suppressed as they did not and do not fit in the reigning economic model,” states Phillip Coppens, author and investigative journalist. “The pyramids are proof that our ancestors knew and worked with an energy technology that we are now finally able to measure, but are still short of fully understanding.”Coppens along with Klaus Dona of Austria and dozens of speakers attended the International Conference Bosnia Pyramid in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina which is held annually to release findings to the public.

Osmanagich has had a host of experts in various fields come to see his Bosnian pyramids, and measure anomalies associated with them. They have included the noted British scientist and inventor Harry Oldfield, who used a special camera system to photograph alleged electromagnetic (EM) waves in the vicinity of Visocica Hill.

The pyramid structures that were built in Bosnia and across the globe over 10,000 years ago cannot be duplicated by modern science and machinery in the 21st century and there is no explanation for who could have built them in our recorded history.

“We realize that this site changes our knowledge of history and as such the findings will need to withstand harsh scrutiny. Our inter-disciplinary scientific team carefully utilizes legitimate scientific research methodology, often having tests done from two or more separate laboratories,” explained Dr. Osmanagich, PhD. “Despite some initial skepticism, we now have a world-wide team of hundreds of thought leaders from numerous scientific disciplines including archeologists, geophysicists, chemical engineers, physicists, electrical engineers, and mathematicians gathering scientific evidence to find the answers.”

Geometric features of the pyramids

Based on numerous airborne and space-borne images of the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun, it becomes evident that the geometric features present with three sides that exhibit geometrical shape of a triangle. Even though such elements occur in nature, it is rarely, if ever, a precise shape and rarely replicated on opposite sides of a mound. In this case, two sides are equilateral triangles, with well- defined sides. Satellite imaging of the local area in the central part of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Landsat, Radarsat, Hyperion, Ikonos, courtesy of Dr. Amer Smailbegovic), indicated that there are five hills which show apparent geospatial anomalies where two or more sides are triangular. All of the aforementioned hills exhibit triangular sides and some have elements of stairs and step features on the sides with flat plateaus on the top. In the case of the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun, three out of four sides exhibit evidence of geometric features. Geologic evidence is not indicative of any significant faulting or the processes of the glaciations in the area that would otherwise affect the existence, geometry and texture of these sides.



Perfect orientation — Cardinal sides of the world

The measurements made by the Geodetic Institute of Bosnia and Herzegovina indicate that the sides of the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun (BPS) are exactly aligned with the cardinal sides of the world (North-South, East-West), which is one of the characteristics often noted with the existing pyramids in Egypt, Peru, Guatemala or China. The North side of the BPS is oriented towards stellar North (like the Great Pyramid of Egypt), in parallel with the position of the North Star.



Geological-sedimentary analyses

The results of core drilling, test-well sinking and limited trenching in August and October 2005, with a follow-up in 2006 and 2007, have confirmed prior observations and, revealed that the surface of the pyramids is comprised of layered sandstone and breccia blocks, which have been manually processed and/or cut to fit the required dimensions. The binding agent found between the sandstone blocks suggest the presence of a “clastic breccia,” a multicolored conglomerate comprised out of gravel, sandstone and shale with a connective matrix or cement composed of sandy carbon particles of quartz, feldspar and flakes of mica. The flat sides of the blocks, the contact zone, and the binding agent are clearly visible. Further detailed cleaning of the contact line between the two sandstone blocks revealed that the blocks were manually processed beneath and that the surface was flat and smooth, with binding agent applied afterwards to the surface.

Equilateral triangle of three main pyramids

Three main pyramids in the Bosnian Pyramid Valley form an equilateral triangle. The Kadastral Office from the County of Visoko performed GPS measurements of the hilltops and determined that all angles are symmetric (60 degrees). Their measurements showed that the distances among all three hilltops are the same (approx. 2,2 km) with less than 2% error, verifying the artificial structures.

Geometry, shape, orientation, constructive material — they all prove the perfect planning and execution of the complex.

Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun

The Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun is the world’s largest 220 meters high and completely covered by soil and vegetation. During the 1950s and 1960s, local government organized tree planting activities. Trees managed to grow only on the bottom half of the Pyramid. Thickness of the soil on Western, Northern and Eastern side of the Pyramid varies from the top (20cm) to the bottom (1.5 meter). This is due to the erosion. The Southern side, which seams to be damaged, has a soil layer of 3-6 meters. That is the reason why this side has lost its regularity. Physical material evidence of shaped and well preserved stone monoliths were unearthed during the ongoing geo-archaeological campaign in 2006-2008.

Satellite radar has penetrated the surface of Northern side of the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun of four meters. Straight black lines show underground passageways — pyramidal substructure. Some of them intersect at 90 degrees.

Bosnian Pyramid of the Moon

With its height of 190 meters, Bosnian Pyramid of the Moon is the world’s second largest: next to the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun (220 meters) and higher than Khufu’s Great Pyramid of Egypt (148 meters). It is a three-sided pyramid with the plateau coming from the East, leading to the top of the structure. Other sides (North, West, South) match the cardinal points. For the construction of this pyramid, sandstone plates and tiles were used together with the clay as a constructive material.

Archaeological field work on the Bosnian Pyramid of the Moon shows that under layers of soil and wood. There exists a huge stone/clay structure, three-sided “terraced” pyramid with paved causeway coming from East.



A Network of Underground Tunnels

Examples of the main pyramidal complexes worldwide show that under the pyramids, underground passageways and chambers had been built. It’s the case of pyramids in Giza (tunnels connect the pyramids, sphinx, Nile), Teotihuacan (underground enlarged 4-chamber cave with passageways), Step pyramid in Saqqara (underground “labyrinth”), China (underground tunnels built from sandstone, bricks and clay), Tenerife (cave-tunnels in Guimar). Numerous field findings suggest that an extensive tunnel network exists in the Bosnian Valley of the Pyramids. It is hypothesized (Principal investigator Semir Sam Osmanagich) that the tunnel system connects all of the colossal objects, water wells and other structures of importance. The current excavations in progress have already presented with findings of several shaped monoliths in the tunnels. Hundreds of meters of tunnels have been secured by wooden support. The tunnels were definitively not the mining shafts as no tools, coal, silver, gold or any other worthy material werefound and they appear much older than Middle Age or Roman times.

Physicist Dr. Anna Pazdur of Poland’s Silesian University announced the news at the Press Conference in Sarajevo in August of 2008- Great number of archaeological artifacts has been found during the four years of excavations. Further cleaning in the underground tunnels confirmed huge artificial network from the pre-historical times. Samples of core drilling from the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun and Vratnica tumulus have shown properties of the best quality concrete (analysis by Institute for Materials of the University of Zenica, Bosnia and Institute for Civil Engineering of the University of Sarajevo, Bosnia) First International Scientific Conference about the Bosnian Valley of the Pyramids was held in Sarajevo on August 25-30, 2008. More than 50 experts from Egypt (20 leading archaeologists, geologists and Egyptologists,), China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Poland, Croatia, UK, Austria, Bosnia and Montenegro concluded/recommended:

(1) that the Bosnian Valley of the Pyramids is “very important archaeological locations which require further multidisciplinary research,”

(2) that “Second Scientific Conference is to be held in two years that should getter pyramid specialists from all over the world,”

(3) “Center for Pyramid Studies is to be established in Sarajevo” and recommended

(4) that “archaeological course at the graduate level is to be established in Bosnian universities as a support for the BosnianValley of the Pyramids project.”- Professor of classical archaeology from the University of Alexandria Dr. Mona Haggagcalled this discovery “writing new pages in European and World history.”

"http://thefrt.com/colorado-is-bracing-itself-for-heavy-pot-tourism/","Colorado Is Bracing Itself For Heavy Pot Tourism","It’s going to be very interesting to see how this one plays out. Personally, I wish them the best of success.

Marijuana tourism is on the way to Colorado, under a recommendation made Tuesday by a state task force to regulate the drug made legal by voters last year.

But Colorado should erect signs in airports and borders telling visitors they can’t take pot home, the task force recommended.

Colorado’s marijuana task force was assembled to suggest regulations for pot after voters chose to flout federal drug law and allow its use without a doctor’s recommendation. Made up of lawmakers, law enforcement authorities and marijuana activists, the task force agreed Tuesday that the constitutional amendment on marijuana simply says that adults over 21 can use the drug, not just Colorado residents. If lawmakers agree with the recommendation, tourists would be free to buy and smoke marijuana.

“Imposing a residency requirement would almost certainly create a black market for recreational marijuana in the state,” said Rep. Dan Pabon, a Denver Democrat who sits on the task force.

Tourists could see purchasing caps though, possibly as low as an eighth of an ounce per transaction.","2013-02-24 00:00:00","0","15.0","11.0","3.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","34.0","28.0","0.0","89.0","5.0","1.0","1","193","96.07","56.18","3.83","92.25","19.30","25.91","81.35","40.41","4.66","1.55","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.04","3.11","9.33","14.51","5.18","3.11","5.18","1.55","12.44","2.59","2.07","1.04","1.55","0.00","5.18","4.66","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.52","6.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.51","0.00","6.74","3.11","2.07","0.52","3.11","4.66","3.63","1.04","0.00","2.59","0.00","2.07","0.00","0.52","11.40","0.00","2.07","9.84","1.55","0.00","2.59","6.74","1.04","9.84","0.52","6.74","2.59","5.70","4.15","1.55","2.59","0.00","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.00","13.47","5.18","5.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.04","2.07","0.00","0.00","964","8.03","21.88888888888889","300","193","10","51.89","13.2","10.8","12.76","12.6","42","8.333333333333334","18.424663212435235","131","20.0","1","0.38","0","5","2","19","0","24","10","0","1","6","41","12","0","18","0","0","4","1","10","0","0","0","7","0","14","7","4","2","3","5","0","1","0","1"

In an era where albums sales have been steadily declining the St. Louis rapper doesn’t think it’s wise for a new artist that is doing well independently to sign a deal with a major record label.

In a new conversation with VladTV, Nelly used Interscope artist Chief Keef as an example.

“Let’s say we take Chief Keef for example. You take someone such as Chief Keef, young kid on fire. To me I said the worst thing Chief Keef ever did was get a record deal,” Nelly said. “That’s just my opinion.”

Vlad then tells Nelly that Keef reportedly got a $6 million deal to sign.

“Well, if he got $6 million then it wasn’t the worst thing. I’m saying as far as that $6 million going in his pocket and not being $6 million for everything in his budget and all that,” Nelly continued. “My point being is that you look at someone that’s got a great social media following. Dude is well over 3-4 million views on his YouTube [page] independently. And this was all under a year. You look at that and then you say to yourself in an era right now where it’s so hard to sell records. Then I look at Chief Keef’s following. It’s more of a mixtape song type of following. I would have said ‘cool on the record deal.’ I’m just going to put out singles. I’m gonna strike my own deal with iTunes. Why? Because if I put out an album I might as well make it a mixtape because they’re not really buying albums anyway. I can just keep putting singles out and touring. As long as my singles are selling and I’m getting radio airplay, I’m touring [and] making money. Now I done gave up this 360 deal. I done gave up part of my publishing, part of my merchandise, part of my touring [revenue] for this cut of money. Which I could have owned 100% of my merchandise. Owned 100% of my publishing and owned 100% of that. I may not have gotten all of the money that I got upfront, but I promise you in the next year or two I would have made that money and still owned everything I got.”

Does Nelly have a valid point? Are new artists better off staying independent instead of taking a 360 with a major label?

The Real Story Behind His Resignation & The Call For Him To Leave Rome?!","International Tribunal calls on Napolitano to “not collude in criminality”, and announces global campaign to occupy Vatican property and launch human rights inquiry in Italy

Rome :

Pope Benedict, Joseph Ratzinger, has scheduled a meeting with Italian President Giorgio Napolitano for Saturday, February 23 to discuss securing protection and immunity from prosecution from the Italian government, according to Italian media sources.

Ratzinger’s meeting follows upon the apparent receipt by the Vatican of a diplomatic note from an undisclosed European government on February 4, stating its intention to issue an arrest warrant for Ratzinger, who resigned from his pontificate less than a week later.

In response to the February 23 meeting, the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State (ITCCS), through its field Secretary, Rev. Kevin Annett, has written to President Napolitano, asking him to refrain from assisting Ratzinger in evading justice.

The ITCCS letter states, in part,

“I need not remind you, Mr. President, that under international law and treaties that have been ratified by Italy, you and your government are forbidden from granting such protection to those like Joseph Ratzinger who have aided and abetted criminal actions, such as ordering Bishops and Cardinals in America and elsewhere to protect known child rapists among their clergy.

“Your obligation to the Vatican through the Lateran Treaty does not negate or nullify the requirements of these higher moral and international laws; nor does it require that you give any protection or immunity to a single individual like Joseph Ratzinger, especially after he has left his papal office.”

A copy of the complete text of the ITCCS letter follows.

In response to the documented crimes of child torture, trafficking and genocide linked to Pope Benedict and Vatican officials, the ITCCS will be sponsoring a series of ongoing protests and occupations of Roman Catholic churches and offices through its affiliates around the world beginning in Easter week, March 24-31, 2013, and continuing indefinitely.

These actions will accompany the legal efforts to bring Joseph Ratzinger and other Vatican officials to trial for their proven complicity in crimes against humanity and criminal conspiracy.

The CIA had developed a poison that caused the victim to have an immediate heart attack. This poison could be frozen into the shape of a dart and then fired at high speed from a pistol. The gun was capable of shooting the icy projectile with enough speed that the dart would go right through the clothes of the target and leave just a tiny red mark. Once in the body the poison would melt and be absorbed into the blood and cause a heart attack! The poison was developed to be undetectable by modern autopsy procedures.

Can you give a person cancer?

In 1931, Cornelius Rhoads, a pathologist from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, purposely infects human test subjects in Puerto Rico with cancer cells; 13 of them died. Though a Puerto Rican doctor later discovers that Rhoads purposely covered up some of the details of his experiment and Rhoads himself gives a written testimony stating he believes that all Puerto Ricans should be killed, he later goes on to establish the U.S. Army Biological Warfare facilities in Fort Detrick Maryland (origin of the HIV/AIDS virus, the Avian Flu virus and the Swine Flu / A-H1N1 virus), Utah and Panama, and is named to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, where he begins a series of radiation exposure experiments on American soldiers and civilian hospital patients.

The answer to the question – Can you give a person cancer – is yes. After nearly 80 years of research and development there is now a way to simulate a real heart attack and to give a healthy person cancer. Both have been used as a means of assassination. Only a very skilled pathologist, who knew exactly what to look for at an autopsy, could distinguish an assassination induced heart attack or cancer from the real thing.

Is death by heart attack, burst aneurysm, of cerebral hemorrhage a “natural cause”? Not if government agencies have found a way to influence your heart rate, blood pressure, or vascular dilatation. Neurological research has found that the brain has specific frequencies for each voluntary movement called preparatory sets. By firing at your chest with a microwave beam containing the ELF signals given off by the heart, this organ can be put into a chaotic state, the so-called heart attack. In this way, high profile leaders of political parties who are prone to heart attacks can be killed off before they cause any trouble. Jack Ruby died of cancer a few weeks after his conviction for murder had been overruled in appeals court and he was ordered to stand trial outside of Dallas – thus allowing him to speak freely if he so desired. There was little hesitancy in Jack Ruby killing Lee Harvey Oswald in order to prevent him from talking, so there is no reason to suspect that any more consideration would have been shown Jack Ruby if he had posed a threat to people in the US government who had conspired to murder the president of the United States – John F Kennedy.

Matt Simmons, an oil industry expert, was assassinated for turning whistle blower over the Obama administration coverup of the BP Gulf Oil Spill. Investment banker Matt Simmons, who died suddenly, was an energy industry insider and presidential adviser whose profile soared when he wrote that Saudi Arabia is running out of oil and world production is peaking. Simmons, 67, died at his vacation home in Maine. An autopsy by the state medical examiner’s office concluded Monday that he died from accidental drowning “with heart disease as a contributing factor.”

His 2005 best-selling book, Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy, brought him a wider audience. The book argued that Saudi Arabia vastly overstated the size of its oil reserves and that the world was on the verge of a severe oil shortage as the largest oil fields become depleted. This revelation is backed up by Iran. Iran knows the Middle East oil supply is quickly drying up and for that reason it is now focusing on building nuclear reactors. Once the oil runs out Iran will be the only country in the Middle East that will be energy self-sufficient. All of the other Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia will become Third World impoverished states.

Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was also assassinated. He was found dead in the detention center at The Hague tribunal. Mr Milosevic faced charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged central role in the wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo during the 1990s. He also faced genocide charges over the 1992-95 Bosnia war, in which 100,000 people died.

Milosevic wrote a letter one day before his death claiming he was being poisoned to death in jail. An autopsy verified his claim as it showed that Milosevic’s body contained a drug that rendered his usual medication for high blood pressure and his heart condition ineffective, causing the heart attack that led to his death.

Former MI6 agent Richard Tomlinson told reporters that he saw documents in 1992 that discussed assassinating Milosevic by means of a staged car accident, where the driver would be blinded by a flash of light and remote controlled brake failure enacted to cause the crash. This exact same technique was utilized for real in the murder of Princess Diana.

If Milosevic was murdered, who would ultimately be responsible? NATO.

Why NATO?

Because, though the ICTY (or ‘Hague Tribunal’) presents itself to the world as a UN body, NATO officials have themselves made clear, in public, that it really belongs to NATO. NATO appointed the prosecutors, and the judges who ruled out investigating any war crimes accusations against NATO. It follows that Slobodan Milosevic, who was a prisoner of the Hague Tribunal’s Scheveningen prison when he died, was a prisoner of NATO. NATO had both motive and opportunity to kill him.

In March 2002, Milosevic presented the NATO controlled Hague tribunal with FBI documents proving that both the United States government and NATO provided financial and military support for Al-Qaeda to aid the Kosovo Liberation Army in its war against Serbia. This didn’t go down too well at the Pentagon and the White House, who at the time were trying to sell a war on terror and gearing up to justify invading Iraq.

During Milosevic’s trial for war crimes NATO alleged that the Serbs had committed a massacre of Albanian civilians in the Kosovo town of Racak. Evidence presented in the court showed that NATO’s claim was a hoax. This is especially embarrassing because the allegation of a massacre at Racak was the excuse that NATO used to begin bombing the Serbs on 24 March 1999 (the carpet bombing were done by the United States Air Force -authorized by then president Bill and Hillary Clinton). Then NATO claimed that the Serbs had supposedly been murdering 100,000 Albanian civilians. However, NATO’s own forensics reported that they could not find even one body of an Albanian civilian murdered by Milosevic’s forces. The failure to find any bodies eventually led to NATO’s absurd claim that the Serbs had supposedly covered up the genocide by moving the many thousands of bodies in freezer trucks deep into Serbia (while Bill Clinton was carpet bombing the place) without leaving a single trace of evidence. But the Hague tribunal showed these accusations to be entirely fraudulent as well.

Milosevic made several speeches in which he discussed how a group of shadowy internationalists had caused the chaos in the Balkans because it was the next step on the road to a “new world order.”

“Dave was like, ‘Oh that’s just one of my friends. I let him stay here for a couple of days’. I was like, ‘A couple of days? And he got a key…a flaming Queen?’

Wait…there’s more!!!

Our party girl says while she was at the crib, she overheard our mystery DJ arguing with Puffy over the phone. According to our source, the beef stemmed from Puffy owing our blind item $30K for a show he did.

Here’s that drop:

“Instead of sending the money Puffy sent Dave flowers, apologizing for the delay. Dave asked me what I thought about the flowers. I said, ‘he probably knows that a gay guy has keys to yo’ house!’

Now, we’re curious what kind of Track this blind item was really a Master of. Can you guess who FolksRtalking talking about?

UltraViolet Protest Planned Demanding He Be Dropped!","Veteran emcee Talib Kweli has joined the growing list of people taking Rick Ross to task over his lyrics in the song “U.O.E.N.O.”

Ross raps about slipping molly into his date’s drink, then taking her home for sex without her consent.

“Put molly all in her champagne / She ain’t even know it / I took her home and I enjoyed that / She ain’t even know it,” Ross raps in the song.

The rapper later offered up an apology that many didn’t believe was sincere.

“Woman is the most precious gift known to man. And there was a misunderstanding with a lyric…a misinterpretation where the term rape was used. I would never use the term rape, you know, in my lyrics. And as far as my camp, hip hop don’t condone that, the streets don’t condone that, nobody condones that,” said Ross.

In an interview with Huffpost Live, Kweli criticized the MMG CEO for his lyrics in the song. He added that he wasn’t buying Ross’ apology.

“I don’t care if Rick Ross is 40 years old. He’s a misguided 40-year-old person,” Talib said. “Rick Ross condoned rape in that song and he should apologize. His apology that he offered was unacceptable.”

As we previously reported, the anti-sexism group UltraViolet, started a petition urging Reebok to drop Ross

The group has taken it’s demands one step further. They are now going to bring their petition with 71,763 signatures to Reebok’s flagship store in New York City, 420 5th Ave, in Manhattan on Thursday (April 4th) to protest in person according to a press release.

Following on the heels of a week of controversy over Reebok’s silence on their spokesman Rick Ross’ new song in which he brags about drugging and raping a woman, UltraViolet members are planning to deliver 71,763+ petitions to the company’s flagship NYC store demanding the company fire him. The Reebok spokesman’s response that in not using the word “rape” he is off the hook has only escalated complaints that he does not fit Reebok’s image. “In remaining silent, Reebok is using it’s brand to promote rape,” said Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of UltraViolet. “Reebok and Rick Ross have crossed a line— not only does Ross brag about drugging and raping a woman, he is pushing the idea that if you don’t use the word ‘rape’ it doesn’t count. We are fed up and disgusted with Reebok, and Thursday we will bring this fight to their front steps.”

The protest will also feature dozens of women in running bibs with the number “71,763” and signs reading “Hey Reebok— Want my business? Stop promoting rape. Drop Rick Ross.”

The protest is scheduled to start at 2 p.m. eastern time.

I heard that one of the most seriously talented dudes from MMG may have issues on the Federal level! The word is Stalley’s home in Dumbo, BK was raided by the FBI yesterday morning. Apparently, people in the building know that Stalley lives there. Nobody knows what the deal is with this rumored raiding. But, sources say “FOR SURE” that it was a federal raid.

Hopefully, the boy Stalley is OK!

Arrest Warrant Isued For Chief Keef In Florida!","After getting arrested for the third time since May on Monday, Chief Keef has another warrant out for his arrest. This one is out of Miami Beach, Florida.

The rapper was celebrating his 17th birthday last August when the red Ferrari he was riding in was pulled over after it was reported to be stolen.

Police searched Keef, real name Keith Cozart, who admitted to having weed on him.

“I have weed in my right front pocket,” said Keef, according to a police report. “I want to be honest with you, officer.“

Sosa was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He didn’t face any charges for riding in the stolen car because it turns out there was a mix up between the rental company and previous owner of the vehicle, according to AllHipHop.

He was ordered to appear in court on January 23 for the weed charge. The problem is, he was already locked up in Chicago on that date for violating his probation from a previous gun charge.

A Florida judge issued a warrant for his arrest, but unless Keef travels to Miami Beach again he’s unlikely to be arrested.

“We would not travel to Chicago for this type of warrant,’’ Miami-Dade Police Detective Javier Baez told the Chicago Tribune.

Keef has been racking up a lot of time in police stations as of late.

On May 20th he was arrested in Dekalb County, Georgia for disorderly conduct after a security guard smelled weed coming from his hotel room. He was picked up again on May 27 for speeding in Northfield, Illinois.



On Monday, June 17 Keef appeared in a Chicago courtroom and pleaded guilty to the speeding charge. He was fined him $531, banned him from driving for 18 months, put him on probation for 18 months and ordered to perform 60 hours of community service and undergo random drug testing. He also must complete eight hours of traffic school.

As he left the courthouse he was arrested again on a trespassing charge.

This NBA legend is reported to have a freaky fetish for group sex with hookers. That’s according to a Windy City prostitute, who says she and two other hookers began their evening with our mystery man, dining at Chi-Town’s Gibson Steakhouse, back in 2003. This before the working girl says the entourage accompanied the basketball great back to his Omni Hotel suite, for his steamy sex session dessert.

Our insider says our blind item uses the Omni Hotel as both his playground and business office. During his playtime, our insider reveals this former Bull likes to stand-up and hold girls upside to perform cunnilingus on them.

Here’s what our insider had to say about today’s mystery man:

“It was me, an Asian girl and a black girl and he fucked us all. He likes group sex and he’s a wild man in bed. It was a crazy foursome. The Asian chic was cool but the black chic was ghetto. You would think he’s happy with all the money and fame that he has — But he’s really a depressed man who likes to sit and drink Corona’s by himself.”

"http://thefrt.com/are-our-schools-prisons-video/","Are Our Schools Prisons?? [VIDEO]","

Though potentially alarmist, this documentary points to a process that really started with the advent of the american education system as a part of the rise of industry. Our modern school system, though it has been vastly successful compared to many earlier systems as bad as it is, is indeed based on the whistle-blowing, mechanized and behaviorist perspective of humanity that was popular in the 1920s-50s.

Instead of changing with the times in terms of making kids into machines, and to produce “good workers,” we might consider trying to help create human beings. Because of all the school shootings, in many ways now we are facing a PKD style “thought police,” No Tolerance rule toward what someone might do. How does this lack of trust effect the people within the system?

[youtuber youtube=’http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-tAQ56-gaA’]

I certainly wouldn’t have made it through this system. Not at all. I barely slipped through in the 90s, until I became an undergrad at Bard and I found an environment that was better suited to my disposition overall (despite issues there as well.)

I imagine that there are more “freaks” like me. They are the ones with capacity for both a type of personal greatness and atrocity. Are those the people you really want to alienate? Bullying is a serious problem in schools.

It was when I was in ‘the system,’ and it certainly is today. But there are more than one approach. And school shootings as I mentioned have also terrified this nation, but our reaction to that fear has been as wrong-minded as the fear reaction that resulted from 9-11. We got so angry and afraid as a nation that we attacked a country that had nothing to do with the attack. We are producing terrorists in the middle east just as we are creating criminals and possibly even terrorists at home. As Aaron Sorkin pointed out in the West Wing episode “the War at Home,” this also has resonance with the war on drugs. “The war is at home. It’s in our classrooms.”

Are our children the enemy?

It comes down to a matter of trust. We have to take a hard look at what we are becoming as individuals and as a nation, keeping in mind that it is the fascist within that produces the fascist without.

The drive behind fanaticism, and fascism — which is an affliction not unlike fanaticism — is psychological, not material. William Reich explored this in The Mass Psychology of Fascism.

Consider this, taken from a chapter appropriately named Ideology as a Material Force,

“Those who followed … the revolutionary Left’s application of Marxism between 1917 and 1933 had to notice that it was restricted to the sphere of objective economic processes and government policies, but that it neither kept a close eye on nor comprehended the development and contradictions of the so-called ‘subjective factor’ of history, i.e., the ideology of the masses. [26]

The extremists driving ideological conflicts are borrowing from mere echoes of myths originating thousands of years ago, catalyzing the existential fear, hate, or desire latent in a culture, and more pointedly, within the individuals that comprise that culture. Again borrowing from Reich’s study on fascism, or Deleuze and Guittari’s examination in Anti-Oedipus, the principles of personal psychology also control mass-psychology. [27] The fascist of the state is the fascist within. This alchemy produces poisonous splinter factions, fundamentalist groups that cause many of the pathological habits our cultures otherwise exhibit, in concentrated form. The atrocities perpetrated by the State far exceed those any one individual could account for, but the will to those ends must be spread through a sufficient public body for any of them to occur.

We have designed the books and articles on this site to provide a form of much needed education in terms of reading symbols in our daily lives as well as literature, to look at metaphor as something more than a literary device, after we’ve learned how to understand it as literary device. These seem like incredibly rudimentary things, but they are lacking. I’m happy we’ve been able to be a part of the curriculum of 5 or 6 200-level college courses so far (SUNY Binghamton), and hope to see more of that in the future.

MSRP for the Mulsanne begins around $280,000, while this particular car stickers around $350,000 as it sits. There’s a plethora of optional and bespoke options to make the sky the limit.

During this presentation, we will take a 1st person look at what the vehicle is all about beginning with the start up, performance data, fuel economy, the occasional track data, and build quality. Also, I will teach you how to use most of the interior and exterior features in a detailed fashion, that before, you could only get from going to a dealership yourself! Throughout the video, I will highlight key styling and unique differences about the vehicle, any available options, and of course it would not be an enthusiast car video without the good ole engine portion with rev and exhaust note with interior and exterior perspectives. A thorough tour/review of this car designed to give others a greater overall appreciation of the vehicle.

In U.S. states which have newly legalized pot, experts on its growth and consumption are needed for public service, NBC News reports:

The job description requests an unlikely mix of skills: five years of regulatory experience, with a law degree preferred, and extensive knowledge of all things marijuana. But that didn’t stop dozens of people from turning out to find out about becoming Washington state’s official marijuana consultant.

As officials figure out how to regulate the state’s newly legal marijuana, they’re hiring an adviser to fill in the gaps: how cannabis is best grown, dried, tested, labeled, packaged, regulated and cooked into brownies.

The board has advertised for consulting services in four categories. The first is “product and industry knowledge” and requires “at least three years of consulting experience relating to the knowledge of the cannabis industry, including product growth, harvesting, packaging, product infusion and product safety.”","2013-02-18 00:00:00","0","13.0","12.0","3.0","1.0","5.0","0.0","33.0","28.0","0.0","89.0","5.0","1.0","1","157","95.87","60.07","37.62","49.48","26.17","34.39","83.44","40.13","3.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.18","7.01","16.56","6.37","2.55","7.01","0.64","10.19","1.91","1.91","1.91","3.18","1.27","1.27","1.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.65","7.01","3.82","1.91","1.27","0.64","1.91","1.91","0.00","0.00","0.64","1.91","0.00","0.64","0.00","1.27","8.28","0.00","1.91","5.73","0.64","1.27","2.55","5.73","0.00","12.10","1.91","6.37","3.82","15.92","2.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.66","5.10","9.55","1.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.55","2.55","0.00","0.00","842","10.37","27.0","263","157","6","36.42","16.5","14.7","15.61","18.1","54","12.5","26.237961783439488","118","24.33","3","0.4","0","7","3","13","0","20","10","0","1","0","38","5","0","13","0","0","1","1","3","0","1","3","4","0","3","3","10","8","5","7","1","0","0","2"

Exclusive to AdoboChronicles.com

District of Columbia – In a decision considered the most controversial in its entire history, the Supreme Court of the United States today struck down the Defense of Marriage Act in its entirety, handing the LGBTQQI community its greatest victory since Stonewall.

The Supremes voted 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts casting the deciding vote. Justices who favored striking down DOMA aside from Roberts were Thomas, Scalia, Alito and Breyer. In the majority decision, penned by Roberts, the high court said of DOMA, “What was Congress thinking? There was no compelling reason to defend marriage. No one was attacking marriage. The LGBTQQI community was, as a matter of fact, all for it. The community members simply wanted to be included.”

In a dissenting opinion, penned by Ginsburg, the minority said, “This is a day of infamy. It marks the end of what is left of the liberal agenda. What’s next for us as justices? It will be a boring rest of the term for us.” Outside the court chambers, Ginsburg was quoted as saying, “It’s time for me to retire.”

On the other landmark case, Prop 8, the justices were unanimous in declaring that those who brought the case before the court had “no standing.” In an unprecedented move, the court sent back the Prop 8 case to California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom. The court said that since Newsom started this whole thing on gay marriage in California when he authorized to issue marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples in 2004, he should just make an executive decision to strike down Prop 8.

The decision comes just a few days before the biggest Pride celebration in the country. The San Francisco Pride Committee quickly convened a board meeting during which it decided to cancel Sunday’s Pride Parade and Festival. “We no longer see the need to stage a separate Pride celebration,” the committee said. “We are now equal with everyone else.”

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/07/06/snowden-considers-options-to-get-to-venezuela/","SNOWDEN CONSIDERS OPTIONS TO GET TO VENEZUELA","Moscow, Russia – Now that President Nocolás Maduro of Venezuela has offered asylum to fugitive intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, there is a lot of speculation on how the American accused of espionage will get to the South American country. Snowden remains holed up at the Moscow airport.

Pundits have ruled out swimming as a means for Snowden to get to Caracas because of the shark-infested waters between Russia and Venezuela.

Snowden is reportedly considering two options. One is to pack himself on a UPS package. Julian Assange of WikiLeaks has offered to pay for shipping and customs charges. The other option is to request President Maduro to send his presidential plane to fetch him in Moscow.

Snowden’s advisers believe that the second option is more viable considering the controversy and diplomatic issue generated by the recent incident in which the plane of Bolivia’s president was denied rights to fly across four European nations on suspicion that Snowden might be on board. The advisers say that the U.S. and the European countries will not risk creating another diplomatic controversy by interfering with the Venezuelan president’s flight.

An international drug cartel has offered to pay for the fuel should Maduro decide to send his presidential plane to fetch Snowden from Moscow.

Meanwhile, eyewitnesses have said that Snowden has been spending his wait time listening to his Rosetta Stone DVD to brush up on his Spanish.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/07/01/republican-controlled-house-of-representatives-makes-a-sweeping-change-to-the-statue-of-liberty/","REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MAKES A SWEEPING CHANGE TO THE STATUE OF LIBERTY","Washington, D.C. – In what was considered worse than a filibuster, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, whose Tea Party-identified members earlier maneuvered to convene a special last- minute session last night that lasted till 12:01 a.m., passed sweeping legislation that critics say is tantamount to “defacing the statue of Liberty and all that it stands for.”

The hastily-convened session was the House Republicans’ response to last week’s bi-partisan passage of Senate Bill 744 on Comprehensive Immigration Reform that establishes a path to citizenship for this country’s estimated 11 Million undocumented immigrants while taking steps to secure the U.S. border.

“The Senate Bill is DOA (dead on arrival) at the House of Representatives,” Speaker John Boehner said after the Senate passed the bill 68 to 32.

The House bill contained an order for the National Park Service to replace the historic plaque beneath the 127 year-old statue of Liberty on Ellis Island. The plaque, as millions of visitors to the iconic monument are very familiar with, contains a poem written by poet Emma Lazarus. The opening of the poem, “The New Colossus,” refers to the Collosus of Rhodes, an ancient statue of a Greek titan. But Lazarus then refers to the statue which “shall” stand as a “mighty woman with a torch” and the “Mother of Exiles.”

Later in the sonnet are the lines which eventually became iconic:

“Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”

The legislative order gives the National Park Service 7 business days from the passing of the House Bill to replace the plaque with new lines, as follows:

“Give me your doctors, your nurses, your artists, Your scientists, your computer geeks,

Send these, who have the money to invest, Those with Ph.D.’s and Masters degrees, the best and brightest of your European shores,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door, but only for those I mention above!”

An amendment to the “new poem,” and later adopted as part of the approved bill, was authored by Minnesota’s Michelle Bachmann. The addition reads:

“Let it be known that I have no tolerance for sexual deviants nor any interest in reuniting families, especially if they come from the continents of color.”

Asked at a press briefing following the bill’s passage why the legislators didn’t bother to amend the first part of Lazarus’ poem, Bachmann said, “there was an overwhelming agreement that the first part of the original poem, accurately represents Congress’ ancient thinking, so we let it stand.”

As to the question on how the bill will help secure the U.S. borders, Bachmann said that there is a provision in the bill that seeks to build fish pens around Ellis Island and the rest of the New York harbor.

A spokesperson for the Russian government told reporters that the asylum cancellation came after Putin learned that Snowden is gay and that previous revelations about his dancer-girlfriend Lindsay Mills were a mere cover-up for his homosexuality. Russia recently issued draconian laws to criminalize homosexuality and has stepped up a state-sanctioned campaign to persecute lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens and visitors.

Ironically, the discovery about Snowden’s sexual orientation came about after the U.S. National Security Agency leaked 5 years worth of email exchanges between Snowden and his long-time boyfriend. The documents, obtained by the Russian government this week, showed that Mills is actually a lesbian cousin of Snowden. The NSA leaked documents did not identify Snowden’s boyfriend by name.

It was not clear whether Snowden is in custody or is back at the Moscow airport lounge which was the fugitive’s living quarters for many weeks prior to the asylum order.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/07/10/dea-takes-over-facebook-2/","DEA TAKES OVER FACEBOOK","Washington. D.C. — It was just a matter of time. President Obama has signed an Executive Order placing the popular social networking site Facebook under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice’s Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). DEA is charged with investigating and prosecuting drug and addiction cases.

The Executive Order came on the heels of a nationwide survey among Americans aged 7 to 77 showing that millions are now seriously addicted to Facebook.

DEA has opened a hotline – 1 800 IADDICT – to receive confidential tips to help the agency identify and file charges against Facebook addicts. DEA has also sought the assistance of the National Security Adminustration (NSA) which has long been known to be monitoring Facebook and other Internet accounts of Americans.

Under the Executive Order, Facebook addiction is defined as “logging in to a Facebook account for more than 15 minutes during any of these times: 6am to 9am, 11am to 2pm and 5pm to Midnight.” Those charged and convicted will face a maximum prison term of 30 days or until completion of a two-week Facebook Anonymous program, whichever comes first.

Everywhere throughout the country, this phrase will be repeated over and over as DEA pursues its mandate to curb the social menace: “Hi, my name is ——, and I am a Facebook addict.”

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/07/22/obama-vows-to-reduce-pork-barrel-spending/","OBAMA VOWS TO REDUCE PORK BARREL SPENDING","Washington, D.C. – Facing criticism for the country’s turtle-paced recovery from the recession and continued budget woes that put him in a never-ending fierce battle with Republican legislators, President Barack Obama today vowed to use all available powers bestowed upon the presidency to significantly reduce pork barrel spending. U.S. legislators have consistently used pet projects in their constituent areas as a negotiating tool in federal budget battles. The most memorable pork barrel projects were Alaska’s “Bridge to Nowhere,” and Boston’s Big Dig (Central Artery/Tunnel Project).

Asked by members of the White House Press Corps about specifics of his plan, President Obama said he will propose to Congress a new legislation that would limit the U.S. government’s importation of Ibérico pork. The Ibérico pig is an indigenous species that is only found in the Iberian peninsula. The superb quality of the meat from the Ibérico pig is brought about by the climate, its freedom to roam outdoors and its diet. It is often fed on acorns which gives the meat its wonderful nutty flavor. The price of Ibérico pork commands a very high price in the world market, costing as much as $100 per pound, or approximately $20,000 per barrel. The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not return calls from The Adobo Chronicles seeking information on how many barrels of the pork the country imports each year from Spain.

Apparently, only Ibérico pork is served in the basement cafeterias of the Senate and House of Representatives Buildings on Capitol Hill, as well as during state banquets hosted by the White House. President Obama urged Congress to swiftly pass his proposed legislation cutting down on pork barrel importation. “I am confident we can pass this legislation in a bi-partisan manner,” the President added.

Even former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin wanted to escape the freezing temperatures of her native Alaska and is spending the next couple weeks in the sunny, white sandy beaches of Waikiki. Her visit is purely a personal vacation, and she has refused to grant interviews with the local media.

However, one of the reporters of The Adobo Chronicles caught up with the ex-governor at Queen’s Surf Beach while she was laying on a straw mat she bought from a nearby ABC Store. Our reporter asked Ms. Palin if there was any truth to the rumor that she flew to and landed in South Korea last week thinking that she was going to attend the Nelson Mandela memorial in Johannesburg, South Africa.

“That’s a lot of MAHALO,” she exclaimed, to the puzzlement of our reporter.

It turned out that Palin went into a McDonald’s restaurant on Kalakaua Avenue just before she went to the beach. She ordered a cheeseburger, ate it inside the restaurant and deposited the wrapper and some leftover into the trash bin marked “Mahalo” (see photo). She assumed that “mahalo” was Hawaiian for trash. So what she actually wanted to say to our reporter was that the rumor about her landing in South Korea was nothing but “trash.”

To Palin’s credit, she actually knows the meaning of “Aloha” and can pronounce “Waikiki” without any problems. Someone just needs to let her know that “mahalo” means “thank you.”

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/07/05/human-rights-campaign-files-class-action-suit/","HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN FILES CLASS-ACTION SUIT","Washington, D.C. -Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the dominant LGBT organization, has filed a multi-million law suit against the eleven million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The class-action suit is the first ever filed against millions of defendants. In most cases, it is the other way around — millions suing a single individual or entity.

According to papers filed in the District of Columbia, HRC is suing for copyright infringement involving its “equal sign” logo. Many will recall that the HRC logo, and variations of it, went viral as Facebook users changed their profile photos to the logo during the weeks prior to the Supreme Court handing down its decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and Prop 8.

When the U.S. Senate began deliberating on the proposed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill – which ultimately passed with a 68-32 vote — millions of undocumented immigrants changed their Facebook profile photos to a graphic that had the number 11 on it. HRC claims that the immigrants simply took the HRC logo and turned it clockwise at 90 degrees.

In response to an email question from The Adobo Chronicles, a spokesperson who refused to reveal his/her sexual orientation, the HRC rep said it doesn’t matter that an estimated 267,000 LGBTs currently in the U.S. are undocumented. “The integity of the HRC logo is what’s at stake here,” the spokesperson said.

Calls to the 11 million undocumented immigrants for comment on the law suit have not been returned.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/07/02/edward-snowden-in-manila/","EDWARD SNOWDEN IN MANILA?","Manila, Philippines – Edward Snowden, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor who admitted revealing secret surveillance programs to media outlets, and who has been charged with espionage, has reportedly been sighted in Manila, roaming the traffic-ridden streets of the Philippine Metropolis. Manila, as many will recall, has been described as the “gates of hell” in Dan Brown’s latest best-selling book, “Inferno.”

An eyewitness said he saw Snowden dressed as a Catholic nun and entering a gated mansion owned by the Archdiocese of Manila. Analysts surmised that the Catholic Bishops may be unaware that the supposed nun was Snowden because of their lack of skill in picking out cross-dressers from a crowd.



The U.S. Embassy in Manila, upon hearing of the report, immediately filed a formal request with Malacanang Palace, the official residence of Philippine President Noynoy Aquino, for help in bringing Snowden into custody. It was unclear whether the Philippine Government would have the balls to gatecrash the Catholic mansion to search for Snowden. While the Philippine Constitution provides for the separation of church and state, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines remains to be a driving force in the conduct of government affairs. Politicians are constantly fearful that any action on their part that would piss off the bishops will lead to the former’s political demise, as was the case with Presidents Ferdinand Marcos, Joseph Estrada and other high-ranking government officials.

It was not immediately known if Snowden plans to seek political asylum in the Philippines, after several unsuccessful attempts to do so in China, Ecuador, Cuba and Russia.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/08/22/bradley-manning-conviction-and-sentence-will-be-overturned/","BRADLEY MANNING CONVICTION AND SENTENCE TO BE OVERTURNED?","Chicago, Illinois – Anonymous sources at the Office of the Judge Advocate General (JAG) today announced that the conviction of Bradley Manning, the U.S. soldier sentenced to 35 years in military prison for leaking government classified documents, is likely to be overturned soon.

Manning received the sentence on Wednesday for giving more than 700,000 secret files, videos and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks. His lawyers had argued the former Army intelligence analyst suffered a sexual identity crisis when he leaked the files while serving in Iraq in 2009 and 2010.

JAG’s opinion came after Manning, in a statement read on NBC’s “Today” show declared, “As I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know the real me. I am Chelsea Manning, I am a female.”

“Given the way that I feel and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible,” Manning said. “I also request that starting today you refer to me by my new name and use the feminine pronoun.”

In view of this development, JAG said the military has no legal standing to carry out the conviction and sentence of the 25 year-old Manning, since SHE is no longer the same person it charged with the crime. “We have no choice but to drop the conviction and sentence,” JAG said.

Meanwhile, lawyers for Chelsea said they will file for compensation for time already served in prison by the former Bradley.

A huge majority of the 10,000 likely voters polled from acoss the 50 states are now gravitating towards women. Republicans and Democrats alike have chosen an all-women field for their top three choices for the next U.S. president. While the 4th and 5th places on both the Republican and Democrat sides were men, the poll numbers were too insignificant and way below the 3% margin of error. CNN and Fox chose not to reveal the names of the potential male candidates because the networks would not want to embarrass them. Not surprisingly, there was a 3-way tie in the Republican poll. Here are the poll results:

DEMOCRATS: REPUBLICANS:

1. Hillary Clinton, 45% 1. Sarah Palin, 33.33%

2. Elizabeth Warren, 40%. 2. Michelle Bachmann, 33.33%

3. Caroline Kennedy, 14.9 %. 3. Jan Brewer, 33.33 %

The CNN-FOX News poll did not pit the Republican and Democrat candidates against each other. “That will be for the next poll,” a joint statement from the two networks said.

Both newspapers have sent separate notices to the attorneys of The Adobo Chronicles that they are about to file defamation charges in federal court against the increasingly popular news parody Internet site and its newly-released book version. (Disclosure: The Adobo Chronicles fired all of its attorneys months ago.)

The Post is suing for damages because of a news article published in The Adobo Chronicles alleging that Amazon, whose owner recently purchased the paper, will use old newspaper copies of The Post to wrap items bought on Amazon.com.

Mercury News, on the other hand is suing because the cover and copyright page of the newly-released book version of The Adobo Chronicles feature photographs of the paper shaped as a hat and as a cone-shaped wrapper for garlic peanuts (adobo peanuts).

The publisher of The Adobo Chronicles refused to issue a statement in reaction to the impending lawsuits, saying that “we don’t comment on any issue that is under investigation.”

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/11/22/california-to-ban-lechon-roasted-duck-and-boiled-crab/","CALIFORNIA TO BAN LECHON, ROASTED DUCK AND BOILED CRAB","Sacramento, California (EXCLUSIVE to The Adobo Chronicles) – Here in the most radical state of the U.S., shark’s fin and foie gras (fattened duck or goose liver) are already banned, thanks to legislation passed and signed into law within the last two years.

California’s law that prohibits the sale, possession, trade, or distribution of shark fins went into effect in July this year, ending the longtime Chinese custom of serving shark’s fin soup. On the other hand, a federal appeals court ruled last September that California can keep in place its ban on the sale of foie gras. The law prohibits state farmers from force-feeding birds with a tube, a procedure used in producing foie gras. The law also prohibits the sale of the delicacy.

Now, in a new move that would inarguably seal California’s reputation as the world’s top melting pot of progressives, conservationists, environmentalists, human and animal rights activists, a bi-partisan group of state assemblymembers is proposing a new set of legislative bans.

The proposed bill will prohibit the sale of lechon (Filipino roasted pig), roasted duck and boiled crab throughout the state. The legislators cited the inhumane procedures used in cooking or displaying these traditional delicacies.

Suckling pigs are bound and skewered in one whole piece before being roasted for hours over a fire pit. Live crabs are boiled in huge pots. Roasted ducks, on the other hand, are displayed stark naked in windows of Chinatown restaurants and food shops, hanging in iron hooks.

The lawmakers were one in saying that “the preparation and cooking procedures for these food items are cruel and have no regard whatsoever for the dignity of these poor creatures.”

The Adobo Chronicles learned that this is just the beginning of a series of legislation that will look into other inhumane practices used in California’s multi-ethnic and diverse food and restaurant industry.

California voters concerned about other cuisine practices are urged to contact their assembly representatives. A toll-free hotline has been established for this purpose: 1 -000- BAN FOOD.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/07/20/white-house-mulls-change-in-the-national-anthem/","WHITE HOUSE MULLS CHANGE IN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM","Washington, D.C. – Nothing can be more controversial and embarrassing than a public performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” that has gone awry –from Roseanne Barr’s disrespectful rendition to Christina Aguilera’s mixed-up lyrics to Hillary Clinton’s open mike fiasco.

Experts agree that the U.S. National Anthem is one of the most difficult to sing not only because its lyrics make no utter sense to 9 in 10 Americans, but also because the melody requires someone with a super-stretched vocal range.

A group of citizens has had enough of these embarrassing moments. It has sent a petition to The White House to replace “The Star-Spangled Banner” with Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the USA” The petition, posted in The White House web site, contends that the Cyrus song is much more easy to remember and has a more upbeat melody.

Re-live the embarrassing moments.

During a surprise visit to The White House press room, President Barack Obama indicated that he is leaning towards making the national anthem change through an Executive Order. Pressed by reporters on why he favors “Party in the USA,” Obama said: “Our national anthem should represent a celebration of our greatness as a nation, our resiliency as a people, and our party attitude which is the hallmark of our social fabric.”

Obama added: “Imagine an American standing atop the Olympic medal stand while our national anthem is played, or being in the bleachers of a packed baseball arena with thousands and thousands of partying fans. It will be quite a riot! That’s what America is all about.”

As of press time, the petition has gained a whopping 1,197 signatures. People can still sign on to the petition through the White House Petitions Web Page.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/08/24/cnn-wants-weed-named-after-the-network/","CNN WANTS WEED NAMED AFTER THE NETWORK","Denver, Colorado – A recent segment on CNN is causing quite a stir in the Cannabis world. But it is not most people would think.

In a recent special report, CNN’s chief medical correpondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, whose name was once floated as a candidate for the country’s Surgeon General position, indicated that he has changed his earlier position on medical marijuana. Gupta said he now believes that MJ has its medical uses and can bring grams and grams of relief to individuals suffering from chronic and untreatable conditions.

The Helping Hands Dispensary in Colorado was so elated over the CNN report that it named one of its marijuana strains after Gupta. It started selling the strain under the name, “Sanjay Gupta Kush.”

Upon learning of this move by the marijuana dispensary, CNN called the owner expressing its displeasure about the Gupta Kush.

“CNN was visibly very upset, demanding that we drop the name,” the owner said. The Atlanta-based cable news network threatened to sue the dispensary unless it changed the name of the strain to “CNN Kush.”

“After all, the report was broadcast on CNN,” the network told the owner. Besides, CNN added, “we need all the publicity we can get in view of our declining ratings, not to mention the new competition we are getting from the newly-launched news cable network, Al Jazeera America.”

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/08/28/twit-or-twerk-no-longer-the-question/","“TWIT” OR ‘TWERK” NO LONGER THE QUESTION","San Francisco, California – Ah, the power of television! Just a couple of days after that much-talked about performance by former Disney singing star Miley Cyrus at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards (VMA), the word, “twerk” has gotten everyone to go berzerk. The performance featured Cyrus stripping down to flesh-colored bikinis and doing the twerk moves, best described as “the rhythmic gyrating of the lower fleshy extremities in a lascivious manner with the intent to elicit sexual arousal or laughter.”

The word has just been added by Britain’s Oxford Dictionary, lending legitimacy to this urban lexicon. Although “twerk” has been around for years, Oxford Dictionary didn’t decide to add the word until Miley “twerked” all over singer Robin Thicke’s man muscle at the VMAs.

In another unintended consequence of Miley’s performance, Twitter, the San Francisco-based online social networking and microblogging service that enables its users to send and read text-based messages of up to 140 characters, has decided on changing its name to “Twerker.” Twitter CEO Dick Costolo told The Adobo Chronicles that the company has been rethinking its name for quite some time now. “People get confused on when to use “tweet” and “twit,” as they do when referring to the company name – “Twitter” or “Tweeter,” Costolo said.



Costolo said that seeing Cyrus perform at the VMAs, and the millions of tweets that followed her controversial performance helped convince Twitter to change its name. “From hereon, there will be no more confusion among twitters, I mean tweeters,” Costolo pointed out. “Everybody will now be using one and the same term, “Twerk.”

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/11/23/pacquiao-eyes-philippine-presidency-sets-campaign-platform/","PACQUIAO EYES PHILIPPINE PRESIDENCY, SETS CAMPAIGN PLATFORM","Macau, China – Filipino world boxing champion Manny “Pacman” Pacquiao confirmed to reporters today that he has set his eyes – and fists – on the Philippine presidency when the 6-year term of incumbent president Noynoy Aquino comes to an end. Pacquiao is currently serving as a Congressman representing his hometown district of Sarangani.

Pacquiao, whose last title bout ended with him being knocked out by challenger Juan Miguel Marquez, faces Brandon Rios of the United States tonight in a title fight.

Paquiao will be the first boxer ever to run for head of state. The Philippines has had its share of non-politicians running for elective positions. Former president Joseph Estrada, now mayor of Manila, was a movie actor. Many Philippine legislators, provincial governors and city mayors, are also actors, entertainers and journalists.

Asked what his top priorities will be if elected president, Pacquiao said that his first order of business would be to convert the Cultural Center of the Philippines to a national karaoke center and the National Assembly Building (Batasang Pambansa) to the “Boxing Center for Asia.” Aside from boxing, Pacquiao’s other passion is singing.

As for his chances of winning the elections, Pacquiao said he is confident that the Filipino electorate will see his honest intentions to lead the country. “It’s definitely not about accumulating wealth, unlike many politicians. I already have lots and lots of money.”

Pacquiao’s mother, Aling Dionisia, was apparently delighted at her son’s announcement. “I don’t mind being called Queen Mum,” she exclaimed in her native Visayan dialect.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/09/07/kerry-courts-world-support-for-u-s-strike-on-syria/","KERRY COURTS WORLD SUPPORT FOR U.S. STRIKE ON SYRIA","VILNIUS, Lithuania —Armed with $1 Billion vouchers, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is in Europe courting international support for a possible U.S. military strike on Syria for alleged use of chemical weapons.

Kerry, the Obama administration’s chief salesman for a U.S. punitive strike, will meet Saturday with European officials about the Syrian crisis and update them on ongoing peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.

President Barack Obama decided last weekend to postpone any military action and seek the backing of Congress before proceeding to violate the United Nations Charter.

The administration is running out of options for gaining support. A favorable Congressional vote is doubtful. U.S. Allies have not aligned with the U.S. The G20 leaders were lukewarm. The U.N. Secretary General is opposed. Polls show 6 in 10 Americans do not support the strike.

“This is our last straw ” Kerry said. “Any country that will support our planned military strike will get $1 Billion in U.S. aid, provided they sign on within the next 3 days. U.S. credibility is what’s at stake here, ” he added.

Asked by The Adobo Chronicles where the funds will come from, Kerry replied, “Oh, it’s part of the little-known presidential pork barrel. We have not touched it in 5 years. The time has come.”

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/09/11/weiner-and-spitzer-apply-for-philippine-citizenship/","WEINER AND SPITZER APPLY FOR PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP","New York, New York – Following their defeat in the New York Democratic primary elections, Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer both announced that they have applied for Philippine citizenship in order to salvage their severely damaged political careers. Weiner lost his bid to become mayor of New York City, while Spitzer failed in his quest to become city comptroller.

Weiner had been in political exile since he resigned from Congress in 2011 for sending women lewd online messages and pictures. He got into the mayor’s race in May, and aside from a few dust-ups with hecklers, was largely well-received at first, holding the lead for most of June and July. Spitzer resigned as governor in 2008 and admitted he paid for sex with call girls. In exile, he bounced around television as a pundit. Then, just four days before the deadline, he announced he was running for comptroller.

The disgraced American politicians apparently saw light at the end of the tunnel after being briefed by their political advisers that in the Philippines, politicians get elected and re-elected regardless of scandals or even conviction and imprisonment. Their advisers pointed to the case of former Philippine President Joseph Estrada, who even after being convicted and jailed for corruption, ran and won the race for mayor of Manila, the Philippine capital. They also cited the case of another former Philippine President, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who despite being charged with plunder and is currently under hospital arrest, won a seat in the House of Representatives. They added, “This is not to mention the family of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos whose wife Imelda has been elected to Congress and son Bongbong who won a Senate seat. Daughter Imee is governor of Marcos’ home province of Ilocos Norte.”

The Adobo Chronicles has learned that Philippine immigration officials have offered to expedite the immigration and citizenship process for both Weiner and Spitzer while Mayor Joseph Estrada indicated he will roll the red carpet for the Americans when they arrive at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Asked to comment about the American politicians’ plan to move to the Philippines, President NoyNoy Aquino said, “They would be a welcome addition to the Philippine political circus, I mean circuit.”

The next scheduled national elections in the Philippines is in 2016. Will the Filipino electorate see a Weiner and a Spitzer for Congress?

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/09/15/napoles-seeks-audience-with-obama-in-manila/","NAPOLES SEEKS AUDIENCE WITH OBAMA IN MANILA","Manila, Philippines – Suspected pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles wasted no time in trying to reach out to Barack Obama after it was officially announced that the U.S. President will be visiting Manila in October.

Obama has included the Philippines in his Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) tour. Manila will be Obama’s last stop. It will be his first visit to the Philippines.

Napoles is the central figure in the Philippine pork barrel scam involving the diversion of ten billion pesos in public funds into fake non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the pockets of senators and congressmen. She is currently in prison and facing charges for illegally detaining one of the whistleblowers in this escalating scandal.

Speaking through her lawyer Lorna Kapunan, Napoles said that she has sent a letter to the U.S. Embassy in Manila requesting a private meeting with Obama when the latter arrives in the Philippine capital.

Informed sources said that in her letter, Napoles has indicated that she will be asking Obama to grant her political asylum in the U.S. and would like to be accommodated aboard Air Force One when Obama leaves Manila to return to the U.S.

Napoles said that she is very confident that she will be granted asylum because she has contrbuted immemsely to the economic recovery of America through her multimillion-dollar U.S. investments and the much talked-about shopping sprees and lavish parties by her daughter, aspiring fashion designer Jeane Napoles.

Napoles said she will not be a burden to America and promised that if Obama interceded on her behalf to have all her assets unfrozen, she will invest all her money in the U.S. and help create more jobs for Americans.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/07/12/undocumented-immigrants-extend-amnesty-to-george-w-bush/","UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS EXTEND AMNESTY TO GEORGE W. BUSH","Dallas, Texas – A coalition of immigrant rights organizations across the U.S., acting on behalf of 11 million undocumented immigrants, today extended amnesty to former President George W. Bush. This unprecedented action by the immigrants, in effect, forgives the former president for all the lies and illegal acts committed during his 8-year term. Many of Bush’s words and actions during his presidency hurt the cause of immigrants and communities of color, including Latinos and Asian Americans.

The grant of amnesty to Bush was prompted by his recent public statement at a naturalization ceremony in Texas, whereby he expressed his full support for a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Recently, the U.S. Senate, passed — by a vote of 68-32 –a bill that would strengthen the borders while providing a path to citizenship to the country’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. The U.S. House of Representatives is now debating the Senate bill, but many conservative Republicans are not happy with the upper chamber’s version because it is tantamount to “granting amnesty to those who have violated this country’s laws.”

In his statement, Bush said, “We can uphold our tradition of assimilating immigrants, and honoring our heritage of our nation built on the rule of law. But we have a problem. The laws governing the immigration system aren’t working; the system is broken.” He urged his fellow Republicans in Congress to address the issue as soon as possible. It wasn’t clear whether Bush’s urging will have any impact in changing the minds of lawmakers opposed to the path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile, the Democrats in Congress have remained silent on the grant of amnesty to the former president. But sources said that while Democrats may not want to go as far as granting amnesty to Bush, they are also weary that opposing such move might jeopardize their standing with the Latino and other immigrant communities, especially in the next elections.

As he posed for a photo with newly-naturalized citizens from Nigeria and the Philippines (see photo), the former president was asked for his reaction to the amnesty extended to him. He simply winked his eye and blurted out, “he he.”

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/09/27/jollibee-testifies-before-philippine-senate-on-pork-barrel-scam/","Jollibee Testifies Before Philippine Senate On Pork Barrel Scam","Manila, Philippines – The fat, stupid, happy bee is once again making headlines in the Philippines, just months after it put the clown permanently out of business in this Asian country of almost 100 million people. See story on the merger of Jollibee and McDonald’s .

As charges of plunder were filed against Janet Lim-Napoles and ranking members of the Philippine Senate this week, the names of more politicians were implicated in testimonies by whistleblowers in the escalating pork barrel scam. The scam involves the diversion of more than 10 billion pesos of taxpayer money into the coffers of fake non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as into the pockets of national and local politicians.

In a privilege speech in the Senate, Senator Jinggoy Estrada, one of the Senators charged in the scam, decried what he termed “selective justice” by being singled out among many others who have personally benefited from this money scandal. During his speech, Estrada suggested that Jollibee, one of the most successful food business enterprises in the country, also benefited from the pork barrel. Estrada did not reveal any details of the alleged involvement of Jollibee in the scam.

Yesterday, Jollibee was summoned to the floor of Congress to answer the allegation by Estrada.

Under oath, Jollibee made a very brief statement at the hearing, then took the Fifth, saying he refuses to answer any questions from the senators on the grounds that he might incriminate himself.

His brief statement: “I can assure this respectable chamber and our millions of loyal customers that Jollibee’s hamburgers are not tainted in any way by pork. Our burgers are 100% beef.”

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/12/11/why-president-obama-was-wrong-in-shaking-the-hand-of-cubas-raul-castro/","WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS WRONG IN SHAKING THE HAND OF CUBA’S RAUL CASTRO","Johannesburg, South Africa – Forget the “selfie” that U.S. President Barack Obama took with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and British Prime Minister David Cameron during the memorial celebration for the late Nelson Mandela. The international community was forgiving of that incident, especially because the word “selfie” was just named word of the year by the Oxford English Dictionary.

The bigger controversy – and what really upset Michelle Obama – was the President shaking the hand of Cuban President Raul Castro. It had nothing to do with a U.S. President shaking the hand of a communist head of state. Rather it was because Obama did it the wrong way.

The politically correct way to greet someone from a Latin country is to “kiss” the hand by bringing it to touch the greeter’s forehead, just like it is done in the Philippines which was once a colony of Spain. Along with this Filipino gesture of greeting and respect, the greeter would say, “Mano, po!” (Please give me your blessing!)

It looks like President Obama needs a lesson or two in cultural sensitivity.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/12/17/kerry-courts-manila-government-philippines-to-become-the-51st-u-s-state/","KERRY COURTS MANILA GOVERNMENT: PHILIPPINES TO BECOME THE 51ST U.S. STATE?","Manila, Philippines – It’s all about oil. U.S. interest seems to be shifting from the Middle East to Asia, particularly the oil-rich waters surrounding the Philippines, China, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. Tension has been rising among and between the governments of these countries over territorial claims in around South China Sea and the Spratly Islands.

Overtly, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is in the Philippines to try to ease tensions between the Manila and Beijing governments, urging China to go easy on imposing no-fly and no-sail zones over the disputed territories between the two countries.

Covertly, as confirmed by latest tweets from suspected American security secrets leaker Edward Snowden, Kerry is in Manila talking up the Aquino government to seriously consider becoming the 51st state of the U.S. Kerry said that becoming a U.S. state would be in the best interest of the Philippines because it would essentially put the American military at its disposal in its dispute with China. Of course, what Kerry is not saying is that it would grant the U.S. full access to the area’s rich oil resources.

The Filipino sentiment against American colonialism has significantly changed since the U.S. military bases were practically driven out of the Philippines in the early 1990’s. There is a growing displeasure with the Manila government. Filipinos are fed up with political dynasties, incompetence, corruption and all that kind of stuff.

Is it time to add another star to the stars and stripes?

Or that of the beer diplomacy at the White House involving Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Cambridge police chief James Crowley. Google it if you have no idea what we’re talking about.

The big news today was the unexpected meeting between Obama and Sarah Palin who are both vacationing in Hawaii.

No visit to Honolulu is ever complete without stopping by Leonard’s Bakery to pick up a box of malasadas, those warm pastries resembling donut holes rolled in sugar.

Apparently, malasadas are a favorite of the political rivals, and they happened to stop by Leonard’s tonight at the same time. At first, both felt very uncomfortable at the unexpected meeting, but after they both got their orders, they felt the spirit of aloha and shook hands.

Members of the press corps accompanying the president (including our star reporter at The Adobo Chronicles) were shocked at what they saw, but conceded that everything they witnessed was all because of the holiday atmosphere that’s been spreading uncontrollably in the Rainbow State.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2013/12/24/sarah-palin-defends-the-adobo-chronicles/","SARAH PALIN DEFENDS ‘THE ADOBO CHRONICLES’","Honolulu, Hawaii – Last week, Sarah Palin defended “Duck Dynasty’ star Phil Robertson’s anti-gay and racist comments he made on GQ magazine, saying that the patriarch was merely exercising his right of free speech.

Asked by Fox News host Greta Van Susteren if Palin took issue with the manner in which Robertson made his comments, the former Alaska governor replied, “I haven’t read the article. I don’t know exactly how he said it, but he was responding to a question about a lifestyle he disagrees with.”

Today, Palin is defending The Adobo Chronicles for publishing an exclusive story about the former vice presidential candidate mistaking the word “mahalo” for “trash.” “I don’t read The Adobo Chronicles or any newspaper for that matter, but whatever the news site said about me is a right guaranteed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,” Palin said.

“I may very well look stupid and clueless in that news article, but I said what I said when asked a stupid question by The Adobo Chronicles reporter. I’m not going to take issue with that,” she added.

Palin is in Waikiki vacationing to escape the frigid temperatures of her native Alaska.

In another exclusive, The Adobo Chronicles reported on the unexpected meeting between Palin and President Obama who is also vacationing this week in Hawaii. The political rivals chanced upon each other while buying malasadas from Leonard’s Bakery in Honolulu.

"http://politicot.com/ted-nugents-wife-files-for-divorce-after-being-outed-as-ted-nugents-wife/","Ted Nugent’s Wife Files for Divorce after being Outed as Ted Nugent’s Wife","DALLAS – Shemane Nugent, the wife of rock musician and gun enthusiast Ted Nugent, filed for divorce today, spelling an end to the couple’s 24-year marriage. According to a source close to the Nugent family, Shemane, 51, decided that “she had no choice” but to separate from Nugent after “the whole world discovered that she was married to him.”

Shemane—who was relatively unknown until recently—was outed as Ted Nugent’s wife on Friday, when she attempted to pass through Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport security with a firearm in her carry-on luggage. The handgun—which Shemane claimed to have been carrying because she had received death threats—was discovered, and she was taken into custody. “I had totally forgotten it was in there,” Nugent claimed after being released on bail. “I mean, Jesus, I live with Ted Nugent, a man who carries half an armory in his ass crack. We’ve got guns all over the goddamn place.”

Mrs. Nugent maintains that she should not have been detained for a “simple mistake,” but did issue a public apology in which she expressed remorse for having spent over two decades married to “a man who once publicly threatened to murder Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton, and who has referred to black people as ‘mongrels’.”

“It was one thing being married to him when nobody knew who I was,” Mrs. Nugent said. “His music earned us a lot of money—we had an amazing house, despite the lingering smell of deer carcass, and we were constantly traveling the world, drinking the finest moonshine, eating the most savory varmint. But, for reasons that should be obvious, I cannot be publicly known as Mrs. Ted Nugent, and I have therefore filed for divorce.”

Ted Nugent—one of the NRA’s most prominent members and an attendee at 2013’s State of the Union address—could not be reached directly for comment, but said through a spokesman that he “didn’t care, because hunting is better than sex anyway,” and added that Shemane could “suck on his machine gun.”

"http://politicot.com/republicans-outraged-by-violation-of-mens-privacy/","Republicans Outraged by Violation of Men’s Privacy","WASHINGTON — Since PRISM whistleblower Edward Snowden first revealed that the NSA has been secretly collecting communication data on millions of Americans without warrants or due process, prominent Republicans across the country have been speaking out against this gross violation of non-vaginal privacy.

“There is no justification for the government to intrude on the personal lives of American citizens,” said libertarian-favorite Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. “Of course there are going to be small exceptions when it comes to women, or gays, or people with vaguely ethnic-sounding names, but for the most part the right to privacy is sacred.” Paul has even threatened to sue the federal government over the NSA’s controversial surveillance program.

In the House, outrage over privacy violations almost brought the lower chamber to a complete standstill this week. Representatives were so busy attempting to restore constitutional protections that they were barely able to approve a bill severely curtailing a woman’s right to choose. The bill, which passed 228-196, would ban abortion after 20 weeks, even in cases of rape or incest.

“The Obama administration has shown appalling disregard for the privacy of American citizens,” said architect of the abortion ban Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., at a press conference Thursday. “Looks like it’s up to Congress to rein in government once again.”","2013-06-24 10:17:35","1","27.0","10.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","59.0","31.0","0.0","85.0","1.0","35.0","9","219","97.61","55.44","35.19","2.20","19.91","30.14","75.80","42.01","3.65","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.46","3.20","8.22","17.35","6.39","4.11","3.20","0.91","10.50","4.11","1.83","0.91","2.74","0.91","5.94","1.37","4.11","0.46","2.28","0.46","5.94","0.00","0.00","0.91","0.00","8.22","1.37","0.91","0.46","3.65","0.46","3.65","3.20","0.91","1.83","0.46","3.20","0.46","1.37","2.74","0.00","7.76","0.46","0.91","5.94","0.00","0.91","3.65","5.48","0.46","14.16","1.83","7.31","5.02","4.11","0.00","0.46","0.91","0.46","0.00","0.91","0.00","0.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.18","5.48","5.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.74","3.65","1.37","0.00","0.00","1130","8.95","31.714285714285715","350","214","12","53.41","13.6","10.2","14.38","13.4","60","10.6","20.334953271028038","158","28.14","6","0.4","0","5","3","21","0","28","19","1","1","1","35","21","3","15","0","0","3","0","11","0","0","1","11","0","9","8","6","5","3","8","1","0","0","1"
"http://politicot.com/u-s-demands-syria-massacre-its-citizens-the-old-fashioned-way-2/","U.S. Demands Syria Massacre Its Citizens the Old-Fashioned Way","WASHINGTON — The Obama administration had harsh words for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Monday, demanding that if the repressive tyrant was going to massacre his own people, he had better do so without the use of chemical weapons.

“We will not stand for the senseless killing of Syrian civilians,” Secretary of State John Kerry vowed at a press conference in Prague, “when that killing involves biological weaponry. Bullets, bombs, grenades—those are fine though. Carry on.”

The president says the statement is about drawing a line in the sand. “America has a moral imperative to make sure the freedom-loving people of this world are repressed as inefficiently as possible,” said Obama during a press briefing Tuesday.

Many don’t realize the United States has a proud history of slowing genocide. In 1943, before the U.S. entered the European theater in World War II, President Roosevelt famously demanded that the Nazis limit the capacity of gas chambers to 40 people at a time.

For many in government, the commitment to support fledgling democracies is part of what makes America exceptional.

“Democracy is like a dandelion,” Kerry reflected. “When you use petrochemical weed-killer, those beautiful yellow flowers will never grow. It’s not fair. If the Syrian government is serious about repressing the will of its people, it had better get on its hands and knees and show a little personal attention to uprooting progress.”

Bolstering the administration’s threats were several NATO backers, who echoed Obama’s sentiments against the use of chemical weapons. “If Syria ignores our threats ten or fifteen more times, things are going to get serious,” warned Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “We’re talking non-binding resolution serious. And if they ignore that, get ready for an official censure.”

Obama admits the threats against Syria are largely toothless, but insists they hold the potential to be effective. “We may not have the bite to back up our bark here,” conceded the president, “but we can gum pretty hard.”","2013-03-20 14:09:01","0","25.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","48.0","1.0","35.0","3","330","89.77","61.92","12.99","3.15","17.37","28.79","76.97","42.73","7.58","3.33","0.00","1.82","0.30","0.61","0.61","4.24","9.39","12.42","7.58","2.73","4.85","1.82","14.24","4.24","2.12","1.21","1.21","1.52","10.00","3.64","6.06","1.82","3.03","0.00","6.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.61","10.00","2.12","1.82","1.21","2.73","0.91","4.24","3.33","0.91","0.61","1.82","1.21","0.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.61","2.12","1.82","5.45","1.52","1.21","2.12","10.00","2.12","9.70","1.82","4.85","3.64","3.33","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.61","1.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.61","6.36","6.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.21","5.45","1.52","0.00","0.00","1642","8.75","21.0","513","326","19","54.02","13.1","10.0","13.11","12.1","88","8.5","19.67754601226994","227","19.75","5","0.42","0","6","2","36","0","39","34","1","0","5","42","38","1","21","0","0","11","5","12","2","0","1","8","0","15","13","13","2","12","13","0","2","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/texas-board-of-education/","Texas Board of Education Revises Textbooks: Slaves were 'Unpaid Interns'","DALLAS — The Texas Board of Education has drawn scrutiny in recent years for its efforts to revise its curriculum to favor more conservative-friendly versions of history and science. After revising textbooks last year to emphasize Christian influences on the Founding Fathers and introduce Intelligent Design to biology classes, the Board voted nine to zero today to change official nomenclature regarding slavery. In Texas, students will now be taught that slaves were not kidnapped and exploited against their will, but were actually “unpaid interns.”

“While African workers were not compensated monetarily,” the new curriculum guidelines acknowledge, “by working outside picking cotton, they gained valuable career experience and were provided with ample networking opportunities.”

Charlie Schuster, a three-term board member from Dallas, introduced the motion. For the incredulous Schuster, the idea that the Founding Fathers were involved in a system of owning fellow humans simply was too much to believe. “Either the Founding Fathers were divinely-inspired statesmen,” said Schuster, “or they endorsed slavery. That’s a pretty glaring contradiction. So obviously slavery didn’t exist.”

“Sure, these plantation interns had it harder than today’s modern college students,” Board of Ed member Alan Wixom told Newslo. “They didn’t have coffee breaks, they couldn’t goof around on Facebook, they were frequently beaten within an inch of sweet merciful death — but they made lifelong connections and built some strong resumes in the process. Not to mention the acclaimed music they were encouraged to write!”

Schuster’s motion reportedly included several primary source documents provided by revisionist historian David Barton, which lent credibility to the Board’s interpretation of slavery. One of the documents — a diary entry supposedly written by a slave in Virginia — proudly describes the glowing letter of recommendation he was given by “the man with the bullwhip.”

But the Board’s critics were vocal in their opposition to the changes. “Look at this garbage,” said education activist Javier Narilla, reading from the new curriculum. “‘History textbooks should mention that the international slave trade was merely an early precursor to modern study abroad programs.’ This is the law now.”

Added Narilla, “I hate this state.”

Whether liberal or conservative, political and pedagogical experts agree that the implications of this decision are monumental, Texas State Senators are already considering legislation that would award slaves retroactive college credit in lieu of reparations.","2013-09-17 21:14:04","0","29.0","8.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","51.0","31.0","0.0","72.0","1.0","35.0","7","384","91.47","58.24","18.52","81.93","19.20","34.90","78.65","40.36","6.77","2.86","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","2.34","3.91","7.55","12.76","7.03","2.60","3.65","1.56","11.46","3.65","1.56","0.52","1.04","1.56","4.95","3.91","0.78","0.00","0.78","0.00","7.81","0.78","0.52","0.00","1.56","9.64","1.82","1.82","0.78","1.30","0.52","3.91","2.08","0.52","0.78","0.26","1.04","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.52","10.16","1.30","2.86","6.25","1.04","0.00","7.29","4.17","0.52","10.68","1.04","4.17","5.47","8.59","1.04","0.00","0.78","0.78","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","19.79","4.95","5.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.78","5.99","2.34","0.00","0.00","2130","10.21","32.666666666666664","660","385","20","43.43","13.7","12.0","16.24","15.4","137","12.75","23.95376623376624","260","29.42","2","0.39","0","11","4","35","0","41","43","1","0","4","59","35","1","34","0","0","10","4","19","1","0","0","12","0","14","23","10","14","9","6","2","0","0","0"
"http://politicot.com/ahmadinejad-to-focus-on-presidential-library/","Ahmadinejad to Focus on Presidential Library","TEHERAN, Iran — Plans for the Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Center for the Purification of Reputation are said to be moving ahead quickly, which is welcome news for the Iranian president as his turbulent time in office comes to an end this summer.

Between a moderate winning a stunning victory in the election to succeed him – a move many are seeing as a repudiation of his hardline policies – and being summoned by a criminal court over flimsy accusations of corruption, Ahmadinejad admitted that his presidency is “coming in for a rough landing.”

“My image could really use a little rehab,” said the soon-to-be-ex-president. “When I saw that [George W.] Bush got a library and no one seems to mind anymore that he drove the U.S. off a cliff, I figured that was the way to go.”

Center director Shayar Bayat says that memorabilia from both Ahmadinejad’s public and private life will be on display, like his friendship collage with late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and a dog-eared, heavily highlighted copy of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.”

However, more high-tech features will also be available. At specially designed touchscreen kiosks, visitors can interact with a virtual Ahmadinejad who explains why the Holocaust is “a myth” perpetuated by “governments in the pay of Zion.” If the user selects pre-programmed responses such as “No respected authority agrees with you,” or “How can you be so callously uninformed and insane?” the automated Ahmadinejad explains why you are a “Jew sympathizer who will burn in hell.”

For the children, the Center will feature a demonstration explaining how the reckless defying of international resolutions has left them a bleak economic picture. The Mahmoud Lack-of-Many-Jobs ride will feature a water slide that gets steeper at special “sanction markers” as kids slip, slide and are ultimately deposited into the Great Islamic Unemployment Pool of Iran.

Those with a non-political bent can also enjoy the Center. The “Shi’a Members Only” exhibit will have mannequins dressed in replica outfits Ahmadinejad wore over the course of his presidency. “We want to convey how Mr. Ahmadinejad changed the way people saw violent Muslim extremists,” said Bayat. “Instead of the keffiyeh clad lunatics you see in the movies, he gave genocidal extremism a more ‘Casual Friday’ face.”

The Center is set to open in 2017, around the same time Iran plans to announce another tribute to Ahmadinejad’s legacy – it’s fully operational nuclear arsenal.","2013-06-24 10:14:42","0","25.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","410","93.51","76.04","11.07","53.27","24.12","27.80","76.83","45.61","7.56","4.15","0.73","0.24","0.98","1.95","0.24","3.41","10.98","13.90","6.83","4.39","4.88","0.49","13.66","4.15","1.95","2.20","0.49","1.46","2.68","1.95","0.49","0.00","0.49","0.00","8.54","0.00","0.24","0.00","1.95","5.61","1.71","1.95","0.98","0.73","0.00","1.22","3.41","1.71","0.98","0.73","1.46","0.49","0.73","0.00","0.24","7.56","1.22","1.71","4.39","1.46","0.24","3.17","8.29","2.68","12.93","2.93","7.56","2.68","4.63","0.73","0.00","0.73","1.71","0.49","0.49","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.51","4.63","3.66","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","2.68","6.59","1.22","0.00","0.49","1988","9.39","46.111111111111114","645","403","19","49.96","13.9","11.6","12.76","13.6","120","16.833333333333332","22.390669975186103","266","39.44","6","0.44","0","7","1","52","0","50","35","2","0","10","59","54","0","18","0","0","12","5","15","1","0","0","10","0","18","15","6","8","9","18","2","2","0","6"
"http://politicot.com/bono-recalls-u2s-enormous-influence-on-nelson-mandela/","Bono Recalls U2’s ‘Enormous Influence’ on Nelson Mandela","DUBLIN — U2 frontman Bono paid tribute to himself in a 1,000-word essay published by TIME following the death of iconic South African leader Nelson Mandela.

“As an activist, Nelson Mandela did pretty much whatever U2 told him to,” he writes. “We have been a forceful presence in his life going back to 1979, when U2 made its first anti-apartheid effort.”

In the piece, titled ‘The Man Who Could Not Cry,’ the legendary bandleader calls his friend “a remarkable man” for using U2’s message of peace to inspire the South African people during the country’s transition from apartheid to multiparty democracy.

Bono also praised Mandela for helping U2 battle the AIDS epidemic and extreme poverty around the globe by increasing access to the greatest band in the world’s discography.

Bono closes his essay with an anecdote that gave the article its title—referencing Mandela’s inability to shed tears. “Laughter, not tears, was Madiba’s preferred way—except on one occasion when I saw him almost choke up,” he recalls.

“Madiba and I were listening to ‘One’ from our album Achtung Baby, which many people say is our best record, and I could have sworn I saw him shed a tear. Everybody cries during that song.”

Bono adds, “But he explained to me that dust damage to his tear ducts from years of working in limestone mines had left him unable to cry. After listening to the song, he said he would have surgery to put this right, and in 1994 he did. I never knew if he listened to the song again, but I would like to think that Madiba is in heaven, listening to U2’s music and weeping.”","2013-12-08 11:16:12","0","24.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","280","86.04","84.99","4.91","38.47","23.33","19.64","77.86","46.79","13.21","9.29","2.50","1.07","0.00","5.71","0.00","3.93","6.79","15.00","5.71","2.86","4.29","1.07","14.64","1.79","1.43","1.79","2.50","1.43","6.43","3.57","2.86","0.00","0.36","2.14","15.00","0.36","0.36","0.00","6.43","8.57","2.50","1.07","2.14","1.07","0.71","2.14","5.00","0.71","4.29","0.00","1.79","0.00","1.79","0.36","0.00","6.79","1.79","2.50","2.50","1.07","0.00","6.07","3.21","0.36","11.79","1.79","6.07","4.29","1.79","1.79","0.00","0.71","0.36","0.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.57","4.29","5.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.71","5.00","2.86","0.00","0.00","1247","8.1","28.6","376","276","12","65.05","10.3","9.9","10.62","12.5","58","12.625","19.605797101449276","180","26.0","15","0.43","0","7","6","21","2","28","19","0","1","3","51","28","0","8","0","0","20","8","8","0","1","1","16","0","10","19","10","4","2","8","3","0","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/obama-admits-to-jerking-off-raul-castro-backstage/","The Obama-Castro Handjob That Shocked The World","JOHANNESBURG — A simple handjob between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro erupted a torrent of international speculation about a coming shift in Cuban-American relations.

Obama offered Castro the handjob in front of a worldwide audience before taking the stage at Tuesday’s memorial service honoring former South African President Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg.

The brief but intimate gesture is no guarantee that the former Cold War foes are headed towards reconciliation, but optimists in both nations hope the two presidents’ aggressive sexual behavior towards one another is a sign of things to come.

“May this… be the beginning of the end of the US aggressions,” read a message on the Cuban government’s official website.

Others were less enthused about the manual stimulation.

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) who was born in Havana before her family moved to Miami, said it was “nauseating and disheartening” to watch Obama jerk off another president.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was quick to lambaste the president for his gesture of kindness, going so far as to compare it to the time Neville Chamberlain famously went down on Adolf Hitler at the start of World War II.

“Why should you give somebody who’s keeping Americans in prison a handjob? It’s a sign of weakness. If anything, Castro should be the one serving up the presidential penis pull,” McCain said.

A White House official said the handjob was not planned, and that Obama and Castro simply “exchanged greetings” as they prepared for the memorial.

After bringing Castro to climax, Obama moved on to nibble Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s ear and gingerly lick the fingers of Afghan President Hamid Karzai.","2013-12-11 15:16:17","0","27.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","55.0","1.0","35.0","3","276","97.43","66.81","29.41","11.64","17.25","28.26","75.36","41.67","6.88","1.81","0.00","0.36","0.36","0.72","0.36","5.07","9.78","15.58","5.07","1.81","3.99","0.72","11.59","5.07","3.26","1.09","1.09","1.45","3.99","1.45","2.54","0.00","2.17","0.36","6.16","0.36","0.00","0.36","0.36","5.80","0.72","0.72","1.45","1.81","0.36","1.81","3.62","0.72","1.45","0.72","1.81","1.09","0.36","0.72","0.00","10.51","2.17","0.72","7.25","0.72","0.00","5.07","4.35","1.81","17.39","4.71","8.33","4.71","4.35","0.36","0.72","0.36","0.00","1.45","0.72","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.03","5.80","2.90","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","1.45","2.90","2.17","1.45","0.00","1382","8.88","23.416666666666668","434","273","14","51.68","13.4","10.9","13.46","13.3","74","11.875","20.642490842490844","181","21.33","7","0.39","0","7","3","30","0","34","21","1","0","2","40","59","2","11","0","0","5","2","6","0","0","1","8","0","8","18","9","4","5","2","0","2","0","1"
"http://politicot.com/pat-buchanan-wants-russias-putin-for-u-s-president/","Pat Buchanan Wants Russia’s Putin for U.S. President","WASHINGTON – Conservative pundit Pat Buchanan believes the United States needs a third party for the future. His choice for leader?

Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In his December 17th syndicated column, Buchanan called Putin the “ideal Commander in Chief” to undo the damage wrought by “the militant secularism of a multicultural and transnational elite” led by President Barack Obama.

“In the culture war for mankind’s future,” Buchanan wrote of Putin, “is he one of us?”

“Not only is Putin one of us,” Buchanan claimed, “but he could also be the one to lead America out of its decrepit state of immorality.”

“President Reagan once called the old Soviet Empire ‘the focus of evil in the modern world,’” Buchanan wrote. “President Putin is implying that Barack Obama’s America may deserve the title in the 21st century.”

Buchanan went on to praise Putin as a fellow “paleoconservative” who could protect America from “the new immorality which has been imposed undemocratically.”

“Putin wouldn’t kowtow to a moderate political base like the contemporary GOP,” argued Buchanan, who added that Putin has all the prerequisites of an all-star Republican presidential candidate.

“He favors a balanced budget and believes in low taxes. He’s an anti-terrorist hero. Most importantly, he supports organized religion and opposes all forms of gayness.”

Earlier this year, Buchanan wrote another column that praised Putin for restoring his nation’s “moral compass” after the Russian leader signed laws banning so-called “gay propaganda.”

Of course, as Buchanan admitted, the laws of both Russia and the United States rule out even the most miniscule chance of a future U.S. President Putin, but Buchanan wrote that “the dream of a truly political, moral and cultural conservative leader is something for which America should strive.”

“Besides,” he concluded, “if a Kenyan can become President of the United States, then why not a Russian?”","2013-12-18 22:20:27","0","29.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","54.0","1.0","35.0","3","307","95.71","75.31","1.27","31.32","19.19","26.38","72.31","41.37","7.49","3.58","0.00","0.65","0.00","2.93","0.00","3.91","10.42","13.03","5.21","1.95","4.23","0.98","9.12","4.23","2.28","1.63","1.63","2.61","5.54","2.93","2.61","0.33","0.65","0.33","8.79","0.00","0.33","0.00","3.26","10.42","1.95","1.30","2.93","1.95","1.30","1.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","10.75","0.98","2.93","7.82","0.33","0.33","4.56","4.89","1.63","9.77","0.98","4.56","4.23","7.49","0.65","0.00","0.65","1.63","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","25.73","4.89","5.54","0.00","0.00","0.98","0.00","0.98","11.40","1.95","0.00","0.00","1546","8.36","34.77777777777778","468","305","17","61.77","12.5","9.1","13.74","13.0","74","7.583333333333334","18.864918032786886","181","27.56","4","0.41","0","7","4","37","0","40","29","0","1","5","46","53","3","5","1","0","8","4","11","1","1","0","4","0","8","17","3","5","1","13","3","2","0","1"

"http://politicot.com/terrorist-mastermind-ayman-al-zawahiri-received-military-security-clearance/","Terrorist Mastermind Ayman al-Zawahiri Received Military Security Clearance","WASHINGTON — An internal investigation carried out by the Department of Defense in response to Monday’s mass shooting at a Navy building in Washington, D.C. has revealed that Ayman al-Zawahiri—the nominal leader of the Islamist terror group al-Qaeda—was given top security clearance last year, allowing him to enter virtually any secured military building in the United States unattended. Military officials admit that giving clearance to the man who is believed to have helped mastermind the 9/11 terror attacks was a “pretty big blunder,” but maintain that the “system is not flawed.”

The report, released Tuesday, shows that in August of 2012 Ayman al-Zawahiri—the world’s most-wanted fugitive who became the leader of al-Qaeda after Osama Bin Laden’s death—applied for a “secret” level security clearance at the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office. Zawahiri’s request was approved on the spot, despite the fact that, according to the report, he “mumbled something about death to America.”

Stan Sims, Director of the Defense Security Service (DSS), says that giving a terrorist madman access to U.S. military sites is “not ideal” and “definitely unfortunate,” but asserted that it’s “just one of those things that happens sometimes.”

“When Zawahiri came in here, he had such a nice face, and he asked so politely,” Sims said. “We simply don’t have the time to check out every single person who applies for clearance. Usually we have to just make these decisions with our gut.”

“This time, I admit, we may have made the wrong call,” Sims said.

The report’s findings are likely to further enrage a public already frustrated with the Department of Defense’s security-clearance procedures. On Monday, a gunman identified as former Navy reservist and military contractor Aaron Alexis killed 12 people in a mass shooting inside Washington, D.C.’s Naval Yard. Alexis had reportedly been given security clearance to enter the premises at-will, despite a “pattern of misconduct” while with the Navy and multiple incidents of firearm misuse dating back to 2004, when he was arrested in Seattle for drunkenly shooting out the tires of a man’s truck. Alexis was killed in a shoot-out with police Monday.

Sims admitted that Alexis represented the “worst-case scenario,” but pointed out that, in Zawahiri’s case, the error was noticed and corrected “before anything catastrophic could happen.”

“Thankfully, Zawahiri seems to have only made use of his clearance to get free buffet-style breakfasts at various military-run cafeterias,” Sims explained. “The only form of terrorism he was able to engage in was the stink bomb he left in the bathroom on Breakfast Fajitas Friday—not that that wasn’t devastating in its own right.”","2013-09-17 21:08:46","0","25.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","448","94.41","73.40","22.76","29.50","26.35","26.56","75.89","43.30","8.04","2.90","0.22","0.89","0.00","1.79","0.00","5.13","8.71","14.73","6.03","3.57","2.90","1.12","12.95","3.57","2.01","1.12","1.56","1.56","7.81","4.02","3.79","0.89","1.12","0.22","8.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.23","10.04","2.90","1.34","0.67","2.46","0.89","2.01","1.34","0.45","0.67","0.00","1.34","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.89","9.60","1.34","1.12","4.69","0.45","2.68","6.92","5.36","0.45","13.84","1.12","8.04","4.91","3.12","0.89","0.45","0.45","0.22","0.89","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.21","4.91","5.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.46","6.70","2.68","0.45","0.22","2185","9.25","41.81818181818182","683","429","19","48.54","13.4","12.1","14.22","15.2","122","12.0","22.415291375291375","262","36.18","9","0.43","0","8","6","45","1","57","32","0","1","3","75","66","1","14","1","0","12","3","17","0","1","6","15","0","14","33","9","17","6","11","1","3","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/at-zero-percent-likelihood-of-budget-compromise-never-been-higher/","At Zero Percent, Likelihood of Budget Compromise Never Been Higher","WASHINGTON — Although mainstream news agencies suggest hope that Democrats and Republicans will reach a compromise on the federal budget is rapidly dwindling, Newslo’s in-house science research team has found that the likelihood of compromise, at zero percent, can only increase.

“These conclusions were drawn from minimal data,” said Head Science Researcher Dr. Ren Bernoulli. “We generally perceive the inability of Congress to work out a bargain on anything to be a self-evident truth. Remember the debt ceiling? Sequestration?”

Despite a recent Gallup poll showing that 60% of Americans favor compromise, Dr. Bernoulli speculated that most Americans actually lost all hope a long time ago. Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-WA) expressed the same cynicism.

“Hope never existed,” said Murray. “They made it up so there would be a conflict for their narrative. Here are some things that are more likely to happen before a budget deal compromise: Kony 2013. Mick Jagger getting satisfaction. Joffrey from Game of Thrones having a redemption moment. Um, Peter Pan saying ‘goodbye.’ Shit, this is hard.”

Dr. Bernoulli warned against misinterpreting the findings to mean things will get better. While the likelihood of compromise can technically only increase, Dr. Bernoulli advises the public not to get their hopes up.","2013-03-20 10:22:01","0","22.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","48.0","1.0","35.0","3","207","90.75","65.05","5.86","62.41","12.94","31.40","76.33","38.65","7.25","1.93","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","1.45","5.31","7.73","11.11","6.76","3.86","1.93","0.97","13.53","3.86","2.90","0.00","1.45","2.42","5.80","3.86","1.93","0.00","0.97","0.48","7.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.53","2.90","0.48","2.42","5.31","1.93","2.42","2.90","0.48","1.45","0.48","1.45","0.97","0.00","0.00","0.48","9.66","3.86","1.93","2.42","1.93","0.48","3.86","8.70","2.42","8.70","0.97","4.35","3.38","5.31","1.45","0.48","2.42","0.00","0.00","0.97","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.00","22.71","8.70","4.35","0.48","0.00","0.97","0.00","1.45","4.35","0.97","0.97","0.48","1076","9.24","16.0","328","205","17","59.19","10.8","8.0","13.85","10.6","65","7.5","19.522926829268293","153","15.23","3","0.38","0","1","3","20","0","23","11","0","1","5","33","37","4","7","0","0","3","2","12","1","0","2","5","0","10","8","6","3","6","4","1","0","0","0"
"http://politicot.com/after-spate-of-acting-out-nation-assures-texas-it-is-very-very-special/","After Spate of Acting Out, Nation Assures Texas It is Very, Very Special","WASHINGTON – After noticing that Texas has been going through a spate of bad behavior that is clearly a sign of wanting adult attention, President Obama let the Lone Star State know that it is very, very special and the US would never forget them or take them for granted.

The signs of trouble began brewing over the summer, when Texas passed a law that would effectively close all but a handful of abortion clinics. The resulting protests from women’s organizations were followed closely by a voter ID law requiring documented proof of any name changes – a burden that many felt was an effort to discourage married women from voting. From there, things got worse. In Dallas, dozens of men brandishing weapons menaced a group of four mothers discussing gun control in a diner. Most recently, a conservative white Republican won a local election in Houston by using a direct mail campaign to mislead African-American voters that he was black.

Speaking from the Rose Garden, President Obama said that while Texas is deep down a good state, it needs to learn how to deal with adversity like a grown up. “I know it’s been a tough time for Texas – what with gay marriage legalized and healthcare and immigration reform gaining steam. My daughter Malia is at the age when is prone to rebel against authority as well. Like I tell her, when things don’t go your way, adults work through their problems. They don’t go around shutting down the government.”

Governor Rick Perry vehemently denied allegations that Texas was “just going through a phase”. Speaking from the steps of the state Capitol, the erstwhile presidential candidate whose campaign was most noteworthy for one of the bigger debate gaffes in recent memory, said “We’re serious! We hate your Big Government, we hate your taxes, and we hate your healthcare.” Stomping his foot for emphasis, the important governor continued, “We want a place where we can hang out with Jesus and hoot people who disagree with us. And if we don’t get what we want – we’re just going to run away and form out own country and it’s going to be awesome. AND YOU CAN’T COME!”

The Governor then ran up to his office and locked the door.

After giving him some time to calm down, the President called Perry and told him that everyone values Texas’ oilfields and their little cowboy outfits and reassured them that everyone thought they were big tough guys and no one would ever, ever mess with them.","2013-11-18 10:39:42","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","421","79.85","92.62","19.84","6.93","22.16","20.43","85.99","48.93","13.30","8.08","0.95","2.61","1.19","1.43","1.90","5.23","7.84","13.78","6.18","3.80","5.70","1.43","16.39","4.75","2.61","2.14","0.95","1.66","6.89","2.38","4.04","0.00","1.43","0.48","14.25","0.95","0.24","1.19","1.90","9.74","2.38","1.66","2.14","1.43","1.90","1.19","2.14","0.48","0.95","0.48","1.19","0.24","0.48","0.48","0.24","12.83","3.33","1.19","6.65","1.43","0.95","4.99","8.55","1.19","14.96","3.80","6.89","4.28","4.51","0.24","0.48","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.24","0.00","13.30","4.04","4.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.24","1.90","2.38","0.00","0.00","1945","8.02","26.875","594","424","19","65.76","11.3","9.6","10.57","12.1","88","17.0","19.221886792452832","271","23.94","10","0.47","0","15","2","38","0","50","34","1","0","4","58","36","0","23","0","0","25","9","16","1","2","6","9","0","16","24","18","7","14","10","2","3","1","5"
"http://politicot.com/gop-demands-war-with-china/","GOP Demands War with China","WASHINGTON – Frustrated by recent near misses at armed conflicts in Syria and Iran, Republican leadership sent the Obama administration a harshly worded statement today, demanding that the President ratchet up the escalating tension between the United States and China and hopefully provoke all-out armed conflict.

Tensions in the Far East escalated last weekend after the Chinese government claimed an Air Defense Identification Zone in the waters of the East China Sea. The zone, which overlaps a similar zone claimed by Japan–including some uninhabited islands—is seen as an attempt by China to increase its influence in the area. With both the US and China conducting operations in the disputed region as a way of testing the others’ resolve, the GOP sees an opportunity for a long awaited war, the third in the last twelve years.

“This president is certainly no stranger when it comes to getting us embroiled in diplomatic adventures,” said Eric Cantor (R-VA), citing the deal brokered this summer to convince Syria to turn over all of its chemical weapons, and this month’s accord that put a temporary freeze on Iran’s nuclear program. “Now it’s time for him to break his habit of ploughshare-rattling and make with the bang-bang. China’s far away; they don’t look like us, and if we win we’d never need to pay back our debt. What more does he need?”

Cantor added that he believed the president is only giving the crisis careful thought and consideration because “he doesn’t want to fight with his fellow Commies.”

In the Senate, John McCain (R-AZ) echoed the need for conflict, calling it a national security issue. “It’s been over a decade since we charged into war with an enemy we don’t understand and goals that are not readily identifiable,” said McCain. With the war in Iraq over, and conflict in Afghanistan winding down, the senator says there are legitimate concerns for America’s fighting preparedness. “How are our servicemen and women ever expected to stay sharp if they are not perpetually in harm’s way?”

McCain also noted that he does not consider the Obama administration’s intervention in last year’s Libiyan civil war as a sufficient example of “keeping the spear sharpened.”

“If we don’t even lose a single troop, it clearly doesn’t count,” stated McCain.","2013-12-02 11:55:14","0","24.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","383","92.05","73.45","23.73","7.60","25.53","24.28","77.55","46.48","9.66","4.96","0.00","2.61","0.00","1.83","0.52","4.70","10.18","14.62","4.70","3.13","5.48","2.61","11.23","3.13","2.09","1.04","0.78","1.83","5.74","2.09","3.66","0.52","2.35","0.52","8.09","0.00","0.26","0.26","2.09","9.66","2.61","1.57","2.35","1.57","1.57","1.83","2.35","0.78","0.78","0.78","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","11.23","2.87","1.57","5.48","1.57","1.31","1.83","8.62","0.78","16.45","1.57","9.92","5.22","3.92","0.26","0.00","0.78","0.00","1.04","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.54","3.39","4.18","0.00","0.26","0.52","0.00","1.31","3.66","4.18","1.04","0.00","1831","9.28","36.18181818181818","582","377","15","54.46","13.6","11.9","12.48","15.1","105","17.166666666666668","23.180583554376657","245","32.18","7","0.46","0","11","0","46","0","50","31","0","0","0","64","44","2","14","0","0","19","6","18","1","0","5","8","0","11","18","12","8","12","12","2","1","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/nra-blames-gta-5-for-d-c-shooting/","NRA Blames ‘GTA 5’ for D.C. Shooting","WASHINGTON — In what has become the latest such tragedy, at least 12 people were killed Monday in a mass shooting that occurred in a D.C. naval office building. The suspect, a former Navy reservist reportedly named Aaron Alexis, was himself shot and killed by law enforcement officials. While Alexis’s motives remain unclear, at least one lobbying group has already decided to apportion blame for the attack. At a press conference Monday night, National Rifle Association executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre took aim at the entertainment industry.

“While our hearts and prayers go out to the victims and their families, we feel it would be remiss not to remind the American people of what it is that makes these catastrophes so commonplace,” said LaPierre. “The lurking variable that leads to the deaths of 87 Americans every day.”

“I am talking, of course, about Grand Theft Auto V.”

According to the LaPierre, Grand Theft Auto V, released Tuesday, and other violent video games were the root cause of violence in American society. LaPierre spoke for 20 minutes about the popular game franchise’s corrosive effects, noting that since the series was first released in 1997, there have been 40 mass shootings in the United States.

“The evidence against Grand Theft Auto is not to be disputed. Clearly, excitement over the imminent release of this game led Mr. Alexis to commit celebratory murders,” said LaPierre. “Either that, or [Alexis] was going on a ‘practice run’ in anticipation of playing this degraded piece of garbage.”

“To point fingers at anything other than Grand Theft Auto V for this tragedy is morally irresponsible,” LaPierre asserted.

The popular video game series has been a target of controversy and criticism since its inception, due to its graphic portrayal of the criminal underworld and violent gameplay, including the ability to murder and carjack civilians and police at will. According to Guinness World Records, it is the most controversial video game series of all-time.

“Were it not for Grand Theft Auto V—released mere hours after this heinous act—12 people would still be alive,” asserted LaPierre. “What will it take for the American people to stand up and say, ‘Enough is enough’? When will the heartless criminals at Rockstar Games be made to answer for these outrages?”

LaPierre also outlined preventative measures he believes could help avert future calamities from occurring.

“If videogames were not so widespread and easy to get your hands on, this horrible act might never have happened,” LaPierre said. “It’s high time Congress and our president backed sensible video game regulation. Anybody that wants to purchase a copy of Grand Theft Auto V must undergo a background check, a psychological evaluation, and a five-day waiting period. Most importantly, all copies of the game must be kept under lock and key when not in use.”

Many NRA members responded warmly to LaPierre’s remarks.

“Many adults leave their video games and consoles lying out in the open where children can find them,” said NRA member Justin Morrow of Harrisburg, Mississippi. “Why, just the other day, I walked into my friend’s living room and his five-year-old was trying to set up the Xbox 360. I couldn’t believe it. Given how many unaccounted-for video games there are lying around, it’s a wonder there aren’t more horrible acts of violence.”

“Thank God the Supreme Court overturned D.C.’s handgun ban in 2008,” Morrow added, “otherwise it would have been even worse.”","2013-09-17 00:06:24","0","46.0","21.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","63.0","31.0","0.0","101.0","1.0","35.0","13","578","85.18","66.73","20.66","12.12","19.27","24.91","76.82","42.21","7.96","2.42","0.69","0.52","0.17","0.52","0.52","5.54","6.40","12.98","7.79","3.63","4.50","1.38","14.01","4.67","1.90","1.38","2.08","3.11","6.57","2.77","3.81","0.35","2.25","0.35","8.30","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.52","10.55","2.25","2.25","1.56","1.90","1.38","2.60","3.46","1.38","1.21","0.87","0.87","0.52","0.35","0.00","0.00","9.69","3.63","1.38","3.81","0.87","0.52","4.84","7.27","1.73","12.63","1.21","6.23","5.19","3.29","3.98","0.35","0.35","0.35","1.04","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.24","5.54","6.06","0.00","0.00","0.35","0.00","0.87","5.19","1.90","0.00","0.35","2798","8.27","25.47826086956522","837","569","32","61.87","11.5","9.1","12.41","11.8","135","7.25","18.610333919156414","343","24.0","15","0.41","0","16","11","47","1","59","45","1","4","11","93","77","2","35","0","0","16","9","19","1","1","4","17","0","22","27","14","13","10","15","4","3","0","6"
"http://politicot.com/louisiana-lt-gov-offers-to-give-duck-dynasty-cast-control-of-the-state-government/","Louisiana Lt. Gov. Offers to Give ‘Duck Dynasty’ Cast Control of the State Government","BATON ROUGE, La. – Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Jay Dardenne today offered to cede control of his state to the cast of “Duck Dynasty,” whom Dardenne called “beacons of hope for Real America” and “more fit to govern than myself or any of my colleagues.”

Dardenne, whose primary concern as lt. governor has been to promote the tourism and film industries in his state, offered control of Louisiana to the “Duck Dynasty” cast—composed largely of the Robertson family—in a letter mailed late last week. In it, Dardenne says that he was “appalled” to hear that the family’s patriarch, Phil Robertson, had been suspended from appearing on the show after he was quoted in GQ equating gay sex to bestiality and making other inflammatory comments about homosexuality and race.

Dardenne wrote that “Duck Dynasty” has been “an important representation of the state of Louisiana.” “It’s a shame that, in America, you can’t say what you want without experiencing this kind of blowback,” Dardenne continued. “But I and millions of others appreciate your views, and believe you represent the values that comprise Real America.”

Indeed, since Robertson’s suspension, hundreds of thousands of Americans have joined groups formed to protest the decision and support Robertson—such as IStandWithPhil.com—and the 67-yeard old has received public support from figures such as Bristol Palin, Gov. Bobby Jindal and the Westboro Baptist Church.

Dardenne also pledged that, if A&E decides to cancel “Duck Dynasty” altogether, he would use the power of his office to ensure that the show stays on the air.

“However, if you’re sick of being in show business—and who would blame you, after this ordeal?—I’d like to officially invite you to take control of the Louisiana state government,” Dardenne wrote. “You and your kin built a juggernaut of a business, starred in an incredibly popular show, and show a deep respect for the Bible, even its ‘politically incorrect’ parts. All of this makes you the perfect family to guide Louisiana.”

Since the contents of his letter became public, Dardenne has been forced to explain his unorthodox offer, and over the weekend he attempted to persuade the public that letting the Robertson family preside over the state would solve a “major problem in America right now.”

“Look at it this way,” Dardenne told reporters Sunday afternoon. “If Phil Robertson is given control of Louisiana, then his views on homosexuality and race will actually be important, and everyone on Facebook can rest easy that they haven’t spent the last week ranting and arguing over something that doesn’t matter, at all.”","2013-12-22 20:54:47","0","25.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","429","87.45","84.20","5.97","42.70","25.24","27.74","76.46","46.85","11.89","5.83","0.93","0.00","2.33","2.33","0.23","6.06","7.46","15.15","5.83","2.10","6.29","0.93","11.66","3.50","1.86","0.93","0.93","1.17","4.20","2.56","1.63","0.23","0.70","0.00","12.59","0.93","0.23","0.00","2.56","11.19","2.10","2.56","2.10","2.10","1.40","3.03","3.03","2.10","0.70","0.00","1.40","0.00","0.47","0.93","0.00","8.39","2.10","0.47","4.90","0.70","0.47","3.73","7.46","0.70","10.02","0.47","5.83","4.20","3.50","1.40","0.70","0.70","0.70","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","20.75","4.20","6.53","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.23","7.23","2.10","0.00","0.23","2090","8.59","39.81818181818182","662","422","19","48.94","13.4","11.9","12.94","14.2","103","8.2","20.643033175355452","243","32.82","7","0.45","0","18","1","39","0","60","22","1","0","6","70","58","1","16","0","1","19","10","14","0","0","1","15","0","21","19","7","13","9","10","3","3","1","0"
"http://politicot.com/fbi-director-confirms-presence-of-drones-in-us-warns-against-sudden-movements/","FBI Director Confirms Presence of Drones in US, Warns Against Sudden Movements","WASHINGTON — The FBI uses drones for domestic surveillance purposes, the head of the agency told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, and citizens are strongly advised not to do anything that could be perceived as hostile toward them.

Asked by Sen. Chuck Grassely, “Does the FBI use drones for surveillance on U.S. soil?” FBI Director Robert Mueller responded, “Yes.”

“Follow-up question: Do we have anything to fear from these drones?”

“No, senator,” said Mueller. “We have everything to fear.”

The head of the FBI proceeded to warn every living person that, when they are not safely under a roof of some sort, they should “walk calmly. Don’t run. Don’t jump around. Just get to where you’re going. And please, for the sake of Christ, don’t have a beard.”

In his testimony, FBI spokesman Paul Bresson recounted how the FBI used a drone to help law enforcement amid a standoff and hostage situation in Alabama in January.

Said Bresson, “The situation was resolved peacefully and we feel the drone was a vital part of that success. The fact that it began acting of its own accord and hunted down seven police officers afterwards is irrelevant to what we’re discussing today, which is security.”

When questioned by Sen. Al Franken if he thinks the agency would consider greater transparency about its surveillance methods, Mueller was hesitant to concede any ground. “There is a price to be paid for that transparency,” he said. “I certainly think it would be educating our adversaries as to what our capabilities are.”

Outraged, Franken abruptly rose from his chair to address the director. A look of panic appearing on his face, Mueller slowly, quietly gestured to Franken that, for his own sake, he should probably sit back down.","2013-06-24 10:12:54","0","34.0","12.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","57.0","31.0","0.0","87.0","1.0","35.0","10","292","80.98","83.98","4.19","37.91","13.90","23.97","80.14","48.97","11.99","6.16","0.34","2.05","0.34","2.40","1.03","5.82","7.19","15.07","9.25","3.42","3.77","2.05","18.15","1.03","1.03","2.40","0.34","1.37","6.51","3.42","2.74","1.37","0.68","0.00","10.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.40","11.30","2.74","1.71","2.05","3.77","1.37","1.03","3.08","0.68","1.71","0.34","2.05","1.37","0.68","0.00","0.00","9.59","2.40","1.37","4.45","0.68","1.37","4.45","11.64","0.34","10.96","2.40","5.48","3.77","3.08","0.00","0.68","0.68","0.34","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.00","23.29","7.19","6.85","0.34","0.00","0.68","0.00","0.34","6.16","1.71","0.00","0.00","1378","7.88","24.833333333333332","415","292","20","73.58","11.1","6.6","11.19","9.5","65","4.6875","16.7441095890411","190","23.17","11","0.48","0","5","1","26","0","34","7","1","0","5","52","40","0","10","0","0","14","8","14","0","0","2","12","0","15","13","5","8","10","7","2","2","0","4"
"http://politicot.com/u-s-afghan-security-pact-allows-afghan-civilians-to-search-us-military-bases/","U.S.-Afghan Security Pact Allows Afghan Civilians To Search US Military Bases","KABUL, Afghanistan — More than 50,000 U.S. troops still deployed in Afghanistan will face a dangerous new challenge after officials in Washington caved on a provision in the new U.S.-Afghan security pact that allows Afghan civilians to search U.S. military bases.

The provision is a compromise in the long-delayed Bilateral Security Agreement that sets the terms for how U.S. forces will operate after the drawdown of troops in 2014.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai had rejected previous iterations of the BSA over the enter-and-search policy that permits foreign troops to enter the homes of Afghan civilians. Karzai was insistent that it is only fair if enter-and-search work both ways.

“We are only asking for transparency from both sides,” stated Karzai. “Innocent Afghan people have been forced to open their homes to U.S. troops, and they should have a right to inspect U.S. military bases so that their families can also feel safe.”

Afghans have grown to fear and distrust foreign troops after a spate of violent incidents, including the February 2012 accidental burning of hundreds of copies of the Quran and a March 2012 mass shooting by a U.S. soldier in southern Afghanistan that killed 16 people.

“The Afghan people have finally realized that this is their country. It doesn’t belong to America or Russia or NATO,” declared one senior Afghan official. “If outside forces want to claim they are here to help, then they shouldn’t have a problem with peaceful Afghans poking around.”

Only specially trained Afghan civilians will be allowed to enter U.S. compounds, and never without fair warning. Still, military commanders say the new provision is bad for morale, not to mention extremely dangerous.

Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. said the compromise “practically asks suicide bombers to wipe their feet at the front door.”

“Not only will it make our servicemen and women feel like uninvited guests, but it will also place them at an extremely elevated risk of attack.”

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the security compromise is a result of “mistakes” by American forces and urged U.S. commanders “to make the most of this unfortunate detail.”

“Remember, they still need us more than we need them. As long as our boys aren’t doing anything they aren’t supposed to, these inspections should be fine,” Sec. Kerry declared.

“That being said, they might want to consider leaving their body armor on at night.”","2013-11-20 12:19:02","0","29.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","404","82.94","67.20","13.41","15.35","18.36","23.02","76.73","45.05","8.42","4.46","0.00","1.24","0.00","0.00","3.22","3.96","6.44","14.11","7.92","4.46","4.95","1.98","13.61","5.20","2.72","0.25","1.98","1.24","6.19","2.72","3.47","0.50","0.99","0.25","8.17","0.25","0.25","0.25","0.25","11.14","1.24","2.72","2.72","2.23","0.74","2.97","2.48","0.74","0.99","0.74","0.99","0.74","0.25","0.00","0.00","12.38","3.96","0.50","5.45","0.00","2.72","2.72","8.66","1.73","12.87","1.49","6.68","4.46","1.98","0.25","0.99","0.00","0.25","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.53","10.40","3.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.49","4.95","0.99","0.00","0.00","1939","7.73","29.857142857142858","577","398","26","72.87","11.3","6.9","12.0","10.5","84","5.857142857142857","16.562211055276382","235","25.21","24","0.44","0","11","7","32","0","46","33","2","1","9","39","62","2","40","0","0","15","7","21","0","0","0","15","0","22","11","6","9","14","10","3","0","0","1"

"http://politicot.com/victory-over-thanksgiving-proves-power-of-bi-partisanship/","Victory Over Thanksgiving Proves Power of Bi-Partisanship","WASHINGTON – Bucking the recent trend of partisan rancor, both liberals and conservatives are celebrating the fact that the War on Thanksgiving is “proceeding wonderfully” and nearing completion. With fewer Americans travelling to be with loved ones this year and Black Fridays sales starting earlier than ever, the fourth Thursday in November is nearing the end of its transformation from a day of giving thanks to an orgy of rapacious consumerism.

“Compared with other major holidays, Thanksgiving was just not pulling its weight,” said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon. “There was comparably little revenue generated, and nothing controversial to get people up in arms.” This prompted Wal-Mart to start a campaign to replace the holiday with something that would generate more passion and revenues. It found allies from across the political spectrum.

“To be honest, the reason Thanksgiving was worthless was because it was so vague,” said Fox News host and murder–phile author Bill O’Reilly. “Giving thanks is a fine idea – but to whom? It should be God, but it’s so open ended you could project anyone in there. Or no one. Not really the wedge issue one expects from a holiday.” O’Reilly did note that the end of Thanksgiving will allow for more time to be dedicated to the War on Christmas. “Now that’s a war that’s great for business,” he said.

The vanquishing also has its supporters amongst the liberal elite. Taking a break from stalking corporate CEO’s to ambush them with accusations of union busting, filmmaker Michael Moore told reporters that the War on Thanksgiving played perfectly into the liberal agenda. “It was just a speed bump in between our annual pagan rite of Halloween and the War on Christmas – which is very real and organized, I might add. Not having this day of warmth and family will free up resources for achieving our real goal – getting God out of every single facet of every American’s life.”

“Keep Christ out of Christmas,” he added.

Not everyone is happy about the recent turn of events, however. Butterball CEO Ron Brenneman said that while he was happy to do his part by concocting a scheme to cut the availability of turkeys by almost 50% — a move aimed at getting people away from dinner tables and into stores – it will affect his bottom line. “We’re happy to take one for Team Consumption, but we expect to have this made up to us on the back end.” Brenneman suggested that turkeys be introduced into nativity scenes or given as gifts at Christmas to help make up for the drop in sales.

Experts say the War on Thanksgiving has been the most effective holiday obliteration since Columbus Day was relegated from “parade worthy” to “afterthought.”","2013-11-27 09:53:10","0","24.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","50.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","456","90.70","64.55","23.51","63.19","19.83","21.49","83.11","48.25","8.77","2.85","0.22","1.10","0.22","1.10","0.22","5.92","7.02","17.11","7.89","3.29","4.82","1.32","14.91","5.48","2.63","0.44","1.32","2.41","5.92","3.95","1.97","0.00","1.54","0.22","6.80","0.22","0.00","0.00","1.10","9.65","1.10","2.19","1.10","1.75","1.54","2.85","1.97","0.22","1.10","0.44","1.75","0.22","0.22","0.44","0.66","10.09","2.63","1.32","5.26","2.41","0.00","5.04","7.02","1.32","14.69","1.10","7.02","6.58","3.07","1.97","0.22","1.97","1.97","1.54","0.66","0.00","0.66","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.35","4.82","3.07","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.44","4.82","1.75","0.00","0.22","2148","7.87","24.31578947368421","676","457","23","59.74","12.1","9.9","11.08","11.5","94","12.875","18.187571115973743","279","22.47","7","0.46","0","15","4","40","0","63","30","3","0","7","68","51","0","25","1","0","15","7","19","1","1","4","17","0","23","20","16","10","5","11","3","1","0","0"
"http://politicot.com/fox-news-host-misses-memo-defends-obamacare/","Fox News Host Misses Memo, Defends Obamacare","NEW YORK – Fox News executives were shocked this week when On The Record host Greta Van Sustern defended Obamacare on her Fox News program by blasting holes in an anti-Obamacare story.

“I was just sitting down for dinner when I received a frantic text telling me to turn on the network,” said Roger Ailes, President of Fox News Channel. “So I grab the remote and see Greta telling some woman that Obamacare wasn’t as bad as the woman was making it out to be. I nearly chocked on my foie gras.”

The woman in question, 56-year-old Florida resident Dianne Barrette, had been the subject of a CBS News segment where she lamented that because of Obamacare, she would go from paying $54 a month of health insurance to $591. Van Sustern then invited her onto her Fox News program and all Hell broke loose.

While her bosses sat in front of the monitors, stunned, Van Sustern proceeded to practice legitimate journalism by tearing Barrette’s story apart. “As soon as Greta started in on Ms. Barrette I was wildly waving my hands over my head to get her attention,” said On the Record Associate Producer Samantha Del Priore. “I was like, oh Christ, I never showed her that inter-office memo ordering us to trash Obamacare at every turn. But honestly, I’d figured that was obvious.”

As her producers went into damage control mode, Van Sustern proceeded to show the many holes in Barrette;s story. These included the fact that the $591 plan was only one of many Barrette has to choose from, the fact that due to her age and income, she would end up paying only $209 a month, and the fact that her current plan was classified by Consumer Reports as “junk health insurance.” In fact, even the company selling the plan recommends customers purchase additional insurance.

“I can’t believe I made such a stupid mistake,” lamented Van Sustern. “I’ve been at Fox long enough, I know the drill. But I couldn’t help myself. I mean the old policy she was crying over sounded like something she’d bought in a back alley from some guy smelling of cheap gin.”

On the program, Van Sustern did not mince words, saying, “Your $54 a month policy is a pretty, you know, bare bones policy. Why do you want to keep that one, except for the price? Maybe you can get something better with a subsidy?”

Hearing this, Ailes was incensed. “She actually told that woman to get help from a government subsidy! On Fox News! I’m going to kill her!”

Not content, Van Sustern went on to point out that Barrettes’s old policy did not cover hospital stays, saying, “You know, if you are walking across the street and someone runs a red light, you are in deep trouble under your existing policy.”

Following her interview with Van Susteren, Barrette’s scheduled morning appearance the next day on Fox News was cancelled.

After the fallout from her interview, Van Sustern was called in to Ailes’ office. She then opened her next show with a lengthy segment explaining how Obamacare forces children to kill their puppies.","2013-10-31 09:37:56","0","29.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","65.0","1.0","35.0","4","528","84.25","70.22","38.95","5.53","18.86","21.21","79.17","45.27","12.69","9.47","3.79","0.19","1.52","3.79","0.19","3.22","6.63","14.39","6.06","3.22","4.17","1.33","13.83","3.22","1.89","0.95","1.52","1.52","3.22","0.57","2.46","0.19","0.76","0.38","10.98","0.00","0.19","4.55","0.19","9.85","1.89","1.89","1.14","1.89","1.52","2.08","3.22","1.33","1.14","0.57","1.33","0.57","0.57","0.00","0.19","6.44","0.76","0.95","3.98","0.76","0.57","5.87","5.30","1.33","16.48","2.08","8.90","6.06","5.49","0.19","0.19","2.46","0.38","0.38","0.38","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","19.32","4.55","6.06","0.00","0.19","0.38","0.57","0.76","3.79","2.08","0.00","0.95","2345","7.52","25.61904761904762","711","524","29","70.02","10.2","8.0","9.74","9.8","99","8.9","16.797251908396948","286","23.29","18","0.44","0","7","8","43","0","65","26","0","0","4","90","70","0","13","1","0","35","16","24","1","0","3","15","0","20","38","20","10","14","8","2","0","0","5"
"http://politicot.com/catholic-church-outsourcing-same-sex-marriage-fight-to-top-ad-agency/","Catholic Church Outsourcing Same-Sex Marriage Fight to Top Ad Agency","NEW YORK — New York’s influential Cardinal Timothy Dolan said the Catholic Church is enlisting some outside help for its culture war on same-sex marriage.

In an interview with “Meet the Press” that aired Sunday, Dolan reiterated his stance on the divisive issue and claimed that the church has “been outmarketed.”

Dolan announced that the Archdiocese of New York would begin consulting with top Manhattan-based ad agency Merkin Strategies counter the growing support of same-sex marriage and “style the Church’s image and curb backlash on divisive issues like gay marriage and abortion.”

“When you have forces like Hollywood, when you have forces like politicians, when you have forces like some opinion-molders that are behind it, it’s a tough battle,” Dolan said of the Church’s same-sex marriage conflict.

Dolan said that the church would utilize “modern strategies to combat modern problems. “Our goal is to maintain our position against homosexuality and sin, but at the same time welcome all people into the church. Keep in mind, we believe in miracles, so that’s not as impossible as it sounds.”

“We’ve been caricatured as being anti-gay,” lamented Dolan. “We don’t want a caricature; the Church’s message should be like a lush oil-painting—anti-gay or not.”

Dolan told moderator David Gregory that the Church “often has difficulty promoting values that originate with God while at the same time maintaining a welcoming, Christ-like image.”

“We get backlash from those who think we are too gracious and compassionate and loving and accepting of gays, and then we get backlash from gay people who feel that we are not tolerant enough of them,” said Dolan.

The high-profile partnership with Merkin is another indicator of Catholic Church’s increasing reliance on outside firms to handle sensitive issues. In November, an office of the Vatican’s central bureaucracy hired accounting firm EY (formerly known as Ernst & Young) to audit the finances of the Vatican City State administration.

Dolan said that outside help from marketing and public relations experts would clarify the Church’s position on same-sex marriage, which has been murky ever since newly elected Pope Francis scolded Catholic leaders for being “obsessed” with issues like same-sex marriage and abortion.

“We can’t please everybody and God at the same time, but advertising doesn’t rival religion as the world’s largest industry for no reason,” said Dolan.","2013-12-02 21:52:10","0","29.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","65.0","1.0","35.0","4","394","86.08","87.33","12.90","44.34","26.27","26.40","81.47","42.89","8.88","3.81","0.00","2.54","0.76","0.25","0.25","5.08","6.85","13.71","6.85","1.78","6.60","1.78","12.18","8.12","5.84","1.52","0.00","1.02","4.31","2.54","1.52","0.25","0.51","0.00","11.93","1.52","0.25","0.00","0.25","9.14","2.03","1.78","1.78","1.27","0.76","2.03","3.05","0.51","1.78","0.51","3.30","0.00","0.51","3.30","0.00","15.48","9.14","1.52","4.57","1.02","0.76","3.55","7.11","0.25","12.18","0.51","6.09","5.58","3.81","0.00","0.00","1.02","5.33","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.32","3.81","4.06","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","3.05","5.84","3.55","0.51","0.25","1961","8.83","40.8","581","382","15","54.05","13.8","12.1","14.39","16.8","95","12.625","22.14764397905759","222","33.3","3","0.43","0","15","0","33","0","54","39","0","1","5","74","51","1","20","0","0","15","4","12","0","0","0","4","0","11","15","10","10","16","9","4","2","0","3"
"http://politicot.com/number-of-nsa-applicants-doubles-following-porn-disclosure/","Number of NSA Applicants Doubles Following Porn Disclosure","WASHINGTON — The National Security Agency disclosed Friday a 200% surge in employment applications over the previous 48 hours, but refused to comment on whether this renewed interest was connected to the revelation that the spy agency has been monitoring the pornographic viewing history of radicals in an attempt to humiliate and discredit them.

Citing documents provided by former N.S.A. contractor Edward Snowden, the Huffington Post revealed Wednesday the N.S.A.’s plan to harm the reputations of those whom the agency believes are radicalizing others through incendiary speeches and rhetoric. The document proposes that six redacted targets, all Muslim, would be discredited by revelations that they viewed sexually explicit material online. None of the six individuals is accused in the document of being involved in terror plots.

The embattled intelligence agency has faced criticism and scrutiny over its spying methods in the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks. While an N.S.A. spokesperson refused comment on a possible link between this most recent disclosure and increased interest in working for the espionage giant, the application swell should come as a relief to intelligence officials..

“While the agency has seen a dip in applications over the last six months, over the last 48 hours, we’ve more than made up for the lost numbers, and are on pace to exceed our recruitment target for the year,” N.S.A. spokesperson Vanee Vines told reporters. “Unfortunately, from what we’re seeing, a large number of the applicants are already disqualified by virtue of their criminal record,” adding that an equally large number were “already under surveillance by one or more of our sister agencies.”

It remains speculative if the pornography revelations and employment applications are connected, but reporters managed to catch up with one applicant who spoke of his sense of duty.

“I’ve always wanted to serve my country, and I think I have a particular set of skills that the N.S.A. would be very interested,” said one recent N.S.A. applicant whose name was withheld for security reasons, adding that he feels he is “uniquely qualified” to engage in the data collection and surveillance that is the N.S.A.’s purview. “I think the government really needs me out there, monitoring the dirty things the bad men get up to.”

Vines also dismissed accusations of a connection between the pornography exposé and a fall report noting that several N.S.A. employees illegally used the agency’s surveillance powers to snoop on their love interests.

“Those incidents were rogue perverts who overstepped their authority,” insisted Vines. “This was a textbook case of our dedicated agents keeping tabs on somebody’s pornography collection. Two completely unrelated occurrences.”","2013-12-03 11:52:14","0","25.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","449","96.24","71.87","20.41","41.90","21.38","29.18","77.51","44.99","9.35","4.23","1.34","1.11","0.00","0.67","1.11","5.12","11.58","13.59","5.57","1.56","4.01","0.22","10.47","3.56","2.23","1.34","2.23","2.00","4.45","2.67","1.78","0.45","0.45","0.22","8.02","0.22","0.00","0.22","0.89","8.02","3.12","0.67","1.34","1.11","0.89","1.78","2.45","0.89","1.11","0.22","1.78","0.22","0.00","1.34","0.00","8.46","1.56","1.11","4.68","0.67","0.67","5.35","4.90","0.22","11.80","0.89","6.46","4.23","6.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.26","8.91","4.01","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.56","1.56","0.00","0.22","2248","9.25","25.22222222222222","714","432","22","43.12","14.3","12.1","14.27","14.0","127","10.7","21.59925925925926","263","22.39","29","0.46","0","12","10","50","0","59","26","2","0","3","75","40","0","37","0","0","12","9","13","0","1","2","11","0","13","20","13","16","12","11","1","4","1","0"
"http://politicot.com/birthers-claim-obama-children-fathered-by-rev-wright/","Birthers Claim Obama Children Fathered by Rev. Wright","CHICAGO – The conservative organization Fellowship of the Mind last week came forward with a shocking accusation questioning the legitimacy of Sasha and Malia Obama. Based on investigative techniques consisting of searching everything from Google Images to Ancestry.com to GenealogyBank.com, the site concludes that the two girls are not the children of Barack and Michelle Obama. After dropping that bombshell, they go on to state unequivocally that the real father is Reverend Jeremiah Wright.

“If anyone can find baby pictures and birth records of Malia Obama and/or Natasha Obama, please let me know!” wrote Dr. Eowyn, a featured author on the site. “Also, if anyone can vouch for Reverend Wright’s whereabouts during the time frame when conception would have occurred, please share. I think we’ve got him this time!”

Though Dr. Eowyn was unable to find any pictures of the alleged Obama girls before the ages of 6 and 9, the site’s readers posted some younger photos. However, members of The Fellowship of the Mind were not convinced. “I noticed that Michelle’s hair looks cut off on the right side, commented Lindarm. “It’s a bad cropping job, and Barack’s head looks photo-shopped in as well. I don’t think the two girls, or Michelle, or Barack are in the same picture at all. How amateurish. Whose kids are they really?”

“We all know that Barry is gay and could not possibly have fathered those girls,” continued Dr. Eowyn in an update. “The only explanation is that Michelle had an affair with Reverend Wright. Twice. It is a cover-up. Why else didn’t Dear Leader throw Wright under the bus back in 2008? He was afraid of what the god Reverend would reveal!”

The final proof that the long-time Obama confidant is the real father of Natasha and Malia is given in another photo of the girls ages 4 and 1, sitting in an unidentified man’s lap. “Whose hairy arm is that behind the girls?” asks Dr. Eowyn. “It’s obviously not Barry’s arm. It’s got to be Wright! This is huge!”","2013-12-02 21:36:18","1","24.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","67.0","1.0","35.0","5","343","81.65","63.69","38.46","30.71","13.19","18.66","76.38","46.36","9.33","2.92","1.17","0.58","0.00","0.58","0.58","6.41","9.33","11.66","9.04","2.92","5.83","1.75","14.29","2.62","1.46","1.75","2.33","1.46","2.62","1.46","1.17","0.29","0.00","0.00","9.91","1.17","0.58","1.75","1.75","12.24","3.50","0.87","1.46","3.21","1.46","4.08","3.50","3.21","0.00","0.29","1.46","1.17","0.00","0.29","0.00","5.54","2.33","0.58","2.04","0.58","0.29","3.79","9.33","0.00","12.54","1.17","7.00","5.25","1.46","0.29","0.00","0.58","0.29","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.00","22.45","7.00","4.08","0.00","0.00","0.87","1.46","0.87","4.37","3.50","0.00","0.29","1565","7.39","16.904761904761905","469","338","29","76.52","8.5","5.5","9.84","7.4","68","5.9375","14.72733727810651","200","15.67","4","0.45","0","12","7","41","0","42","21","1","0","5","47","56","0","18","0","0","15","0","15","0","0","2","5","0","10","19","6","5","12","13","0","1","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/congress-thankful-for-all-the-work-they-didnt-do-this-year/","Congress Thankful for All the Work They Didn’t Do this Year","WASHINGTON – As Thanksgiving approaches, many leading members of Congress are describing the things they are most grateful for this year. Along with God and family, many lawmakers say they’re particularly grateful for all the hard work they can look forward to doing in 2014, since, in the words of House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, they “haven’t done much of anything this year.”

“2013 has been a remarkable year,” said House Representative Eliot Engel (D-NY). “Take just one example: There have been over 20 mass shootings since January 1, and yet, incredibly, we haven’t even begun to discuss legislation to address gun violence. It’s hard to believe, but we’re just really happy, because at least we’ll have plenty to do next year!”

Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) echoed Engel’s statements, adding that he’s grateful for all the free time he’s had over the past 11 months. “Running for Vice President was exhausting, so it’s been nice to have so much free time this year to work on my abs,” Ryan said. “It’s true that this has been one of the least productive Congresses in modern history, but that means there’s nowhere to go but up.”

While unemployment continues to hover above seven percent, some members of Congress say that, after this year, they’re grateful that they can “really empathize with Americans who are out of work.”

“Technically, we as congressmen are employed,” said Representative Michael McCaul (R-Texas). “But we’ve done so little work recently that most of us feel like we’re jobless, so we can totally understand what the unemployed are going through—and that’s the first step to finally fixing America’s broken labor market.”

Many House Representatives also admitted that they’re very grateful that they failed to pass any laws that meaningfully address immigration this year, despite the fact that Americans overwhelmingly support the various reform ideas offered by both parties. “Yes, we have a big immigration problem, and we haven’t done a thing to fix it,” said Sanford Bishop (D-GA). “But mine is the best looking lawn on the block right now, and I think 2014 will be a great time to dig in on this issue.”

Although most lawmakers said they believe that next year will be productive, several admitted that they don’t plan on doing much work then, either. “Listen, we can’t set the bar too high,” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. “As long as we get some significant redistricting done in 2014, it’ll be a proud year, in my book.”","2013-11-26 10:13:17","0","24.0","7.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","418","53.21","77.08","51.95","70.76","23.22","19.86","86.12","48.33","13.16","5.98","0.96","2.87","0.00","0.48","1.67","7.18","4.31","12.92","11.96","4.55","5.50","1.44","18.18","6.70","3.59","0.48","2.63","5.74","4.78","3.59","1.20","0.24","0.00","0.48","10.29","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.48","11.00","2.63","1.44","0.24","1.67","1.67","3.35","3.59","0.48","2.39","0.72","0.72","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.24","12.20","4.07","2.87","4.78","1.44","0.48","4.78","13.88","1.67","15.07","1.91","5.98","7.66","6.22","1.20","1.67","0.72","0.48","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.48","0.24","0.00","0.00","26.08","4.07","7.66","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.96","5.74","5.26","1.91","0.00","1948","7.79","40.0","593","414","18","65.05","12.6","9.9","12.02","13.6","79","12.875","18.832850241545895","240","35.09","8","0.48","0","10","10","30","0","55","39","0","5","6","44","46","2","14","2","0","30","2","28","0","1","0","13","0","24","16","11","12","27","8","1","2","0","0"

But while the vast majority of Americans agree that they find the prospect of a nuclear North Korea with long-range rocket capabilities harrowing, many just can’t resist Supreme Leader Kim Jung-un’s doughy, rollie pollie cheeks.

“The idea of a nuclear North Korea with advanced weaponry is terrifying. There’s no predicting what Kim Jong-un might do with long-range rockets and nukes. But when I see him walk on stage all chubby and cute, I just want to go to town on those cheeks like a Jewish grandmother at a Bar Mitzvah,” said 27-year-old Joan Davis, before trailing off and making unintelligible baby-talk noises.

“I find his regime disgusting, but I find his perpetual schoolboy-on-picture-day look to be a real treat,” agreed 43-year-old Alan Davies, a tax attorney and father of two.

Even outgoing Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has stated that while Kim Jung-un has made it clear that under his regime will be no kinder or gentler than Kim Jong-il’s, there are times he can’t help but finding their new Supreme Leader flat-out adorable.

“North Korea’s actions over the last week serve as proof that Kim Jung-un is every bit as ruthless and untrustworthy as his father,” said Panetta. “Still, something about that ‘Little Rascals’ haircut and puppy dog face make me think, man, he can’t be all bad.”","2013-01-28 10:49:50","1","23.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","10.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","59.0","1.0","35.0","4","265","77.74","50.00","58.33","32.24","29.44","17.74","78.11","40.75","8.68","5.28","1.89","0.00","0.00","2.64","0.75","3.40","5.28","11.32","5.28","3.40","7.17","1.89","11.32","6.79","3.40","1.13","1.13","2.64","6.42","3.40","3.02","1.13","1.13","0.00","8.30","1.51","0.00","0.38","4.15","11.32","2.26","1.13","0.38","1.51","1.89","4.53","3.02","1.51","1.13","0.00","1.89","1.51","0.00","0.00","0.38","4.91","0.75","1.51","3.02","0.38","1.13","1.51","9.81","1.89","16.60","1.89","8.68","6.04","1.51","0.38","0.00","0.38","0.75","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","21.89","3.40","5.66","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.04","3.40","3.40","0.00","0.00","1209","8.3","30.333333333333332","359","250","9","60.18","12.5","11.8","12.6","16.5","52","11.0","21.44","183","28.33","5","0.4","0","12","3","21","0","32","26","0","1","6","51","34","2","8","0","0","10","5","5","0","0","2","3","0","12","6","8","3","10","9","0","1","0","1"
"http://politicot.com/obama-secretly-asked-kenyan-uncle-to-self-deport/","Obama Secretly Asked Kenyan Uncle to Self-Deport","WASHINGTON — President Obama’s domestic policy has been met with frustration from his own base, even as he attempts to pivot away from healthcare-related distractions and towards comprehensive immigration reform. Now he is faced with the uncomfortable task of telling his Kenyan uncle that he cannot stay at the White House over the Christmas holiday.

Onyango Okech Obama, the president’s uncle, indicated that “Barry owed me one for allowing him to crash at my place in Cambridge for a few weeks in the ‘80s while he was waiting to move into his own apartment.”

So Onyango Okech Obama was dumbfounded when he received a curt request from White House Press Secretary Jay Carney to “politely self-deport back to Kenya so as not to create yet another headache for B.O.”

The president’s uncle had been living illegally in the United States over the past five decades until last week, when he was granted permission to stay with a green card.

The White House has already been forced to retract a 2011 statement indicating that the two had never met, though Carney still claims that the President had “absolutely zero” participation in his uncle’s deportation case.

Noted presidential historian Newt Gingrich suggested that the first family was likely worried about having the president’s uncle in residence for a number of reasons.”

“Birthers would latch onto the Kenyan connection and his own party might claim the president had granted a free pass to his relative when his administration has deported more immigrants annually than that of George W. Bush,” said Gingrich. “But I suspect his uncle’s heavy drinking put the kibosh on the visit.”

Onyango Okech Obama had been arrested on drunk driving charges in 2011, which brought him to the attention of immigration officials. But it was his overly potent rum cake that caught the first lady’s attention when she received it as an offering to apologize for a lackluster Christmas gift.

An anonymous White House official told Politico that the first lady considered her husband’s uncle a bad influence on the Obama girls. “Last time they had him over for Christmas, he re-gifted a bust of the 16th president that he obviously took from the Lincoln bedroom,” said the highly-ranking source. “Michelle awkwardly accepted the gift, which she promptly returned to the bedroom only to find an empty bottle of Changaa,” an alcoholic drink popular in Kenya.

“Still, the family realizes this is a sensitive issue, so they’re not going to round him up and forcibly deport him. Like with healthcare, they decided to adopt Romney’s policy instead when it came to urging Onyango back to Kenya.”","2013-12-11 10:57:42","0","27.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","440","90.06","85.21","18.77","29.57","25.88","24.09","79.32","46.59","10.45","6.82","0.68","0.00","0.00","5.68","0.45","3.64","9.32","14.55","5.68","5.00","4.32","0.91","11.59","4.32","1.36","1.59","2.05","0.68","2.73","1.36","1.14","0.45","0.23","0.23","13.86","2.27","0.00","1.36","6.82","7.27","2.95","1.36","0.23","0.45","0.68","1.82","2.27","1.36","0.45","0.68","1.82","0.00","0.68","0.00","1.36","8.64","1.36","1.36","5.45","0.23","0.23","6.59","3.18","0.45","16.14","3.18","6.14","7.95","2.95","2.05","2.50","0.45","0.68","0.00","0.68","0.00","0.45","0.23","0.00","0.00","14.55","4.09","3.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.91","4.09","2.27","0.00","0.00","2128","8.56","37.5","661","436","17","53.95","14.3","12.1","12.42","15.3","101","13.0","21.506055045871562","250","32.83","5","0.45","0","5","8","44","0","54","30","1","0","2","75","54","1","9","0","0","23","11","25","0","0","2","17","0","14","31","8","16","3","9","3","0","0","5"
"http://politicot.com/popes-foot-fetish-leaves-traditionalists-weary-liberals-delighted/","Pope's Foot Fetish Leaves Traditionalists Weary, Liberals Delighted","VATICAN CITY — Last month’s election of Pope Francis, a celebrated advocate for the poor in his native Argentina, has been met with acclaim by those hoping for change in the Roman Catholic Church. And now, following a visit to a youth detention center during which he washed the feet of two young women, progressive Catholics are viewing his open display of foot-fetishism as a brave step towards the sexual liberation of Catholicism, while traditionalists are becoming gravely concerned about the direction of the Church.

Justin Jones, a 44-year-old construction worker from Long Island, praised the Pope for his open attitude.

“For too long, the Catholic Church has held archaic, irresponsible views on sex. But Pope Francis is a breath of fresh air. It’s nice to know that despite being the most powerful holy leader in the world, he too has kinky, unusual sexual proclivities just like you and I,” said Jones. “And it’s beautiful that he’s comfortable enough with himself to be open about it.”

New York Jets Head Coach and fellow foot fetishist Rex Ryan has also praised Pope Francis for his openness, noting that harboring a sexual attraction to feet is nothing to be ashamed of.

“I mean, the way the toes wiggle. The way they flop around in sandals…They’re clearly the sexiest part of a woman’s body,” said Ryan. “Toes, nails, heels, ankles, arches, man oh man. Call em’ whatever you want. Tootsies, paws… Wait, what was the question again?”

However, Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellett was quick to voice his displeasure with the Pope.

“With all due respect to the Holy Father, his actions last week completely undermine the Church’s well-established position that sex is shameful and should take place joylessly in the missionary position,” said Ouellett. “Washing the feet of young girls is unacceptable behavior for a pontiff, regardless of how sexy those feet may be.”","2013-04-03 10:30:18","0","26.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","63.0","1.0","35.0","5","315","91.15","81.29","9.17","73.23","19.69","23.17","85.71","44.13","8.57","4.76","0.63","0.00","0.63","3.17","0.32","3.81","9.21","13.65","7.62","4.44","3.49","0.32","13.33","4.76","1.27","1.27","0.63","0.95","6.03","4.13","1.59","0.63","0.00","0.32","10.16","0.32","0.32","0.95","4.44","6.67","1.59","0.63","1.59","1.27","1.27","0.95","2.54","1.27","1.27","0.00","7.62","4.13","0.63","2.86","0.00","6.35","2.22","2.22","2.86","0.32","0.00","2.86","8.25","0.63","14.60","1.90","7.30","5.40","0.95","0.63","0.00","0.32","5.40","0.32","0.95","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.63","0.00","21.59","5.40","8.25","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.00","1.27","3.81","2.54","0.00","0.00","1496","8.05","23.0","443","311","16","68.7","12.3","8.5","12.13","12.2","68","16.166666666666668","18.505980707395498","208","21.0","4","0.42","0","6","2","32","0","41","34","0","1","2","47","41","1","16","0","0","13","6","14","0","1","1","7","0","6","8","8","8","9","14","3","0","0","1"

"http://politicot.com/mccain-warns-gays-could-take-your-jobs-if-anti-discrimination-bill-passes/","McCain Warns ‘Gays Could Take Your Jobs’ If Anti-Discrimination Bill Passes","WASHINGTON – As the landmark gay rights bill known as the Employee Non-Discrimination Act inches its way through the Senate, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is using his fear mongering tactics to justify his opposition to the bill, which would ban workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Although McCain’s wife, Cindy, recently signed a Human Rights Campaign postcard pressing her husband to back ENDA, he reiterated his concerns about the bill, claiming that it could lead to “gays taking your jobs.”

“I’m not saying gays and things don’t deserve jobs; they absolutely do. I know a lot of them work very hard at whatever it is they do. But the ENDA legislation could lead to certain scenarios where they could take jobs from well-deserving straight workers, which wouldn’t be fair either.”

McCain elaborated his concerns, saying, “Whether it imposes quotas, whether it has reverse discrimination, whether it has the kinds of provisions that really preserve equal rights for all citizens or, like for example, busing. Busing was done in the name of equality. Busing was a failure. Quotas were a failure. A lot of people thought they were solutions. They weren’t. They bred problems.”

Proponents of the bill were quick to point out that it explicitly forbids quotas and reverse discrimination and contains nothing resembling the desegregation busing practices that began after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision.

“Senator McCain is grossly misinformed about ENDA and the rights that it protects for all citizens,” said openly gay state Rep. Brian Sims (D-Philadelphia). “The bill is designed to protect all US citizens from workplace discrimination.”

“It’s irresponsible and simply wrong for John McCain to claim that the bill will be used to bus gay kids to certain schools or allow members of the LGBT community to take over the work place,” added Sims.

Sims also pointed out that Federal law already bans discrimination in hiring or employment on the basis of race, color, sex, nationality, religion, age or disability, and that ENDA protects people of all sexual orientations from workplace discrimination, which means a person could not be fired for being heterosexual either.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will bring ENDA to the floor on Monday, but even if the bill passes, it will face an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.","2013-11-03 19:18:20","0","27.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","66.0","1.0","35.0","4","397","80.29","57.01","5.38","12.43","17.26","24.43","75.31","44.33","10.08","4.28","0.50","0.25","0.25","1.51","1.76","5.79","7.05","12.09","7.81","3.02","5.29","1.51","12.34","4.03","2.27","2.02","0.00","3.02","3.53","1.26","2.27","0.25","0.25","0.50","8.06","0.50","0.00","0.50","1.51","13.10","1.76","2.52","2.02","2.02","2.27","4.79","1.76","0.50","0.76","0.50","2.52","0.25","0.00","2.27","0.00","9.82","1.26","2.77","5.04","1.01","1.76","3.27","6.05","0.76","7.81","1.01","5.04","2.02","4.79","0.00","0.25","1.76","0.25","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.25","0.25","0.25","0.00","20.40","6.30","6.05","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","1.51","3.02","1.76","1.51","0.00","1966","8.63","28.928571428571427","622","392","23","54.22","11.9","9.9","12.99","11.9","103","7.916666666666666","19.31020408163265","240","26.36","16","0.41","0","15","0","32","0","46","17","0","0","8","60","57","1","30","0","0","19","7","15","0","0","3","12","0","19","15","12","7","8","16","5","0","0","1"
"http://politicot.com/rand-paul-admits-basing-ideology-off-ayn-rand-cliffsnotes/","Rand Paul Admits Basing Ideology off Ayn Rand CliffsNotes","WASHINGTON — Senator Rand Paul’s political future continued to dim this week as reporters and adversaries unearthed further instances of plagiarism stretching back to the Kentucky senator’s formative schooldays.

Initial reports that the senator lifted portions of his speeches from Wikipedia were initially dismissed as the indiscretions of young staffers, but further investigation revealed that Paul’s entire political philosophy may have been based on a slapdash book report copied, in large part, from CliffsNotes.

Paul’s high school book report, entitled “Objectivism in Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand by Randal Paul,” includes entire paragraphs lifted verbatim from the popular study guide designed for students who prefer to skip the tedious prose and get straight to the executive summary.

Joanne Taggart, who taught Paul at Brazoswood High School where he was involved in swimming and football, said, “Randal didn’t spend a lot of time hitting the books.” She remembers Paul “complaining that ‘Atlas Shrugged’ was, ‘not in any literary sense a serious novel, it [was] an earnest one, belligerent and unremitting in its earnestness.’”

Fact checkers have since sourced Paul’s criticism back to a 1957 review by Granville Hicks of the New York Times.

Taggart characterized Paul’s grasp of Ayn Rand’s philosophy as, “loose at best, designed to woo the ladies into thinking he was a serious intellectual when he was anything but.”

Unsurprised that Paul apparently never read any of Ayn Rand’s books in full despite regularly quoting them at length in Congress, Taggart suggested that, “Randal—or Rand as he’s now known—is as unfit for the U.S. presidency as he was for class president.”

Paul defended himself by calling Rachel Maddow, who first raised the charges against him, a “hater” and maintained that he is “not a plagiarist.”“A plagiarist is someone who commits the ‘wrongful appropriation’ and ‘purloining and publication’ of another author’s ‘language, thoughts, ‘ideas, or expressions.’”

Ironically, senator’s definition also appears to come from the Wikipedia entry for “plagiarism.”

Still, Paul has vowed to footnote his public statements and establish a “study group” to discuss Ayn Rand’s oeuvre, promising to “actually read her works cover to cover this time, not just the book jackets.”","2013-11-20 22:32:22","0","28.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","62.0","1.0","35.0","4","357","90.38","65.27","17.56","8.85","32.45","31.93","73.11","41.74","8.40","3.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.36","0.28","4.76","6.72","14.57","4.76","3.36","5.60","1.40","9.24","6.72","2.52","1.68","0.84","2.24","3.64","1.12","2.52","0.00","0.56","0.00","8.40","0.00","0.00","0.84","2.80","10.64","3.08","0.84","0.28","2.80","1.40","3.08","1.96","0.56","0.56","0.56","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","6.16","0.28","0.84","4.76","0.56","0.28","3.64","4.20","0.84","12.89","1.12","6.72","5.60","7.84","2.80","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","24.09","3.92","6.72","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.84","5.04","0.00","0.56","1859","9.66","74.2","557","355","13","43.77","14.8","13.9","15.15","18.3","105","16.333333333333332","24.75098591549296","221","58.6","4","0.41","0","12","2","28","0","47","26","0","2","1","60","55","0","21","0","0","11","4","15","0","0","0","11","0","12","24","7","12","5","10","0","4","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/yet-another-superbowl-goes-to-the-team-that-prayed-hardest/","Yet Another Superbowl Goes to the Team That Prayed Hardest","NEW ORLEANS — The Baltimore Ravens beat out the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 on Sunday to take home their first Super Bowl title in thirteen years. Incredibly, the game also marked the 47th consecutive time the team that had spent the most time in prayer took home the Lombardi Trophy.

“The 49ers were great competitors, but we know that preparation, talent, and sheer dumb luck had nothing to do with our victory,” said Ravens quarterback and Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco. “We simply had longer, more intense telepathic conversation with the omniscient, all-knowing presence we call God. And for that, we were rewarded with a Super Bowl victory.”

“I thank the Lord for taking his focus off of the disease and poverty-stricken parts of the world and dedicating it entirely to football on Sunday,” said Ravens linebacker and NFL legend Ray Lewis. “All glory to God.”

While members of the 49ers were clearly disappointed by Sunday’s result, most players openly acknowledged their lack of ritualistic communication with the invisible being that controls the outcome of all things, including sporting events, led to the loss.

“We fought our hardest,” said 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. “But as I watched my last throw sail over the head of Michael Crabtree, it became clear that my teammates and I hadn’t developed close enough personal relationships with Jesus Christ to win the game. We’ll try harder next year.”","2013-02-05 00:39:39","0","24.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","11.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","63.0","1.0","35.0","4","235","91.50","83.62","12.31","73.45","21.36","21.28","79.15","40.43","10.21","6.81","2.13","3.40","0.00","0.43","0.85","3.40","8.09","12.34","4.26","1.28","5.11","0.85","11.06","6.81","2.98","0.00","2.55","2.98","6.38","4.26","1.70","0.00","0.85","0.85","10.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.43","9.36","1.70","1.70","0.43","1.70","2.98","0.85","2.98","0.85","1.28","0.85","0.85","0.43","0.43","0.00","0.00","17.87","6.81","6.38","5.53","3.83","0.85","6.81","2.98","1.28","10.21","0.85","4.26","5.11","1.70","2.55","0.85","0.85","2.98","0.00","0.43","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.30","4.68","5.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.28","5.11","1.28","0.00","0.00","1134","8.55","26.444444444444443","340","233","11","58.42","12.2","10.4","12.24","13.1","57","10.1","20.26540772532189","161","24.11","7","0.41","0","9","4","23","0","24","18","2","1","0","37","34","0","11","0","0","11","7","8","1","1","1","6","0","4","18","6","5","5","1","1","0","0","0"
"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/obamas-double-standard-on-saving-children-sarin-gas-vs-abortion","Obama’s Double Standard on Saving Children: Sarin Gas vs. Abortion","Before the latest political crisis to get America’s blood pressure up – the government shutdown, and its slow bleed into the debt ceiling issue – Syria dominated the headlines. But there’s a more important crisis, decades old, looming over both of them.

Time after time, President Obama declared that he “absolutely will veto” any spending bill that delays Obamacare. When in a recent House hearing House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) asked, wryly, if that meant Obama had drawn a “red line” on the legislation, the committee burst out laughing.

There’s reason to laugh: Obama proved what a “red line” really means to him in Syria. A civil war that’s killed hundreds of thousands of people over a period of years stoked our president’s ire only when it was politically convenient. And in trying to replicate that ire in the American people, Obama resorted to a tried-and-true tactic: he pulled heartstrings. He invoked the welfare of children.

“Over 1,400 people were gassed,” Obama said. “Over 400 of them were children.” And without action in Syria “I think people, rightly, are going to be pretty skeptical about the system [i.e., the U.N.] and whether it can work to protect those children that we saw in those videos.”

The president’s “red line” was revealed as a joke – a source of outright laughter in the House of Representatives. But at least he put up a show of defending innocent children in Syria. Here in the United States, our own children in the womb don’t get even the charade of a “red line.”

Pro-choice advocates will object that it’s offensive to compare abortion to sarin gas attacks. Perhaps they don’t accept basic embryology, which tells us unequivocally that these children, just like those in Syria, are human beings. Perhaps they haven’t read our Declaration of Independence, which grants an equal right to life to every person, or our Constitution, whose Fourteenth Amendment reads, “… nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”

The protection of children is a theme with President Obama. He appealed to it often during the Trayvon Martin case, when he condemned violence against African-American children – except when they’re in the womb. We saw it after Sandy Hook, when Obama shed tears for the children violently taken from us by a madman with a rifle, and again at the Washington Navy Yard, where our president listed tragedies of gun violence from Fort Hood to Aurora.

“And yet,” Obama said at the Navy Yard, “here in the United States, after the round-of-clock [sic] coverage on cable news, after the heartbreaking interviews with families, after all the speeches and all the punditry and all the commentary, nothing happens. Alongside the anguish of these American families, alongside the accumulated outrage so many of us feel, sometimes I fear there’s a creeping resignation that these tragedies are just somehow the way it is, that this is somehow the new normal.”

Obama perorates about the unrestrained evil of a machine that fires bullets, or an international thug with chemical weapons, but when will he do the same over clamps, suction machines, and syringes filled with heart-stopping poison? When will our president cite the “heartbreaking interviews with families” suffering from our abortion-on-demand culture?

Everyone agrees that the senseless killing of innocent children is an abominable crime, whether they are gunned down here at home or gassed in Syria. To call attention to eerily similar abominable crimes does nothing to diminish these – in fact, it reinforces our respect for the dignity of every human being, and our desire to protect every one of them equally.

But remember: abortion – this rampant destruction of our children here in the United States – is legal. It is permitted, lauded, and sometimes even prayed for by officials in our government. And it is happening on a scale that dwarfs the atrocities our president so frequently takes it upon himself to condemn.

President Obama’s red line may be a joke, but there’s a deadly serious red line that transcends him. It’s the arbitrary line of birth. On one side, Obama would rain destruction on Syria to protect the child. On the other, he oversees the contemptible and compassionless denial of the child’s fundamental right to life.

Politicians promote double-standards so often that we’re practically used to it. We sigh and say, “What can you do?” But we need to give this particular double-standard the outrage it deserves. The callous hypocrisy of too many power-brokers in Washington – including, notoriously, our president – has deprived our country of whole generations.

President Obama, there is a real red line out there, and no one is laughing at it. If our children are so important to you, prove it. Save them.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/obama-is-propping-up-the-rich-and-poor-but-leaving-behind-the-middle-class","Obama is Propping up the Rich and Poor, but Leaving Behind the Middle Class","It’s obvious that Wall Street investors don’t like tapering. But why?

When it was announced that Lawrence Summers withdrew his name to be selected as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, the markets ticked up. When it was officially announced that Janet Yellen would be nominated as the next fed chair, the markets ticked up. Why does Wall Street like Yellen over Summers?

The most distinguishing difference between the policies of the two is that Summers was for tapering the use of quantitative easing and Yellen isn’t. Quantitative Easing is an economic strategy that has been ongoing since the last year of President George W. Bush’s administration where the Federal Reserve buys bonds by printing off more money. The purchasing of the bonds and subsequent influx of cash into the markets provides more cash to trade. Besides the obvious threat to deflate currency, it also provides a weak base for economic growth.

Look at another government program as an example. With the program Cash for Clunkers, the government provided significant cash rebates towards the purchase of a new car for trading in an older model vehicle. During the program the new car sales spiked upwards, however as soon as the program ended car sales dropped immediately to pre-program levels. The program was unsustainable as the government couldn’t keep spending tax dollars to falsely stimulate the car market and paint a rosy picture of vehicle sales.

The same model was used for housing with a “new home buyer” credit that was introduced shortly after Cash for Clunkers ended. The housing market boomed…until the credit ran out.

What will happen when the current unsustainable program of Quantitative Easing ends?

Meanwhile, who really benefits from these false economies generated by government policy? Not the middle class. The Census Bureau reported that 2012 had the fifth straight year of decreased median wages. Not the poor. Since Obama took office, recipients of food stamps (or the Supplemental & Nutritional Assistance Program -SNAP) have increased by nearly 16 million people.

However, the rich are getting richer. A recent World Wealth Report by the Swiss Bank, Credit Suisse, states that the world has 2 million new millionaires compared to 2012, the majority of which are living in the United States. They summarize that, “Millionaires are experiencing even better times now than before the financial crisis.”

Although the Democrat Party has done a great job of branding themselves as the party of the Middle Class, it’s clear that the Federal Reserve, under the Obama Administration’s leadership, has been helping the rich. The Sunlight Foundation reports that President Barack Obama has done better at getting Wall Street donations than any other President in the last 20 years.

It looks like the leader of the self-proclaimed ‘party of the middle class’ has introduced a little pay-to-play Chicago style politics to D.C.

It might be a flashlight, your son’s baseball bat, or that still unloaded gun you thought you’d never need.

In a matter of seconds, the intruders are at your bedroom door. You brace for the confrontation, a shaky grip on your weapon. In the moments before you go down for the count, shot multiple times by the strangers who have invaded your home, you get a good look at your accosters.

It’s the police.

Before I go any further, let me start by saying this: the problem is not that all police are bad. The problem, as I point out in my book A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State is that increasing numbers of police officers are badly trained, illiterate when it comes to the Constitution (especially the Fourth Amendment) and, in some cases, willfully ignorant about the fact that they are supposed to be peacekeepers working for us, the taxpayer.

Consider, for example, the sad scenario that played out when a SWAT team kicked open the door of ex-Marine Jose Guerena’s home during a drug raid and opened fire. Thinking his home was being invaded by criminals, Guerena told his wife and child to hide in a closet, grabbed a gun and waited in the hallway to confront the intruders. He never fired his weapon. In fact, the safety was still on his gun when he was killed. The SWAT officers, however, not as restrained, fired 70 rounds of ammunition at Guerena – 23 of those bullets made contact. Guerena had had no prior criminal record, and the police found nothing illegal in his home.

Then there was the time police used a battering ram to break into the home of 92-year-old Kathryn Johnson, mistakenly believing her house to be a drug den. Fearing that burglars were entering her home, which was situated in a dangerous neighborhood, Johnson fired a warning shot when the door burst open. Police unleashed a hail of gunfire, hitting Johnson with six bullets. Johnson died.

Eighty-year-old Eugene Mallory suffered a similar fate when deputies with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, claiming to have smelled chemicals related to the manufacture of methamphetamine, raided the multi-unit property in which Mallory lived. Thinking that his home was being invaded by burglars, Mallory allegedly raised a gun at the intruders, who shot him six times. Mallory died. “The lesson here,” observed the spokesman for the sheriff’s department, “is don’t pull a gun on a deputy.”

In Fort Worth, Texas, two rookie police officers sent to investigate a possible burglary circled 72-year-old Jerry Waller’s house with flashlights shining. Waller, concerned that his home was being cased, went to his garage, armed with a gun for self-defense. The two officers snuck up on Waller, who raised his gun on the intruders. When Waller failed to obey orders to lower his gun, the officers shot and killed him. It turned out the officers had gone to the wrong address. They blamed the shooting death on “poor lighting.”

In Sarasota, Florida, a mixture of federal and local police converged on the apartment complex where Louise Goldsberry lived after receiving a tip that a child rape suspect was in the complex. Unaware of police activity outside, Louise was washing dishes in her kitchen when a man wearing what appeared to be a hunting vest pointed a rifle at her through her window. Fearing that she was about to be attacked, Louise retrieved her revolver from her bedroom. Meanwhile, the man began pounding on Louise’s front door, saying, “We’re the f@#$ing police; open the f@#$ing door.” Identifying himself as a police officer, the rifle-wielding man then opened the door, pointed a gun at Goldsberry and her boyfriend, who was also present, and yelled, “Drop the f@#$ing gun or I’ll f@#$ing shoot you.” Ironically, the officer later justified his behavior on the grounds that he didn’t like having a gun pointed at him and because “I have to go home at night.”

These incidents underscore a dangerous mindset in which civilians (often unarmed and defenseless) not only have less rights than militarized police, but also one in which the safety of civilians is treated as a lower priority than the safety of their police counterparts (who are armed to the hilt with an array of lethal and nonlethal weapons), the privacy of civilians is negligible in the face of the government’s various missions, and the homes of civilians are no longer the refuge from government intrusion that they once were.

It wasn’t always this way. There was a time in America when a man’s home really was a sanctuary where his family could be safe and secure from the threat of invasion by government agents.

To our detriment, we have been transported back to a time before the American Revolution when government agents – with the blessing of the courts – could force their way into a citizen’s home, with seemingly little concern for lives lost and property damaged in the process.

Indeed, if Winston Churchill is correct that “democracy means that if the doorbell rings in the early hours, it is likely to be the milkman,” then it’s safe to say that we no longer live in a democracy. Certainly not in a day and age when the Fourth Amendment, which was intended to protect us against the police state, especially home invasions by government agents, has been reduced to little more than words on paper.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/a-case-against-a-third-political-party","Virginia Election: The Case Against a Third Political Party","The 2013 Gubernatorial Race in Virginia is the most recent clear case against having a Third Political Party in the United States. In short, a strongly supported Third Party candidate keeps liberal Democrats in power.

At the time of this writing (Nov 6, 2013) the final vote tally was:

Terry McAuliffe (Democratic candidate)) : 1,064,815

Ken Cuccinelli (Republican candidate)) : 1,009,839

Robert Sarvis (Libertarian candidate) : 146, 474

McAuliffe won the election by 54,976 votes which is 37.5 percent of the votes the (Democrat funded) Libertarian candidate received.

The key question is, if Robert Sarvis wasn’t in the race where would his votes have gone? Would they have gone to the Democrat (Terry McAuliffe), the Republican (Ken Cuccinelli) or would they have just stayed home? Although many may have just stayed home, most would have still voted.

What’s the likelihood that they would have voted for McAuliffe? Slim. Although it’s true that many Democrats have become disgruntled with their party and are looking for a Third Party option, they are not looking for a party that wants less government than Republican party.

Most Democrats looking for a Third Party are upset at the Democrat Party because they feel the Party isn’t doing enough when it comes to gay rights, environment protection, taxing the rich, and women’s rights. Voting for a Libertarian (even in name only) is like voting for the anti-Christ.

However, the Republican Party is supposed to be the party of limited government and lower taxes. That’s not very far from where most Libertarians stand. If Libertarians are honest with themselves, most will admit that they would choose the Republican if they only had the choice between a Democrat and a Republican.

This is not the first race that has been swayed by a strong Third Party candidate. There are many smaller local, statewide and Congressional races that have a Democrat sitting there because a Third Party took too many votes away from the Republican candidate.

The real problem is that the Republican Party abandoned their limited government, lower tax principles. When many Republicans woke up to this fact instead of ‘voting the bums out’ they have started looking for Third Party candidates. It’s time to hold the politicians accountable, especially in the Republican Party.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/fair-trials-for-terrorists-threaten-americans","‘Fair’ Trials for Terrorists Threaten Americans","Abu Anas al-Libi, suspected Al-Qaeda leader, was grabbed in a military raid in Libya on Oct. 5. He’s due to stand trial as an accused civilian criminal in a Manhattan Federal Court, where he has been under indictment for more than a decade on charges he helped plan and conduct surveillance for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998, in which 212 people were killed and over 4,000 wounded, including 12 Americans.

Our history of prosecuting war criminals from our first war, through the Civil War and World War II, have been clear and simple, and for over 100 years supported by international law (Geneva Conventions) and our operative version of Geneva, called The Law of Land Warfare, or the modern Army Field Manual 27-10. These documents give guidance and regulation to how we treat enemy Prisoners of War (lawful combatants and protected persons), and are clear about not giving legal privileges and protections to those who do not follow the law (unlawful combatants). These documents inform, repeatedly, that those found in violation of the law can be “prosecuted” and then “executed.”

The Geneva Conventions were written in part to protect innocent civilians in time of war, not to protect those who PRETEND to be civilians in order to MURDER them. It’s not that the Taliban and al Qaeda can’t afford uniforms of their own – just one of the requirements in lawful conflict – it’s that they don’t want you to see them coming and want us to believe they are merely innocent goat herders. It’s as if they want to be able to run onto the ball field from the stands at any time, murder an opposing player, and then disappear back into the crowd. And when security comes to take them away they say “it wasn’t me!” They lawyer up, play the system, and then go back to killing Americans.

Human Rights First brags that “Federal civilian criminal courts have convicted nearly 500 individuals on terrorism-related charges since 9/11.” And that “Federal prisons hold more than 300 individuals convicted of terrorism-related offenses.”

But they don’t mention what happened to the other nearly 200 convicted terrorists! Can we assume they are free on American soil? If prosecuted and then convicted, could al-Libi be set free someday on Main Street U.S.A.?

None of the over 600 Gitmo detainees who’ve been released so far are suspected of being on our shores. But the over 28 percent combined recidivism rate amongst these released Gitmo detainees is no comfort, especially to the loved ones of those killed in the Benghazi attack (led by former Guantanamo Bay detainee Sufian bin Qumu), which left four Americans dead, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.

When I was deployed to Guantanamo Bay in early February 2002, just months after 9/11/01, my Army Reserve enemy prisoner of war liaison detachment was prepared to participate in military tribunals to determine the status of detainees fresh off of planes from Afghanistan. That is where most of the first detainees had participated in a deadly but failed prison uprising which claimed the first American life, CIA operative Johnny Michael Spann. Instead, the principle of “lawfare,” or the exploitation of the American justice system by detainees, their lawyers, sympathizers and apologists in order to manipulate American political will (which also caused disruption of U.S. military detention operations), took hold.

Today, the Military Commissions Act of 2009, the current legal policies governing the prosecution of accused war criminals in the Global War on Terror, affords unlawful combatant Islamist detainees virtually the SAME RIGHTS as you or I would enjoy were we in a Federal Court of Law. Even though the Geneva Conventions and Law of Land Warfare, created to protect innocent civilians during war, offer NO extra-legal privileges for those who break the law.

The Obama administration has taken the disposition of Global War on Terror suspected war criminals to an absurd level, not only allowing them to remain in the stadium, but giving them luxury boxes and rain-check tickets for a repeat performance,. These terrorists are being allowed to put more American lives at risk by bringing the latest and greatest al Qaeda suspect to U.S. shores, when he should be at Gitmo receiving a professional interrogation from our best and brightest.

Urban myths about the treatment of Gitmo detainees are now vernacular, especially amongst the “low information” crowd who rarely dig deeper than news feed sound bites provide. The truth is that although over 600-plus Guantanamo Bay detainees have been released, none have been executed, beheaded, hacked to death, blown up or dragged naked and lifeless through the streets. In contrast, the only U.S. prisoner held by Taliban or al Qaeda believed not to have had his head slowly removed from his body by a long jihadi knife, Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who went missing in June, 2009, remains a mystery. Where are Amnesty International, the ACLU and other so-called “human rights” organizations on Sgt. Bergdahl? Why won’t the mainstream media or Barack Hussein Obama even show his face or demand his release?

I know from my 22 years as a military member and over nine years of service as an Army officer with an enemy prisoner of war liaison detachment, the best way to obtain valuable information from enemy suspects is to convince them that unless they cooperate they will remain in detention, which, according to the Geneva Conventions is legal. Even lawful combatant prisoners of war may be held, without charge, “until the end of hostilities.” This is not “indefinite detention,” as some would complain; no more indefinite than a baseball game in extra innings. In theory, the game could go on endlessly, but it never does, and neither would unlawful combatant detainees be held “forever.”

We need to redouble our efforts to take away our enemy’s means and will to fight and kill us. Until then, the finest military detention facility in the world is ready, willing and able to take care of and provide opportunities for unlawful combatants to help end the Global War on Terror.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/the-case-for-religious-based-marriage-just-because-government-has-controlled-marriage-for-years-doesnt-mean-it-should","The Case for Religious-Based Marriage: Just Because Government Has Controlled Marriage for Years, Doesn’t Mean it Should","Illinois is the most recent state to join the nationwide debate to approve or ban gay marriage. However, the real debate should be whether or not government should have a say in any form of marriage.

Pro-traditional marriage advocates most commonly reference a religious argument when defending their position, stating that God created marriage between man and woman. Pro-gay marriage advocates most commonly reference fairness or equality.

The real question would be equal to what? Why would a gay couple want to get married? Although there could be a myriad of answers depending on the couple, these three are the most influential:

Benefits

Raising Children

Tradition

WHY LOOK TO GOVERNMENT?

Gay couples look to government as the solution because the government already has too much influence on marriage. If it is true that marriage was organized by religion then looking at marriage today one can see plenty of evidence that government has already made laws “prohibiting the free exercise” of religion.

ORIGINS OF MARRIAGE

The debate of government’s role in marriage should begin with the assertion that marriage was started by a Higher Power. Both the Holy Bible and the Quran state that Adam and Eve were the first humans and that the “first marriage” was between them. From that point on in the Judeo-Christian view and the Islamic view has been that marriage was a union of families sanctioned by a religious entity. Hinduism and Buddhism both also viewed marriage as something the religious organization oversaw.

However, there is evidence that in the ancient world, many families began to “join together” as an economic tool. Most of these families did not affiliate themselves with a religious body, some did. Arranged marriages were also used as an economic tool. Although we traditionally call these situations ‘”marriages”, joining of families for economic reasons was not the intent of the Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists, therefore these were not really marriages.

GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE BEGINS

After thousands of years of marriage being overseen by the religions of the world, the first evidence we have of government being involved in marriage was with the organization of the Church of England in 1534 after King Henry VIII – who among other things – wanted the Catholic Church to annul his marriage.

[sharequote align=”center”]Gay couples look to government as the solution because it already has too much influence on marriage[/sharequote]

Even after that, divorce was rare as most people followed the powerful influence of the Church’s teachings. In 1670, it took government, specifically Parliament, to pass an act that allowed for the divorce of John Manners, Lord Roos, from his wife, Lady Anne Pierpon. This created a precedent for government sanctioned divorces on the grounds of the wife’s adultery.

GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF MARRIAGE BEGINS

According to Carol Smart, sociologist from the University of Manchester, The Clandestine Marriage Act of 1753, popularly known as Lord Hardwicke’s Act, marked the beginning of state involvement in marriage. The act required couples to get married in a church or chapel by a minister, otherwise the union was void. Couples also had to issue a formal marriage announcement, called banns, or obtain a license.

Now the key here is that most people were already following these procedures but now there was a penalty for not complying, and the penalty was harsh. Researchers agree that this is clear evidence that government felt that control of marriage was too important to leave up to canon law or religious governing. In US Constitution vernacular, they felt justified infringing upon the free exercise of religion when it came to marriage.

EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL- BENEFITS

After centuries where the Church had maybe too much influence and authority over the State, the tables began to turn. This one act eventually led to government controlling benefits based on marital status. In some instances, marital status was used just for ease of convenience. Next thing you know, the private sector began doing the same thing with joint loans, health benefits and other products and services.

With governments and private groups qualifying things based upon marital status, there were now two groups of people left out, singles and couples who weren’t married but cohabitated (heterosexual or homosexual). In an attempt to fix part of the problem the government came up with something called “common law marriages”. Different taxing bodies came up with varying methods to determine a common law marriage. Anything from living together for specified amount of time to registering at a hotel as a married couple can get you a common law marriage depending on where you live.

With homosexual couples being left out of the common law solution and therefore continue to be denied all of the benefits of marriage, they turned once again to government to fix a problem the government created.

EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL – CHILDREN

One of the integral reasons for marriage was to provide a structured environment to give birth and raise children. However, in ancient times if a child was orphaned, in many cultures they were viewed as a mere burden unless they could be sold into slavery. It was religious organizations who began to teach that the nurturing of children was up to the community. At the passing of parents, the different religious groups would assign an orphaned child to capable couples.

As these different religious organizations, like the Catholic Church, began to organize formal adoptions, they would only adopt a child to married couples. Just as government gradually usurped its power over marriage it wasn’t long before it began to usurp its power over orphaned children, declaring orphaned children were “wards of the state”.

Government continued the religious custom of adopting children to capable couples, but now they also held significant influence over both the child and the marriage. Therefore when homosexual couples who cohabitated wanted to adopt a child they went to government for a solution to another problem the government created.

EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT – TRADITION

Nowhere else can we see the corrupting of marriage more so than in what has become the tradition of marriage. Something that started out as a simple act that was encouraged by a Higher Power, even solemnized by some, has now become an insipid reason to spend an inheritance in order to be treated like a prince and princess for one day.

The “Dream Wedding” is what you hear. Ask a young man why he hasn’t “popped the question” and often you’ll hear, “I can’t afford the ring yet”. Ask an engaged couple why they haven’t set a date for their wedding yet and you’ll get, “We don’t have enough money saved for the wedding.” The “Dream Wedding” has even infected the religious. The young couple may have a modest wedding ceremony, but the after party wedding reception will be worthy of the Gods!

On the opposite end of those over glamorizing weddings or getting married, you have others who belittle it. Shotgun weddings, drunk Vegas drive-through extravaganzas, silly themed weddings, extreme situational weddings and the like all stem from government’s control over marriage and what it has become, a shadow of what it used to symbolize. Couples are now so focused on preparing for the wedding that they forget about preparing for the marriage.

Once again though, why should only heterosexual couples enjoy such a glamorous, fun or thrilling event? It’s not fair, so let’s turn to government to solve another problem that government created.

PROHIBITING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF

“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;”

The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution has two parts pertaining to religion. The first part prevents the United States Congress from establishing a dominant religion for the country. Although some States and local governments have tinkered with that idea, it’s never been an issue from the federal level.

The second part states that Congress cannot prohibit the free exercise of an established religion. So is government’s role in marriage in defiance of the First Amendment? Just because it was practiced by past governments, including this one, doesn’t make it right.

This is the debate we need to have on the national stage.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/health-care-versus-obamacare","Health Care Versus Obamacare","A much-needed reminder about health care versus Obamacare, which, for President Obama and the Left, was never about health care:

Many on the Left argue that health care is a “right.”

Access to health care is not a legal or civil right along the lines of say, equal protection under the law or the right to free speech. That said, in the richest nation in the history of the world, nobody should go sick or untreated for lack of resources. And in the richest nation in the history of the world, no one has.

If someone sought out medical care yet had no insurance and no money, they were still treated, because that’s who we are – who we’ve always been – as a nation. Before Obamacare (and after), the U.S. has had a gazillion social welfare programs in place to help those in need get the care they need: Medicare for the elderly; Medicaid for the poor; WIC for women and their babies; and if someone were really, really broke, they could still walk into any hospital or doctor’s office and get treated. The social safety net has always been extensive.

When the Obamacare debate began (and to this day), nobody was saying that no reform of the health care system was needed. Of course reform was needed. But you could have taken care of many of the issues – including the cost and access to affordable insurance and the overall cost of health care – through free-market and patient-based reforms: portability, tort and tax reform, allowing to buy and carry insurance across state lines, etc. You didn’t need to nationalize one-sixth of the U.S. economy to address those things.

That’s why Obamacare was never about health care or health insurance for Obama and the Left: it was ALWAYS and ONLY about government power and control. And that’s why they’re not freaking out about the Obamacare website and other problems – because they were never that interested in actually getting it to work. They were only interested in slamming it into place to leverage it as part of Obama’s “fundamental transformation of the nation.”

Now that Obama’s starting to feel some political heat over it, he may move to make some changes, possibly a delay (although the only reason he’d do that is to push its start past the 2014 elections to help Democrats avoid the disaster as long as possible).

He will not fire anyone. He never has. Not Attorney General Eric Holder after he lied to Congress, not the IRS folks, not the Fast and Furious folks, not the Benghazi folks. There never has been accountability in the “most transparent administration in history,” so don’t look for it now. The only way he’d fire someone (and I doubt it would be someone as high-profile as Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius) is if his poll numbers slip even further. They’re pretty low now, but if they go lower, he’ll look to deflect attention from himself. Only then will any heads roll, and I’m sure they’d be re-instated after a while, the way the Benghazi Four were over at the State Department.

As we move forward, please don’t confuse health care with Obamacare. Health care exists to treat and care. Obamacare exists to expand government, dependency, and control.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/americas-fundamental-transformation-under-obama","America’s Fundamental Transformation Under Obama","Last week on “The O’Reilly Factor,” I recalled how Barack Obama spoke in 2008 about the “fundamental transformation of the nation.” After five years of his presidency, we see the enormous success he’s had in achieving it.

The objective was always to move America away from a nation built on individual liberty and economic freedom and toward a government welfare and dependency state. Socialism, communism, statism, leftism — in the end it doesn’t matter what you call it, because what matters is what’s being carried out…and its consequences.

Radical wealth redistribution, class warfare, socialized medicine, the atomization of American society, divisive identity politics, the war on success, the loss of our Triple A credit rating, the retrenchment of U.S. power abroad, the gutting of our military, the erosion of our international credibility.

It’s all being done deliberately by Obama and the left in order to “fundamentally transform” this country into just another crippled dependency state.

After five years of evidence, people are still wondering aloud why Obama doesn’t negotiate, why he doesn’t compromise, why he doesn’t handle things the way, say, Bill Clinton did.

Wake the BLEEP up! (and by the way, my book laid all of this out and more. Please see the top of this website for how to order the paperback edition of “What The (Bleep) Just Happened?” It’s all there…and way ahead of its time.)

Unlike Clinton, who was a pragmatist, Obama is a pure ideologue. Why do you think he hasn’t negotiated with Republicans? First, it’s because he doesn’t really have to, given that the liberals in Congress and the media protect and advance his interests at every turn and because the GOP is so spineless. Second, it’s because he’s a total ideologue who will never give anything on his way to “fundamentally transforming the nation.”

Guess what Obama’s next move is? Pushing for immigration “reform” (see the story here). Why? Because granting amnesty to tens of millions of illegals, locking them into government dependency, and creating a permanent Democrat voting majority is the final, missing piece of the “fundamental transformation of the nation.”

After that, America is over.

Stop waiting for Obama to change. It’s never going to happen. And while we’re over here, contemplating our navels and whining about his unwillingness to compromise, he and the left are busily remaking America — right from under us.

Is it too late? I don’t know. Maybe. I wish I could be more optimistic. But the “leadership” on our side is completely unready and unwilling to wage this fight. They simply aren’t up to it.

And while we’ve got a few brave souls on the Hill who get it and are fearlessly fighting back — guys like Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee — the Left has been working tirelessly (along with disgraceful members of the GOP as well) to marginalize and discredit them.

Meanwhile, the left — flanked by its troops in the media — keeps pressing and pressing, exhausting us until we give up, while they never rest, never falter, never compromise, and never fail.

And, well, we’re losing. Not just the fights over the CR and the debt ceiling and Obamacare, but the future of the country. That doesn’t mean that we should stop fighting. We must fight with every breath and ounce of energy we’ve got. But we need to understand what we’re up against, how far down the road of “transformation” we already are, and how our own leadership is failing us.

It’s time to regroup and re-energize and maybe even re-brand the Tea Party. It’s time to find and recruit real conservatives to run for office, from the bottom up. It’s time to support folks who are doing that, from Heritage to FreedomWorks.

It’s time for our own “fundamental transformation.” Let’s go.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/nice-return-on-our-investment-huh","Nice Return on Our Investment, Huh?","Tamarlan Tsarnaev and his younger brother Dzhokhar came to the United States when they were boys, refugees from Russia. This country took their family in, gave them asylum, educated them, offered them every opportunity, and, according to the Boston Herald, provided them with taxpayer-funded welfare benefits. Of course we did. Here’s how The Herald reported it:

“Marathon bombings mastermind Tamerlan Tsarnaev was living on taxpayer-funded state welfare benefits even as he was delving deep into the world of radical anti-American Islamism, the Herald has learned. “State officials confirmed last night that Tsarnaev, slain in a raging gun battle with police last Friday, was receiving benefits along with his wife, Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, and their 3-year-old daughter. The state’s Executive Office of Health and Human Services said those benefits ended in 2012 when the couple stopped meeting income eligibility limits. Russell Tsarnaev’s attorney has claimed Katherine — who had converted to Islam — was working up to 80 hours a week as a home health aide while Tsarnaev stayed at home. “In addition, both of Tsarnaev’s parents received benefits, and accused brother bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan were recipients through their parents when they were younger, according to the state. “The news raises questions over whether Tsarnaev financed his radicalization

on taxpayer money.”

So America embraced this family as “one of us” and provided them welfare benefits, giving them help and hope, as we, in our deep naivete, believed they would assimilate and love us back.

Instead of love, we got a profound, violent hatred. Their hatred of the U.S., fueled by the Islamic jihad, ended in two deadly terrorist explosions at the Boston Marathon and a hail of bullets that killed one police officer and wounded another while an entire American city was forced into lockdown.

Nice return on our investment, no?

Post-Boston, we need to address a number of glaring and fatal problems, among them: Why didn’t the FBI more aggressively pursue Tamarlan after repeated requests and warnings about his radicalism from Russian intelligence? Why did the FBI not visit the Islamic Society of Boston where the brothers often worshipped until 4 days after the bombings Why weren’t our intelligence and law enforcement agencies talking to one another about Tamerlan after all of these red flags went up? After all, tearing down that communications wall so that they COULD talk to each other was a key adopted provision of the 9/11 Commission Report. It’s also why we have a Director of National Intelligence—to make sure all of these agencies are communicating. (Of course, the current DNI, James Clapper, is fairly useless.) And, in era in which the federal government and state governments are broke, shouldn’t we be dealing far more aggressively on entitlement

reform, so that, say, suspected terrorists don’t get welfare?

Just a few questions to get us started here, because America definitely needs to start paying closer attention to the “returns” we’re getting on our “investments.”","2013-04-24 14:00:54","0","2.0","13.0","0.0","1.0","15.0","0.0","30.0","24.0","0.0","45.0","0.0","1.0","0","494","81.21","90.92","14.97","36.45","24.70","30.16","79.15","44.13","10.32","6.88","0.00","2.83","0.00","1.01","3.04","3.44","6.28","13.77","5.26","4.66","6.68","1.21","11.34","4.25","2.63","2.43","2.02","2.63","6.68","3.64","3.04","0.40","1.62","0.40","12.96","1.82","0.00","0.40","1.82","7.29","1.21","1.62","1.42","1.01","1.42","1.21","0.61","0.20","0.40","0.00","1.21","0.00","0.81","0.00","0.00","13.16","5.47","0.61","4.45","2.43","0.61","6.68","4.25","0.20","14.78","1.21","7.09","7.09","6.68","0.81","1.01","1.62","1.21","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.22","3.64","7.29","0.40","0.00","0.81","0.00","1.21","2.23","2.02","0.40","0.20","2495","8.93","26.57894736842105","774","488","21","47.93","13.4","12.3","13.99","15.3","128","10.3","21.771803278688527","302","24.58","6","0.44","0","16","10","47","0","59","29","3","0","1","70","59","2","34","0","0","24","11","16","2","0","3","12","0","13","35","15","12","11","8","3","1","0","9"
"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/nixon-now-more-than-ever","Nixon, Now More Than Ever","“I was born in a house my father built.”

That’s how Richard Nixon chose to begin his memoir, “RN.” A simple, declarative sentence distinguished by its humility. Nixon, the young Quaker boy who grew up poor in the citrus groves of Southern California, and through hard work, extraordinary intellect and talent, and sheer force of will, went on to become President of the United States.

Yesterday, we celebrated the Nixon Centennial. He was born January 9, 1913, and over the next 81 years, he became a dynamic symbol of American resilience.

On July 3, 1990, I became the former President’s foreign policy assistant. I served in this capacity until his death on April 22, 1994 (after which I wrote two bestsellers about my experiences with him, “Nixon Off the Record,” and “Nixon in Winter.”) During those four years, I became a professional confidante of a man who had transformed American politics, changed global balances of power, and became an icon for those seeking both good and evil, brilliance and deceit, selflessness and selfishness, greatness and baseness. Visible and controversial even after his death, Nixon remains a source of endless fascination. “In politics,” he would say, “the only worse thing than being wrong is being dull.” He was sometimes wrong but he was never dull.

Nixon saw leadership as high drama, to be played out on a grand scale and without fear or hesitation. His political career, which he directed with almost epic intensity, dealt triumphs and tragedies in rapid succession: election to Congress in 1946; exposure of top-ranking State Department official Alger Hiss as a spy for the Soviet Union, launching him into the national spotlight; selection as Dwight Eisenhower’s vice presidential running mate in 1952; a well-orchestrated self-defense against false charges with the Fund speech, saving his place on that ticket; the heartbreakingly close loss to John Kennedy in 1960; the defeat in the California gubernatorial race in 1962; the survival of the next six years in the political wilderness; victory in 1968 and a thundering re-election win in 1972; the opening of American relations with China, détente with the Soviet Union, and the end of the war in Vietnam; Watergate and the resignation; and the slow, deliberate climb back to respectability.

At the center of American politics for almost fifty years, Nixon commanded a significance that went beyond political influence. It was cultural. It was definitive. Whether championing anti-communism or the need to help a post-cold war Russia, civil rights or ending the draft, a “peace with honor” in Vietnam or rapprochement with China, responsible arms control, environmental protection, or educational opportunity, Nixon was there, leading. And whether making the decisions in office himself or whispering advice to his successors, Nixon was there. More than any other single figure, Nixon shaped the second half of the American century.

How we could use his wise counsel today on Iran, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Iraq, and al Qaeda. He was, after all, the first president to order a top-secret analysis of Islamic terror (in 1973). We could also use his realism on Russia and China. The world has always been a complicated and dangerous place, but Nixon was one of the rare presidents who could see it functioning as a whole as well as seeing its individual parts. He could also see what the world was going to look like 20 years down the road and dare to make American policy to prepare for that world.

He was once asked how history will remember him, and he replied, “The judgment of history depends on who writes it.” I believe history will be far kinder to Nixon than his contemporaries were, and he will ultimately be considered one of the great modern presidents. Flawed, yes. But he was a tremendously influential leader possessing that rarest of intellectual gifts—vision—and the extraordinary courage to carry it out. This cannot be said for all presidents: Nixon mattered.

Happy 100th birthday, Mr. President! We were lucky to have your leadership, wisdom, and vision—-and I was lucky to have your friendship. Godspeed, sir.","2013-01-10 13:50:13","0","36.0","46.0","33.0","1.0","30.0","0.0","93.0","84.0","0.0","195.0","0.0","23.0","3","686","89.53","67.95","27.14","33.31","20.79","22.45","79.59","45.77","9.48","5.83","1.31","0.58","0.29","3.64","0.00","3.64","8.02","14.72","5.83","2.62","7.29","0.44","10.93","8.16","2.77","1.75","3.79","1.02","6.27","3.35","2.92","0.44","0.29","0.87","8.31","0.15","0.29","0.00","4.23","9.91","2.33","2.19","0.87","2.04","0.73","2.77","2.33","0.87","0.87","0.29","0.15","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.52","1.75","2.92","7.00","1.31","1.17","5.25","3.94","0.87","15.45","1.75","8.16","5.54","4.96","0.87","0.15","0.44","0.15","0.58","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.29","0.00","19.83","4.81","8.60","0.29","1.46","0.00","0.15","1.17","2.33","0.44","0.58","0.00","3310","8.43","24.607142857142858","1046","676","31","57.81","13.7","10.6","12.53","13.7","159","6.5","20.12828402366864","398","21.29","9","0.44","0","37","20","63","0","84","73","3","0","9","124","65","1","26","1","0","32","15","21","0","0","3","16","0","19","37","15","10","1","4","3","5","0","2"

–

While harrying and stalling tea party groups seeking nonprofit status, the Internal Revenue Service mailed $4.2 billion in child-credit checks to undocumented immigrants.

Critics say midlevel IRS bureaucrats continue to abuse the Additional Child Tax Credit program by dispensing $1,000 checks to families in this country illegally.

“The law needs clarification that undocumented immigrants are not eligible,” Sen.Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, told Watchdog.org in a statement.

To make Congress’ intent clear – that only legal U.S. residents are entitled to ACTC credits — Grassley co-sponsored a clarifying amendment with Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wy.

“Unfortunately, the majority leader (Harry Reid, D-Nev.) cut off debate, so we weren’t given the chance to offer our amendment,” said Grassley, the topRepublican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The IRS’ practice of paying out billions to undocumented-immigrant families never received full congressional scrutiny, said David North, a fellow at the enforcement-oriented Center for Immigration Studies.

“I’ve been in government and I know kind of how these things work out,” North told the Washington Times.

“It struck me that (GS) 15s and 16s got together at some point and decided this is how we should handle it, and it stuck,” said North, who wrote “Paying Illegals to Stay,” an analysis of how benefit programs increase illegal immigration.

The IRS has said it doesn’t believe the ACTC law allows the agency to deny payment to undocumented immigrants.

Watchdog reported in June that disbursement of ACTC credits has grown rapidly — and suspiciously — with increased issuance of Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers as substitutes for Social Security numbers.

ITIN holders are not required to prove legal residency, and ITIN applications are running at the rate of 1 million a year.

Federal investigators identified one address in Atlanta where 23,994 ITIN refunds totaling $46,378,040 were delivered. A single bank account there received 8,393 refunds.

Records indicate that undocumented immigrants in Virginia received $87.9 million in ACTC cash from the IRS. Watchdog reported that $163,711 went to a single address in the tiny eastern shore town of Parksley.

In lightly populated Iowa, Grassley’s home state, undocumented immigrants got an estimated $30 million.

With an average of 15 percent of ACTC refunds directed to undocumented households nationally, North calculates that roughly half of the money went to ITIN holders who paid “little or no income taxes.”

An audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration stated:

“We believe legislation is needed to clarify whether or not refundable tax credits such as the ACTC may be paid to filers without a Social Security number. Such a legislative change could result in cost savings to the federal government of $1.8 billion annually.

“As it now stands, the payment of federal funds through this tax benefit appears to provide additional incentive for aliens to enter, reside and work in the U.S. without authorization, which contradicts federal law and policy to remove such incentives.”

The recommendations of that audit, conducted in 2009, have yet to be acted on.

Meantime, the IRS continues to be dogged by controversy over its handling of tax-exempt requests by tea party groups and other conservative organizations.

Judicial Watch this month filed a Freedom of Information lawsuit against the agency asking the District Court for the District of Columbia to compel the IRS to produce records of all communications relating to the review process for organizations seeking 501(c)(4) non-profit status since Jan. 1, 2010.

On May 14, the Treasury inspector general concluded the IRS had singled out groups with conservative-sounding terms such as “patriot” and “tea party” in their titles when applying for tax-exempt status.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/when-did-the-cuban-missile-crisis-become-a-u-s-victory","When did the Cuban Missile Crisis become a U.S. “Victory?”","That Khrushchev swept the floor with Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis was the mainstream conservative conclusion throughout much of the Cold War. Richard Nixon and Barry Goldwater, for instance, represented opposite poles of the Republican establishment of their time.

“We locked Castro’s communism into Latin America and threw away the key to its removal,” growled Barry Goldwater about the JFK’s Missile Crisis “solution.”

“Kennedy pulled defeat out of the jaws of victory,” complained Richard Nixon. “Then gave the Soviets squatters rights in our backyard.”

Generals Curtis Le May and Maxwell Taylor represented opposite poles of the military establishment.

“The biggest defeat in our nation’s history!” bellowed Air Force chief Curtis Lemay while whacking his fist on his desk upon learning the details of the deal.

“We missed the big boat,” complained Gen. Maxwell Taylor after learning of same.

“We’ve been had!” yelled then Navy chief George Anderson upon hearing on Oct. 28, 1962, how JFK “solved” the missile crisis. Adm. Anderson was the man in charge of the very “blockade” against Cuba.

“It’s a public relations fable that Khrushchev quailed before Kennedy,” wrote Alexander Haig. “The legend of the eyeball to eyeball confrontation invented by Kennedy’s men paid a handsome political dividend. But the Kennedy-Khrushchev deal was a deplorable error resulting in political havoc and human suffering through the America’s.”

Even Democratic luminary Dean Acheson despaired: “This nation lacks leadership,” he grumbled about the famous “Ex-Comm meetings” so glorified in the movie Thirteen Days. “The meetings were repetitive and without direction. Most members of Kennedy’s team had no military or diplomatic experience whatsoever. The sessions were a waste of time.”

But not for the Soviets. “We ended up getting exactly what we’d wanted all along,” snickered Nikita Khrushchev in his diaries, “security for Fidel Castro’s regime and American missiles removed from Turkey and Italy. Until today the U.S. has complied with her promise not to interfere with Castro and not to allow anyone else to interfere with Castro. After Kennedy’s death, his successor Lyndon Johnson assured us that he would keep the promise not to invade Cuba.”

In fact Khrushchev prepared to yank the missiles before any “bullying” by Kennedy. “What!” Khrushchev gasped on Oct. 28th 1962, as recalled by his son Sergei. “Is he (Fidel Castro) proposing that we start a nuclear war? But that is insane!…Remove them (our missiles) as soon as possible! Before it’s too late. Before something terrible happens!” commanded the Soviet premier.

So much for the gallant Knights of Camelot forcing the Russians’ retreat. In fact, the Castro brothers and Che Guevara’s genocidal lust is what prompted the Butcher of Budapest to yank the missiles from their reach.

The genuine threat came – not from Moscow – but from the Castros and Che.

“If the missiles had remained, we would have fired them against the very heart of the U.S., including New York. The victory of socialism is well worth millions of atomic victims.” (Che Guevara to Sam Russell of The London Daily Worker, November 1962.)

“Of course I knew the missiles were nuclear- armed,” responded Fidel Castro to Robert McNamara during a meeting in 1992. “That’s precisely why I urged Khrushchev to launch them. And of course Cuba would have been utterly destroyed in the exchange.”

Castro’s regime’s was granted new status. Let’s call it MAP, or Mutually-Assured-Protection. Cuban freedom-fighters working from south Florida were suddenly rounded up for “violating U.S. neutrality laws.” Some of these bewildered men were jailed, others “quarantined,” prevented from leaving Dade County. The Coast Guard in Florida got 12 new boats and seven new planes to make sure Castro remained unmolested.

JFK’s Missile Crisis “solution” also pledged that he immediately pull the rug out from under Cuba’s in-house freedom fighters. Raul Castro himself admitted that at the time of the Missile Crisis his troops and their Soviet advisors were up against 179 different “bands of bandits” as he labeled the thousands of Cuban anti-Communist rebels then battling savagely and virtually alone in Cuba’s countryside, with small arms shipments from their compatriots in south Florida as their only lifeline.

Kennedy’s deal with Khrushchev cut this lifeline. This ferocious guerrilla war, waged 90 miles from America’s shores, might have taken place on the planet Pluto for all you’ll read about it in the mainstream media and all you’ll learn about it from Kennedy’s court scribes, who scribbled Kennedy’s Missile-Crisis “victory.” To get an idea of the odds faced by those betrayed Cuban rebels, the desperation of their battle and the damage they wrought, you might revisit Tony Montana during the last 15 minutes of “Scarface.”

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/clintonian-lies-continue-with-anthony-weinercarlos-dangerhuma-abedin-psychodrama","Clintonian Lies Continue With Anthony Weiner/Carlos Danger/Huma Abedin Psychodrama","The Anthony Weiner/Carlos Danger/Huma Abedin psychodrama has kicked over an old, moldy rock, beneath which is the revolting and exhausting thing known as the Clinton psychodrama.

Abedin has been Hillary Clinton’s closest adviser for nearly two decades, from the White House to the Senate to the State Department. By many accounts, Abedin is the person to whom Hillary turns first, after Bill. Her full-time job is running Hillary’s “transition team” — leaving open the question: “transition to what?” The answer is pretty obvious.

After the new revelations that Carlos Danger kept sexting with college-age women right through this year, Abedin stood by his side, claiming that she “loves” and “believes in” him. The script was right out of the Hillary Clinton playbook. And yet, reports are that Hillary and Bill are “furious” with the comparisons. Take that one with a grain of salt.

Then there’s the question of truth, which has always been elastic for the Clintons. Here is one version of events from the New York Post:

“Hillary didn’t know Huma would do this whole stand-by-your-man routine, and that’s one of the reasons the Clintons are distancing themselves from all this nonsense,’’ the source said.

And here’s another version from Politico:

Abedin did not give Clinton a personal heads-up that she planned to defend her husband at a hastily-called press conference last week. Still, Clinton was aware ahead of time that she planned to do it, having been alerted from others in her orbit, sources said.

So: did Hillary know ahead of time or didn’t she? The answer to that particular question may be immaterial, but the bigger point is not. The Clintons have always had a casual acquaintance with the truth, which led — and continues to lead — to all kinds of distress for the nation. She didn’t know about Bill’s womanizing in 1992 when they first ran for president. She didn’t know about Monica Lewinsky before that scandal blew up. She didn’t know that Huma was going to do a Hillary routine. She didn’t know what what going on in Benghazi, and she doesn’t know what has happened since.

For the “smartest woman in the world,” she’s pretty stupid. And she’s still the same old slippery liar.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/the-obama-administration-is-all-about-failing-up","The Obama Administration Is All About Failing Up","The Obama administration is all about failing up. If you have lied to the American people, overseen policies that resulted in the deaths of American citizens, created other policies that have undermined American law and interests, screwed up royally, and covered up your actions, then you are primed for position and promotion in the Obama administration.

The most recent example of failing up is Susan Rice. Rice is, of course, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations who was wheeled out on September 15th of last year on five Sunday morning show to peddle a whopper of a lie. She said that they believed the terror attack in Benghazi (which they all knew at the time was a terror attack committed by forces linked to al Qaeda) was simply a “spontaneous demonstration as a result of what had transpired in Cairo,” and she explicitly blamed an obscure YouTube video. That was a lie, she knew it was a lie, everyone around her knew it was a lie, and she said it anyway.

Now she’s getting rewarded with a big promotion to National Security Adviser. That gig requires no Senate confirmation, so she’s in. Great work if you can get it.

Taking her place at the UN will be Samantha Power, the wife of Obama’s radical regulatory czar Cass Sunstein. Power is the one who came up with the basis for our disastrous intervention in Libya—which ultimately led to the Benghazi attack and the deaths of those four brave Americans. Called “Responsibility to Protect,” Power’s doctrine argues that the U.S. has a moral responsibility to intervene anywhere there is a slaughter or the potential of slaughter (whether our strategic interests are involved or not). She successfully argued “R2P” (as it’s known) and Obama led the NATO operation that helped to overthrow Moammar Qaddafi (who had not initiated an assault against his people). Qaddafi fell, was killed, and then we went on a social engineering experiment that led to the outpost in Benghazi and probable gunrunning out of Libya to…Syria. Which bring us to….Syria. If Power’s “R2P” were applied consistently, then Obama should have intervened there 2 years ago, when Assad’s slaughter began. There is still no intervention there, 70,000 to 80,000 lives later. I’m not arguing for intervention—in fact, I don’t think we should be injecting ourselves in that Arab civil war. But there is no consistency in policy: intervene in Libya where there was no slaughter, but don’t intervene in Syria where there is an actual slaughter. Whatever exists of an Obama “doctrine” (which is quite a mess and is resulting in the rise of anti-American regimes and forces around the world) is Samantha Power’s worldview. Lord help us, now she’s going to be our UN Ambassador. Failing upward!

Not to mention Victoria Nuland, who led the charge in demanding the edits to the Benghazi “talking points” documents that protected “her building’s leadership.” She’s now being promoted to Assistant Secretary of State.

Top IRS officials who oversaw the targeting of conservative and patriot groups remain in their jobs, and those who aren’t still employed by the IRS were scheduled to leave and retire anyway. Lois Lerner, a major villain in this scandal, is on “administrative leave” while still drawing her $177,000 salary. Paid by you. (You may want to work a little harder.)

And don’t forget that several of the officials overseeing Fast and Furious in Arizona—which resulted in the deaths of two brave Americans—were merely shuffled around to different jobs. Not fired, not held accountable, just moved around.

If you suck at your job and are willing to lie through your teeth, I’ve got good news. In this horrendous Obama Economy, you can always get a job among your fellow liars in the Obama administration. You might even get promoted.","2013-06-05 11:32:10","0","2.0","13.0","0.0","1.0","15.0","0.0","30.0","24.0","0.0","45.0","0.0","1.0","0","641","75.67","76.83","17.72","4.82","19.42","22.62","80.34","50.70","11.70","6.24","0.47","1.25","1.87","2.18","0.47","5.46","7.64","13.88","8.42","4.68","5.30","2.18","13.42","1.87","1.25","2.65","1.72","0.78","5.30","1.56","3.59","0.31","2.50","0.47","10.14","0.16","0.16","2.18","0.31","9.05","1.09","2.18","1.09","2.18","1.09","2.96","0.78","0.31","0.31","0.16","0.94","0.16","0.31","0.16","0.31","11.39","1.87","2.81","5.93","2.50","0.94","5.77","7.96","1.25","14.20","2.34","8.11","4.06","6.08","0.31","0.00","0.94","0.31","1.56","0.62","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.31","18.88","6.08","5.15","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.16","2.50","2.65","1.87","0.16","3006","8.24","20.0","946","631","34","61.06","12.3","9.4","11.6","11.3","147","8.2","18.758541996830427","337","17.64","14","0.49","0","21","11","60","0","71","41","0","0","7","77","74","3","28","0","0","34","11","37","0","1","5","21","0","19","41","14","23","17","18","11","7","0","3"
"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/obamacare-is-selling-sex-drugs-and-unhealthy-lifestyles","Obamacare is Selling Sex, Drugs and Unhealthy Lifestyles","Obamacare is in a heap of trouble with bad news coming by the day, or more often by the hour. President Obama and his supporters are desperate for the program to work but they have an entirely uphill battle, namely getting the young and healthy to enroll in order to support everyone else. Should be a piece of cake, right? Young Americans were huge supporters of President Obama, idolizing how cool he was.

But it seems like the young and healthy aren’t particularly enthused about Obamacare. After all, they have been extremely hard hit by the recession, student loan debt, and a depressed job market. Where in the world are they going to find money to pay for high premiums and deductibles when they are still living in their parent’s basements?

No matter. The Obamacare supporters, specifically in Colorado, think they found a way to reel in the youngsters: appeal to what they like most – sex, beer, and more sex.

One of the latest Obamacare ads feature a male and female couple together, with the female holding a package of birth control pills with the caption excitedly asking if the hot guy next to her is as easy to get as them.

The other ad features three frat boys, one chugging beer from a keg , with the caption urging young people to buy health insurance so an illness doesn’t take away all their beer money.

Is this what President Obama thinks American youth are all about – that all they care about are sex and alcohol? Granted both are intriguing subjects for marketing purposes but the ads are bordering on offensive and, at first glance, seem to be a joke. This is health insurance we are talking about, not the local beer pong tournament or a night of a Sex, Milk and Cookies program in college.

As a young woman, I am particularly offended. Do President Obama and his supporters all see young women as single-issue voters? Are women voting just to get free birth control, so we can have all the sex we want? Is that what women have been reduced to? Sure feels like it.

Today, women outnumber men in higher education. Since 1982, women have earned nine million more college degrees than men. These women aren’t out all night drinking and getting pizza at 2am and then thinking about buying health insurance because of some demeaning ad. They are concerned about their future, about careers and families, and the economy. It’s not all about a $9 pack of birth control pills that they can easily purchase at Wal-Mart.

[sharequote align=”center”]Obamacare forces me to pay for abortion-inducing drugs that I am morally opposed to. [/sharequote]

However, as a pro-life woman, I am even more offended. Obamacare forces me to pay for a lot of drugs, including abortion-inducing drugs, that I am morally opposed to. My generation leans pro-life as well and does not want to pay for products that cause abortions, yet we are going to be forced to because that is what the government decided is “minimum essential coverage.”

Hey, at least now young women can supposedly have all the free sex they want because birth control pills are complimentary, courtesy of the Obama Administration and taxpayers – because apparently that is all young women care about.

The initial enrollment numbers for Obamacare are dismal and fall 97 percent short of their stated goals. No demographics were released but I wonder if the young and healthy lined up to buy expensive health insurance just for the carefree sex life. I’d be surprised if young Americans are going to follow their leader off the cliff, especially if they are marketed to using such cheap shots.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/obamacare-will-force-one-florida-county-to-make-nicotine-use-illegal","Obamacare Will Force One Florida County to Make Nicotine Use Illegal","Commentary by William Patrick, a writer at Watchdog.org, who can be contacted at william@floridawatchdog.org.

–

Flagler County commissioners are taking a tough new stance against tobacco users looking for work – by considering nicotine a banned drug.

Beginning Oct. 1, prospective county employees will be required to take a nicotine test in addition to pre-employment drug screening for illegal drugs.

A failed test would not only deny an otherwise qualified applicant a job, but would also prohibit employment with the county for another 12 months.

“The tobacco ban applies to anything that would produce nicotine,” said Joseph Mayer, Flagler County’s community services director. That includes cigarettes, chewing tobacco, e-cigarettes, pipes and snuff.

Job applicants also must sign an affidavit stating, under penalty of perjury, that they have not used tobacco within one-year of employment.“It’s the same thing as drug use,” Mayer said. “We have a drug-free policy where everyone is tested for drug use before they come on board, and if they start using afterwards we won’t know until either a random test or a workers compensation incident.”

Mayer said the county has no desire to be the “tobacco police” but testing positive for nicotine after being hired could result in termination.

The new policy is aimed at reducing health insurance costs. According to widely cited research, smokers can cost employers about $5,800 more annually than nonsmokers.

But the tobacco ban, as opposed to just smoking, also coincides with the tobacco surcharge under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

Flagler County employees are insured through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, which acknowledges tobacco users will pay more under Obamacare.

Beginning in January, the tobacco surcharge will allow health insurers to charge up to 50 percent more in health insurance premiums, driving up costs for both public and private employers.

The American Lung Association opposes the measure on the grounds that the penalty does not effectively reduce tobacco use.

Critics of so-called tobacco lifestyle bans often cite discrimination and privacy violations. But federal law does not provide tobacco users equal protection, and Florida state law does not protect off-work tobacco use.

Other local governments have enacted similar laws, and Florida hospitals have done the same. In 1995, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that public employees have no expectation of privacy when it comes to tobacco use.

Flagler’s 635 current employees are exempt from the new tobacco policy, which was unanimously passed by the Flagler County Board of County Commissioners on Aug. 19.

When asked if the new tobacco ban would apply to the county commissioners, Mayer responded in an email, “As such, the policy does not apply to our County Commission or those individuals who may run for office in the future.”

According to recent reporting from the Long War Journal and SITE Intelligence Group, Ansar al-Sharia Libya has announced the opening of its first Twitter feed.

And how did they make this announcement? Take a long, hard guess.

Facebook.

From an analyst’s perspective, this reporting is significant for multiple reasons.

First, Ansar al-Sharia Libya is the same group responsible for the 9/11 Benghazi attack that killed four good Americans. Jack and Brandon have continued to provide timely and accurate updates regarding the failures that enabled Ansar al-Sharia Libya to conduct such a deadly attack in 2012.

However, with the opening of the Ansar al-Sharia Libya Twitter account, it is evident that the group has yet to be brought to justice, and continues to expand.

Second, the fact that this very same group is expanding its information operations capability through social media is indicative of the group’s intent to expand its reach and voice to any potential followers on a larger, global scale. Just like SOFREP reported at the beginning of October, al Qaeda clearly recognizes the value of rapid information exchange, data sharing, and the inter-connectivity that social media provides.

The fact that Ansar al-Sharia Libya made this announcement via Facebook drives this point home. The ability of terrorist organizations to utilize social media platforms such as Twitter remains a constant and increasing threat for U.S. counterterrorism operations and strategy.

Third, with an increasing number of terrorist organizations and personalities continuing to join the ranks of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, additional policing efforts will be required. As of early 2013, Twitter was already having a difficult time upholding its “zero tolerance” policy regarding violence and illegal activity. The practice of identifying and suspending or shutting down actual terrorist accounts is a struggle not unlike the game of Whac-a-Mole, and a constant one at that. With increased terrorist presence on social media, increased policing is also required.

[sharequote align=”center”]Identifying & shutting down terrorist accounts is a struggle not unlike the game of Whac-a-Mole[/sharequote]

Finally, given al Qaeda, Ansar al-Sharia Libya, and al Shabaab’s choice of social media platforms, an additional and more subliminal threat to U.S. national security is now posed by terrorist organizations. Whereas jihad hopefuls in the past had to physically travel to various terrorist hotbeds in order to get their dose of jihad tourism, various terrorist organizations are now much more accessible to everyday citizens or otherwise moderate individuals around the world. Considering that over 550,000,000 people use Twitter alone, increasingly greater numbers of non-radicals are now potentially at risk for exposure to terrorist propaganda.

This exposure could be leveraged by terrorist organizations to either motivate individuals or groups to physically travel to terrorist hotbeds in support of a holy war, or could inspire them to take action in their local area, more in keeping with a “homegrown” or “lone wolf” attack style.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/njs-disabled-repo-cop-loses-his-pension","NJ’s Disabled Repo Cop Loses His Pension","TRENTON – Joe Derrico, the disabled New Jersey cop turned roughhousing repo man on reality TV, took a hard punch Monday from a state pension board.

The board stripped Derrico of his $69,703 a year tax-free disability pension and declared him fit to return to work for the Hamilton Township police. The action was sparked by an investigative report by New Jersey Watchdog and NBC 4 New York two months ago.

“We had to stop his pension,” said Police and Firemen’s Retirement System board member John Sierchio. “Otherwise, this would go on in limbo forever. And he would be collecting a pension, not being disabled and pretty much laughing at everybody.”

Whether Hamilton wants Derrico back is another matter. At the time he retired in 2010, Derrico was under indictment on a felony charge of theft by receiving stolen property.

In a secretive deal, Mercer County Prosecutor Joseph Bocchini dropped the case after Derrico agreed to leave the Hamilton police and not seek re-employment there. As part of the bargain, the township also agreed to drop misconduct charges against Derrico. If he had been convicted or fired, Derrico could have lost his pension under state rules.

“In my opinion, if the prosecutor would have done his job, there wouldn’t be an issue here,” Sierchio said. “Your report caught them and now everybody has egg on their faces.”

Derrico’s disability pension was based on his claim he could no longer work as a patrolman because he had twice injured his leg while making arrests.

One year after retiring, Derrico was brawling on television as a cast member of “Bear Swamp Recovery”, a truTV cable network reality show on vehicle repossessions by the “baddest towing team in Jersey.”

During the “Monster Truck Showdown” episode, Derrico runs after a truck, pulls a man down from the driver’s seat, throws him to the ground and climbs into the cab. In another scene, Derrico is wrestling with opponents.

“Everything that you saw was all fake,” Derrico’s close friend and fellow cast member, P.J. Vinch, told NBC 4′s Chris Glorioso. “It was all staged. Nobody was exerting any physical activity. Nobody was actually fighting; it was mocked for TV.”

Yet it was real enough for the Police and Firemen’s Retirement System’s Board of Trustees and the state’s medical experts to determine Derrico is no longer disabled.

What will happen next in the Derrico saga is unclear.

Derrico may appeal the decision to the Office of Administrative Law, a process that could take months or even years. Depending on the outcome, Hamilton Township could be forced to rehire a cop with a troubled history. Or PFRS could get stuck paying $5,808 a month in disability checks to someone deemed not disabled.

“As far as we’re concerned, he’s no longer a Hamilton police officer and has no rights to be re-employed,” said John Ricci, township administrator.

Derrico did not attend the pension board meeting and could not be reached for comment.

“I’m sure this is going to wind up in court,” Sierchio said.

The Derrico controversy began April 13, 2010, with a burglary at a residence in Hamilton Township, a suburb of Trenton.

Three youths stole jewelry valued at several thousand dollars. Their next stop was Hiram’s Gold & Coin Exchange LLC, a Ewing Township enterprise dealing in precious metals and gems. The business was similar to a pawn shop, but did not offer collateralized loans.

Derrico moonlighted as a manager and co-owner at Hiram’s. According to state records, he was a principal in Hiram’s when the business formed in 2009. And the off-duty officer was behind the counter when the youths brought their loot to the store on North Olden Avenue.

Few questions asked, Derrico paid them roughly $1,000 for the whole bag of jewelry, one of the youths later told police.

The day after the burglary, police investigators went to Hiram’s to inquire about the stolen property. Derrico denied the youths had been at his store or that he bought anything from them.

Unknown to Derrico, the store had been under surveillance by Ewing police, who suspected burglars were using Hiram’s to fence stolen property, according to documents obtained by New Jersey Watchdog.

Confronted by photos of the youths entering the store, Derrico changed his story. Some of the jewelry was subsequently recovered – but not a platinum ring with a one-karat diamond valued at $5,500, according to the burglary victims.

The Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office and Hamilton Township began an internal investigation. The following month, Derrico was indefinitely suspended from his police job. The administrative charges against him included misconduct and untruthfulness.

A grand jury subsequently indicted Derrico July 14, 2010, on a charge of third-degree theft by receiving stolen property, an offense punishable by up to five years in prison.

Derrico already had been planning to leave the Hamilton Police Deparatment, but under a completely different circumstance.

One month before the burglary, Derrico applied for accidental disability retirement – an especially generous type of pension that would pay him two-thirds of his $104,555 annual salary, tax-free, for the rest of his life.

Derrico told authorities his leg was injured while apprehending suspects on July 31, 2009, and again on Jan. 16, 2010. The incidents were detailed in his state pension file, obtained by New Jersey Watchdog under the Open Public Records Act.

Following the first scuffle, Derrico stated “my left leg felt like rubber and felt like it was asleep.” Six months later, the officer reported “my left leg gave out on me” when he tried to arrest a suspect at a house party.

“I feel my injury will prohibit me from doing my job safely and at the level needed, it will put me or other officers in danger,” Derrico concluded.

Details about Derrico’s diagnosis, treatment and disability evaluation were omitted from the records released by the state Treasury’s Division of Pensions and Benefits. The agency determined those documents are exempt from public disclosure.

Disability retirements are epidemic in New Jersey, where 5,447 former police and fire officials collected $196 million from state pension coffers last year, according to state Treasury data. Nearly one in five PFRS retirees receive disability pay.

“It’s astronomical – that’s crazy,” said Sierchio, a Bloomfield police detective. “Almost 20 percent of our membership retires on disability. The other 80 percent are still working, paying the bills for these guys.”

There is a strong economic incentive for police officials to make suspicious and possibly fraudulent claims, but the state does little or nothing to stop the abuses, Sierchio said.

“The State of New Jersey has an $80 billion pension system, and we have zero investigators,” he said. “We have nobody watching our money.”

The secret seal

Disabled or not, Derrico’s grand jury indictment threatened his plans to start collecting a pension at age 43.

“The receipt of retirement benefits is expressly conditioned upon the rendering of honorable service by a public officer or employee,” states the PFRS handbook. “Your benefits may be reduced or forfeited if you are convicted of a crime in any way related to your employment, or if you are suspended or dismissed from your employment.”

Fortunately for Derrico, PFRS did not find out about the indictment until after his pension was approved.

The Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office ignored a state law that requires it to report indictments of public employees to the Division of Criminal Justice.

“We did not receive any notification of an indictment on Derrico,” DCJ spokesman Peter Aseltine told New Jersey Watchdog.

As a result, DCJ was unable to pass along the information to pension authorities.

“We had no idea he was under indictment,” said Sierchio, chair of the pension board when Derrico’s retirement was granted on Sept. 9, 2010.

He said it would not have been approved if the trustees had known.

Derrico used his status as a retiree to convince the Mercer County prosecutor to dismiss the indictment and Hamilton to end its disciplinary procedures. All charges against Derrico were dropped on Sept. 23, 2010.

By the time pension officials finally learned about the case against Derrico, it was too late.

“If the indictment is dropped and there are no charges, we can’t hold the gentleman responsible for anything,” Sierchio said. “The prosecutor cut a deal for whatever reason, and now the taxpayers and pension system are paying the bill. The township cut a deal to get the officer off the job, so taxpayers and the pension system are paying the bill.”

Derrico’s disability did not stop him from becoming a rough-and-tumble character on reality television.

Vinch, his associate at Hiram’s, had another business venture – a repo service called Bear Swamp Recovery. In 2011, it became the focus of a reality show bearing the same name.

The program featured Vinch and Derrico as members of a repo crew, seizing vehicles from debtors in confrontational situations. It lasted for a season of 13 episodes on truTV, a cable network of Turner Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Time Warner.

The show debuted the year after Derrico received his first monthly disability pension check from New Jersey.

“He’s a model citizen; he really and truly is,” said Vinch in Derrico’s defense. “To even think he would do something that’s not above board is disgraceful.”

Meanwhile, a bill that would create a unit to investigate pension fraud has languished in the state Legislature for the past year.

The proposed reform – S-1913 in the Senate and A-3074 in the Assembly – also would tighten up the qualifications for disability retirements. In both chambers, the reform has been stuck in committees.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/nebraska-board-does-about-face-on-transgender-policy","Nebraska Board Does About-Face on Transgender Policy","Turnabout, it seems, doesn’t always equal fair play.

The head of a Nebraska board that governs school activities said the board has not yet voted on a policy protecting the rights of transgender athletes, a statement that appears to contradict what she told national media outlets such as the New York Times and Deadspin.

The group’s executive director, Rhonda Blanford-Green, had said the Nebraska School Activities Association passed a policy in December outlining a process to allow transgender student-athletes to change teams.

Not so.

She now says her board of directors did not vote on the policy, as reported, and will do so in August.

Nebraska Watchdog reported last week the NSAA passed the policy, which sets up procedures for schools if transgendered students want to participate on the team they identify with – if a male student identifies as a female and wants to play on the girls’ team, for example.

But a member of the NSAA’s board of directors – the entity that supposedly passed the policy – told Nebraska Watchdog on Monday the transgender policy was discussed at the December meeting, but wasn’t voted on.

“We did not take action,” said Bob Reznicek, superintendent of schools for Boys Town schools. “Our understanding was we were going to vote on it in the spring.”

Reznicek, who has served on the NSAA board for 13 years, said the board typically discusses a policy one month and votes on it the next. He said he got a brief email from Blanford-Green on Monday confirming there was no official vote taken, so a vote would be taken at the board’s Aug. 21 meeting.

That is contrary to what Blanford-Green told multiple reporters. But this story has been odd from the start.

Stories about Nebraska’s transgender policy first appeared in the national press while few people in Nebraska seemed to know anything about it, until Nebraska Watchdog’s report came out last week. The policy was nowhere to be found in NSAA agendas or meeting minutes, although the policy itself could be found online.

But that online post has since been removed and replaced with a message from Blanford-Green saying the policy will be on the board’s August agenda to “eliminate any confusion on the transparency of the association or myself to formally address procedures for transgender participation within our board procedures.”

After other Nebraska media followed up on our story late last week, Blanford-Green told a Lincoln Journal Star reporter she proposed the policy to the board in November because she wanted to get it in the books before she appeared at a national conference on transgender student participation in sports.

Then, she told the Omaha World-Herald although the policy is on the books, it doesn’t appear in meeting minutes and would come back for “another vote” July 11 “to ensure that it is placed on official meeting records.” That date apparently has since been pushed back to Aug. 21.

Reznicek tells a different story.

“Yes, we did discuss it, but no, we did not vote on it,” he said. “Whenever we take official action, it should be in our official minutes.”

Whether this is the first or second vote on the policy – which apparently is up for debate – does he think it will pass?

“I don’t want to speculate on that,” he said. “I don’t think anybody’s necessarily opposed to it.”

When asked why the vote wasn’t recorded in meeting minutes, Blanford-Green told Nebraska Watchdog via email she wasn’t sure. “There was a discussion and acceptance,” she wrote, and the situation “will be rectified.”

Asked about Reznicek’s statement that the policy had not yet been approved, Blanford-Green said, “You spoke with a board member and they have provided you with the answer. I don’t think an additional comment from me on a board member’s response is necessary.”

The other seven NSAA board members did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.

Blanford-Green was an 11-time All-American sprinter and hurdler at the University of Nebraska in the early 1980s. She left her job as associate commissioner of Colorado’sHigh School Activities Association, where she helped craft a similar policy in 2009, to take the top job in Nebraska last July.

Meanwhile, as awareness of the policy has spread in Nebraska, so has opposition. Al Riskowski, executive director of the Nebraska Family Council, said his group would oppose such a policy.

“I think parents should be involved in this type of a decision,” he said. “We certainly would hope that the board would open up public comment in regard to such a controversial policy.”

If a transgendered girl is allowed to participate on a girls’ team, that could be an unfair advantage and “becomes problematic when it comes to bathrooms, locker rooms and showers,” Riskowski said.

“Do we want little girls or young women exposed to a boy in their locker room shower?” he said. “If you’re going to change such a policy, parents should really be involved with such a shift. There’s a lot of parents who are going to care very deeply.”

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/progressives-blame-israel-for-muslim-persecution-of-christians-around-the-world","Progressives Blame Israel for Muslim Persecution of Christians Around the World","What’s worse than the silence of Western Christians concerning the Muslim persecution of their coreligionists in the Islamic world? Cynically exploiting that persecution for a political agenda—in the case of a recent “Daily Beast article”, to excoriate the state of Israel and its supporters.

Titled “Why Won’t the West Defend Middle Eastern Christians?” and written by Diarmaid MacCulloch, a Fellow of St. Cross College, the article touches on the persecution of Christians, but primarily as a springboard to attack American Christian support for Israel. Consider the following excerpt:

… one of the silences which I find most frustrating is precisely the lack of noise from Western Christians about the fate of ancient Christianities in the Middle East. At the heart of the problems in the Middle East is seven decades of unresolved conflict between Israel and Palestine…

Yes, Western silence vis-à-vis the plight of Mideast Christians is as real as it is frustrating, but exactly how is MacCulloch able to jump to the conclusion that the Arab-Israeli conflict is “the heart” of the problem?

What about the well-documented Islamic doctrines that codify the suppression and persecution of Christians and other non-Muslims?

What about the documented fact that Christians under Islam have been persecuted for more than 1,300 years before the existence of the state of Israel, in complete accordance to said doctrines?

What about the fact that Christians are currently being persecuted in every corner of the Islamic world, as documented in my monthly “Muslim Persecution of Christians” series—including diverse countries such as Pakistan, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, and every corner of Africa—and not just the Middle East?

Surely this is the true “heart of the problem”—and not the tiny and relatively new state of Israel.

Of course, to thinkers like MacCulloch, all the above points concerning Islamic hostility for Christians are not open to consideration, for they portray Islam in a negative light and so must be false (see Crucified Again: Exposing Islam’s New War on Christians for abundant documentation otherwise.)

Instead, MacCulloch offers politically correct boilerplate statements, such as: “Christians are scapegoated for their faith by an extremist militant minority of Muslims, who betray their own religion by intolerance, and who make other Muslims ashamed of what is happening.”

Indeed, it is MacCulloch who betrays himself by characterizing Islam as a “tolerant” faith when any moderately objective reading of doctrine and history—made manifest in daily headlines—all prove the reverse.

Likewise, instead of delving into and exposing the true “heart of the problem,” MacCulloch critiques Protestant eschatology and U.S. support for Israel, the consequences of which “have been particularly dire for the traditional Christianities of the Middle East.”

It would have been more useful and sincere if he had addressed more glaring questions, for example:

MacCulloch is correct about one thing: many Muslims do hate Israel. But that hate, far from prompting the persecution of Christians, is actually a byproduct of the same hostility Islamic supremacism engenders for all non-Muslims. The reason it is much more viral for Israel is because the Jewish state is in a unique position of authority over Muslims, as opposed to vulnerable Christian minorities (as fully explained in this article).

The theme of silence permeates MacCulloch’s “Daily Beast” article—specifically, that Western Christians are silent concerning the plight of their persecuted brethren. This silence is true and troubling—and many mainstream American Protestant denominations are certainly guilty of it.

However, instead of exploiting the sufferings of Christian minorities simply to scapegoat Israel—ironically a nation that is in an existential struggle against the very same ideology and forces that persecute Christians—it may have been better for MacCulloch himself to be silent.

This just in: The military-industrial complex is a powerful force in Washington, D.C. politics.

It’s not exactly new information, but the debate over Syria seems to have exposed — once again — the degree to which defense contractors and others standing to profit from the United States launching missiles at a foreign country.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday voted 10-7 in favor of authorizing military action in Syria. The vote was the first step to a full Senate vote to authorize President Barack Obama’s plan to bomb the war-torn nation.

According to an analysis by MapLight, which tracks lobbying and campaign contributions in Congress, senators who voted in favor of the resolution received, on average, 83 percent more money from defense contractors and other defense interests than senators who voted against the resolution.

The MapLight analysis looked at campaign contributions between 2007 and 2012.

In raw dollars, the 10 senators voting in favor of the military authorization received a total of $728,000, for an average of $72,800.

It’s hardly surprising that uber-hawk Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., led the way with more than $176,000 in contributions from defense interests. (McCain, during the same hearing, was caught playing video poker on his smart phone).

On the other side, the seven senators who opposed military action in Syria received a total of $278,000 from defense interests, for an average of $39,000 per senator.

It’s worth noting that every senator on the committee received at least $14,000 from the defense industry between 2007 and 2012, according to MapLight. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, was the low man on that totem pole.

Of course, it’s easy to spend lots of money on politicians when your business is making missiles that sell for $1.45 million apiece.

Here’s the whole rundown:

Marijuana moratoriums appear to be the new bureaucratic move for cities uncomfortable with laws legalizing cannabis.

A growing number of Washington state cities are adopting moratoriums on legal weed sales as the Washington State Liquor Control Board carves out regulations and red tape around the industry. Despite 56 percent of voters approving legal weed in Washington in November, several cities are not eager for the new market to get moving.

Several cities, including the state capital of Olympia, have already enacted marijuana moratoriums, as others are considering them. Apparently, cities need more time to add regulations and zoning to the new marijuana laws.

“I’m not looking to limit access to medical marijuana for those patients who need it. However, collective gardens are new under the law,” Kent Council President Jamie Perry said in a press release. “This moratorium allows us the time to plan and zone for them before the law goes into effect. We need to do this right.”

But fear not, cannabis defenders, communities cannot ignore I-502 and the will of the voters indefinitely.

“There’s nothing in I-502 that allows a community to opt out,” Washington state Liquor Control Board spokesman Brian Smith said. If a marijuana retailer meets the state’s requirement for a license then it will be granted.

But, there’s a catch. They will also have to comply with local zoning codes and regulations, leaving the door open to miles of red tape and trouble for the newly emerging industry. That could lead to lawsuits and the continued dominance of the black market.

“There could be friction there going forward,” Smith said. “No one wants to see litigation.”

The liquor control board filed updated rule revisions to the law and is expected to finalize them by December. Smith said the moratoriums are understandable given the time it’s taking the state to regulate the industry.

“Many of them are taking a look and see what our rules look like and that’s appropriate,” he said.

One of the major themes to emerge from this week’s national conference of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) in Los Angeles is a push to expand union organizing beyond the traditional collective bargaining agreement and into every workplace.

And after some brief flirting, the AFL-CIO is ready to go steady with “workers centers,” which are popping up around the nation to help organize workers in the service sector. Members of the AFL-CIO, an umbrella group for dozens of labor unions, approved a resolution this week to establish a more formal connection between the union and the workers centers that it has, in many cases, helped to start.

“The labor movement cannot be confined within bargaining units defined by government agencies or limited to workplaces where a majority of employees votes ‘Yes’ in the face of a ruthless campaign by their employer to deny them representation,” the resolution reads.

The union said it would seek to organize workers who are not in traditional collective bargaining agreements and would “mobilize these new members in electoral and other political efforts and in support of organizing drives and collective bargaining campaigns.”

To achieve that end, the AFL-CIO pledged to work more closely with “workers centers” and with foundations providing seed money to those centers.

In many cases, these workers centers have morphed into front groups for unions by using Occupy-style tactics and threats of lawsuits to make employers comply with their demands, despite the lack of a collective bargaining agreement.

Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, echoed the “big tent” message during his keynote remarks to the conference Monday night.

“All over America, workers are organizing in all kinds of ways, and they call their unity by all kinds of names — workers’ unions, associations, centers, networks,” he said.

As Watchdog.org previously reported, one of those centers – the Restaurant Opportunity Center, or ROC United, which was launched in New York City in 2001 – has been at the forefront of a recent wave of protests in major cities, attempting to draw attention to low-wage sectors.

Saru Jayaraman, co-founder of ROC-United, was a featured speaker at the AFL-CIO conference this week.

Previously, Trumka specifically praised the work of Jayaraman and ROC-United for organizing workers in New York and dozens of other cities.

It’s probably no surprise unions are looking to broaden their horizons. Union membership has been on the decline nationally for a few decades, particularly in the private sector.

“If I were within that organization, I would probably be trying to do the exactly what they are doing,” said Jade West, senior vice president for the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.

West said the unions’ declining influence has little effect on the daily lives of most employers, but the rise of workers centers and their organizing tactics is a real threat to workers and businesses.

In 2012, about 7 million private-sector workers were members of a labor union, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. That’s half of the 14 million private-sector labor union members in 1980.

Growth in public sector unions — they now account for more than 50 percent of all union membership, up from just 28 percent in 1980 — has helped the labor movement continue its powerful influence in politics, but it has also changed how the movement works.

Instead of fighting for weekends, better working conditions and a decent wage for industrious, blue-collar workers, unions today are more likely to be defending the right of a 50-year-old white-collar worker to retire early with full pension benefits until death.

In 2009, public-sector unions outnumbered their private-sector counterparts for the first time ever.

The move toward workers centers and other low-pay, long-hours, service-sector employees brings unions back toward their original purpose. Plus, it comes with the added benefit of more workers to mobilize in electoral efforts, as the AFL-CIO indicated in its resolution.

West said many workers are no longer looking for a 25-year job with a single company that ends with a gold watch and a pension, leaving unions to scramble for a new generation of members.

“They have almost become an anachronism,” said West. I don’t think the workforce really sees the need for a union.”

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/jobs-report-is-fraud-greatest-ponzi-scheme-in-history-continues","Jobs Report is Fraud, Greatest Ponzi Scheme in History Continues","I am a small businessman at “ground zero.” I don’t need Obama, the Fed, economists, or the media to tell me how the economy is doing. I live it. And I’m telling you, we’re all being lied to. The economy is not getting better, it’s getting worse.

Back in late 2007 and early 2008, I publicly predicted (numerous times) that we were entering the deepest recession since the 1929 Great Depression. At the exact moment I wrote about this, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was testifying in front of Congress that the economy was fine, we were not in recession, and there was little threat of a serious economic decline. It turned out he was dead wrong about everything. A small businessman always knows.

In my national bestselling book, “The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide” I predicted all of this: the decline of the economy, the death of jobs, the disaster of Obamacare, and the murder of the middle class. It’s all happening in front of our very eyes.

Here’s what I know. We have a jobs disaster. The numbers are sobering. Yet the mainstream media is reporting the November jobs report as if “happy days are here again.” Every media headline reports a “fantastic jobs report.” And, establishment D.C. Republicans are so dumb they accept government manipulated numbers as “fact.”

The truth is…it’s all a lie. Obama propaganda. A massive cover up. A Ponzi scheme aided and abetted by the Obama-adoring, Kool-Aid drinking mainstream media.

First, are the numbers even real? We recently found out in that in the run-up to the 2012 Presidential election, Census Bureau employees purposely reported hundreds of thousands of new jobs that did not exist. They created a false narrative that the economy was improving to fraudulently re-elect Obama. What makes you think that’s not still happening?

Why would you believe the jobs report from the same government that told you, “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it” “Obamacare will make your insurance rates go down”? and more recently, “the Obamacare web site is fixed.” All lies.

Why would you believe anything coming from an Obama administration so corrupt that it sent the IRS to intimidate a stage-4 cancer victim within days of his appearance on “Fox News” criticizing Obamacare.

But, let’s assume the 7 percent November unemployment number the national media has made its headline is accurate. Why isn’t the media also reporting the government’s own U6 figure of 13.2 percent? The U6 measures unemployment combined with underemployment, a stat that every expert agrees is the more accurate picture of true unemployment. If a Republican was President, the 13.2 percent figure would be trumpeted in every headline.

[sharequote align=”center”]Why isn’t the media also reporting the government’s own U6 figure of 13.2 percent? [/sharequote]

But, this is only the start of the Ponzi scheme. Assuming that over 200,000 new jobs were created in November, why doesn’t the media report on what kind of jobs are being created? Are these jobs that pay enough to live a middle class lifestyle and feed your family, or crummy part-time jobs that don’t even allow employees to eat without receiving food stamps? The answer of course is the latter.

Once analyzed in detail, November’s jobs numbers will undoubtedly be exactly the same as the rest of 2013. Respected economist and author John Lott reported recently that 96 percent of the jobs created in this Obama economy since January are crummy part-time jobs.

Respected billionaire businessman and publisher Mort Zuckerman disagrees. He says only 88 percent of the jobs created this year under Obama are crummy part-time jobs.

No matter which figure you believe, the Obama “recovery” is a mirage. This economy is only doing well if you want a job at McDonalds.

Even worse for taxpayers, of the few full-time jobs created, almost half are government jobs.

Folks, Obama is using your taxpayer money to create government jobs that actually hurt the economy and raise your taxes. Your typical government employee collects more money in retirement than they made while working. Every government job is a gigantic net loss for taxpayers. This is a disaster. This is one of the major factors for how America wound up $17 trillion in debt – with a massive unfunded liability for government employee pensions. We desperately need private sector jobs, not government jobs.

[sharequote align=”center”]We desperately need private sector jobs, not government jobs. [/sharequote]

But this is no mistake. Obama is brilliant. He wants more and more government jobs – because government employees will always protect their jobs by doing Obama’s bidding (including reporting fraudulent jobs numbers at the Census Bureau, or persecuting Obama’s critics at the IRS). And, of course, they will always vote loyally Democrat and pay union dues (which turn into bribes that fund Democrat candidates).

How bad is the private sector economy? A new study shows 41 of 50 states have lost private sector jobs under Obama.

But even that doesn’t tell the full story. I’ll make an educated guess that 80 percent of the few private sector jobs actually created under Obama belong to Big Business. Obama’s policies have purposely rewarded his backers in big business, while gutting small business, the economic sector where Americans can achieve upward mobility. If you want people to be self sufficient, reward and encourage small business. If you want people to become dependent on government, create a “crony capitalist” system that puts government in bed with big business.

Small business drives the American Dream. Like my father, who went from butcher to butcher store owner, and then put his two children through Ivy League university. Jobs at McDonalds, Home Depot and WalMart are a place to get a start, but only a socialist like Obama (whose goal is to make everyone dependent on big government by wiping out the middle class), would consider creating low-paying jobs for big business a success. Next of course, Obama dreams of giving amnesty to 10 to 15 million illegal immigrants, guaranteeing (due to competition) nothing but low wage jobs for decades to come.

Lastly, the biggest media scam of all is allowing Obama to report unemployment as “improving,” when the major reason for an improved unemployment number is due to people dropping out of the labor force to go on welfare, food stamps and disability. In October, a record 932,000 people simply stopped looking for work.

That’s what causes each month’s “drop” in unemployment. It isn’t jobs, it’s lost souls giving up because it’s impossible to find a job in Obama’s America, or it pays more to sit at home collecting welfare.

Facts don’t lie:

Along with the U6, the real unemployment number that matters is the Labor Force participation Rate. It is at the lowest level since the 1970’s.

The population of America has increased by 16 million in the past seven years, but there are 1.1 million less people working.

More Americans now receive entitlements than work full-time.

More Americans are on food stamps than population of Spain or Greece.

The 46 million Americans in poverty is twice as large as the population of Syria.

The truth is America is experiencing an “Obama Great Depression.” Obama is the greatest jobs killer in U.S. history. And things will only get worse from here. Or did you think a bad economy with no jobs would get better now that Obamacare has been unleashed on the nation?

Obama has attacked business with $1.8 trillion in new regulations for 2014, massive new Obamacare taxes, dramatic increases in the cost of health insurance, and to top it off- millions of individuals and small businesses are losing their insurance altogether. And in the midst of this, you thought the economy would improve? You believed the lies, fabrications, and manipulations coming from this administration? I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn.

Things are getting worse, not better. But Obama, the Fed, government economists, and the Obama-adoring mainstream media can’t tell you the truth. Or we’d have rioting, unrest, and perhaps even revolution in the streets. So they just keep lying and denying, while sending out government checks like candy to soothe the masses.

So the greatest Ponzi scheme in world history continues unabated.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/taxpayers-burned-as-nea-funded-art-goes-up-in-flames","Taxpayers Burned As NEA-Funded Art Goes Up in Flames","by Tom Steward/Watchdog Minnesota

ST. PAUL–It wasn’t long ago that burning works of art, whether books or otherwise, was frowned upon. But it was in vogue for at least a few minutes at 2 a.m. Sunday in St. Paul when a Twin Cities sculptor’s life-sized model of a local Marcel Breuer-designed house went up in flames before thousands at an outdoor art festival.

The performance, entitled “Celebration, Love, Loss,” was fueled in part by a $15,000 National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grant.

University of Minnesota art professor Chris Larson originally hoped to float and burn the 1800-square-foot cardboard and wood re-creation on the Mississippi River.

“Set on a solid floating platform, the house will float on the river and then be set on fire as a symbolic act of celebration and destruction,” states the NEA grant description. After facing objections, Larson accepted an offer to torch his creation at the Northern Spark art festival.

“The purpose of the piece is kind of his title, which is celebration, love, loss,” said Mira LaCous, the lead pyro-technician for the exhibition. “Kind of bringing it through that cycle of loss and burning it up so fast there’s hardly time to grieve.”

“Burning the Breuer replica is not an act of mourning,” according to the event website which lists the NEA and the Minnesota State Arts Board as sponsors. “Rather than a funeral pyre, it represents hope. The spectacular flame prevents melancholy arising from the loss of Modernist purity and rationality. Ruinous beauty burns to reveal new possibility—seeing through the high point of man-made perfection to the potentialities wrought through its destruction.”

The conflagration was the finale of the weekend event, which serves an outlet for art work typically not seen or staged in museums. Followers raved about the 15-minute flame-out on Northern Spark’s FaceBook page. “That was sweet!” wrote Nancy V. Lang. “Legitimately one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen,” said Joey Lusvardi.



The New York Times embraced the pyrotechnics with a 2,700-word spread, 23 photos and video in the Home and Garden section that dug for insight into Larson’s short-lived work. “Pressing him (Larson) to explain why he creates and obliterates houses ultimately seemed like asking the photographer Cindy Sherman why she takes so many pictures of herself. It’s what he does,” wrote reporter Michael Tortorello.

But the inferno ignited critics of wasteful government spending, who questioned the NEA’s priorities and noted the Minnesota State Arts Board’s taxpayer support of the festival through Legacy Grant funding. Minnesota received 28 NEA grants in 2013 totaling $877,500, eighth most among states.

“Burning through public money in the name of subsidized art is unfortunately common in Minnesota, but this once again demonstrates the folly of government involvement in funding of the arts,” said Jonathan Blake of the Freedom Foundation of Minnesota. “It’s hard to believe this money could not have been put to better use by a federal government deep in debt.”

When reached by phone, Larson said he would email Watchdog Minnesota a statement which had not arrived at the time of this post. But LaCous, who laced the doomed replica house with accelerants at a cost of a couple thousand dollars, says the explosive artwork was worth more than it cost the public.

“It got a lot of exposure, it got a lot of people thinking about art in a different way,” said LaCous. “I think the amount that was funded for that in the end was cheap.”

If art is truly in the eye of the beholder such as the taxpayer, what if there’s nothing left to behold except for ashes?

“The burned house persists not as a blank page but as a erased page, a palimpsest, a way to begin again,” explains the event website. “Architects always glean hope from ruination—to build on old foundations, but to build anew. Value is in the fire, the spectacle of ruin, and the release of potentiality. Therein resides hope.”

–

Want to further weaken an anemic economy that has been struggling to recover?

Kill coal.

At least freeze the construction of new coal-fired power plants.

That’s how the coal industry, congressional members from coal-producing and manufacturing-heavy states and some leading economists see as extreme new Environmental Protection Agency limits on greenhouse gases emitted by power plants.

The EPA is expected to release its revised, proposed caps on carbon dioxide output by Friday.

Sources tell Watchdog.org that EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy will unveil the proposal to journalists Friday morning at a National Press Club breakfast, where McCarthy will “highlight the administration’s commitment to carrying our President Obama’s Climate Action Plan to reduce carbon pollution and address the impacts of a changing climate.”

The limits are the first of their kind, a key piece of Obama’s drive for federal agencies to take on climate change, what the administration until recently billed as “global warming.”

The rumored details of the proposal are generating some dire predictions from industry insiders.

Jason Hayes, associate director of the American Coal Council, tells Watchdog.org the proposal is rumored to cap CO2 emissions at as low as 1,100 pounds per megawatt hour, and no higher than 1,500 pounds. EPA was asked to go back to the drawing board last year amid a firestorm of criticism after it proposed like standards for natural gas and coal-fired power plants, at 1,000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt hour.

The glitch, Hayes says, is the technology, mainly to capture carbon, doesn’t exist commercially to meet such rigid standards.

Prairie State Energy Campus, in Washington County, Ill., comes the closest to hitting the mark with its $1 billion investment in Best Available Control Technology. While the coal plant is said to be the cleanest coal-fueled power plant in Illinois and one of the cleanest in the world, its CO2 emission rate remains significantly higher than the potential new EPA limits.

Despite gains in natural gas and renewable energy output, coal still powers about 40 percent of U.S. electricity needs.

Development of coal-fired power plants doesn’t come cheap, and Hayes said unreasonable greenhouse gas limits on new and, eventually, existing coal facilities will kill investment.

That, industry officials assert, could be disastrous for an economy mired in slow job growth with an unemployment rate of 7.2 percent – down last month, mainly because 312,000 people just stopped looking for work.

The Washington, D.C.-based National Mining Association, which represents coal and mineral mining companies nationwide, warns the EPA’s limits could put in peril an industry that supports more than 800,000 jobs, many of them delivering wages well above state and national averages.

“That is the area that is really going to put this conversation at the forefront,” said NMA spokeswoman Nancy Gravatt. “This puts thousands of middle-class jobs at risk, and it’s akin to an energy tax on consumers. The hardest hit would be those on fixed incomes, like retirees.”

The average household already spends 20 percent of its disposable income on energy, Gravatt said. Unattainable CO2 regulations would only add to that energy burden, the mining spokeswoman asserts.

Also in the crosshairs, according to economic experts, the manufacturing sector, which has seen a resurgence in old industrial-heavy states like Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin. Gravatt said limiting coal would hit hard a sector the president has made a big show of supporting.

“When you look at the states with the highest percentage of coal-fired electricity, they tend to be states with the highest number of manufacturers,” she said.

Some damage already has been done in what Obama administration critics have labeled the president’s war on coal.

U.S. Rep. Keith Rothfus and U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania Republicans, and at least 11 of their colleagues in the Pennsylvania congressional delegation in July urged Obama to stop the EPA from finalizing its new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.

The letter was sent two days after a local energy provider announced it would close two of its Western Pennsylvania coal-fired power plants over concerns about the costs of complying with current and future regulations.

“(W)e learned that at least three hundred Western Pennsylvanians will lose their jobs because of the cost of complying with current and future regulations,” Rothfus said in a statement. “These hardworking moms and dads are losing their livelihoods and the ability to support their families and contribute to their communities. The disastrous impact of President Obama’s burdensome regulations on our communities underscores the need for regulatory reform, rather than more red tape.”

Nonsense, says Frank O’Donnell, president of environmental watchdog Clean Air Watch.

“In the real world, I’m not sure if these standards will have much, if any, impact. No one is really contemplating building new coal plants now,” he told Watchdog.org. O’Donnell added that the cost shifts in the energy market have made natural gas a more viable option for power plant developers.

“Coal was once the king of the hill, and now it is sliding to the bottom of the hill,” the environmentalist said.

The Obama administration plan includes funding for carbon capture technology, demanded for new coal-fired plants. Some $8 billion in tax credits would be on the table.

Stricter limits for new plants will drive stricter regulations on existing plants, where the real problem is, O’Donnell said.

“We hope the EPA will in fact proceed with these regulations in an expeditious fashion,” he said. “If they do, I see the health and environmental communities cheering very loudly for the president to move ahead and make this a positive part of his legacy.”

Coal industry officials say they welcome and support advancing cleaner standards. They just want the Obama administration to assign reasonable, achievable targets. If the rumored limits come to pass, Hayes said it would be tantamount to the government demanding General Motors build cars with fuel economies of 50 mph to 60 mph overnight.

Coal advocates remain hopeful the new EPA administrator lives up to a recent public relations description, which characterizes McCarthy as a “leading advocate for common-sense strategies to protect public health and the environment.”

–

A blowout win by Gov. Chris Christie in next week’s election might be great for his presidential ambitions in 2016.

Yet it probably won’t help his fellow Republicans win majorities in the New Jersey Legislature.

A Rutgers-Eagleton poll found that 50 percent of voters want Democrats to keep control of the Statehouse. Just 38 percent would prefer the GOP to take over in Trenton.

In contrast, Christie has a 24-point lead over his Democratic challenger. He leads Sen. Barbara Buono by 59 percent to 35 percent, according to the most recent Monmouth University poll of likely voters.

[sharequote align=”center”]Voters seem happy to split their tickets, with a Republican governor & a Democratic Legislature.[/sharequote]

“Right now, voters seem to be quite happy to split their tickets, supporting a Republican governor and a Democratic Legislature,” said David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton poll.

Christie’s campaign brags that 58 elected Democrats, including Sen. Brian Stack, D-Union City, have jumped on the bandwagon to publicly endorse him for re-election.

“This campaign – and these past three years – has been about bringing people together from both sides of the aisle to get real things done for the people of our state,” stated Christie in a release on his campaign’s web site.

While Christie postures as a bipartisan hero, Republican candidates who wish to ride the coattails of their party’s biggest figure may be left behind.

“While some individual races will be highly competitive and seats could change hands, Democrats seem to be where they need to be statewide,” Redlawsk said. “History suggests the GOP needs to be much closer in this generic ballot test to make major inroads across the state.”

All 120 seats in the Legislature are at stake on Nov. 5.

In the Senate, Democrats enjoy a 24-16 majority. The Republicans need a net gain of four seats to tie and five to take control.

In the Assembly, the score is 48-32. The GOP needs to add eight seats to pull even and nine to take the lead.

Conversely, the Democrats could gain veto-proof supermajorities by gaining three seats in the Senate and six seats in the Assembly.

Republicans have not held a majority in either chamber since 2001, when they controlled both the Assembly and Senate.

The Rutgers-Eagleton Poll was conducted Sept. 3-9 with a scientifically selected random sample of 925 New Jersey adults. Of these, 814 were registered voters. This telephone poll included 782 landline and 143 cell phone adults, all acquired through random digit dialing. The report focused on the preferences of 568 likely voters. The sampling margin of error was plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.

The Monmouth University poll was conducted Oct. 10-12 with a statewide random sample of 1,606 likely voters drawn from a list of registered voters who voted in at least two of the last four general elections, including 824 contacted by interactive voice response on a landline telephone, 447 contacted by a live interviewer on a landline telephone and 335 contacted by a live interviewer on a cell phone. The sampling margin of error was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.

–

A number of people on both sides of the gay marriage debate in Hawaii say the current draft of Senate Bill 1, which would legalize same-sex ceremonies, infringes on religious liberty.

Civil rights attorney Jim Hochberg, who as president of Hawaii Family Advocates is leading the coalition effort to let people vote on the issue, said if Hawaii passes this bill as written, the state will be “among the worst for protecting religious freedom.”

While SB1 protects religious clergy from liability for refusing to solemnize a same sex marriage, the legislation offers no exemption to non-clergy members, such as judges, Hochberg said.

SB1 also fails to protect religious organizations from liability if they decline requests to use their properties for same sex celebrations, Hochberg said, because to qualify for the protection, a church must “not make its facilities or grounds available to the general public for solemnization of any marriage celebration for a profit.”

“How will the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission determine whether the church qualifies? Will a financial audit of the church be necessary?” Hochberg asked. “The language is simply not clear. We do not know. It will ultimately be sorted out by the courts. And that leaves churches vulnerable and at risk.”

Wayne Cordeiro, head of New Hope Oahu, the largest church in the state with 42 branches in Hawaii and 138 around the world, said the lack of this protection in this bill is “unconstitutional” and “forces religious people to violate their own faith.”

“We do not judge them (gay couples) for their lifestyles for that is their chosen decisions, but we do not agree with a law which mandates that we set aside our conscience in order to advocate an immoral lifestyle and be forced, under penalty, to service their ceremonies,” Cordeiro said. “This is an easy and understandable compromise our governmental leaders should allow.”

Five noted law professors told Hawaii lawmakers this week they agree SB 1 will infringe on religious liberties,and the bill should be amended.

While the professors expressed support for same-sex marriage, they warned careless or overly aggressive drafting could create a whole new set of problems for the religious liberty of those believers who cannot conscientiously participate in implementing the new regime.

“The gain for human liberty will be severely compromised if same-sex couples now force religious dissenters to violate their conscience in the same way that those dissenters, when they had the power to do so, used to force same-sex couples to hide their sexuality,” the law professors wrote.

The professors said the challenge for any bill is to “equalize civil marriage while preserving religious control over religious marriage”, and they said SB 1 “has not yet accomplished the task.”

“A bill that addresses only solemnization would do less to protect religious liberty than any other state that has enacted same-sex marriage by legislation,” the professors wrote.

[sharequote align=”center”]This fails to protect religious organizations if they decline requests for same-sex celebrations[/sharequote]

One of them, Douglas Laycock of theUniversity of Virginia, toldWatchdog.org he doesn’t know that any one of the 14 states that have legalized gay marriages has ideal legislation, and there have been last-minute compromises, and last-minute drafting, sometimes with glitches, nearly everywhere.

However, he believes the best provision is in New Hampshire, because it protects religious organizations with respect to solemnizing, celebrating or promoting marriages when doing so would violate their religious tenets.

“This reaches services to the marriage after the wedding, such as marriage counseling and married student housing. Too many states have focused only on the wedding, which misses much of the problem,” said Laycock, who also teaches religious studies at UVA.

Hawaii already has a civil union law, passed in 2010.

As many as 12,000 people on three islands turned out Monday at a five-hour rally to protest the bill. The massive crowd that gathered at the Capitol in Honolulu chanted and waved signs that said “Let the people decide,” and religious and political leaders spoke at the event.

The Senate Judiciary and Labor Committee listened to testimony from supporters and opponents of gay marriage for 12 hours Monday before passing the bill out of committee to the full Senate by a vote of 5-2. The early testimony count was running about 40 percent in support of legalization, and 60 percent in opposition, according to committee chairman Clayton Hee.

The bill is expected to easily pass the Senate on Wednesday, and go to the House on Thursday, where the judiciary and finance committees will hold a hearing.

Should the bill pass the House without changes, Gov. Neil Abercrombie, who called lawmakers into special session specifically for this purpose, will sign it into law.

Thanks to new regulations that are part of the federal Affordable Care Act, better know as Obamacare, patients will be asked to disclose more personal information to their doctors — including how often they have sex and with how many sexual partners.

And once they do, it won’t really be personal information any more.

One provision of the new Obamacare law will have doctors asking their patients about their sex lives and history of drug use, even if such information is completely unrelated to why the patient is seeking medical treatment, according to a report in Monday’s New York Post. Christina Sandefur, a lawyer for the Goldwater Institute, an Arizona-based conservative think tank challenging the Affordable Care Act in federal court, said the arrangement is a violation of patients’ privacy rights.

“Once you’ve shared your information with a private third party, the Supreme Court has ruled that is fair game for the government,” she told Watchdog.org, noting the recent disclosures of data sharing between the National Security Agency and Google, Facebook and other online services.

Doctors and hospitals who refuse to participate could be cut-off from some federal funds, and individuals who decline to share sensitive information may have to pay the fines — taxes, according to the Supreme Court — outlined in the federal health care law.

“This is nasty business,” New York cardiologist Dr. Adam Budzikowski told the Post.

Budzikowski called the sex questions “insensitive, stupid and very intrusive.”

The president’s “reforms” aim to turn doctors into government agents, pressuring them financially to ask questions they consider inappropriate and unnecessary, and to violate their Hippocratic Oath to keep patients’ records confidential, the Post reported.

Thanks to laws that protect the confidentiality of doctor-patient conversations — in the same way conversations with your lawyer or your priest are considered off-the-record — people generally are more open with their doctors than with friends and family.

That’s a good thing for both doctors and patients. Privileged communication means patients will give honest answers and doctors can get vital information.

But in the new age of Obamacare, doctors will have to ask about personal details patients may not want to share. Then, that information goes into an electronic personal file, which can be shared between doctors, hospitals and other treatment centers.

The connectivity is supposed to help reduce waiting times and get patients faster treatment under Obamacare, but some worry about the tremendous potential for personal information to be stolen or improperly shared.

In reviewing New York’s state-level system of electronic medical records, the New York chapter of the ACLU concluded that “there are significant flaws in the state’s current privacy and security policies and procedures governing computer networks for sharing electronic medical records.”

They’re not the only ones raising concerns.

In August, the federal Department of Health and Human Services said it needed more time to ensure the software to be used for the federal insurance exchanges was secure enough to keep patients’ private information would not be compromised.

And those concerns seem to be well-founded: just last week, the Minnesota health insurance exchange was victimized by a security breach leaking data for 2,400 insurance brokers.

Other parts of the Obamacare roll-out are also generating privacy concerns.

In a letter sent to HHS last month, 12 state attorneys general said they were worried about the trustworthiness of the Obamacare “navigators” being hired by states with federal money, as Florida Watchdog reported at the time.

The navigators are supposed to help low-income individuals understand the complexities of the Affordable Care Act and how to use the health insurance exchanges.

“It is inevitable that HHS’s vague ‘standards’ will result in improperly screened or inadequately trained personnel. These individuals will be more prone to misappropriate, accidentally or intentionally, the private data of consumers,” the letter said.

Patients need to defend their own privacy by refusing to answer the intrusive social-history questions. If you need to confide something pertaining to your treatment, ask your doctor about keeping two sets of books so that your secret stays in the office, the Post advised in its article.

“Doctors take the Hippocratic Oath seriously and won’t be offended,” the author of the Post article, Betsy McCaughey, said.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/this-weeks-fights-in-congress-defense-spending-and-energy","This Weeks Fights in Congress: Defense Spending and Energy","The National Defense Authorization Act will probably be the last major bill to come before the Senate this year. This will set off an unpredictable scramble for last-minute amendments from senators looking for votes on a wide array of issues. Conservatives need to follow the process closely, as many of the amendments will be non-germane to the defense bill itself.

National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)

This week, the Senate will be debating the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the bill (S. 1197) that reauthorizes all military and defense-related programs at a price-tag of over $600 billion. This is very late to be passing the Fiscal Year 2013 authorization, as the House already passed its version in June. The NDAA debate will provide senators with an opportunity to offer sundry amendments – both germane and non-germane to defense and foreign policy issues.

Here are some of the possible amendments that could come to the floor this week:

Minimum Wage

Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) wants to offer his minimum wage bill as an amendment. The bill ( S. 460) would raise the minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is planning to respond by offering the RAISE Act to counter the wage mandates.

Under current labor laws, employers are actually hamstrung by maximum wage restrictions, limiting wages to the caps stipulated in union contracts. Rubio’s bill would eliminate those restrictions, thereby exposing the Democrat hypocrisy for setting maximum wage restrictions and then demanding a hike in the minimum wage.

Let the free market work.

NSA Domestic Spying

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is working on an amendment to make it easier for Americans to be granted standing in a federal court to challenge the NSA surveillance program when the individual feels he was placed under surveillance.

Sexual Assault in the Military

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) wants a vote on her amendment to change the way sexual assault cases are handled within the military chain of command.

Her bill would strip commanders of the ability to prosecute sexual assault cases and hand them to military lawyers. Among other things, the bill would also grant a special council to victims, eliminate the statute of limitations, and establish a civilian oversight board.

While everyone agrees that this is a pervasive problem that must be solved immediately, it would be wise for the politicians to look at some of the social engineering in the military. The Obama administration has made an end-run around Congress to place women in direct ground combat with men.

In general, the military has been moving more and more towards a co-ed structure for everything. Aside for clamping down on prosecutions of sexual assault, it would be prudent for Congress to study the influence of the co-ed structure and whether it helps or harms the fight against sexual assaults in the service.

Energy

The House will take a slight detour this week and focus on three energy policy bills.

On Tuesday, the House will consider H.R. 1965, the Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act. This bill, sponsored by Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.), would force the Department of Interior to decide on whether to issue a permit for onshore drilling within 60 days of the request. It would also limit the department’s ability to restrict lands for drilling wells and would impose a fine on those who lodge frivolous lawsuits against drilling.

On Wednesday, the House will consider H.R. 2728, the Protecting States’ Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act, sponsored by Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas). This bill would block an impending Department of Interior requirement that fracking companies disclose the chemicals used in their drilling process in states that already have their own requirements and oversight. Over 99 percent of the fracking process consists of merely water and sand.

On Thursday, the House will consider H.R. 1900, the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act, sponsored by Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.). This bill would expedite the process of certification, licensing, and permitting for any pipeline project.

These are all good bills that directly address the federal government’s obstruction of domestic energy production. While Republicans are on the topic of energy they might want to push a repeal of the ethanol mandate. The mandate has become so unworkable and counterproductive that even Obama’s EPA was forced to reduce the targeted renewable fuels standard for this year.

Now would be a good time for Republicans to stand with consumers against an onerous intervention that raises the price of food and fuel – all to benefit a couple of special interest groups.

On Nov. 5, 2009, as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan went about his murderous work of massacring 13 people and wounding 32 others. Some were families of fallen soldiers — many of whom lost their lives fighting in Afghanistan or Iraq — were there for a field trip at Fort Hood, Texas.

The plan was to take in a day at an on-base flight simulator. Things quickly changed when Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, began his rampage against unarmed soldiers at a Fort Hood medical deployment center.

“They were afraid for their lives with their children,” said Ami Neiberger-Miller, public affairs officer for the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, or TAPS, a national bereavement group for loved ones of fallen military members. “Basically they were locked in an office and had to stay in there for several hours.”

Hasan last month was unanimously convicted on 13 charges of premeditated murder and 32 charges of attempted premeditated murder. He has since been sentenced to die.

Six soldiers from Wisconsin were among the killed and wounded. The dead included Sgt. Amy Krueger, of Kiel, who joined the service in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and served in Afghanistan, and Capt. Russell Seager of Mount Pleasant.

Also killed was Pvt. Francheska Velez. She was 21 and pregnant when Hasan shot her down. Her father, Juan Velez told the court through an interpreter, “That man (Hasan) did not just kill 13 people, he killed 15. He killed my grandson and he killed me, slowly,” CBS News reported.

Hasan, who represented himself, sounded unmoved by the victims’ testimony, only interjecting at one point to tell the judge he was hungry.

“Given that it’s almost one o’clock, I move we break early for lunch,” he said.

It’s safe to say the families locked in that room for hours at Fort Hood in November 2009 were terrorized. The dead and wounded victims of Hasan’s assault surely felt terror, even if many were trained to handle combat. And nearly four years later, it would seem Juan Valez remains terrorized.

Yet, the government classifies the Fort Hood attack as a “workplace violence” incident, precluding military awards and benefits to soldiers who were killed or wounded in the deadliest base shooting in U.S. military history.

More than 100 members of the House want to change that designation.

They’ve introduced the bipartisan Honoring the Fort Hood Heroes Act, which would declare the attack at the Texas military installation an act of terror. The bill would require the Army to award Purple Hearts for soldiers and Secretary of Defense Medals of Freedom for civilians to victims, and it would allow victims and their families to be eligible for “appropriate combat-related benefits.”

“This terrible tragedy still looms in the recent memory for many of us,” U.S. Rep.Tom Petri (R-Wisc.), co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement sent out a day after a military contractor is alleged to have shot and killed 12 people and himself at the historic Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.

“It’s a shame these soldiers — who were attacked by a self-proclaimed enemy of the United States — cannot receive the medals and benefits they deserve because of the way the incident is classified. It’s bureaucratic and political,” Petri added. “This is an attack where our men and women in uniform lost their lives and have lingering effects from their injuries.”

U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, co-author of the bill, said changing the designation is the right thing to do.

“The Fort Hood Heroes Act will make sure this attack is label (sic) as it should be, in turn ensuring these brave men and women get the help, benefits and honors they need and deserve,” Carter, chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a statement.

The Pentagon in the past has expressed concerns about classifying the attack as an act of terrorism due to Hasan’s ongoing trial.

Military service members and their families traditionally are eligible for awards and benefits when service members are killed or wounded in a combat zone.

“But the federal government set historic precedent when it awarded military victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks with Purple Hearts, as well as honoring civilian victims with the Secretary of Defense Medal for the Defense of Freedom award. This precedent should be followed for the Fort Hood attack,” Petri’s statement declares.

The cost to taxpayers is not yet known. Petri’s and Carter’s offices couldn’t provide a figure, and because the bill, which is a companion bill to legislation introduced last week by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has yet to be reported out of committee. Until it is, the Congressional Budget Office will not have a fiscal estimate.

Neiberger-Miller also works with the National Veterans Legal Services Program, a group that assists veterans in applying for combat-related benefits.

“If a service member has injuries that are considered to have occurred through combat, they can get monthly compensation, tax-free, for life,” she said. “This is for people who were injured who cannot work again. This would be significant money.”

There could be an emotional cost to the Fort Hood Heroes Act perhaps not considered by the lawmakers.

Neiberger-Miller, whose brother was killed in the War in Iraq, said designations for special categories of military members killed or injured and their families have a way making those left out feel left behind.

“How do we support families dealing with grief and loss when deaths are treated differently?” she said. “Oftentimes families are hurt. Deaths stateside are treated differently than deaths in the war zone.”

TAPS doesn’t take positions on legislation, but Neiberger-Miller said society continues to grapple with the question of how best to honor military sacrifice in different theaters of service.

And what about the victims of the Naval Yard shootings? Were they victims of terrorism?

Petri believes the attack on Fort Hood deserves a fitting label.

“It’s only right that this be called what it was, an act of terrorism, and those heroes be rightly honored.”

"http://politicops.com/ted-nugents-wife-files-for-divorce-after-being-outed-as-ted-nugents-wife/","Ted Nugent’s Wife Files for Divorce after being Outed as Ted Nugent’s Wife","DALLAS – Shemane Nugent, the wife of rock musician and gun enthusiast Ted Nugent, filed for divorce today, spelling an end to the couple’s 24-year marriage. According to a source close to the Nugent family, Shemane, 51, decided that “she had no choice” but to separate from Nugent after “the whole world discovered that she was married to him.”

Shemane—who was relatively unknown until recently—was outed as Ted Nugent’s wife on Friday, when she attempted to pass through Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport security with a firearm in her carry-on luggage. The handgun—which Shemane claimed to have been carrying because she had received death threats—was discovered, and she was taken into custody. “I had totally forgotten it was in there,” Nugent claimed after being released on bail. “I mean, Jesus, I live with Ted Nugent, a man who carries half an armory in his ass crack. We’ve got guns all over the goddamn place.”

Mrs. Nugent maintains that she should not have been detained for a “simple mistake,” but did issue a public apology in which she expressed remorse for having spent over two decades married to “a man who once publicly threatened to murder Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton, and who has referred to black people as ‘mongrels’.”

“It was one thing being married to him when nobody knew who I was,” Mrs. Nugent said. “His music earned us a lot of money—we had an amazing house, despite the lingering smell of deer carcass, and we were constantly traveling the world, drinking the finest moonshine, eating the most savory varmint. But, for reasons that should be obvious, I cannot be publicly known as Mrs. Ted Nugent, and I have therefore filed for divorce.”

Ted Nugent—one of the NRA’s most prominent members and an attendee at 2013’s State of the Union address—could not be reached directly for comment, but said through a spokesman that he “didn’t care, because hunting is better than sex anyway,” and added that Shemane could “suck on his machine gun.”

"http://politicops.com/bono-recalls-u2s-enormous-influence-on-nelson-mandela/","Bono Recalls U2’s ‘Enormous Influence’ on Nelson Mandela","DUBLIN — U2 frontman Bono paid tribute to himself in a 1,000-word essay published by TIME following the death of iconic South African leader Nelson Mandela.

“As an activist, Nelson Mandela did pretty much whatever U2 told him to,” he writes. “We have been a forceful presence in his life going back to 1979, when U2 made its first anti-apartheid effort.”

In the piece, titled ‘The Man Who Could Not Cry,’ the legendary bandleader calls his friend “a remarkable man” for using U2’s message of peace to inspire the South African people during the country’s transition from apartheid to multiparty democracy.

Bono also praised Mandela for helping U2 battle the AIDS epidemic and extreme poverty around the globe by increasing access to the greatest band in the world’s discography.

Bono closes his essay with an anecdote that gave the article its title—referencing Mandela’s inability to shed tears. “Laughter, not tears, was Madiba’s preferred way—except on one occasion when I saw him almost choke up,” he recalls.

“Madiba and I were listening to ‘One’ from our album Achtung Baby, which many people say is our best record, and I could have sworn I saw him shed a tear. Everybody cries during that song.”

Bono adds, “But he explained to me that dust damage to his tear ducts from years of working in limestone mines had left him unable to cry. After listening to the song, he said he would have surgery to put this right, and in 1994 he did. I never knew if he listened to the song again, but I would like to think that Madiba is in heaven, listening to U2’s music and weeping.”","2013-12-08 11:16:12","0","24.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","280","86.04","84.99","4.91","38.47","23.33","19.64","77.86","46.79","13.21","9.29","2.50","1.07","0.00","5.71","0.00","3.93","6.79","15.00","5.71","2.86","4.29","1.07","14.64","1.79","1.43","1.79","2.50","1.43","6.43","3.57","2.86","0.00","0.36","2.14","15.00","0.36","0.36","0.00","6.43","8.57","2.50","1.07","2.14","1.07","0.71","2.14","5.00","0.71","4.29","0.00","1.79","0.00","1.79","0.36","0.00","6.79","1.79","2.50","2.50","1.07","0.00","6.07","3.21","0.36","11.79","1.79","6.07","4.29","1.79","1.79","0.00","0.71","0.36","0.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.57","4.29","5.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.71","5.00","2.86","0.00","0.00","1247","8.1","28.6","376","276","12","65.05","10.3","9.9","10.62","12.5","58","12.625","19.605797101449276","180","26.0","15","0.43","0","7","6","21","2","28","19","0","1","3","51","28","0","8","0","0","20","8","8","0","1","1","16","0","10","19","10","4","2","8","3","0","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/pat-buchanan-wants-russias-putin-for-u-s-president/","Pat Buchanan Wants Russia’s Putin for U.S. President","WASHINGTON – Conservative pundit Pat Buchanan believes the United States needs a third party for the future. His choice for leader?

Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In his December 17th syndicated column, Buchanan called Putin the “ideal Commander in Chief” to undo the damage wrought by “the militant secularism of a multicultural and transnational elite” led by President Barack Obama.

“In the culture war for mankind’s future,” Buchanan wrote of Putin, “is he one of us?”

“Not only is Putin one of us,” Buchanan claimed, “but he could also be the one to lead America out of its decrepit state of immorality.”

“President Reagan once called the old Soviet Empire ‘the focus of evil in the modern world,’” Buchanan wrote. “President Putin is implying that Barack Obama’s America may deserve the title in the 21st century.”

Buchanan went on to praise Putin as a fellow “paleoconservative” who could protect America from “the new immorality which has been imposed undemocratically.”

“Putin wouldn’t kowtow to a moderate political base like the contemporary GOP,” argued Buchanan, who added that Putin has all the prerequisites of an all-star Republican presidential candidate.

“He favors a balanced budget and believes in low taxes. He’s an anti-terrorist hero. Most importantly, he supports organized religion and opposes all forms of gayness.”

Earlier this year, Buchanan wrote another column that praised Putin for restoring his nation’s “moral compass” after the Russian leader signed laws banning so-called “gay propaganda.”

Of course, as Buchanan admitted, the laws of both Russia and the United States rule out even the most miniscule chance of a future U.S. President Putin, but Buchanan wrote that “the dream of a truly political, moral and cultural conservative leader is something for which America should strive.”

“Besides,” he concluded, “if a Kenyan can become President of the United States, then why not a Russian?”","2013-12-18 22:20:27","0","29.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","54.0","1.0","35.0","3","307","95.71","75.31","1.27","31.32","19.19","26.38","72.31","41.37","7.49","3.58","0.00","0.65","0.00","2.93","0.00","3.91","10.42","13.03","5.21","1.95","4.23","0.98","9.12","4.23","2.28","1.63","1.63","2.61","5.54","2.93","2.61","0.33","0.65","0.33","8.79","0.00","0.33","0.00","3.26","10.42","1.95","1.30","2.93","1.95","1.30","1.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","10.75","0.98","2.93","7.82","0.33","0.33","4.56","4.89","1.63","9.77","0.98","4.56","4.23","7.49","0.65","0.00","0.65","1.63","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","25.73","4.89","5.54","0.00","0.00","0.98","0.00","0.98","11.40","1.95","0.00","0.00","1546","8.36","34.77777777777778","468","305","17","61.77","12.5","9.1","13.74","13.0","74","7.583333333333334","18.864918032786886","181","27.56","4","0.41","0","7","4","37","0","40","29","0","1","5","46","53","3","5","1","0","8","4","11","1","1","0","4","0","8","17","3","5","1","13","3","2","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/obama-admits-to-jerking-off-raul-castro-backstage/","The Obama-Castro Handjob That Shocked The World","JOHANNESBURG — A simple handjob between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro erupted a torrent of international speculation about a coming shift in Cuban-American relations.

Obama offered Castro the handjob in front of a worldwide audience before taking the stage at Tuesday’s memorial service honoring former South African President Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg.

The brief but intimate gesture is no guarantee that the former Cold War foes are headed towards reconciliation, but optimists in both nations hope the two presidents’ aggressive sexual behavior towards one another is a sign of things to come.

“May this… be the beginning of the end of the US aggressions,” read a message on the Cuban government’s official website.

Others were less enthused about the manual stimulation.

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) who was born in Havana before her family moved to Miami, said it was “nauseating and disheartening” to watch Obama jerk off another president.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was quick to lambaste the president for his gesture of kindness, going so far as to compare it to the time Neville Chamberlain famously went down on Adolf Hitler at the start of World War II.

“Why should you give somebody who’s keeping Americans in prison a handjob? It’s a sign of weakness. If anything, Castro should be the one serving up the presidential penis pull,” McCain said.

A White House official said the handjob was not planned, and that Obama and Castro simply “exchanged greetings” as they prepared for the memorial.

After bringing Castro to climax, Obama moved on to nibble Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s ear and gingerly lick the fingers of Afghan President Hamid Karzai.","2013-12-11 15:16:17","0","27.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","55.0","1.0","35.0","3","276","97.43","66.81","29.41","11.64","17.25","28.26","75.36","41.67","6.88","1.81","0.00","0.36","0.36","0.72","0.36","5.07","9.78","15.58","5.07","1.81","3.99","0.72","11.59","5.07","3.26","1.09","1.09","1.45","3.99","1.45","2.54","0.00","2.17","0.36","6.16","0.36","0.00","0.36","0.36","5.80","0.72","0.72","1.45","1.81","0.36","1.81","3.62","0.72","1.45","0.72","1.81","1.09","0.36","0.72","0.00","10.51","2.17","0.72","7.25","0.72","0.00","5.07","4.35","1.81","17.39","4.71","8.33","4.71","4.35","0.36","0.72","0.36","0.00","1.45","0.72","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.03","5.80","2.90","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","1.45","2.90","2.17","1.45","0.00","1382","8.88","23.416666666666668","434","273","14","51.68","13.4","10.9","13.46","13.3","74","11.875","20.642490842490844","181","21.33","7","0.39","0","7","3","30","0","34","21","1","0","2","40","59","2","11","0","0","5","2","6","0","0","1","8","0","8","18","9","4","5","2","0","2","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/catholic-church-outsourcing-same-sex-marriage-fight-to-top-ad-agency/","Catholic Church Outsourcing Same-Sex Marriage Fight to Top Ad Agency","NEW YORK — New York’s influential Cardinal Timothy Dolan said the Catholic Church is enlisting some outside help for its culture war on same-sex marriage.

In an interview with “Meet the Press” that aired Sunday, Dolan reiterated his stance on the divisive issue and claimed that the church has “been outmarketed.”

Dolan announced that the Archdiocese of New York would begin consulting with top Manhattan-based ad agency Merkin Strategies counter the growing support of same-sex marriage and “style the Church’s image and curb backlash on divisive issues like gay marriage and abortion.”

“When you have forces like Hollywood, when you have forces like politicians, when you have forces like some opinion-molders that are behind it, it’s a tough battle,” Dolan said of the Church’s same-sex marriage conflict.

Dolan said that the church would utilize “modern strategies to combat modern problems. “Our goal is to maintain our position against homosexuality and sin, but at the same time welcome all people into the church. Keep in mind, we believe in miracles, so that’s not as impossible as it sounds.”

“We’ve been caricatured as being anti-gay,” lamented Dolan. “We don’t want a caricature; the Church’s message should be like a lush oil-painting—anti-gay or not.”

Dolan told moderator David Gregory that the Church “often has difficulty promoting values that originate with God while at the same time maintaining a welcoming, Christ-like image.”

“We get backlash from those who think we are too gracious and compassionate and loving and accepting of gays, and then we get backlash from gay people who feel that we are not tolerant enough of them,” said Dolan.

The high-profile partnership with Merkin is another indicator of Catholic Church’s increasing reliance on outside firms to handle sensitive issues. In November, an office of the Vatican’s central bureaucracy hired accounting firm EY (formerly known as Ernst & Young) to audit the finances of the Vatican City State administration.

Dolan said that outside help from marketing and public relations experts would clarify the Church’s position on same-sex marriage, which has been murky ever since newly elected Pope Francis scolded Catholic leaders for being “obsessed” with issues like same-sex marriage and abortion.

“We can’t please everybody and God at the same time, but advertising doesn’t rival religion as the world’s largest industry for no reason,” said Dolan.","2013-12-02 21:52:10","0","29.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","65.0","1.0","35.0","4","394","86.08","87.33","12.90","44.34","26.27","26.40","81.47","42.89","8.88","3.81","0.00","2.54","0.76","0.25","0.25","5.08","6.85","13.71","6.85","1.78","6.60","1.78","12.18","8.12","5.84","1.52","0.00","1.02","4.31","2.54","1.52","0.25","0.51","0.00","11.93","1.52","0.25","0.00","0.25","9.14","2.03","1.78","1.78","1.27","0.76","2.03","3.05","0.51","1.78","0.51","3.30","0.00","0.51","3.30","0.00","15.48","9.14","1.52","4.57","1.02","0.76","3.55","7.11","0.25","12.18","0.51","6.09","5.58","3.81","0.00","0.00","1.02","5.33","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.32","3.81","4.06","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","3.05","5.84","3.55","0.51","0.25","1961","8.83","40.8","581","382","15","54.05","13.8","12.1","14.39","16.8","95","12.625","22.14764397905759","222","33.3","3","0.43","0","15","0","33","0","54","39","0","1","5","74","51","1","20","0","0","15","4","12","0","0","0","4","0","11","15","10","10","16","9","4","2","0","3"
"http://politicops.com/louisiana-lt-gov-offers-to-give-duck-dynasty-cast-control-of-the-state-government/","Louisiana Lt. Gov. Offers to Give ‘Duck Dynasty’ Cast Control of the State Government","BATON ROUGE, La. – Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Jay Dardenne today offered to cede control of his state to the cast of “Duck Dynasty,” whom Dardenne called “beacons of hope for Real America” and “more fit to govern than myself or any of my colleagues.”

Dardenne, whose primary concern as lt. governor has been to promote the tourism and film industries in his state, offered control of Louisiana to the “Duck Dynasty” cast—composed largely of the Robertson family—in a letter mailed late last week. In it, Dardenne says that he was “appalled” to hear that the family’s patriarch, Phil Robertson, had been suspended from appearing on the show after he was quoted in GQ equating gay sex to bestiality and making other inflammatory comments about homosexuality and race.

Dardenne wrote that “Duck Dynasty” has been “an important representation of the state of Louisiana.” “It’s a shame that, in America, you can’t say what you want without experiencing this kind of blowback,” Dardenne continued. “But I and millions of others appreciate your views, and believe you represent the values that comprise Real America.”

Indeed, since Robertson’s suspension, hundreds of thousands of Americans have joined groups formed to protest the decision and support Robertson—such as IStandWithPhil.com—and the 67-yeard old has received public support from figures such as Bristol Palin, Gov. Bobby Jindal and the Westboro Baptist Church.

Dardenne also pledged that, if A&E decides to cancel “Duck Dynasty” altogether, he would use the power of his office to ensure that the show stays on the air.

“However, if you’re sick of being in show business—and who would blame you, after this ordeal?—I’d like to officially invite you to take control of the Louisiana state government,” Dardenne wrote. “You and your kin built a juggernaut of a business, starred in an incredibly popular show, and show a deep respect for the Bible, even its ‘politically incorrect’ parts. All of this makes you the perfect family to guide Louisiana.”

Since the contents of his letter became public, Dardenne has been forced to explain his unorthodox offer, and over the weekend he attempted to persuade the public that letting the Robertson family preside over the state would solve a “major problem in America right now.”

“Look at it this way,” Dardenne told reporters Sunday afternoon. “If Phil Robertson is given control of Louisiana, then his views on homosexuality and race will actually be important, and everyone on Facebook can rest easy that they haven’t spent the last week ranting and arguing over something that doesn’t matter, at all.”","2013-12-22 20:54:47","0","25.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","429","87.45","84.20","5.97","42.70","25.24","27.74","76.46","46.85","11.89","5.83","0.93","0.00","2.33","2.33","0.23","6.06","7.46","15.15","5.83","2.10","6.29","0.93","11.66","3.50","1.86","0.93","0.93","1.17","4.20","2.56","1.63","0.23","0.70","0.00","12.59","0.93","0.23","0.00","2.56","11.19","2.10","2.56","2.10","2.10","1.40","3.03","3.03","2.10","0.70","0.00","1.40","0.00","0.47","0.93","0.00","8.39","2.10","0.47","4.90","0.70","0.47","3.73","7.46","0.70","10.02","0.47","5.83","4.20","3.50","1.40","0.70","0.70","0.70","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","20.75","4.20","6.53","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.23","7.23","2.10","0.00","0.23","2090","8.59","39.81818181818182","662","422","19","48.94","13.4","11.9","12.94","14.2","103","8.2","20.643033175355452","243","32.82","7","0.45","0","18","1","39","0","60","22","1","0","6","70","58","1","16","0","1","19","10","14","0","0","1","15","0","21","19","7","13","9","10","3","3","1","0"

"http://politicops.com/u-s-afghan-security-pact-allows-afghan-civilians-to-search-us-military-bases/","U.S.-Afghan Security Pact Allows Afghan Civilians To Search US Military Bases","KABUL, Afghanistan — More than 50,000 U.S. troops still deployed in Afghanistan will face a dangerous new challenge after officials in Washington caved on a provision in the new U.S.-Afghan security pact that allows Afghan civilians to search U.S. military bases.

The provision is a compromise in the long-delayed Bilateral Security Agreement that sets the terms for how U.S. forces will operate after the drawdown of troops in 2014.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai had rejected previous iterations of the BSA over the enter-and-search policy that permits foreign troops to enter the homes of Afghan civilians. Karzai was insistent that it is only fair if enter-and-search work both ways.

“We are only asking for transparency from both sides,” stated Karzai. “Innocent Afghan people have been forced to open their homes to U.S. troops, and they should have a right to inspect U.S. military bases so that their families can also feel safe.”

Afghans have grown to fear and distrust foreign troops after a spate of violent incidents, including the February 2012 accidental burning of hundreds of copies of the Quran and a March 2012 mass shooting by a U.S. soldier in southern Afghanistan that killed 16 people.

“The Afghan people have finally realized that this is their country. It doesn’t belong to America or Russia or NATO,” declared one senior Afghan official. “If outside forces want to claim they are here to help, then they shouldn’t have a problem with peaceful Afghans poking around.”

Only specially trained Afghan civilians will be allowed to enter U.S. compounds, and never without fair warning. Still, military commanders say the new provision is bad for morale, not to mention extremely dangerous.

Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. said the compromise “practically asks suicide bombers to wipe their feet at the front door.”

“Not only will it make our servicemen and women feel like uninvited guests, but it will also place them at an extremely elevated risk of attack.”

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the security compromise is a result of “mistakes” by American forces and urged U.S. commanders “to make the most of this unfortunate detail.”

“Remember, they still need us more than we need them. As long as our boys aren’t doing anything they aren’t supposed to, these inspections should be fine,” Sec. Kerry declared.

“That being said, they might want to consider leaving their body armor on at night.”","2013-11-20 12:19:02","0","29.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","404","82.94","67.20","13.41","15.35","18.36","23.02","76.73","45.05","8.42","4.46","0.00","1.24","0.00","0.00","3.22","3.96","6.44","14.11","7.92","4.46","4.95","1.98","13.61","5.20","2.72","0.25","1.98","1.24","6.19","2.72","3.47","0.50","0.99","0.25","8.17","0.25","0.25","0.25","0.25","11.14","1.24","2.72","2.72","2.23","0.74","2.97","2.48","0.74","0.99","0.74","0.99","0.74","0.25","0.00","0.00","12.38","3.96","0.50","5.45","0.00","2.72","2.72","8.66","1.73","12.87","1.49","6.68","4.46","1.98","0.25","0.99","0.00","0.25","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.53","10.40","3.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.49","4.95","0.99","0.00","0.00","1939","7.73","29.857142857142858","577","398","26","72.87","11.3","6.9","12.0","10.5","84","5.857142857142857","16.562211055276382","235","25.21","24","0.44","0","11","7","32","0","46","33","2","1","9","39","62","2","40","0","0","15","7","21","0","0","0","15","0","22","11","6","9","14","10","3","0","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/number-of-nsa-applicants-doubles-following-porn-disclosure/","Number of NSA Applicants Doubles Following Porn Disclosure","WASHINGTON — The National Security Agency disclosed Friday a 200% surge in employment applications over the previous 48 hours, but refused to comment on whether this renewed interest was connected to the revelation that the spy agency has been monitoring the pornographic viewing history of radicals in an attempt to humiliate and discredit them.

Citing documents provided by former N.S.A. contractor Edward Snowden, the Huffington Post revealed Wednesday the N.S.A.’s plan to harm the reputations of those whom the agency believes are radicalizing others through incendiary speeches and rhetoric. The document proposes that six redacted targets, all Muslim, would be discredited by revelations that they viewed sexually explicit material online. None of the six individuals is accused in the document of being involved in terror plots.

The embattled intelligence agency has faced criticism and scrutiny over its spying methods in the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks. While an N.S.A. spokesperson refused comment on a possible link between this most recent disclosure and increased interest in working for the espionage giant, the application swell should come as a relief to intelligence officials..

“While the agency has seen a dip in applications over the last six months, over the last 48 hours, we’ve more than made up for the lost numbers, and are on pace to exceed our recruitment target for the year,” N.S.A. spokesperson Vanee Vines told reporters. “Unfortunately, from what we’re seeing, a large number of the applicants are already disqualified by virtue of their criminal record,” adding that an equally large number were “already under surveillance by one or more of our sister agencies.”

It remains speculative if the pornography revelations and employment applications are connected, but reporters managed to catch up with one applicant who spoke of his sense of duty.

“I’ve always wanted to serve my country, and I think I have a particular set of skills that the N.S.A. would be very interested,” said one recent N.S.A. applicant whose name was withheld for security reasons, adding that he feels he is “uniquely qualified” to engage in the data collection and surveillance that is the N.S.A.’s purview. “I think the government really needs me out there, monitoring the dirty things the bad men get up to.”

Vines also dismissed accusations of a connection between the pornography exposé and a fall report noting that several N.S.A. employees illegally used the agency’s surveillance powers to snoop on their love interests.

“Those incidents were rogue perverts who overstepped their authority,” insisted Vines. “This was a textbook case of our dedicated agents keeping tabs on somebody’s pornography collection. Two completely unrelated occurrences.”","2013-12-03 11:52:14","0","25.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","449","96.24","71.87","20.41","41.90","21.38","29.18","77.51","44.99","9.35","4.23","1.34","1.11","0.00","0.67","1.11","5.12","11.58","13.59","5.57","1.56","4.01","0.22","10.47","3.56","2.23","1.34","2.23","2.00","4.45","2.67","1.78","0.45","0.45","0.22","8.02","0.22","0.00","0.22","0.89","8.02","3.12","0.67","1.34","1.11","0.89","1.78","2.45","0.89","1.11","0.22","1.78","0.22","0.00","1.34","0.00","8.46","1.56","1.11","4.68","0.67","0.67","5.35","4.90","0.22","11.80","0.89","6.46","4.23","6.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.26","8.91","4.01","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.56","1.56","0.00","0.22","2248","9.25","25.22222222222222","714","432","22","43.12","14.3","12.1","14.27","14.0","127","10.7","21.59925925925926","263","22.39","29","0.46","0","12","10","50","0","59","26","2","0","3","75","40","0","37","0","0","12","9","13","0","1","2","11","0","13","20","13","16","12","11","1","4","1","0"
"http://politicops.com/birthers-claim-obama-children-fathered-by-rev-wright/","Birthers Claim Obama Children Fathered by Rev. Wright","CHICAGO – The conservative organization Fellowship of the Mind last week came forward with a shocking accusation questioning the legitimacy of Sasha and Malia Obama. Based on investigative techniques consisting of searching everything from Google Images to Ancestry.com to GenealogyBank.com, the site concludes that the two girls are not the children of Barack and Michelle Obama. After dropping that bombshell, they go on to state unequivocally that the real father is Reverend Jeremiah Wright.

“If anyone can find baby pictures and birth records of Malia Obama and/or Natasha Obama, please let me know!” wrote Dr. Eowyn, a featured author on the site. “Also, if anyone can vouch for Reverend Wright’s whereabouts during the time frame when conception would have occurred, please share. I think we’ve got him this time!”

Though Dr. Eowyn was unable to find any pictures of the alleged Obama girls before the ages of 6 and 9, the site’s readers posted some younger photos. However, members of The Fellowship of the Mind were not convinced. “I noticed that Michelle’s hair looks cut off on the right side, commented Lindarm. “It’s a bad cropping job, and Barack’s head looks photo-shopped in as well. I don’t think the two girls, or Michelle, or Barack are in the same picture at all. How amateurish. Whose kids are they really?”

“We all know that Barry is gay and could not possibly have fathered those girls,” continued Dr. Eowyn in an update. “The only explanation is that Michelle had an affair with Reverend Wright. Twice. It is a cover-up. Why else didn’t Dear Leader throw Wright under the bus back in 2008? He was afraid of what the god Reverend would reveal!”

The final proof that the long-time Obama confidant is the real father of Natasha and Malia is given in another photo of the girls ages 4 and 1, sitting in an unidentified man’s lap. “Whose hairy arm is that behind the girls?” asks Dr. Eowyn. “It’s obviously not Barry’s arm. It’s got to be Wright! This is huge!”","2013-12-02 21:36:18","1","24.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","67.0","1.0","35.0","5","343","81.65","63.69","38.46","30.71","13.19","18.66","76.38","46.36","9.33","2.92","1.17","0.58","0.00","0.58","0.58","6.41","9.33","11.66","9.04","2.92","5.83","1.75","14.29","2.62","1.46","1.75","2.33","1.46","2.62","1.46","1.17","0.29","0.00","0.00","9.91","1.17","0.58","1.75","1.75","12.24","3.50","0.87","1.46","3.21","1.46","4.08","3.50","3.21","0.00","0.29","1.46","1.17","0.00","0.29","0.00","5.54","2.33","0.58","2.04","0.58","0.29","3.79","9.33","0.00","12.54","1.17","7.00","5.25","1.46","0.29","0.00","0.58","0.29","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.00","22.45","7.00","4.08","0.00","0.00","0.87","1.46","0.87","4.37","3.50","0.00","0.29","1565","7.39","16.904761904761905","469","338","29","76.52","8.5","5.5","9.84","7.4","68","5.9375","14.72733727810651","200","15.67","4","0.45","0","12","7","41","0","42","21","1","0","5","47","56","0","18","0","0","15","0","15","0","0","2","5","0","10","19","6","5","12","13","0","1","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/after-spate-of-acting-out-nation-assures-texas-it-is-very-very-special/","After Spate of Acting Out, Nation Assures Texas It is Very, Very Special","WASHINGTON – After noticing that Texas has been going through a spate of bad behavior that is clearly a sign of wanting adult attention, President Obama let the Lone Star State know that it is very, very special and the US would never forget them or take them for granted.

The signs of trouble began brewing over the summer, when Texas passed a law that would effectively close all but a handful of abortion clinics. The resulting protests from women’s organizations were followed closely by a voter ID law requiring documented proof of any name changes – a burden that many felt was an effort to discourage married women from voting. From there, things got worse. In Dallas, dozens of men brandishing weapons menaced a group of four mothers discussing gun control in a diner. Most recently, a conservative white Republican won a local election in Houston by using a direct mail campaign to mislead African-American voters that he was black.

Speaking from the Rose Garden, President Obama said that while Texas is deep down a good state, it needs to learn how to deal with adversity like a grown up. “I know it’s been a tough time for Texas – what with gay marriage legalized and healthcare and immigration reform gaining steam. My daughter Malia is at the age when is prone to rebel against authority as well. Like I tell her, when things don’t go your way, adults work through their problems. They don’t go around shutting down the government.”

Governor Rick Perry vehemently denied allegations that Texas was “just going through a phase”. Speaking from the steps of the state Capitol, the erstwhile presidential candidate whose campaign was most noteworthy for one of the bigger debate gaffes in recent memory, said “We’re serious! We hate your Big Government, we hate your taxes, and we hate your healthcare.” Stomping his foot for emphasis, the important governor continued, “We want a place where we can hang out with Jesus and hoot people who disagree with us. And if we don’t get what we want – we’re just going to run away and form out own country and it’s going to be awesome. AND YOU CAN’T COME!”

The Governor then ran up to his office and locked the door.

After giving him some time to calm down, the President called Perry and told him that everyone values Texas’ oilfields and their little cowboy outfits and reassured them that everyone thought they were big tough guys and no one would ever, ever mess with them.","2013-11-18 10:39:42","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","421","79.85","92.62","19.84","6.93","22.16","20.43","85.99","48.93","13.30","8.08","0.95","2.61","1.19","1.43","1.90","5.23","7.84","13.78","6.18","3.80","5.70","1.43","16.39","4.75","2.61","2.14","0.95","1.66","6.89","2.38","4.04","0.00","1.43","0.48","14.25","0.95","0.24","1.19","1.90","9.74","2.38","1.66","2.14","1.43","1.90","1.19","2.14","0.48","0.95","0.48","1.19","0.24","0.48","0.48","0.24","12.83","3.33","1.19","6.65","1.43","0.95","4.99","8.55","1.19","14.96","3.80","6.89","4.28","4.51","0.24","0.48","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.24","0.00","13.30","4.04","4.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.24","1.90","2.38","0.00","0.00","1945","8.02","26.875","594","424","19","65.76","11.3","9.6","10.57","12.1","88","17.0","19.221886792452832","271","23.94","10","0.47","0","15","2","38","0","50","34","1","0","4","58","36","0","23","0","0","25","9","16","1","2","6","9","0","16","24","18","7","14","10","2","3","1","5"
"http://politicops.com/congress-thankful-for-all-the-work-they-didnt-do-this-year/","Congress Thankful for All the Work They Didn’t Do this Year","WASHINGTON – As Thanksgiving approaches, many leading members of Congress are describing the things they are most grateful for this year. Along with God and family, many lawmakers say they’re particularly grateful for all the hard work they can look forward to doing in 2014, since, in the words of House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, they “haven’t done much of anything this year.”

“2013 has been a remarkable year,” said House Representative Eliot Engel (D-NY). “Take just one example: There have been over 20 mass shootings since January 1, and yet, incredibly, we haven’t even begun to discuss legislation to address gun violence. It’s hard to believe, but we’re just really happy, because at least we’ll have plenty to do next year!”

Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) echoed Engel’s statements, adding that he’s grateful for all the free time he’s had over the past 11 months. “Running for Vice President was exhausting, so it’s been nice to have so much free time this year to work on my abs,” Ryan said. “It’s true that this has been one of the least productive Congresses in modern history, but that means there’s nowhere to go but up.”

While unemployment continues to hover above seven percent, some members of Congress say that, after this year, they’re grateful that they can “really empathize with Americans who are out of work.”

“Technically, we as congressmen are employed,” said Representative Michael McCaul (R-Texas). “But we’ve done so little work recently that most of us feel like we’re jobless, so we can totally understand what the unemployed are going through—and that’s the first step to finally fixing America’s broken labor market.”

Many House Representatives also admitted that they’re very grateful that they failed to pass any laws that meaningfully address immigration this year, despite the fact that Americans overwhelmingly support the various reform ideas offered by both parties. “Yes, we have a big immigration problem, and we haven’t done a thing to fix it,” said Sanford Bishop (D-GA). “But mine is the best looking lawn on the block right now, and I think 2014 will be a great time to dig in on this issue.”

Although most lawmakers said they believe that next year will be productive, several admitted that they don’t plan on doing much work then, either. “Listen, we can’t set the bar too high,” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. “As long as we get some significant redistricting done in 2014, it’ll be a proud year, in my book.”","2013-11-26 10:13:17","0","24.0","7.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","418","53.21","77.08","51.95","70.76","23.22","19.86","86.12","48.33","13.16","5.98","0.96","2.87","0.00","0.48","1.67","7.18","4.31","12.92","11.96","4.55","5.50","1.44","18.18","6.70","3.59","0.48","2.63","5.74","4.78","3.59","1.20","0.24","0.00","0.48","10.29","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.48","11.00","2.63","1.44","0.24","1.67","1.67","3.35","3.59","0.48","2.39","0.72","0.72","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.24","12.20","4.07","2.87","4.78","1.44","0.48","4.78","13.88","1.67","15.07","1.91","5.98","7.66","6.22","1.20","1.67","0.72","0.48","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.48","0.24","0.00","0.00","26.08","4.07","7.66","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.96","5.74","5.26","1.91","0.00","1948","7.79","40.0","593","414","18","65.05","12.6","9.9","12.02","13.6","79","12.875","18.832850241545895","240","35.09","8","0.48","0","10","10","30","0","55","39","0","5","6","44","46","2","14","2","0","30","2","28","0","1","0","13","0","24","16","11","12","27","8","1","2","0","0"
"http://politicops.com/mccain-warns-gays-could-take-your-jobs-if-anti-discrimination-bill-passes/","McCain Warns ‘Gays Could Take Your Jobs’ If Anti-Discrimination Bill Passes","WASHINGTON – As the landmark gay rights bill known as the Employee Non-Discrimination Act inches its way through the Senate, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is using his fear mongering tactics to justify his opposition to the bill, which would ban workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Although McCain’s wife, Cindy, recently signed a Human Rights Campaign postcard pressing her husband to back ENDA, he reiterated his concerns about the bill, claiming that it could lead to “gays taking your jobs.”

“I’m not saying gays and things don’t deserve jobs; they absolutely do. I know a lot of them work very hard at whatever it is they do. But the ENDA legislation could lead to certain scenarios where they could take jobs from well-deserving straight workers, which wouldn’t be fair either.”

McCain elaborated his concerns, saying, “Whether it imposes quotas, whether it has reverse discrimination, whether it has the kinds of provisions that really preserve equal rights for all citizens or, like for example, busing. Busing was done in the name of equality. Busing was a failure. Quotas were a failure. A lot of people thought they were solutions. They weren’t. They bred problems.”

Proponents of the bill were quick to point out that it explicitly forbids quotas and reverse discrimination and contains nothing resembling the desegregation busing practices that began after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision.

“Senator McCain is grossly misinformed about ENDA and the rights that it protects for all citizens,” said openly gay state Rep. Brian Sims (D-Philadelphia). “The bill is designed to protect all US citizens from workplace discrimination.”

“It’s irresponsible and simply wrong for John McCain to claim that the bill will be used to bus gay kids to certain schools or allow members of the LGBT community to take over the work place,” added Sims.

Sims also pointed out that Federal law already bans discrimination in hiring or employment on the basis of race, color, sex, nationality, religion, age or disability, and that ENDA protects people of all sexual orientations from workplace discrimination, which means a person could not be fired for being heterosexual either.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will bring ENDA to the floor on Monday, but even if the bill passes, it will face an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.","2013-11-03 19:18:20","0","27.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","66.0","1.0","35.0","4","397","80.29","57.01","5.38","12.43","17.26","24.43","75.31","44.33","10.08","4.28","0.50","0.25","0.25","1.51","1.76","5.79","7.05","12.09","7.81","3.02","5.29","1.51","12.34","4.03","2.27","2.02","0.00","3.02","3.53","1.26","2.27","0.25","0.25","0.50","8.06","0.50","0.00","0.50","1.51","13.10","1.76","2.52","2.02","2.02","2.27","4.79","1.76","0.50","0.76","0.50","2.52","0.25","0.00","2.27","0.00","9.82","1.26","2.77","5.04","1.01","1.76","3.27","6.05","0.76","7.81","1.01","5.04","2.02","4.79","0.00","0.25","1.76","0.25","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.25","0.25","0.25","0.00","20.40","6.30","6.05","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","1.51","3.02","1.76","1.51","0.00","1966","8.63","28.928571428571427","622","392","23","54.22","11.9","9.9","12.99","11.9","103","7.916666666666666","19.31020408163265","240","26.36","16","0.41","0","15","0","32","0","46","17","0","0","8","60","57","1","30","0","0","19","7","15","0","0","3","12","0","19","15","12","7","8","16","5","0","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/gop-demands-war-with-china/","GOP Demands War with China","WASHINGTON – Frustrated by recent near misses at armed conflicts in Syria and Iran, Republican leadership sent the Obama administration a harshly worded statement today, demanding that the President ratchet up the escalating tension between the United States and China and hopefully provoke all-out armed conflict.

Tensions in the Far East escalated last weekend after the Chinese government claimed an Air Defense Identification Zone in the waters of the East China Sea. The zone, which overlaps a similar zone claimed by Japan–including some uninhabited islands—is seen as an attempt by China to increase its influence in the area. With both the US and China conducting operations in the disputed region as a way of testing the others’ resolve, the GOP sees an opportunity for a long awaited war, the third in the last twelve years.

“This president is certainly no stranger when it comes to getting us embroiled in diplomatic adventures,” said Eric Cantor (R-VA), citing the deal brokered this summer to convince Syria to turn over all of its chemical weapons, and this month’s accord that put a temporary freeze on Iran’s nuclear program. “Now it’s time for him to break his habit of ploughshare-rattling and make with the bang-bang. China’s far away; they don’t look like us, and if we win we’d never need to pay back our debt. What more does he need?”

Cantor added that he believed the president is only giving the crisis careful thought and consideration because “he doesn’t want to fight with his fellow Commies.”

In the Senate, John McCain (R-AZ) echoed the need for conflict, calling it a national security issue. “It’s been over a decade since we charged into war with an enemy we don’t understand and goals that are not readily identifiable,” said McCain. With the war in Iraq over, and conflict in Afghanistan winding down, the senator says there are legitimate concerns for America’s fighting preparedness. “How are our servicemen and women ever expected to stay sharp if they are not perpetually in harm’s way?”

McCain also noted that he does not consider the Obama administration’s intervention in last year’s Libiyan civil war as a sufficient example of “keeping the spear sharpened.”

“If we don’t even lose a single troop, it clearly doesn’t count,” stated McCain.","2013-12-02 11:55:14","0","24.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","383","92.05","73.45","23.73","7.60","25.53","24.28","77.55","46.48","9.66","4.96","0.00","2.61","0.00","1.83","0.52","4.70","10.18","14.62","4.70","3.13","5.48","2.61","11.23","3.13","2.09","1.04","0.78","1.83","5.74","2.09","3.66","0.52","2.35","0.52","8.09","0.00","0.26","0.26","2.09","9.66","2.61","1.57","2.35","1.57","1.57","1.83","2.35","0.78","0.78","0.78","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","11.23","2.87","1.57","5.48","1.57","1.31","1.83","8.62","0.78","16.45","1.57","9.92","5.22","3.92","0.26","0.00","0.78","0.00","1.04","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.54","3.39","4.18","0.00","0.26","0.52","0.00","1.31","3.66","4.18","1.04","0.00","1831","9.28","36.18181818181818","582","377","15","54.46","13.6","11.9","12.48","15.1","105","17.166666666666668","23.180583554376657","245","32.18","7","0.46","0","11","0","46","0","50","31","0","0","0","64","44","2","14","0","0","19","6","18","1","0","5","8","0","11","18","12","8","12","12","2","1","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/rep-radel-blames-cocaine-bust-on-obamacare-fight/","Rep. Radel Blames Cocaine Bust on Obamacare Fight","WASHINGTON — Representative Trey Radel (R-Fla.) pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine in D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday morning, admitting he had purchased the drug as a booster to keep him going during long hours of attempting to derail President Obama’s legislation.

“I am so sorry to be here,” Radel said Wednesday. “I have let my constituents, my country and my family down. I want to come out of this stronger and I intend to do that, to be a better man, a better husband and continue blocking this administration’s agenda.”

According to authorities, on the evening of October 29, Radel and an acquaintance met an undercover officer who sold the pair 3.5 grams of cocaine. The congressman was arrested in his D.C. apartment later that evening.

“Obamacare is horrible, and I found myself desperate for an extra boost,” Radel admitted in a statement released today. “Obviously I never would have turned to drugs had it not been for the way this legislation is destroying the very fabric of our great nation.”

Radel, a freshman elected to Congress in 2012 with Tea Party support, had previously voted for mandatory drug testing of food stamp applicants. Radel further blamed his drug use on his alcoholism, which he claimed was exacerbated by the White House’s domestic agenda. Though he faced a maximum of 180 days in jail, as well as a fine of up to $1,000, the 37-year-old Radel was instead sentenced to a year of probation. Radel deflected accusations that the lenient verdict was due to his status as an elected official.

“It is clear that the judge understood the stress that I, and indeed the whole country feels under Obamacare,” Radel said. “That is why I received a soft sentence. People who are struggling under socialized medicine should not be treated too harshly for their mistakes.”

The Florida representative made no mention of resigning, but instead implied that he would return to the House after seeking treatment for his substance abuse problems, saying, “Once qualified medical professionals have guided me through my addiction, I promise my constituents that I shall return to the House to continue the fight against policies that would allow them to get the same help.”","2013-11-22 14:04:43","0","58.0","35.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","105.0","31.0","0.0","184.0","1.0","35.0","34","374","87.67","55.31","20.44","14.66","19.68","25.94","80.21","48.40","12.57","8.02","4.55","0.27","0.00","2.67","0.53","4.55","8.02","14.97","7.22","2.94","3.48","1.07","12.83","5.35","2.94","1.07","2.14","0.53","6.15","2.67","3.48","1.34","1.07","0.53","8.56","0.53","0.27","0.00","3.21","8.29","1.60","1.60","1.87","0.00","1.34","1.87","1.87","0.53","0.80","0.53","2.67","0.00","2.14","0.00","0.80","8.82","1.60","0.80","6.15","1.07","0.27","5.08","6.15","0.53","12.57","1.07","5.35","6.42","2.67","0.80","1.34","0.53","0.00","0.00","0.80","0.00","0.27","0.27","0.27","0.00","17.38","5.61","5.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.80","3.74","0.80","0.53","0.27","1763","8.49","29.076923076923077","548","369","20","61.16","11.8","9.3","11.66","11.3","92","6.357142857142857","19.37289972899729","231","25.38","16","0.47","0","7","8","36","0","44","18","3","0","5","57","36","0","15","0","0","20","12","18","0","0","1","17","0","15","24","11","14","7","5","2","2","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/u-s-demands-syria-massacre-its-citizens-the-old-fashioned-way-2/","U.S. Demands Syria Massacre Its Citizens the Old-Fashioned Way","WASHINGTON — The Obama administration had harsh words for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Monday, demanding that if the repressive tyrant was going to massacre his own people, he had better do so without the use of chemical weapons.

“We will not stand for the senseless killing of Syrian civilians,” Secretary of State John Kerry vowed at a press conference in Prague, “when that killing involves biological weaponry. Bullets, bombs, grenades—those are fine though. Carry on.”

The president says the statement is about drawing a line in the sand. “America has a moral imperative to make sure the freedom-loving people of this world are repressed as inefficiently as possible,” said Obama during a press briefing Tuesday.

Many don’t realize the United States has a proud history of slowing genocide. In 1943, before the U.S. entered the European theater in World War II, President Roosevelt famously demanded that the Nazis limit the capacity of gas chambers to 40 people at a time.

For many in government, the commitment to support fledgling democracies is part of what makes America exceptional.

“Democracy is like a dandelion,” Kerry reflected. “When you use petrochemical weed-killer, those beautiful yellow flowers will never grow. It’s not fair. If the Syrian government is serious about repressing the will of its people, it had better get on its hands and knees and show a little personal attention to uprooting progress.”

Bolstering the administration’s threats were several NATO backers, who echoed Obama’s sentiments against the use of chemical weapons. “If Syria ignores our threats ten or fifteen more times, things are going to get serious,” warned Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “We’re talking non-binding resolution serious. And if they ignore that, get ready for an official censure.”

Obama admits the threats against Syria are largely toothless, but insists they hold the potential to be effective. “We may not have the bite to back up our bark here,” conceded the president, “but we can gum pretty hard.”","2013-03-20 14:09:01","0","25.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","48.0","1.0","35.0","3","330","89.77","61.92","12.99","3.15","17.37","28.79","76.97","42.73","7.58","3.33","0.00","1.82","0.30","0.61","0.61","4.24","9.39","12.42","7.58","2.73","4.85","1.82","14.24","4.24","2.12","1.21","1.21","1.52","10.00","3.64","6.06","1.82","3.03","0.00","6.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.61","10.00","2.12","1.82","1.21","2.73","0.91","4.24","3.33","0.91","0.61","1.82","1.21","0.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.61","2.12","1.82","5.45","1.52","1.21","2.12","10.00","2.12","9.70","1.82","4.85","3.64","3.33","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.61","1.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.61","6.36","6.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.21","5.45","1.52","0.00","0.00","1642","8.75","21.0","513","326","19","54.02","13.1","10.0","13.11","12.1","88","8.5","19.67754601226994","227","19.75","5","0.42","0","6","2","36","0","39","34","1","0","5","42","38","1","21","0","0","11","5","12","2","0","1","8","0","15","13","13","2","12","13","0","2","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/fda-approves-pull-out-method-for-over-the-counter-use/","FDA Approves ‘Pull-Out Method’ for Over the Counter Use","WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it approved the controversial contraceptive commonly know as the “pull-out method” for over-the-counter sales for women and men 17 or older.

The Obama administration had been waging a legal battle to preserve restricted access to the pull-out method—also known as withdrawal or coitus interruptus—when a federal judge ruled to back the FDA’s approval the emergency birth-control method for wider use.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius—who in 2011 blocked the FDA’s attempt to lift all age restrictions for purchasing the morning-after pill—called the decision “as risky as the withdrawal method itself.”

“It’s my opinion that the decision to approve the withdrawal method will cause a huge mess,” read a statement issued by Sebelius. “The medical research supporting this alternative form of birth control is inconsistent at best.”

Researchers compiling surveys from more than 2,000 women ages 15 to 24 found 31 percent had used the pull-out method in the last two years. Among those women, 21 percent reported having an unintended pregnancy. In contrast, 13 percent of women who only used other forms of birth control became pregnant unintentionally.

In spite of the risks, women’s health advocates say that the pull-out method provides an alternative to alternative forms of birth control like intrauterine devices (IUDs), the Depo-Provera hormone shot, the patch, or the ring.

“You can never really have enough options when it comes to preventing unwanted pregnancy,” said sex researcher Rachel K. Jones, who was showered with criticism for her 2009 report that claimed the pull-out method was nearly as effective as condoms in preventing pregnancy.

“What makes withdrawal a noteworthy alternative to traditional birth control methods is that it places the onus on the man to be responsible,” added Jones.

“Over-the-counter access to emergency contraceptive products has the potential to further decrease the rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States,” said Center for Drug Evaluation and Research director Dr. Janet Woodcock.

Woodcock added that, counter to its recent decision to lift all age restrictions for Plan B, the FDA has no plans to alter the age requirements for the pull-out method.

“Asking young teenagers to remember to wear a condom is one thing,” said Woodcock, “but asking them to exercise the kind of self control it takes to use the pull-out method would be disastrous.”","2013-11-10 13:53:42","0","28.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","54.0","1.0","35.0","3","406","98.03","66.24","30.74","18.51","27.07","26.11","78.82","40.64","6.16","0.99","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.25","0.25","5.17","10.34","15.52","4.43","2.22","4.19","0.49","11.08","3.94","3.69","1.48","2.96","1.97","2.96","1.23","1.72","0.49","0.99","0.00","7.39","1.23","0.00","1.48","0.49","11.33","2.96","3.45","0.49","1.97","0.99","2.71","1.23","0.00","1.23","0.00","5.42","0.25","4.68","1.97","0.49","8.87","0.25","0.99","5.67","1.48","1.23","4.19","4.93","0.99","12.81","1.97","5.91","5.17","3.94","0.25","0.25","0.49","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.00","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.00","17.24","3.94","3.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.45","4.43","0.99","0.49","0.00","2027","8.94","34.25","608","389","15","45.19","14.9","13.4","14.68","17.3","99","16.0","22.539948586118257","237","30.0","6","0.4","0","8","12","47","0","42","29","3","1","3","89","31","1","25","0","0","8","3","9","0","0","7","19","0","15","21","9","6","4","12","1","4","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/toronto-mayors-crack-dealer-calls-for-his-resignation/","Toronto Mayor’s Crack Dealer Calls for His Resignation","TORONTO – Toronto Mayor Rob Ford reached a new low on Thursday after a man claiming to be his crack dealer publicly called for his resignation with an open letter that was posted on the Toronto Star’s website.

Long-standing rumors of Ford’s drug use were confirmed this week when Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair announced he had obtained a video of the mayor using crack cocaine, but Ford is holding his ground and refusing to resign in spite of condemnations from almost every major Toronto media outlet.

The Toronto Star posted Slick Jay’s open letter to Ford in the online edition of their Sunday paper, prefacing the 400-word rant with a disclaimer that the Star Media Group, who owns the Star, does not condone “the actions of Rob Ford” or “the business of Slick Jay.”

“It’s time for Mr. Ford to step down. Toronto’s mayor is an even worse customer than he is a politician, and things need to change. The man is irresponsible by any business standards, drug related or not,” Slick Jay wrote.

“The video is water under the bridge, even though it has done significant damage to my entrepreneurial endeavors. However, my business relationship with the mayor has been characterized by staggering incompetence, constant lies, and a borderline sociopathic refusal to take responsibility for any of his actions.”

Slick Jay cited Ford’s 1999 DUI arrest and marijuana possession charge as proof that the mayor “should never have been trusted.” He also called out Ford for his well-known habit of skipping city council meetings to coach football, and revealed that Ford would use his “passion for the game” as an excuse to avoid meeting Slick Jay’s bagmen in a “timely manner.”

Slick Jay also targeted Ford’s younger brother, Doug, a Toronto City Councillor, for his repeated denial of Rob’s crack cocaine use, calling it a “bitch move.”

Pundits expect the loss of support in the junkie community to have a severe impact on the Ford brothers’ odds of reelection. In spite of mounting pressure, Mayor Ford issued a brief statement denying his involvement with Slick Jay or the “drug community” and again insisted that he would not vacate his office.","2013-11-04 10:19:04","0","25.0","7.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","48.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","363","93.85","73.69","2.93","1.00","27.92","21.76","71.90","42.15","7.44","4.41","0.55","0.00","0.00","3.58","0.28","3.03","9.09","13.77","5.79","2.75","4.68","1.10","10.74","2.75","1.65","0.55","0.55","1.10","5.23","0.83","4.41","0.55","1.10","1.10","11.02","0.55","0.00","0.00","4.68","8.26","0.83","1.38","1.38","1.93","0.83","2.75","0.83","0.83","0.00","0.00","1.38","0.00","0.83","0.28","0.28","7.71","1.93","1.38","3.58","0.55","1.10","3.58","6.06","0.28","10.47","1.65","5.23","3.86","4.41","1.65","0.00","1.38","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.08","3.86","4.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.83","4.96","2.75","0.00","0.00","1719","8.8","46.625","527","362","14","53.65","11.5","12.2","11.78","14.9","89","17.333333333333332","22.194254143646408","209","38.12","2","0.41","0","10","2","37","2","43","17","2","0","3","77","56","1","12","0","0","7","12","13","0","0","2","10","0","12","18","11","11","2","10","1","1","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/texas-board-of-education/","Texas Board of Education Revises Textbooks: Slaves were 'Unpaid Interns'","DALLAS — The Texas Board of Education has drawn scrutiny in recent years for its efforts to revise its curriculum to favor more conservative-friendly versions of history and science. After revising textbooks last year to emphasize Christian influences on the Founding Fathers and introduce Intelligent Design to biology classes, the Board voted nine to zero today to change official nomenclature regarding slavery. In Texas, students will now be taught that slaves were not kidnapped and exploited against their will, but were actually “unpaid interns.”

“While African workers were not compensated monetarily,” the new curriculum guidelines acknowledge, “by working outside picking cotton, they gained valuable career experience and were provided with ample networking opportunities.”

Charlie Schuster, a three-term board member from Dallas, introduced the motion. For the incredulous Schuster, the idea that the Founding Fathers were involved in a system of owning fellow humans simply was too much to believe. “Either the Founding Fathers were divinely-inspired statesmen,” said Schuster, “or they endorsed slavery. That’s a pretty glaring contradiction. So obviously slavery didn’t exist.”

“Sure, these plantation interns had it harder than today’s modern college students,” Board of Ed member Alan Wixom told Newslo. “They didn’t have coffee breaks, they couldn’t goof around on Facebook, they were frequently beaten within an inch of sweet merciful death — but they made lifelong connections and built some strong resumes in the process. Not to mention the acclaimed music they were encouraged to write!”

Schuster’s motion reportedly included several primary source documents provided by revisionist historian David Barton, which lent credibility to the Board’s interpretation of slavery. One of the documents — a diary entry supposedly written by a slave in Virginia — proudly describes the glowing letter of recommendation he was given by “the man with the bullwhip.”

But the Board’s critics were vocal in their opposition to the changes. “Look at this garbage,” said education activist Javier Narilla, reading from the new curriculum. “‘History textbooks should mention that the international slave trade was merely an early precursor to modern study abroad programs.’ This is the law now.”

Added Narilla, “I hate this state.”

Whether liberal or conservative, political and pedagogical experts agree that the implications of this decision are monumental, Texas State Senators are already considering legislation that would award slaves retroactive college credit in lieu of reparations.","2013-09-17 21:14:04","0","29.0","8.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","51.0","31.0","0.0","72.0","1.0","35.0","7","384","91.47","58.24","18.52","81.93","19.20","34.90","78.65","40.36","6.77","2.86","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","2.34","3.91","7.55","12.76","7.03","2.60","3.65","1.56","11.46","3.65","1.56","0.52","1.04","1.56","4.95","3.91","0.78","0.00","0.78","0.00","7.81","0.78","0.52","0.00","1.56","9.64","1.82","1.82","0.78","1.30","0.52","3.91","2.08","0.52","0.78","0.26","1.04","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.52","10.16","1.30","2.86","6.25","1.04","0.00","7.29","4.17","0.52","10.68","1.04","4.17","5.47","8.59","1.04","0.00","0.78","0.78","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","19.79","4.95","5.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.78","5.99","2.34","0.00","0.00","2130","10.21","32.666666666666664","660","385","20","43.43","13.7","12.0","16.24","15.4","137","12.75","23.95376623376624","260","29.42","2","0.39","0","11","4","35","0","41","43","1","0","4","59","35","1","34","0","0","10","4","19","1","0","0","12","0","14","23","10","14","9","6","2","0","0","0"
"http://politicops.com/nnts-rick-santorum-compares-himself-to-nelson-mandela-fighting-against-the-apartheid-of-obamacare/","Rick Santorum: “I Am Like Nelson Mandela, Fighting Against The Apartheid Of Obamacare”","“On a recent edition of O’Reilly Factor, Rick Santorum compared Obamacare to apartheid, then called Obamacare “cool” because it helped Republicans win in 2014. “Nelson Mandela died some time ago,” O’Reilly said. “I don’t know if you’re aware. Ninety-five years old. Nelson Mandela – I spent some time in South Africa, he was a communist, this man. He was a communist. But he was a great man anyway. The sacrifices he made for his people were just stunning. But he was a communist. A great man, but a communist.”

““I would never attack Nelson Mandela,” O’Reilly continued. “I told Bishop Tutu, who’s like that too, but I told him, ‘I respect you.’ Why can’t you guys in the Republican Party bring that to the forum?”

““Well, Nelson Mandela stood up against a great injustice,” Santorum replied. “And he was willing to pay a huge price for that. And it’s for that reason he – he – he is mourned today, because of that struggle he performed. But what he was advocated for was not necessarily the right answer, but he was fighting against some great injustice.”

““I would make the argument,” Santorum continued, “that we have a great injustice going on too, in this country, with an ever-increasing size of government that is taking over and controlling people’s lives, and Obamacare is front-and-center in that.”

““And I agree with [O’Reilly’s] talking points earlier, that the center focus of the 2014 election was Obamacare and all of its aspects,” he concluded. “And the cool thing about Obamacare is that it’s not only bad for the economy, not only bad for people’s health, it’s also bad for freedom of conscience – it’s also bad for a whole variety of issues that have energized all across America.”","2013-12-06 10:19:32","0","24.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","68.0","1.0","35.0","5","298","53.92","71.58","11.39","57.50","14.90","20.13","85.91","52.68","16.44","9.06","2.68","0.34","1.01","5.03","0.00","7.38","7.05","11.41","8.05","4.36","6.71","2.01","13.76","4.03","1.68","1.01","1.34","2.35","8.05","4.70","3.02","0.34","1.01","0.34","13.42","0.00","0.34","0.00","6.38","11.74","1.68","2.68","1.01","1.34","1.68","4.36","1.01","0.00","0.34","0.67","0.67","0.00","0.67","0.00","0.00","8.72","2.01","0.34","3.02","2.68","1.34","7.05","6.38","0.67","11.07","1.01","5.70","4.36","1.68","0.34","0.00","1.34","0.67","0.67","3.02","0.00","1.34","1.01","0.34","0.34","31.21","6.38","7.72","0.00","0.00","0.34","0.00","1.34","9.40","5.37","0.00","0.67","1311","7.37","20.6","415","294","20","73.47","10.2","6.7","10.08","8.6","56","2.9583333333333335","15.49904761904762","157","17.07","13","0.54","0","14","3","32","0","36","19","0","0","3","34","36","1","10","0","0","31","2","16","1","0","2","3","0","5","24","7","5","11","8","3","2","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/republicans-outraged-by-violation-of-mens-privacy/","Republicans Outraged by Violation of Men’s Privacy","WASHINGTON — Since PRISM whistleblower Edward Snowden first revealed that the NSA has been secretly collecting communication data on millions of Americans without warrants or due process, prominent Republicans across the country have been speaking out against this gross violation of non-vaginal privacy.

“There is no justification for the government to intrude on the personal lives of American citizens,” said libertarian-favorite Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. “Of course there are going to be small exceptions when it comes to women, or gays, or people with vaguely ethnic-sounding names, but for the most part the right to privacy is sacred.” Paul has even threatened to sue the federal government over the NSA’s controversial surveillance program.

In the House, outrage over privacy violations almost brought the lower chamber to a complete standstill this week. Representatives were so busy attempting to restore constitutional protections that they were barely able to approve a bill severely curtailing a woman’s right to choose. The bill, which passed 228-196, would ban abortion after 20 weeks, even in cases of rape or incest.

“The Obama administration has shown appalling disregard for the privacy of American citizens,” said architect of the abortion ban Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., at a press conference Thursday. “Looks like it’s up to Congress to rein in government once again.”","2013-06-24 10:17:35","1","27.0","10.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","59.0","31.0","0.0","85.0","1.0","35.0","9","219","97.61","55.44","35.19","2.20","19.91","30.14","75.80","42.01","3.65","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.46","3.20","8.22","17.35","6.39","4.11","3.20","0.91","10.50","4.11","1.83","0.91","2.74","0.91","5.94","1.37","4.11","0.46","2.28","0.46","5.94","0.00","0.00","0.91","0.00","8.22","1.37","0.91","0.46","3.65","0.46","3.65","3.20","0.91","1.83","0.46","3.20","0.46","1.37","2.74","0.00","7.76","0.46","0.91","5.94","0.00","0.91","3.65","5.48","0.46","14.16","1.83","7.31","5.02","4.11","0.00","0.46","0.91","0.46","0.00","0.91","0.00","0.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.18","5.48","5.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.74","3.65","1.37","0.00","0.00","1130","8.95","31.714285714285715","350","214","12","53.41","13.6","10.2","14.38","13.4","60","10.6","20.334953271028038","158","28.14","6","0.4","0","5","3","21","0","28","19","1","1","1","35","21","3","15","0","0","3","0","11","0","0","1","11","0","9","8","6","5","3","8","1","0","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/obama-secretly-asked-kenyan-uncle-to-self-deport/","Obama Secretly Asked Kenyan Uncle to Self-Deport","WASHINGTON — President Obama’s domestic policy has been met with frustration from his own base, even as he attempts to pivot away from healthcare-related distractions and towards comprehensive immigration reform. Now he is faced with the uncomfortable task of telling his Kenyan uncle that he cannot stay at the White House over the Christmas holiday.

Onyango Okech Obama, the president’s uncle, indicated that “Barry owed me one for allowing him to crash at my place in Cambridge for a few weeks in the ‘80s while he was waiting to move into his own apartment.”

So Onyango Okech Obama was dumbfounded when he received a curt request from White House Press Secretary Jay Carney to “politely self-deport back to Kenya so as not to create yet another headache for B.O.”

The president’s uncle had been living illegally in the United States over the past five decades until last week, when he was granted permission to stay with a green card.

The White House has already been forced to retract a 2011 statement indicating that the two had never met, though Carney still claims that the President had “absolutely zero” participation in his uncle’s deportation case.

Noted presidential historian Newt Gingrich suggested that the first family was likely worried about having the president’s uncle in residence for a number of reasons.”

“Birthers would latch onto the Kenyan connection and his own party might claim the president had granted a free pass to his relative when his administration has deported more immigrants annually than that of George W. Bush,” said Gingrich. “But I suspect his uncle’s heavy drinking put the kibosh on the visit.”

Onyango Okech Obama had been arrested on drunk driving charges in 2011, which brought him to the attention of immigration officials. But it was his overly potent rum cake that caught the first lady’s attention when she received it as an offering to apologize for a lackluster Christmas gift.

An anonymous White House official told Politico that the first lady considered her husband’s uncle a bad influence on the Obama girls. “Last time they had him over for Christmas, he re-gifted a bust of the 16th president that he obviously took from the Lincoln bedroom,” said the highly-ranking source. “Michelle awkwardly accepted the gift, which she promptly returned to the bedroom only to find an empty bottle of Changaa,” an alcoholic drink popular in Kenya.

“Still, the family realizes this is a sensitive issue, so they’re not going to round him up and forcibly deport him. Like with healthcare, they decided to adopt Romney’s policy instead when it came to urging Onyango back to Kenya.”","2013-12-11 10:57:42","0","27.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","440","90.06","85.21","18.77","29.57","25.88","24.09","79.32","46.59","10.45","6.82","0.68","0.00","0.00","5.68","0.45","3.64","9.32","14.55","5.68","5.00","4.32","0.91","11.59","4.32","1.36","1.59","2.05","0.68","2.73","1.36","1.14","0.45","0.23","0.23","13.86","2.27","0.00","1.36","6.82","7.27","2.95","1.36","0.23","0.45","0.68","1.82","2.27","1.36","0.45","0.68","1.82","0.00","0.68","0.00","1.36","8.64","1.36","1.36","5.45","0.23","0.23","6.59","3.18","0.45","16.14","3.18","6.14","7.95","2.95","2.05","2.50","0.45","0.68","0.00","0.68","0.00","0.45","0.23","0.00","0.00","14.55","4.09","3.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.91","4.09","2.27","0.00","0.00","2128","8.56","37.5","661","436","17","53.95","14.3","12.1","12.42","15.3","101","13.0","21.506055045871562","250","32.83","5","0.45","0","5","8","44","0","54","30","1","0","2","75","54","1","9","0","0","23","11","25","0","0","2","17","0","14","31","8","16","3","9","3","0","0","5"
"http://politicops.com/victory-over-thanksgiving-proves-power-of-bi-partisanship/","Victory Over Thanksgiving Proves Power of Bi-Partisanship","WASHINGTON – Bucking the recent trend of partisan rancor, both liberals and conservatives are celebrating the fact that the War on Thanksgiving is “proceeding wonderfully” and nearing completion. With fewer Americans travelling to be with loved ones this year and Black Fridays sales starting earlier than ever, the fourth Thursday in November is nearing the end of its transformation from a day of giving thanks to an orgy of rapacious consumerism.

“Compared with other major holidays, Thanksgiving was just not pulling its weight,” said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon. “There was comparably little revenue generated, and nothing controversial to get people up in arms.” This prompted Wal-Mart to start a campaign to replace the holiday with something that would generate more passion and revenues. It found allies from across the political spectrum.

“To be honest, the reason Thanksgiving was worthless was because it was so vague,” said Fox News host and murder–phile author Bill O’Reilly. “Giving thanks is a fine idea – but to whom? It should be God, but it’s so open ended you could project anyone in there. Or no one. Not really the wedge issue one expects from a holiday.” O’Reilly did note that the end of Thanksgiving will allow for more time to be dedicated to the War on Christmas. “Now that’s a war that’s great for business,” he said.

The vanquishing also has its supporters amongst the liberal elite. Taking a break from stalking corporate CEO’s to ambush them with accusations of union busting, filmmaker Michael Moore told reporters that the War on Thanksgiving played perfectly into the liberal agenda. “It was just a speed bump in between our annual pagan rite of Halloween and the War on Christmas – which is very real and organized, I might add. Not having this day of warmth and family will free up resources for achieving our real goal – getting God out of every single facet of every American’s life.”

“Keep Christ out of Christmas,” he added.

Not everyone is happy about the recent turn of events, however. Butterball CEO Ron Brenneman said that while he was happy to do his part by concocting a scheme to cut the availability of turkeys by almost 50% — a move aimed at getting people away from dinner tables and into stores – it will affect his bottom line. “We’re happy to take one for Team Consumption, but we expect to have this made up to us on the back end.” Brenneman suggested that turkeys be introduced into nativity scenes or given as gifts at Christmas to help make up for the drop in sales.

Experts say the War on Thanksgiving has been the most effective holiday obliteration since Columbus Day was relegated from “parade worthy” to “afterthought.”","2013-11-27 09:53:10","0","24.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","50.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","456","90.70","64.55","23.51","63.19","19.83","21.49","83.11","48.25","8.77","2.85","0.22","1.10","0.22","1.10","0.22","5.92","7.02","17.11","7.89","3.29","4.82","1.32","14.91","5.48","2.63","0.44","1.32","2.41","5.92","3.95","1.97","0.00","1.54","0.22","6.80","0.22","0.00","0.00","1.10","9.65","1.10","2.19","1.10","1.75","1.54","2.85","1.97","0.22","1.10","0.44","1.75","0.22","0.22","0.44","0.66","10.09","2.63","1.32","5.26","2.41","0.00","5.04","7.02","1.32","14.69","1.10","7.02","6.58","3.07","1.97","0.22","1.97","1.97","1.54","0.66","0.00","0.66","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.35","4.82","3.07","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.44","4.82","1.75","0.00","0.22","2148","7.87","24.31578947368421","676","457","23","59.74","12.1","9.9","11.08","11.5","94","12.875","18.187571115973743","279","22.47","7","0.46","0","15","4","40","0","63","30","3","0","7","68","51","0","25","1","0","15","7","19","1","1","4","17","0","23","20","16","10","5","11","3","1","0","0"
"http://politicops.com/ahmadinejad-to-focus-on-presidential-library/","Ahmadinejad to Focus on Presidential Library","TEHERAN, Iran — Plans for the Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Center for the Purification of Reputation are said to be moving ahead quickly, which is welcome news for the Iranian president as his turbulent time in office comes to an end this summer.

Between a moderate winning a stunning victory in the election to succeed him – a move many are seeing as a repudiation of his hardline policies – and being summoned by a criminal court over flimsy accusations of corruption, Ahmadinejad admitted that his presidency is “coming in for a rough landing.”

“My image could really use a little rehab,” said the soon-to-be-ex-president. “When I saw that [George W.] Bush got a library and no one seems to mind anymore that he drove the U.S. off a cliff, I figured that was the way to go.”

Center director Shayar Bayat says that memorabilia from both Ahmadinejad’s public and private life will be on display, like his friendship collage with late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and a dog-eared, heavily highlighted copy of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.”

However, more high-tech features will also be available. At specially designed touchscreen kiosks, visitors can interact with a virtual Ahmadinejad who explains why the Holocaust is “a myth” perpetuated by “governments in the pay of Zion.” If the user selects pre-programmed responses such as “No respected authority agrees with you,” or “How can you be so callously uninformed and insane?” the automated Ahmadinejad explains why you are a “Jew sympathizer who will burn in hell.”

For the children, the Center will feature a demonstration explaining how the reckless defying of international resolutions has left them a bleak economic picture. The Mahmoud Lack-of-Many-Jobs ride will feature a water slide that gets steeper at special “sanction markers” as kids slip, slide and are ultimately deposited into the Great Islamic Unemployment Pool of Iran.

Those with a non-political bent can also enjoy the Center. The “Shi’a Members Only” exhibit will have mannequins dressed in replica outfits Ahmadinejad wore over the course of his presidency. “We want to convey how Mr. Ahmadinejad changed the way people saw violent Muslim extremists,” said Bayat. “Instead of the keffiyeh clad lunatics you see in the movies, he gave genocidal extremism a more ‘Casual Friday’ face.”

The Center is set to open in 2017, around the same time Iran plans to announce another tribute to Ahmadinejad’s legacy – it’s fully operational nuclear arsenal.","2013-06-24 10:14:42","0","25.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","410","93.51","76.04","11.07","53.27","24.12","27.80","76.83","45.61","7.56","4.15","0.73","0.24","0.98","1.95","0.24","3.41","10.98","13.90","6.83","4.39","4.88","0.49","13.66","4.15","1.95","2.20","0.49","1.46","2.68","1.95","0.49","0.00","0.49","0.00","8.54","0.00","0.24","0.00","1.95","5.61","1.71","1.95","0.98","0.73","0.00","1.22","3.41","1.71","0.98","0.73","1.46","0.49","0.73","0.00","0.24","7.56","1.22","1.71","4.39","1.46","0.24","3.17","8.29","2.68","12.93","2.93","7.56","2.68","4.63","0.73","0.00","0.73","1.71","0.49","0.49","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.51","4.63","3.66","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","2.68","6.59","1.22","0.00","0.49","1988","9.39","46.111111111111114","645","403","19","49.96","13.9","11.6","12.76","13.6","120","16.833333333333332","22.390669975186103","266","39.44","6","0.44","0","7","1","52","0","50","35","2","0","10","59","54","0","18","0","0","12","5","15","1","0","0","10","0","18","15","6","8","9","18","2","2","0","6"
"http://politicops.com/mayor-bloomberg-on-suicide-watch-after-election/","Mayor Bloomberg on Suicide Watch After Election","NEW YORK – Reports are coming from City Hall that Michael Bloomberg has been put on suicide watch due to today’s election, which officially marks the end of his tenure as Mayor of New York City. Bloomberg has been mayor for twelve years, and will once again become a civilian in January when the new mayor Democrat Bill de Blasio – takes the helm.

“He has been in denial months,” said one source close to Bloomberg, “and I don’t think any of us really thought this day would come. After persuading the City Council to remove term limits, allowing him to run a third time, he kind of assumed he would pull something else out of the hat to stay in power, but it just didn’t happen this time.”

Others inside the administration were concerned that the mayor was spiraling into depression about how he would fill his time after leaving office. “He’ll have to just live with his $31 billion, 14 houses around the world, and piloting his helicopter and futuristic AgustaWestland AW609 Tiltrotor hybrid helicopter-plane when it comes out,” said a friend with knowledge of Bloomberg’s situation. We’re all extremely worried for him.” Meanwhile, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly went on record as saying that Bloomberg not being on the ballot was “the worst thing to happen to New York City in living memory,” lamenting that “no one stopped and frisked 32oz sodas like Mike did.”

One source did confirm that both Bloomberg and Ray Kelly voted for the current mayor as a write-in candidate, but they were not optimistic about his chances.","2013-11-05 21:06:40","0","21.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","51.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","263","77.58","63.39","59.44","11.13","29.22","17.87","81.75","47.53","10.65","5.70","0.38","0.76","0.00","4.18","0.38","4.94","5.70","15.21","8.37","4.56","5.32","1.90","17.49","4.56","2.66","1.52","3.42","1.14","2.28","0.38","1.52","0.38","0.00","0.38","7.98","0.00","0.38","0.00","4.56","10.27","2.66","1.52","1.14","1.52","0.76","3.04","1.52","0.38","1.14","0.00","1.14","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.38","5.70","1.14","0.38","2.66","0.76","0.76","5.70","7.98","1.52","21.67","3.80","8.75","9.51","2.66","0.00","0.38","0.38","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.97","3.42","4.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.76","4.18","2.28","0.00","0.38","1217","8.26","45.0","357","264","9","58.66","11.2","12.4","11.15","15.8","53","12.5","21.75030303030303","176","39.33","4","0.46","0","8","6","21","0","37","12","0","1","4","42","36","0","7","0","0","13","5","11","0","0","1","8","0","12","13","10","7","5","7","1","0","0","3"
"http://politicops.com/terrorist-mastermind-ayman-al-zawahiri-received-military-security-clearance/","Terrorist Mastermind Ayman al-Zawahiri Received Military Security Clearance","WASHINGTON — An internal investigation carried out by the Department of Defense in response to Monday’s mass shooting at a Navy building in Washington, D.C. has revealed that Ayman al-Zawahiri—the nominal leader of the Islamist terror group al-Qaeda—was given top security clearance last year, allowing him to enter virtually any secured military building in the United States unattended. Military officials admit that giving clearance to the man who is believed to have helped mastermind the 9/11 terror attacks was a “pretty big blunder,” but maintain that the “system is not flawed.”

The report, released Tuesday, shows that in August of 2012 Ayman al-Zawahiri—the world’s most-wanted fugitive who became the leader of al-Qaeda after Osama Bin Laden’s death—applied for a “secret” level security clearance at the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office. Zawahiri’s request was approved on the spot, despite the fact that, according to the report, he “mumbled something about death to America.”

Stan Sims, Director of the Defense Security Service (DSS), says that giving a terrorist madman access to U.S. military sites is “not ideal” and “definitely unfortunate,” but asserted that it’s “just one of those things that happens sometimes.”

“When Zawahiri came in here, he had such a nice face, and he asked so politely,” Sims said. “We simply don’t have the time to check out every single person who applies for clearance. Usually we have to just make these decisions with our gut.”

“This time, I admit, we may have made the wrong call,” Sims said.

The report’s findings are likely to further enrage a public already frustrated with the Department of Defense’s security-clearance procedures. On Monday, a gunman identified as former Navy reservist and military contractor Aaron Alexis killed 12 people in a mass shooting inside Washington, D.C.’s Naval Yard. Alexis had reportedly been given security clearance to enter the premises at-will, despite a “pattern of misconduct” while with the Navy and multiple incidents of firearm misuse dating back to 2004, when he was arrested in Seattle for drunkenly shooting out the tires of a man’s truck. Alexis was killed in a shoot-out with police Monday.

Sims admitted that Alexis represented the “worst-case scenario,” but pointed out that, in Zawahiri’s case, the error was noticed and corrected “before anything catastrophic could happen.”

“Thankfully, Zawahiri seems to have only made use of his clearance to get free buffet-style breakfasts at various military-run cafeterias,” Sims explained. “The only form of terrorism he was able to engage in was the stink bomb he left in the bathroom on Breakfast Fajitas Friday—not that that wasn’t devastating in its own right.”","2013-09-17 21:08:46","0","25.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","448","94.41","73.40","22.76","29.50","26.35","26.56","75.89","43.30","8.04","2.90","0.22","0.89","0.00","1.79","0.00","5.13","8.71","14.73","6.03","3.57","2.90","1.12","12.95","3.57","2.01","1.12","1.56","1.56","7.81","4.02","3.79","0.89","1.12","0.22","8.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.23","10.04","2.90","1.34","0.67","2.46","0.89","2.01","1.34","0.45","0.67","0.00","1.34","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.89","9.60","1.34","1.12","4.69","0.45","2.68","6.92","5.36","0.45","13.84","1.12","8.04","4.91","3.12","0.89","0.45","0.45","0.22","0.89","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.21","4.91","5.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.46","6.70","2.68","0.45","0.22","2185","9.25","41.81818181818182","683","429","19","48.54","13.4","12.1","14.22","15.2","122","12.0","22.415291375291375","262","36.18","9","0.43","0","8","6","45","1","57","32","0","1","3","75","66","1","14","1","0","12","3","17","0","1","6","15","0","14","33","9","17","6","11","1","3","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/sean-hannity-questions-chris-christies-birthplace-after-decisive-victory/","Sean Hannity Questions Chris Christie’s Birthplace After Decisive Victory","TRENTON, N.J. — Sean Hannity used his Wednesday radio broadcast to question the birthplace of newly reelected N.J. Gov. Chris Christie, suggesting that Christie is not only out of the “mainstream of conservatism,” he also may be ineligible for higher office.

“I don’t know what the big appeal of Christie––just based on the record––is,” Hannity told his listeners. “Christie tells us that he was born in ‘Newark,’ but let me ask you this, why does the governor refuse to specify whether that was Newark, New Jersey or Newark-on-Trent in the United Kingdom?”

According to Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, only citizens or natural born citizens are eligible for the office of president.

“New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania—some of these states are not the same as red states,” claimed Hannity. “They’re just as foreign and exotic as is Hawaii, with equally shoddy record keeping.”

He went on to argue, “Barack Hussein Obama’s forged Hawaiian birth certificate may have been enough to dupe a majority of voters, but we still have time to stop Christie before he makes it all the way to Pennsylvania Avenue.”

Hannity demanded answers to questions that would help determine Christie’s true origin. “Hey Chris, [the gubernatorial] election’s over. I dare you. I dare you” to answer questions like, “What exit on the parkway? Where is Jimmy Hoffa buried? Sinatra or Springsteen? Who pumps your gas?”

This is not the first time Hannity has taken to the airwaves to challenge the nationality of political candidates.

Said Hannity on another broadcast, “You know, John McCain had questions about whether he was born in America. Dick Cheney had to prove his residency in Wyoming. If we want to take it back further, other presidents have been questioned about their residency. What’s wrong with asking about, ‘OK, can you just show us the birth certificate?’”

Even Alan Colmes, Hannity’s former cohost on Fox News, had trouble convincing Hannity of his background. “No matter what I said or did, neither Sean nor the viewing public would take me seriously as a proper liberal counterweight,” lamented Colmes.

Hannity made it clear that his pedigree is indisputable. “I know I was born in Metropolitan Hospital in New York, December 30, 1961. By the way, I was born to be a conservative because I was a tax deduction for that year.”","2013-11-07 13:05:05","0","28.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","66.0","1.0","35.0","4","394","71.16","65.78","37.17","21.86","14.59","23.60","74.11","47.97","12.69","7.87","2.54","1.02","1.52","2.54","0.25","4.82","5.58","13.45","9.14","3.81","4.31","1.78","15.23","5.58","3.05","2.28","1.02","1.52","1.78","0.76","1.02","0.00","0.25","0.00","9.90","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.54","11.42","3.55","2.03","1.02","3.30","1.02","3.81","2.03","1.02","1.02","0.00","0.51","0.25","0.25","0.25","0.00","6.09","1.27","0.51","2.54","1.27","0.76","6.60","7.36","0.51","12.69","0.25","6.35","6.09","2.79","0.25","0.51","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.76","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","24.11","5.84","7.36","0.00","0.00","1.52","0.00","0.51","6.09","2.28","0.00","0.51","1842","7.99","20.05","572","388","25","64.2","11.3","8.2","11.71","10.1","88","8.6","17.27216494845361","233","18.15","15","0.46","0","8","3","31","0","46","24","1","0","5","41","73","0","12","1","0","29","7","17","1","0","0","14","0","18","19","6","14","12","13","1","4","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/rand-paul-admits-basing-ideology-off-ayn-rand-cliffsnotes/","Rand Paul Admits Basing Ideology off Ayn Rand CliffsNotes","WASHINGTON — Senator Rand Paul’s political future continued to dim this week as reporters and adversaries unearthed further instances of plagiarism stretching back to the Kentucky senator’s formative schooldays.

Initial reports that the senator lifted portions of his speeches from Wikipedia were initially dismissed as the indiscretions of young staffers, but further investigation revealed that Paul’s entire political philosophy may have been based on a slapdash book report copied, in large part, from CliffsNotes.

Paul’s high school book report, entitled “Objectivism in Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand by Randal Paul,” includes entire paragraphs lifted verbatim from the popular study guide designed for students who prefer to skip the tedious prose and get straight to the executive summary.

Joanne Taggart, who taught Paul at Brazoswood High School where he was involved in swimming and football, said, “Randal didn’t spend a lot of time hitting the books.” She remembers Paul “complaining that ‘Atlas Shrugged’ was, ‘not in any literary sense a serious novel, it [was] an earnest one, belligerent and unremitting in its earnestness.’”

Fact checkers have since sourced Paul’s criticism back to a 1957 review by Granville Hicks of the New York Times.

Taggart characterized Paul’s grasp of Ayn Rand’s philosophy as, “loose at best, designed to woo the ladies into thinking he was a serious intellectual when he was anything but.”

Unsurprised that Paul apparently never read any of Ayn Rand’s books in full despite regularly quoting them at length in Congress, Taggart suggested that, “Randal—or Rand as he’s now known—is as unfit for the U.S. presidency as he was for class president.”

Paul defended himself by calling Rachel Maddow, who first raised the charges against him, a “hater” and maintained that he is “not a plagiarist.”“A plagiarist is someone who commits the ‘wrongful appropriation’ and ‘purloining and publication’ of another author’s ‘language, thoughts, ‘ideas, or expressions.’”

Ironically, senator’s definition also appears to come from the Wikipedia entry for “plagiarism.”

Still, Paul has vowed to footnote his public statements and establish a “study group” to discuss Ayn Rand’s oeuvre, promising to “actually read her works cover to cover this time, not just the book jackets.”","2013-11-20 22:32:22","0","28.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","62.0","1.0","35.0","4","357","90.38","65.27","17.56","8.85","32.45","31.93","73.11","41.74","8.40","3.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.36","0.28","4.76","6.72","14.57","4.76","3.36","5.60","1.40","9.24","6.72","2.52","1.68","0.84","2.24","3.64","1.12","2.52","0.00","0.56","0.00","8.40","0.00","0.00","0.84","2.80","10.64","3.08","0.84","0.28","2.80","1.40","3.08","1.96","0.56","0.56","0.56","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","6.16","0.28","0.84","4.76","0.56","0.28","3.64","4.20","0.84","12.89","1.12","6.72","5.60","7.84","2.80","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","24.09","3.92","6.72","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.84","5.04","0.00","0.56","1859","9.66","74.2","557","355","13","43.77","14.8","13.9","15.15","18.3","105","16.333333333333332","24.75098591549296","221","58.6","4","0.41","0","12","2","28","0","47","26","0","2","1","60","55","0","21","0","0","11","4","15","0","0","0","11","0","12","24","7","12","5","10","0","4","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/rand-paul-protests-government-intrusion-into-pets-food-choices/","Rand Paul Protests Government Intrusion into Pets' Food Choices","WASHINGTON—Sensing an opening for a libertarian pushback against healthcare reform, Tea Party darling Rand Paul today issued an impassioned attack against newly proposed rules regulating the production of animal feed.

The senator from Kentucky, a self-described “warrior against government overreach,” used his seat on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee to denounce the Food and Drug Administration’s latest attempt to “force-feed arbitrary regulations down the throats of our pets, who have a God-given right to the rice, liver, and Purina blend of their choice.”

The long-awaited proposal follows the 2010 passage of the Food Safety and Modernization Act, which opened the door to government regulation of pet food. Like the deadly melamine found in imported dog and cat food that precipitated congressional action, tainted jerky treats from China appear to be responsible for the recent spate of 600 dog deaths and over 3,000 complaints dogging the FDA.

Paul, a doctor of ophthalmology, said he is “working to ensure that real free market principles are applied to the American health care system so that it is responsive to pets’ freedom of choice rather than government bureaucracy.”

The senator has long advocated for animal rights. Shortsighted himself, Paul’s Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic focuses on curing feline vision problems.

Speaking to Glenn Beck on the topic of marriage rights, Paul further indicated that he believed equality was meant for everyone, pets included. “If we have no laws on this, people take it to one extension further,” said Paul. “Does it have to be humans?”

In addition to bestiality, pet food choices should be protected as well, claims Paul. “It’s a decision between man and man’s best friend. The only pet whose food should be dictated by the federal government is Bo [Obama].”

Paul argues that the new FDA rules, which are expected to cost the industry $130 million annually, amount to slavery. “As humans, yeah, we do have an obligation to give pets water, to give pets food,” allowed Paul, but “once you conscript people and say, ‘You can feed your cat Fancy Feast but not Meow Mix,’ then it’s servitude.”

He calls the introduction of new regulations “a dog and pony show,” designed “to show people that something bad happened, which it did, something terrible and tragic happened and I don’t want to demean or in any way lessen that, but the response to it is, ‘Hey, look over here…go fetch this government-sanctioned bone.’ It’s completely dehumanizing.”","2013-11-01 15:01:22","0","26.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","56.0","1.0","35.0","3","415","90.76","75.02","2.93","29.81","24.41","24.58","76.63","41.20","9.16","3.13","0.24","0.72","0.72","1.20","0.24","6.02","7.47","13.01","6.27","1.45","4.82","0.72","11.81","3.37","2.41","1.20","1.93","0.72","4.10","2.17","1.93","0.00","0.48","0.24","8.92","0.24","0.48","0.00","1.69","8.67","1.93","1.20","1.69","1.69","0.48","2.65","2.41","1.20","0.96","0.00","5.30","0.96","1.20","0.00","3.13","9.64","1.45","0.48","6.75","0.48","0.96","2.89","7.95","0.48","7.71","0.72","4.82","2.17","5.54","0.24","2.17","0.96","0.24","0.24","0.72","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.24","0.00","22.65","4.10","8.67","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","1.20","5.30","2.41","0.00","0.72","2021","9.24","38.36363636363637","630","407","17","55.68","13.8","11.4","13.41","15.2","114","17.333333333333332","22.763931203931207","265","33.18","4","0.41","0","15","7","35","0","42","23","0","1","3","83","45","0","24","0","0","17","4","13","1","1","1","19","0","18","17","8","13","13","13","4","1","1","0"
"http://politicops.com/nra-suggests-schools-grant-firearm-passes-to-honor-roll-students/","NRA Suggests Schools Grant ‘Firearm Passes’ to Honor Roll Students","SPARKS, Nev.— The National Rifle Association responded to yesterday’s deadly Nevada school shooting by suggesting that schools allow “a select group of trustworthy students” to carry firearms.

A 13-year-old student at Sparks Middle School opened fire on the school’s campus just before the starting bell Monday, wounding two boys and killing a teacher, police said. The boy then shot himself dead with the semi-automatic handgun, which belonged to his parents.

Asa Hutchinson, director of the NRA’s National School Shield task force, told MSNBC’s Chris Jansing that the shooting “could have be averted had certain students been empowered to stop it.”

“Anybody that’s been to school knows that teachers can’t be in all places all at all times,” said Hutchinson. “There were reportedly 20 or 30 students that witnessed the shooting. Once the teacher was killed, they were all powerless to stop it.”

Hutchinson was referring to Michael Landsberry, the 45-year-old math teacher and former Marine who was shot and killed when he told the student to put the gun down.

“This is another case where a gun in the hands of the right person could have prevented another tragedy. Even a former Marine can’t stop a child when the child is brandishing a gun,” stated Hutchinson.

Hutchinson said The National School Shield, which the NRA created in response to last December’s mass school shooting in Newtown, Conn., would “begin exploring options that would allow certain students to carry firearms in our nation’s schools.”

“What we need is firearm passes for our best students—class presidents and honor roll-type kids that can stand up for their school and their community by providing backup to teachers.”

Federal law prohibits the possession of a handgun or handgun ammunition by any person under the age of 18, but Hutchinson pointed out that there is no minimum age for long gun possession. “We’re not talking about pistols in backpacks, of course, but many students already have hunting rifles and other arms at home that could be placed around the school in secure areas, much like fire extinguishers.”

Nevada Superintendent of Public Instruction Dale Erquiaga joined Hutchinson and Jansing on air, and said that although many school boards have weighed the option of arming teachers and administrators, the state would not support the NRA’s plan to arm students.

“Most schools don’t even allow students to have cell phones in class. There’s no way they’re going to let them carry guns,” declared Erquiaga.","2013-10-22 12:01:42","0","35.0","11.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","60.0","31.0","0.0","89.0","1.0","35.0","10","412","87.18","71.18","20.33","38.73","22.89","25.00","78.64","42.23","7.77","2.67","0.00","0.97","0.00","0.73","0.97","5.10","7.52","12.14","7.77","2.91","4.13","1.70","12.86","2.18","1.70","1.70","1.70","2.91","3.16","1.94","1.21","0.00","0.73","0.24","8.74","0.24","0.00","0.00","1.21","8.98","0.73","1.46","1.70","1.70","1.46","2.43","1.94","0.00","1.21","0.73","1.21","0.73","0.24","0.00","0.24","13.11","2.43","1.21","8.50","0.24","1.70","5.34","6.80","0.73","15.29","1.94","7.77","5.58","9.95","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.69","4.61","4.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.46","4.37","3.40","0.00","0.00","2017","8.22","35.5","577","405","18","65.56","11.2","9.7","13.29","14.4","89","12.25","19.790123456790123","234","29.92","6","0.42","0","13","6","41","0","39","21","0","2","9","69","47","0","34","0","0","9","5","12","0","0","3","14","0","25","24","13","12","7","6","7","2","0","3"

"http://newslo.com/ted-nugents-wife-files-for-divorce-after-being-outed-as-ted-nugents-wife/","Ted Nugent’s Wife Files for Divorce after being Outed as Ted Nugent’s Wife","DALLAS – Shemane Nugent, the wife of rock musician and gun enthusiast Ted Nugent, filed for divorce today, spelling an end to the couple’s 24-year marriage. According to a source close to the Nugent family, Shemane, 51, decided that “she had no choice” but to separate from Nugent after “the whole world discovered that she was married to him.”

Shemane—who was relatively unknown until recently—was outed as Ted Nugent’s wife on Friday, when she attempted to pass through Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport security with a firearm in her carry-on luggage. The handgun—which Shemane claimed to have been carrying because she had received death threats—was discovered, and she was taken into custody. “I had totally forgotten it was in there,” Nugent claimed after being released on bail. “I mean, Jesus, I live with Ted Nugent, a man who carries half an armory in his ass crack. We’ve got guns all over the goddamn place.”

Mrs. Nugent maintains that she should not have been detained for a “simple mistake,” but did issue a public apology in which she expressed remorse for having spent over two decades married to “a man who once publicly threatened to murder Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton, and who has referred to black people as ‘mongrels’.”

“It was one thing being married to him when nobody knew who I was,” Mrs. Nugent said. “His music earned us a lot of money—we had an amazing house, despite the lingering smell of deer carcass, and we were constantly traveling the world, drinking the finest moonshine, eating the most savory varmint. But, for reasons that should be obvious, I cannot be publicly known as Mrs. Ted Nugent, and I have therefore filed for divorce.”

Ted Nugent—one of the NRA’s most prominent members and an attendee at 2013’s State of the Union address—could not be reached directly for comment, but said through a spokesman that he “didn’t care, because hunting is better than sex anyway,” and added that Shemane could “suck on his machine gun.”

"http://newslo.com/lindsey-graham-to-give-syria-chemical-weapons-until-he-is-justified-in-bombing-them/","Lindsey Graham to Give Syria Chemical Weapons Until He is Justified in Bombing Them","WASHINGTON — In an effort to gain more concrete justification for US military intervention in Syria, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has unofficially admitted to sending Bashar al-Assad a slew of chemical weapons labeled with the warning, “Do Not Use (Wink).”

Despite pressure from Graham and others in Washington, President Obama has steadfastly refused to employ the use of military force in Syria, but the president said proof that the regime is using chemical weapons would be a “red line” in the intervention discussion. “I’m not sure what a ‘red line’ is,” said Graham, “but I’m pretty sure the nerve gas-tipped warheads I just shipped over there will cross it.”

In an interview Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Senator Graham said that without intervention in Syria, the region will “fall into chaos” by the end of the year. “Trust me,” he continued, “we need to bomb them…I’ve sent al-Assad some really atrocious stuff.”

The senator, along with a cohort composed predominantly of Republicans who agree with him, believes the US can significantly “turn the tide” in Syria without “putting boots on the ground.”

“This would only be done with missiles,” said Graham, with John McCain nodding vociferously behind him. “Honestly, I’d hate to see us move ground troops into Syria. It’s just so much less cool than firing cruise missiles and watching everything blow up.”

The Syrian government under al-Assad has killed over 70,000 people to date in the two-year Civil War, and new allegations are being leveled regarding the regime’s use of sarin, an advanced type of nerve gas strictly outlawed by the Geneva Convention (and by the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria never signed). While the “rebels” in Syria—a loose coalition of anti-Assad forces—have made some significant gains, their progress has been stymied by the government’s complete dominance in the air.

According to Graham and McCain, missile attacks would obliterate Syria’s air supremacy, and “be fucking awesome.”

Another concern voiced by Graham, as he played with a model fighter jet and made explosion noises at his desk, is that, “If we don’t give the rebels the military support they need, then the radical Islamists already arming them will…although I guess if the jihadists gain control we could just bomb them later. But I don’t wanna wait.”

Senator Graham has also said that if Syria does actually use the chemical weapons he supplied to them, “It would be terrible but not the worst thing in the world…I really wanna see those puppies in action.”","2013-05-02 10:51:13","0","28.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","11.0","0.0","48.0","31.0","0.0","69.0","1.0","35.0","5","427","85.23","54.66","18.81","8.82","28.47","22.01","76.35","47.78","10.30","6.32","2.11","1.41","0.00","1.41","1.41","3.98","8.90","13.58","8.67","2.81","4.68","1.87","14.75","3.28","1.41","0.70","0.70","1.41","6.56","2.58","3.98","0.23","3.04","0.00","8.43","0.00","0.23","0.00","1.41","12.41","1.17","2.58","2.81","1.64","1.41","4.45","3.28","1.17","1.64","0.47","0.94","0.70","0.00","0.23","0.00","9.60","1.64","1.64","5.62","0.94","0.94","3.04","9.37","1.41","12.18","2.11","7.03","3.04","2.11","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.47","0.47","1.64","0.23","0.23","0.70","0.00","0.00","24.12","4.22","6.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.64","7.73","2.81","1.41","0.00","2011","8.82","54.75","622","415","15","51.82","13.8","12.9","12.83","16.6","100","16.333333333333332","22.718554216867474","256","47.25","14","0.43","0","11","3","43","0","57","27","2","1","9","68","52","1","19","0","0","26","2","24","0","0","1","8","0","17","15","11","11","16","10","1","2","0","0"

"http://newslo.com/gop-house-members-stand-firm-on-belief-they-should-be-paid-during-shutdown/","GOP House Members Stand Firm On Belief They Should Be Paid During Shutdown","WASHINGTON – A number of brave Republican House members today announced that despite the government shutdown, they would bravely stand up to special interests by refusing to compromise on their belief that they should draw a regular salary.

“I need my paycheck. That’s the bottom line,” said Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina. “I understand that there may be some other members who are deferring their paychecks, and I think that’s admirable. I’m not in that position.”

Representative Ellmers went on to lay her position in full, which is that she should continue to receive money even after voting to shut down the Federal Government and furloughing over 800,000 government workers without pay. “I’ve always believed that I should be paid for doing my job, even when I don’t do it,” she explained. “I think I’ve made that very clear.”

A growing number of members of the both the House and the Senate have gone on record that they will be donating any salary they earn during the government shutdown. Forgoing the $174,000 per year salary they earn in Congress will be especially hard on members of the House of Representatives, who are only worth an average of $6.5 million as opposed to their wealthier fellow legislators in the Senate, who are worth an average of $11.9 million.

However, Representative Ellmers was not alone in standing firm and refusing to bend to the will of special interests. “I’m staying here, and I’m working,” said Republican Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. “My office is open, we’re taking phone calls, I’m voting every day, I’m debating every day, I’m going to countless meetings. I’m working to earn the salary that the people pay me to do the job. I will continue to earn it, and I will continue to collect what I earn.”

When it was pointed out that many of the furloughed employees are also continuing to do their job, only without the benefit of getting paid, Cramer responded, “They have their beliefs, and I have mine.”","2013-10-05 11:11:03","0","24.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","63.0","1.0","35.0","4","338","56.12","48.82","50.04","65.02","21.12","23.67","86.09","52.96","17.75","11.54","7.10","0.30","0.00","0.89","3.25","6.21","6.21","13.91","12.13","3.55","3.55","1.48","20.12","4.14","1.18","2.07","2.37","2.37","2.66","2.37","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.30","10.06","0.00","0.30","0.89","0.30","8.28","2.07","0.30","1.48","0.89","1.48","2.07","1.48","0.30","0.89","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.76","1.78","2.37","5.03","2.37","0.00","3.25","11.54","2.07","12.13","1.78","7.10","3.85","7.99","0.00","0.89","4.44","0.59","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.12","4.73","6.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.14","3.85","0.00","0.89","1573","7.57","27.153846153846153","492","337","17","59.84","12.0","9.8","11.2","11.6","63","7.0","17.39774480712166","182","22.77","22","0.52","0","7","10","28","0","43","18","1","0","10","31","23","1","15","0","0","32","8","15","0","0","3","14","0","20","10","19","6","28","2","1","4","0","3"
"http://newslo.com/obama-admits-to-jerking-off-raul-castro-backstage/","The Obama-Castro Handjob That Shocked The World","JOHANNESBURG — A simple handjob between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro erupted a torrent of international speculation about a coming shift in Cuban-American relations.

Obama offered Castro the handjob in front of a worldwide audience before taking the stage at Tuesday’s memorial service honoring former South African President Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg.

The brief but intimate gesture is no guarantee that the former Cold War foes are headed towards reconciliation, but optimists in both nations hope the two presidents’ aggressive sexual behavior towards one another is a sign of things to come.

“May this… be the beginning of the end of the US aggressions,” read a message on the Cuban government’s official website.

Others were less enthused about the manual stimulation.

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) who was born in Havana before her family moved to Miami, said it was “nauseating and disheartening” to watch Obama jerk off another president.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was quick to lambaste the president for his gesture of kindness, going so far as to compare it to the time Neville Chamberlain famously went down on Adolf Hitler at the start of World War II.

“Why should you give somebody who’s keeping Americans in prison a handjob? It’s a sign of weakness. If anything, Castro should be the one serving up the presidential penis pull,” McCain said.

A White House official said the handjob was not planned, and that Obama and Castro simply “exchanged greetings” as they prepared for the memorial.

After bringing Castro to climax, Obama moved on to nibble Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s ear and gingerly lick the fingers of Afghan President Hamid Karzai.","2013-12-11 15:16:17","0","27.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","55.0","1.0","35.0","3","276","97.43","66.81","29.41","11.64","17.25","28.26","75.36","41.67","6.88","1.81","0.00","0.36","0.36","0.72","0.36","5.07","9.78","15.58","5.07","1.81","3.99","0.72","11.59","5.07","3.26","1.09","1.09","1.45","3.99","1.45","2.54","0.00","2.17","0.36","6.16","0.36","0.00","0.36","0.36","5.80","0.72","0.72","1.45","1.81","0.36","1.81","3.62","0.72","1.45","0.72","1.81","1.09","0.36","0.72","0.00","10.51","2.17","0.72","7.25","0.72","0.00","5.07","4.35","1.81","17.39","4.71","8.33","4.71","4.35","0.36","0.72","0.36","0.00","1.45","0.72","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.03","5.80","2.90","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","1.45","2.90","2.17","1.45","0.00","1382","8.88","23.416666666666668","434","273","14","51.68","13.4","10.9","13.46","13.3","74","11.875","20.642490842490844","181","21.33","7","0.39","0","7","3","30","0","34","21","1","0","2","40","59","2","11","0","0","5","2","6","0","0","1","8","0","8","18","9","4","5","2","0","2","0","1"
"http://newslo.com/obama-u-s-does-not-tolerate-massacres-that-pose-environmental-risk/","Obama: U.S. Does Not Tolerate Massacres That Pose Environmental Risk","WASHINGTON — In an interview on “PBS Newshour,” President Obama confirmed that the Syrian government carried out an attack on its own people using chemical weapons and said that the United States must take action against any hostile strikes that could have “negative environmental repercussions.”

“At a time when combating climate change is of the utmost importance, we cannot stand by and watch as government leaders are massacring their citizens with warheads containing potentially hazardous chemicals,” Obama declared.

Last week’s attack in Zamalka, a suburb of Damascus, accounts for only a fraction of the lives lost in a civil war that has gripped Syria for more than two years. Roughly a month before the attack, the U.N. announced that the war’s death toll had reached 100,000.

Up to this point, the U.S. and other nations have avoided military intervention in the region, arguing that previous massacres were carried out “within the parameters of international environmental law.” Now, with the deployment of chemical weapons to carry out attacks, President Obama believes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has “crossed a red—no, make that green line.”

Syrian President al-Assad has denied responsibility for the chemical strike, instead blaming the region’s rebels. The Syrian leader believes the claims against him are “absurd’ given that he has shown himself time and again to be “an eco-friendly type of guy.”

“I recycle. I drive a hybrid. I do all of that,” said al-Assad. “The idea that I would kill my own people with weapons that could contaminate the ground water is just ridiculous.”

“Believe me,” al-Assad reiterated, “when I slaughter innocent civilians in my own country, I make sure to use low-emission explosives and then discard the bodies in a compost heap.”

The administration has yet to announce any specific plan of attack, but President Obama has said he does not intend on getting the United States involved in another open-ended war.

“This is not about ousting a dictator,” Obama insisted. “This is about sending a message to government leaders everywhere: Before you decide to drop bombs on the women and children of today, think about the effect it will have on the women and children of tomorrow.”","2013-08-30 10:27:05","0","26.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","58.0","1.0","35.0","3","370","92.02","59.61","45.17","1.00","21.76","26.22","77.84","45.95","9.46","4.59","2.43","0.27","0.54","1.08","0.27","4.86","9.73","13.78","7.03","3.24","3.24","1.35","13.51","2.16","1.35","0.54","0.81","1.35","6.49","0.81","5.41","0.27","4.32","0.54","7.84","0.00","0.54","0.54","1.35","9.19","2.16","1.89","1.08","0.81","1.35","2.43","1.89","0.81","0.81","0.27","0.81","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.27","10.54","0.81","1.89","7.57","0.54","0.54","3.24","9.19","1.35","15.41","2.16","8.38","4.86","4.05","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","1.62","0.27","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.81","5.41","5.41","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.89","6.76","1.08","0.00","0.00","1793","8.48","37.4","562","361","18","51.07","12.8","11.1","13.05","13.2","88","16.0","19.790692520775625","223","32.0","12","0.45","0","8","3","45","0","48","32","1","0","5","55","28","2","28","0","0","14","4","13","0","0","1","7","0","14","13","9","11","12","15","4","0","0","2"
"http://newslo.com/pat-buchanan-wants-russias-putin-for-u-s-president/","Pat Buchanan Wants Russia’s Putin for U.S. President","WASHINGTON – Conservative pundit Pat Buchanan believes the United States needs a third party for the future. His choice for leader?

Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In his December 17th syndicated column, Buchanan called Putin the “ideal Commander in Chief” to undo the damage wrought by “the militant secularism of a multicultural and transnational elite” led by President Barack Obama.

“In the culture war for mankind’s future,” Buchanan wrote of Putin, “is he one of us?”

“Not only is Putin one of us,” Buchanan claimed, “but he could also be the one to lead America out of its decrepit state of immorality.”

“President Reagan once called the old Soviet Empire ‘the focus of evil in the modern world,’” Buchanan wrote. “President Putin is implying that Barack Obama’s America may deserve the title in the 21st century.”

Buchanan went on to praise Putin as a fellow “paleoconservative” who could protect America from “the new immorality which has been imposed undemocratically.”

“Putin wouldn’t kowtow to a moderate political base like the contemporary GOP,” argued Buchanan, who added that Putin has all the prerequisites of an all-star Republican presidential candidate.

“He favors a balanced budget and believes in low taxes. He’s an anti-terrorist hero. Most importantly, he supports organized religion and opposes all forms of gayness.”

Earlier this year, Buchanan wrote another column that praised Putin for restoring his nation’s “moral compass” after the Russian leader signed laws banning so-called “gay propaganda.”

Of course, as Buchanan admitted, the laws of both Russia and the United States rule out even the most miniscule chance of a future U.S. President Putin, but Buchanan wrote that “the dream of a truly political, moral and cultural conservative leader is something for which America should strive.”

“Besides,” he concluded, “if a Kenyan can become President of the United States, then why not a Russian?”","2013-12-18 22:20:27","0","29.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","54.0","1.0","35.0","3","307","95.71","75.31","1.27","31.32","19.19","26.38","72.31","41.37","7.49","3.58","0.00","0.65","0.00","2.93","0.00","3.91","10.42","13.03","5.21","1.95","4.23","0.98","9.12","4.23","2.28","1.63","1.63","2.61","5.54","2.93","2.61","0.33","0.65","0.33","8.79","0.00","0.33","0.00","3.26","10.42","1.95","1.30","2.93","1.95","1.30","1.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","10.75","0.98","2.93","7.82","0.33","0.33","4.56","4.89","1.63","9.77","0.98","4.56","4.23","7.49","0.65","0.00","0.65","1.63","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","25.73","4.89","5.54","0.00","0.00","0.98","0.00","0.98","11.40","1.95","0.00","0.00","1546","8.36","34.77777777777778","468","305","17","61.77","12.5","9.1","13.74","13.0","74","7.583333333333334","18.864918032786886","181","27.56","4","0.41","0","7","4","37","0","40","29","0","1","5","46","53","3","5","1","0","8","4","11","1","1","0","4","0","8","17","3","5","1","13","3","2","0","1"
"http://newslo.com/bono-recalls-u2s-enormous-influence-on-nelson-mandela/","Bono Recalls U2’s ‘Enormous Influence’ on Nelson Mandela","DUBLIN — U2 frontman Bono paid tribute to himself in a 1,000-word essay published by TIME following the death of iconic South African leader Nelson Mandela.

“As an activist, Nelson Mandela did pretty much whatever U2 told him to,” he writes. “We have been a forceful presence in his life going back to 1979, when U2 made its first anti-apartheid effort.”

In the piece, titled ‘The Man Who Could Not Cry,’ the legendary bandleader calls his friend “a remarkable man” for using U2’s message of peace to inspire the South African people during the country’s transition from apartheid to multiparty democracy.

Bono also praised Mandela for helping U2 battle the AIDS epidemic and extreme poverty around the globe by increasing access to the greatest band in the world’s discography.

Bono closes his essay with an anecdote that gave the article its title—referencing Mandela’s inability to shed tears. “Laughter, not tears, was Madiba’s preferred way—except on one occasion when I saw him almost choke up,” he recalls.

“Madiba and I were listening to ‘One’ from our album Achtung Baby, which many people say is our best record, and I could have sworn I saw him shed a tear. Everybody cries during that song.”

Bono adds, “But he explained to me that dust damage to his tear ducts from years of working in limestone mines had left him unable to cry. After listening to the song, he said he would have surgery to put this right, and in 1994 he did. I never knew if he listened to the song again, but I would like to think that Madiba is in heaven, listening to U2’s music and weeping.”","2013-12-08 11:16:12","0","24.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","280","86.04","84.99","4.91","38.47","23.33","19.64","77.86","46.79","13.21","9.29","2.50","1.07","0.00","5.71","0.00","3.93","6.79","15.00","5.71","2.86","4.29","1.07","14.64","1.79","1.43","1.79","2.50","1.43","6.43","3.57","2.86","0.00","0.36","2.14","15.00","0.36","0.36","0.00","6.43","8.57","2.50","1.07","2.14","1.07","0.71","2.14","5.00","0.71","4.29","0.00","1.79","0.00","1.79","0.36","0.00","6.79","1.79","2.50","2.50","1.07","0.00","6.07","3.21","0.36","11.79","1.79","6.07","4.29","1.79","1.79","0.00","0.71","0.36","0.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.57","4.29","5.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.71","5.00","2.86","0.00","0.00","1247","8.1","28.6","376","276","12","65.05","10.3","9.9","10.62","12.5","58","12.625","19.605797101449276","180","26.0","15","0.43","0","7","6","21","2","28","19","0","1","3","51","28","0","8","0","0","20","8","8","0","1","1","16","0","10","19","10","4","2","8","3","0","0","2"

"http://newslo.com/sen-mccain-hospitalized-with-excitement-over-imminent-syria-strike/","Sen. McCain Hospitalized with Excitement over Imminent Syria Strike","PHOENIX – Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) was rushed to a Phoenix emergency room early this evening, according to his spokesman. Doctors say that Sen. McCain became “extremely excited” and collapsed in his kitchen after hearing that the United States will likely launch a military strike against the Syrian government in the coming days, a scenario that would “be like the wettest dream ever” for the aging senator.

Dr. Daniel Sacks of St. Luke’s Medical Center in Phoenix says that Senator McCain—who has been calling for US military intervention in the Syrian civil war for several months—became “overly stimulated” upon learning that President Obama is contemplating a strike against Syrian dictator Bashir al-Assad’s forces in retaliation for his alleged use of chemical weapons on his own citizens. “It seems Senator McCain had been jonesing for another war for some time,” Sacks said. “When heard he might get what he’s been dreaming of, the excitement was just too much for his frail, decrepit body to handle.”

Sen. McCain reportedly became dizzy and quickly collapsed, landing on his kitchen floor.

“It was like those people who win the lottery and get so freakin’ excited their heart explodes,” said one of McCain’s aides who witnessed the episode. “He’s lying there, moments from death, but can’t stop grinning and mumbling something about ‘Damn you Assad.’”

While Senator McCain is currently in stable condition, Sacks warned that the effects of the strike, should it occur, would have unpredictable health consequences for the 76-year old senator.

“Right now, we just have to wait and see,” Sacks said.

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel confirmed Tuesday that the U.S. military is prepared to launch a military strike in Syria, and is awaiting orders from President Obama. White House officials say that the strike will most likely involve sea-launched cruise missiles or long-range bombers, and will target military sites “not directly related to Syria’s alleged chemical-weapons arsenal.” Sources also indicate that the strike will likely last no more than two days. Dr. Sacks hopes that, for Senator McCain’s sake, the strike doesn’t lead to a prolonged conflict.

“If this thing turns into all-out war, Senator McCain’s probably not going to make it,” Sacks warned. “His body just can’t handle that kind of elation anymore.”","2013-08-27 20:51:48","0","33.0","12.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","59.0","31.0","0.0","93.0","1.0","35.0","11","383","80.19","67.14","11.64","14.87","19.15","26.37","75.46","41.25","10.44","3.66","0.00","0.52","0.26","2.61","0.26","6.79","5.74","11.49","6.79","3.39","3.66","1.57","13.05","2.35","1.83","1.31","0.78","1.83","4.96","2.09","2.87","0.00","1.83","0.00","8.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.61","11.23","2.09","2.87","1.31","2.87","1.04","2.61","3.66","0.52","2.35","0.52","2.35","0.78","1.04","0.00","0.52","10.18","0.52","0.52","7.05","1.57","1.31","3.92","7.05","2.09","13.05","2.61","4.96","5.74","2.09","0.78","1.04","0.26","0.00","1.04","0.78","0.52","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.24","6.27","5.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.83","6.01","3.39","0.52","0.00","1871","7.94","30.307692307692307","552","374","20","60.95","12.2","9.4","13.4","12.8","80","6.5","18.036149732620324","232","27.77","5","0.41","0","9","3","29","0","47","26","1","1","10","55","57","1","20","0","0","9","8","25","0","1","1","8","0","17","19","13","11","7","10","1","4","0","1"
"http://newslo.com/tea-party-members-demand-history-remember-brave-white-patriots-who-protested-kings-racist-speech/","Tea Party Members Demand History Remember Brave, White Patriots Who Protested King's Racist Speech","WASHINGTON – As the 50th Anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech from August 28, 1963 approaches, a number of influential Tea Party activists are expressing concern that all the attention is being given to Dr. King, while the “brave patriots” who protested his speech are all but forgotten.

“In yet another example of the vast liberal media conspiracy hiding the truth from the American people, the only thing anyone’s talking about is that speech and all the black people who came to hear it,” said Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin. “Where are the stories of the God-fearing white people who came to protest the violence-inciting words of a known criminal? Come on people, the FBI saw the speech as anti-American, why can’t everyone else?”

Martin was referring to a memo from FBI Agent William Sullivan written two days after King’s speech that read in part, “In the light of King’s powerful demagogic speech… We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro and national security.”

Intended to mark the 100-year anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, King’s speech was delivered to over 250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and was ranked as the top American speech of the 20th century by a 1999 poll of scholars of public addresses. Yet some worry that history is not telling the full story.

“250,000 supporters. That’s all you ever hear about. 250,000 civil rights supporters,” said Amy Kremer, chair of the Tea Party Express. “What about the protestors? You can’t hold a town hall meeting these days without a couple dozen protestors, but you expect us to believe there weren’t some good, Christian folk at the Mall that day waving signs telling the fake doctor to go home?”

Another fear in Tea Party corners is the worry that President Obama is trying to usurp the occasion with his announced intention to deliver a speech called “Let Freedom Ring” from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on the anniversary of Dr. King’s 1963 speech.

“It’s disgraceful!” said Becky Gerritson, founder of the Wetumpka Tea Party in Alabama. “How dare Obama use this historic moment to talk about his socialist issues like freedom and race and jobs.”

“You’d never see a President Bachmann give a racist speech like that,” she added.","2013-08-20 23:04:46","0","50.0","26.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","83.0","31.0","0.0","139.0","1.0","35.0","23","419","95.23","82.40","10.90","43.13","24.65","20.05","80.43","43.44","8.35","3.10","0.24","0.72","0.95","1.19","0.00","5.25","10.74","14.32","5.01","3.58","3.58","1.67","11.46","3.58","2.39","1.67","3.34","2.86","5.73","3.34","2.39","0.95","0.48","0.00","11.93","0.00","0.00","0.24","2.39","8.11","0.95","1.19","0.72","1.43","2.15","2.39","5.25","1.19","4.06","0.00","1.91","0.00","0.24","0.00","1.67","9.07","2.15","1.43","4.06","0.95","0.95","4.53","6.21","0.48","11.93","2.15","4.53","5.25","2.39","2.15","0.24","0.00","0.48","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.57","3.82","5.25","0.00","0.00","0.95","0.24","1.19","5.25","2.86","0.00","0.00","1926","7.92","35.833333333333336","596","411","18","56.79","13.1","11.0","11.55","13.2","82","12.125","19.100535279805353","245","29.33","4","0.43","0","8","13","55","0","54","30","0","0","3","65","63","0","27","2","0","12","3","9","0","1","0","11","0","12","11","12","9","14","6","3","4","0","2"

7. At least we got you to read about Syria.

Bonus: “Oops! Sorry we just couldn’t find anything on this, but you probably shouldn’t have clicked on this in the first place. Go read something that matters, you chauvinistic pig.”

"http://newslo.com/e-cigarette-ban-major-victory-in-war-against-quitting/","E-Cigarette Ban Major Victory In War Against Quitting","NEW YORK – Smokers hope for quitting went up in a puff of vapor as City Council voted 43-8 to extend the strict smoking ban to include E-Cigarettes. Mayor Bloomberg, who pushed the measure, cackled with delight exclaiming, “Good luck quitting now, suckers!” The bill bans E-Cigarettes from being used in restaurants, bars, city parks, and anywhere else where smoking is prohibited. E-Cigarette smokers now no longer have an incentive to use the ridiculous looking devices.

46-year-old smoker, Alex Kelly, shivered despondently outside of a Starbucks, while chain-smoking a pack of Menthols. “This was my last ditch effort to quit,” Kelly said between vicious coughs, “If I can’t get my fix indoors, there’s no point in me looking like douchebag using these stupid looking things.”

The ban comes just weeks after New York became the first major city to increase the age of smoking from 18 to 21. A recent poll shows that New York is no longer the greatest city in the world, currently falling behind Jersey City, but still slightly above Trenton.

Christine Quinn stated that scientist can’t yet say whether E-Cigarettes, which are free of tobacco, but give a dose of vaporized nicotine are truly safe. “How do we know anything really?” Quinn said passionately, and then quietly fell into an existential crisis.

Sources revealed that a similar bill is in the works that will effectively ban all decaffeinated beverages, non-alcoholic beers, and mocktails.","2013-12-20 16:06:59","0","22.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","241","90.58","33.90","71.91","72.39","20.08","25.73","78.42","40.66","6.22","2.07","1.66","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.15","7.47","12.45","4.56","4.56","4.56","2.07","13.28","6.22","3.32","2.07","2.49","0.41","5.81","4.15","1.66","0.00","1.66","0.00","2.90","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.54","1.66","2.49","0.83","2.07","0.83","3.32","3.73","2.07","1.66","0.00","5.81","0.00","1.24","0.41","4.56","7.05","0.41","2.90","1.66","1.24","0.83","3.32","9.13","1.24","18.67","2.49","8.71","7.47","1.66","3.32","0.00","1.24","0.00","0.00","0.41","0.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.58","4.15","8.30","0.00","0.00","0.41","0.41","3.73","3.32","1.24","0.00","0.00","1164","8.75","27.555555555555557","338","237","12","68.3","10.1","8.7","12.71","12.8","62","7.583333333333334","20.38413502109705","182","26.22","8","0.37","0","5","5","21","0","29","19","0","1","3","31","30","0","15","0","0","3","2","21","0","0","0","6","0","12","11","11","4","6","8","2","1","0","1"
"http://newslo.com/israelis-and-palestinians-fund-syrian-rebels-to-keep-john-kerry-away/","Israelis and Palestinians Fund Syrian Rebels to Keep John Kerry Away","JERUSALEM — Longtime enemies Isreael and Palestine have found common ground in recent days in what many hope is the beginning of a lasting peace between the two tradition enemies.“Today, I am pleased to announce that we have embarked in a joint venture with our Israeli counterparts to do all we can to fund the Syrian Rebels,” said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. “Both of our people can rejoice knowing that by working together, we can keep U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry away from our lives, and out of our hair.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed the statements as he stood next to Abbas in a display of anti-Kerry solidarity.“At first I thought I would have to actually make peace to get Kerry to go away,” said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, defending his decision to fund Syrian rebels even though many have links to Islamist terror organizations. “But his obsession with Syria means as long as they keep fighting over there, we will have a reprieve from that snooze-fest here in the Holy Land.”

Both camps acknowledge the ethical ambiguities of stoking a conflict that has now claimed the lives of over 100,000 people, including at least 8,000 children, but urged everyone to remember just how horrid it is dealing with John Kerry.

“I mean this is a man that published a picture of him wind surfing of the coast of Nantucket in order to connect with the average American,” Abbas vented, “can you imagine a more out of touch obnoxious move?”

Netanyahu echoed those sentiments, explaining that John Kerry seems like a guy who is well intentioned but cannot help acting like someone who needs to be punched in the face.

“When John Kerry promised Middle East Peace in nine months, I was sure that it had to be a different John Kerry than the one that lost a presidential election to George W. Bush, one of the least popular presidents of the last fifty years,” explained Netanyahu, “Seriously, does the man think he’ll be able to bore us into peace?”

Both the Israeli Prime Minister and Palestinian President hope to keep the conflict in Syria going as long as possible in order to keep Kerry busy. Both sides have revealed, however, that if the Syrian conflict does eventually get resolved they would work together to solve their differences—or, failing that, hire someone to break Kerry’s kneecaps.","2013-09-18 10:45:57","0","24.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","406","91.55","78.48","44.69","21.97","36.91","23.40","79.56","46.06","10.34","5.42","1.23","2.22","0.25","0.99","0.74","4.93","6.90","16.75","6.90","3.20","4.19","0.25","14.29","4.93","3.69","1.23","2.46","2.71","6.65","3.20","3.45","0.74","1.48","0.49","9.85","0.00","0.25","0.00","1.97","11.82","4.93","0.99","1.48","2.22","0.99","2.96","1.48","0.74","0.49","0.25","0.99","0.49","0.49","0.00","0.00","9.61","3.20","1.97","4.19","0.49","0.49","2.22","11.08","1.48","13.55","0.99","8.13","3.45","2.96","0.25","0.00","0.49","1.23","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","14.29","3.20","5.67","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.00","0.49","3.94","0.49","0.00","0.00","1881","8.29","68.16666666666667","575","400","14","59.37","13.6","12.1","11.32","15.8","82","8.4","21.64","233","55.33","9","0.44","0","7","7","32","0","52","29","0","3","7","37","62","0","21","0","0","19","7","16","1","0","0","19","0","24","15","12","7","12","11","3","3","0","2"
"http://newslo.com/mayor-bloomberg-on-suicide-watch-after-election/","Mayor Bloomberg on Suicide Watch After Election","NEW YORK – Reports are coming from City Hall that Michael Bloomberg has been put on suicide watch due to today’s election, which officially marks the end of his tenure as Mayor of New York City. Bloomberg has been mayor for twelve years, and will once again become a civilian in January when the new mayor Democrat Bill de Blasio – takes the helm.

“He has been in denial months,” said one source close to Bloomberg, “and I don’t think any of us really thought this day would come. After persuading the City Council to remove term limits, allowing him to run a third time, he kind of assumed he would pull something else out of the hat to stay in power, but it just didn’t happen this time.”

Others inside the administration were concerned that the mayor was spiraling into depression about how he would fill his time after leaving office. “He’ll have to just live with his $31 billion, 14 houses around the world, and piloting his helicopter and futuristic AgustaWestland AW609 Tiltrotor hybrid helicopter-plane when it comes out,” said a friend with knowledge of Bloomberg’s situation. We’re all extremely worried for him.” Meanwhile, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly went on record as saying that Bloomberg not being on the ballot was “the worst thing to happen to New York City in living memory,” lamenting that “no one stopped and frisked 32oz sodas like Mike did.”

One source did confirm that both Bloomberg and Ray Kelly voted for the current mayor as a write-in candidate, but they were not optimistic about his chances.","2013-11-05 21:06:40","0","21.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","51.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","263","77.58","63.39","59.44","11.13","29.22","17.87","81.75","47.53","10.65","5.70","0.38","0.76","0.00","4.18","0.38","4.94","5.70","15.21","8.37","4.56","5.32","1.90","17.49","4.56","2.66","1.52","3.42","1.14","2.28","0.38","1.52","0.38","0.00","0.38","7.98","0.00","0.38","0.00","4.56","10.27","2.66","1.52","1.14","1.52","0.76","3.04","1.52","0.38","1.14","0.00","1.14","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.38","5.70","1.14","0.38","2.66","0.76","0.76","5.70","7.98","1.52","21.67","3.80","8.75","9.51","2.66","0.00","0.38","0.38","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.97","3.42","4.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.76","4.18","2.28","0.00","0.38","1217","8.26","45.0","357","264","9","58.66","11.2","12.4","11.15","15.8","53","12.5","21.75030303030303","176","39.33","4","0.46","0","8","6","21","0","37","12","0","1","4","42","36","0","7","0","0","13","5","11","0","0","1","8","0","12","13","10","7","5","7","1","0","0","3"
"http://newslo.com/gop-calls-government-employees-lazy-for-threatening-to-stop-working-if-gop-shuts-down-government/","GOP Calls Government Workers Lazy For Threatening to Stop Working if GOP Shuts Down Government","WASHINGTON – Republicans had harsh words this week for government employees thinking about not coming to work next month if the GOP manages to shut down the government. “Anyone who refuses to do his or her government job just because we’ve managed to shut down the government and bar them from working is a traitor to this great nation,” said House Speaker John Boehner. “I would go so far as to call them lazy, good-for-nothing, douche bags.”

The possibility of a full government shutdown loomed large after the Republican-led House of Representatives passed a bill last week to fund the government only if Obamacare is destroyed. Since this is a non-starter in the Seante and would be vetoed by President Obama in any case, some fear a shutdown is inevitable.

“Oh, we’re having a shut down,” said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, gleefully rubbing his hands together. “You bet your ass we are! And when all those dirty hippy government employees refuse to force their way through the doors we’ve padlocked to keep them fro working, it’ll show everyone how truly un-American they are!”

“If these public, government workers- who let’s face it are all really just lazy indigents sucking on the national teat- can’t find the drive to get up in the morning and go to work at jobs we’ve officially and legally barred them from doing, then America is better off without them,” declared House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

While a full shutdown is not yet a foregone conclusion, Congress is running out of time. Both houses must agree on and pass a bill funding the government by October 1. Without that, multiple agencies including the Defense Department, the Education Department, the FBI, and the Environmental Protection Agency would have to cut back their operations immediately.

Cruz was not worried. “The real men of the Defense Department and the FBI can break into their buildings and get to work no problem, while the sissies in Education and the EPA will stay at home,” he said. “Works for me.”

“All these government employees claim to love their country,” said House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy. “We’re just giving them a chance to prove it. It’s a new world, and people can’t just take their jobs for granted. You have to show a desire to work.”

Republicans feel so strongly about this issue, that some are discussing canceling next week’s planned week-long vacation. But nobody is taking them seriously.","2013-09-23 22:33:36","0","27.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","65.0","1.0","35.0","5","411","76.33","76.73","26.74","12.78","19.57","22.38","87.10","48.66","11.44","7.06","0.49","1.70","0.73","0.97","3.16","4.38","8.03","12.90","7.54","4.14","6.08","2.19","15.33","4.38","0.73","0.97","0.24","2.43","4.87","1.95","2.92","0.49","0.24","0.00","11.19","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.97","10.22","1.22","1.22","2.19","2.68","1.95","3.16","2.68","0.49","1.22","0.97","1.46","0.73","0.24","0.00","0.24","15.82","2.19","3.16","8.27","1.95","0.97","2.92","9.49","0.97","15.57","2.19","8.27","5.35","9.25","0.73","1.70","1.22","0.00","0.00","0.97","0.49","0.00","0.24","0.24","0.00","19.22","4.62","5.11","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.49","1.95","4.38","2.68","0.00","0.00","1918","7.62","24.941176470588236","588","408","21","68.7","11.9","8.5","11.31","11.5","78","12.5","17.40705882352941","254","22.47","6","0.47","0","13","1","48","0","40","21","1","2","8","49","45","3","18","1","0","24","9","22","0","0","6","17","0","34","12","15","6","14","11","0","2","0","2"
"http://newslo.com/facebook-introduces-schmuck-button/","Facebook Introduces 'Schmuck' Button","MENLO PARK, Calif.—Like it or hate it, half-baked, insensitive, crackpot, or otherwise deplorable posts are commonplace on Facebook. While these updates speak volumes about the people who post them, developers at the social network have been trying to put their finger on a way for friends to express their disapproval with a single click.

After experimenting with a “sympathize” button that would go hand in hand with more somber updates for which users selected a negative emotion like “sad” or “depressed,” Facebook engineers began toying with the idea of a “schmuck” button.

Presented at Facebook’s Compassion Research Day, the button was described as a “lighthearted way to tell your friends that they’re complete jackasses without launching never-ending threads of increasingly nasty comments.”

Software engineer Phil Brainard went on to discuss his inspiration for the latest development. “I have this cousin, Charlie. He’s always the life of the party, but when he posted a drunken selfie of him peeing into my Boba Fett collectible mug, I knew I had to find a way to respond that told him I love him, but I’d also love to smack him over the head right now.”

While the icon associated with the “schmuck” button has yet to be finalized, leaked documents indicate that Facebook’s designers have been considering cartoon depictions of either an extended middle finger or phallus.

While the notion of a “schmuck” button received a thumbs-up from fellow Facebookers, its launch on the site remains uncertain.

What the company has made clear is that a “dislike” button is anything but close at hand. Product engineer Bob Baldwin nixed the possibility earlier this year during a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” discussion.

“Actions on Facebook tend to focus on positive social interactions,” said Baldwin. “A ‘dislike’ button is just a dumb idea that doesn’t fit our business model. I only wish there were some way to make the company’s complete lack of interest in this feature evident to everyone out there.”

Mandy Patinker, leader of the “DISLIKE button” community on Facebook—itself backed by nearly 54,000 likes—minced no words in describing the executives who refuse to add the buttons immediately. “They’re complete schmucks.”","2013-12-20 11:47:11","0","26.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","365","91.09","77.02","34.63","21.56","22.81","26.58","80.55","46.85","11.23","5.48","2.19","0.27","0.27","1.92","0.82","5.75","9.04","14.79","5.75","3.29","3.84","1.37","12.88","3.56","2.47","1.37","1.10","1.37","4.93","2.19","2.47","0.27","0.82","0.55","13.42","0.27","1.10","0.00","2.19","10.96","1.64","1.37","0.82","3.01","2.47","2.74","3.01","0.82","0.82","1.37","3.84","2.19","0.27","0.00","0.82","7.40","4.66","0.82","1.37","0.55","0.27","3.56","7.95","0.27","14.79","2.19","7.12","5.48","2.74","3.01","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.82","0.27","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.55","4.66","4.66","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.82","7.95","2.47","0.00","0.00","1792","9.01","28.692307692307693","550","358","17","58.52","12.5","10.3","13.29","13.9","98","8.8","21.38972067039106","243","25.15","10","0.45","0","7","2","40","0","47","31","0","1","1","59","32","1","22","0","0","18","7","14","2","0","1","12","0","13","16","8","9","15","7","3","3","0","1"
"http://newslo.com/former-supporters-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-seek-laws-reinstatement-after-mannings-transgender-announcement/","After Manning Comes Out as Transgender, Politicians Seek to Reinstate ‘Don’t Ask Don’t Tell’","WASHINGTON — Less than three years after President Obama signed the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act into law, some members of Congress who formerly supported the repeal are calling for the military’s original policy to be reinstated after Bradley Manning announced that she is female and wishes to live her life as a woman named Chelsea.

“Given the way that I feel and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible,” Manning said. “I also request that starting today you refer to me by my new name and use the feminine pronoun.”

“Wait. How can—oh I see. Yeah, I’d rather not know about all of that,” admitted Richard Burr, who voted in support of the repeal. (R-NC).

“I supported the bill when I thought there were just gays and lesbians. You know, keep it simple. But this is beyond what I’m capable of understanding,” Burr added.

Manning made the announcement via a statement read by her lawyer a day after being sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking over 700,000 files to WikiLeaks in the largest breach of secret data in the nation’s history.

“I’m not one to say I told you so,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who led a filibuster to stop the repeal, “but hell yes I told you so! I bet you didn’t think about what the ‘T’ in GLBT means, did you?”

Of the five Republican senators remaining in office who voted in favor of the DADT repeal in 2010, four have moved to repeal the repeal and reinstate the original policy that banned openly gay service members, which the military instituted in 1993.

“I didn’t imagine something like this when I supported the repeal. Now that Manning is a woman, I feel threatened, you know, in that way,” said Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski in a speech from the Senate floor.

The one Republican who has not publically reversed his stance on the repeal is Illinois’ Mark Kirk, who told reporters that his daughter “is a huge fan of Lady Gaga.”

“As a matter of fact,” Kirk added, “I found his blonde—I mean her blonde wig— quite convincing.”","2013-08-26 10:12:17","0","27.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","365","79.35","64.95","54.28","51.40","19.21","17.53","81.64","47.40","14.79","9.04","5.21","0.00","1.92","1.92","0.00","5.75","7.95","13.97","5.75","3.84","4.66","1.92","15.89","6.03","3.29","3.29","2.74","1.64","2.47","1.92","0.55","0.27","0.55","0.00","11.78","0.27","0.00","3.01","0.82","11.23","4.93","1.37","0.82","1.37","0.55","2.47","3.01","0.82","1.37","0.82","1.92","0.00","1.10","0.82","0.00","6.30","0.55","0.27","4.38","0.82","0.55","7.12","9.86","0.55","11.78","0.55","5.75","5.48","3.01","0.00","0.00","0.55","0.27","0.00","1.64","0.27","0.55","0.55","0.27","0.00","22.19","4.93","6.30","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.27","0.55","5.75","3.01","1.10","0.00","1569","7.74","24.933333333333334","494","361","18","67.99","10.6","8.8","9.57","10.4","71","15.666666666666666","17.907036011080333","223","21.8","24","0.47","0","7","10","35","0","47","16","0","1","1","52","45","0","10","0","0","27","7","16","0","0","0","9","0","12","24","7","7","20","8","2","8","0","2"

"http://newslo.com/lhota-changes-last-name-to-lhoblasio-renames-his-party-redemocrats/","Lhota Changes Last Name to 'LhoBlasio,' Renames His Party 'Redemocrats’","NEW YORK – After a recent poll put him 50 points behind Democrat Bill De Blasio and showed that only 22 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of him, Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota today announced that he will be changing both his name and the name of his party in order to appeal to New York voters.

Lhota said that, effectively immediately, he will be referred to as Joe LhoBlasio in all campaign literature, and confirmed that he will be changing his name legally before the election. The Republican Party of New York State has also agreed to change its name to the “Redemocrats,” according to LhoBlasio’s wishes.

LhoBlasio spokesman John Gattuso noted that their first campaign ad highlighted LhoBlasio’s support for same-sex marriage, abortion rights and decriminalizing small amounts of marijuana, “which are all Democrat positions, so relabeling the New York branch of the Republican Party as ‘Redemocrats’ just seemed to make sense.” LhoBlasio has also branded congressional Republicans “extremists” over the government shutdown.

The Redemocrat also rolled out a slew of new campaign promises, ranging from raising taxes on those making over $500,000 to opposition to stop and frisk (he previously said that New York could become Detroit after the program was found unconstitutional). LhoBlasio also told journalists that he spent time in Nicaragua in the late 1980s, and denied that he had been budget director and deputy mayor under Rudy Giuliani and Chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority under Michael Bloomberg.

LhoBlasio was quick to point out that he did not blame the liberal media for making these claims, saying “I love the liberal media, and all things liberal, because I’m a liberal Redemocrat in the greatest liberal city in the world. ‘Liberal Joe LhoBlasio’ was my nickname in high school.”

Gattuso denied that the campaign’s strategic changes were simply designed to confuse voters by having names that were so similar to De Blasio and the Democrats, although did acknowledge that they would be handing out glasses at polling stations on polling day which limited peoples’ eyesight.","2013-10-07 10:47:10","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","343","83.78","76.69","12.15","58.87","34.30","28.57","71.43","43.73","10.20","4.96","0.87","0.00","0.00","3.50","0.58","5.25","6.12","13.70","7.29","2.92","5.83","0.29","12.54","5.25","2.62","0.58","1.46","1.75","2.92","2.33","0.58","0.29","0.29","0.00","9.04","0.29","0.00","0.00","3.50","7.58","2.04","2.62","0.87","0.87","1.17","0.58","2.04","0.58","1.17","0.00","1.17","0.29","0.29","0.58","0.00","8.45","1.46","1.17","5.83","0.00","0.29","5.83","3.79","1.17","14.87","1.75","7.29","5.54","2.33","1.17","0.00","1.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.41","2.92","4.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.29","2.92","2.04","0.58","0.29","1746","9.4","43.375","534","342","10","36.76","14.4","16.6","13.88","20.5","88","18.333333333333332","25.972397660818718","206","37.75","4","0.42","0","10","4","27","0","45","22","0","1","5","41","52","3","20","0","0","12","6","14","0","0","3","12","0","14","25","13","6","4","5","3","0","0","0"
"http://newslo.com/nra-lack-of-injuries-in-dekalb-county-school-shooting-proves-guns-arent-dangerous/","NRA: Lack of Injuries in Dekalb County School Shooting Proves Guns Aren’t Dangerous","DECATUR, Ga.—The NRA declared that the lack of injuries in Tuesday’s Atlanta-area school shooting is a victory for gun supporters everywhere.

A suspect was taken into custody moments after police responded to a call reporting shots fired inside Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy, a charter school that houses students from pre-kindergarten to fifth grade a few miles outside of Atlanta.

The alleged gunman brandished an AK-47 and demanded to talk to a local television station before surrendering to police after both sides exchanged fire. “Shooter apprehended; all kids safe and accounted for,” interim Superintendent Michael Thurmond told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution early Tuesday afternoon.

“This harmless shooting is further proof that guns are not as dangerous as the media wants the public to believe,” stated NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, who earlier this year urged the nation’s schools to hire armed guards to keep children safe from violent intruders.

“If firearms are so dangerous, how could one man bring an automatic weapon into a school full of children and not injure or kill a single one of them? Even after shots were fired, nobody was hurt, so how dangerous could an AK-47 be?”

“I bet more kids have been injured by playing dodge ball in the gym,” added LaPierre.

LaPierre went on to express his support for parents whose children attend the school, and urged them to take the opportunity to speak to their children about “the real dangers facing today’s youth.”

“Thank God no children were hurt today. But parents have to ask themselves: who is really to blame for today’s shooting? This would never have happened if it weren’t for the violent video games and music that give guns a bad reputation.”","2013-08-20 20:01:33","0","33.0","10.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","55.0","31.0","0.0","82.0","1.0","35.0","9","289","92.14","68.59","10.57","3.15","22.23","26.30","80.97","41.52","6.23","2.08","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.35","1.38","4.15","8.30","13.84","6.23","3.11","5.19","2.08","12.11","6.92","3.11","1.73","2.08","2.08","7.61","2.42","4.84","0.00","1.73","0.69","10.03","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.69","8.30","1.38","0.69","2.42","1.38","1.38","2.77","2.08","0.35","0.69","1.04","1.38","1.04","1.04","0.00","0.35","10.38","1.04","0.69","4.50","2.08","3.11","4.15","8.65","0.35","11.76","1.04","5.19","5.54","5.88","2.77","0.35","1.04","0.35","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.61","3.81","3.46","0.35","0.35","1.04","0.00","1.73","4.15","1.73","0.00","0.00","1396","8.23","29.4","415","283","13","57.81","11.4","10.6","12.65","13.8","63","8.9","19.624593639575973","193","27.2","9","0.4","0","7","4","29","0","29","18","0","0","3","43","31","0","26","0","0","5","2","12","2","0","0","14","0","15","19","5","10","7","6","2","2","1","2"
"http://newslo.com/nra-victims-of-gun-violence-only-upset-because-they-got-shot/","NRA: 'Victims of Gun Violence Only Upset Because They Got Shot'","WASHINGTON — In the wake of last week’s defeat of a bipartisan, widely popular gun regulation bill, NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre released a statement claiming that the only reason gun control advocates tried to pass tougher gun laws was because either they or someone they love had been a victim of gun violence, or because they had an aversion to seeing innocent people die.

“These people want you to be afraid,” said LaPierre. “Afraid of being killed, afraid of a friend or family member being murdered or maimed, afraid of turning on the TV and seeing that young children have had their lives instantly snuffed out at random. Today, the American people can rest assured that the fear mongers have not won.”

At the Capitol, a minority of senators celebrated their victory over the proposal to curb a phenomenon that is responsible for nearly 32,000 deaths in the US alone each year. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) explained his ‘Nay’ vote, telling reporters: “Though this bill explicitly said that there shall never be a registry of gun owners in this country, and that background checks would only flag those with a history of mental illness or felonious activity—it is clear that the proposal only served the special interests behind it. Specifically, people who themselves have been shot, know a loved one who has been shot, or would rather not one day be shot.”

“Remember, guns don’t kill people,” he added. “They just do what they are specifically and uniquely designed to do”.

Reeling from the vote, the Brady Center for Gun Violence Chairwoman Sarah Brady conceded defeat and confessed that her tireless efforts to reduce gun violence were an assault on liberty. “It’s all true,” said a tearful Brady after reading LaPierre’s statement. “The whole reason why I started my sensible campaign to curb gun violence was because the man I married and raised a family with had part of his brain destroyed by an armed maniac. For that selfish reason alone, I tried to curb every American’s God-given rights to live in a society awash in weaponry that by its very existence increases the likelihood someone you know and love will suffer a violent death or severe injury. I am so ashamed. Thank you, Wayne LaPierre, for showing me the error of my ways.”

A new Quinnipiac University poll shows that while 91% of all Americans support universal background checks on all firearm sales, 100% of responders do not wish to become the next victim of gun violence.

Another study showed that 97% of those polled wished that the next time LaPierre made a public statement, he would literally shoot his mouth off.

"http://newslo.com/number-of-nsa-applicants-doubles-following-porn-disclosure/","Number of NSA Applicants Doubles Following Porn Disclosure","WASHINGTON — The National Security Agency disclosed Friday a 200% surge in employment applications over the previous 48 hours, but refused to comment on whether this renewed interest was connected to the revelation that the spy agency has been monitoring the pornographic viewing history of radicals in an attempt to humiliate and discredit them.

Citing documents provided by former N.S.A. contractor Edward Snowden, the Huffington Post revealed Wednesday the N.S.A.’s plan to harm the reputations of those whom the agency believes are radicalizing others through incendiary speeches and rhetoric. The document proposes that six redacted targets, all Muslim, would be discredited by revelations that they viewed sexually explicit material online. None of the six individuals is accused in the document of being involved in terror plots.

The embattled intelligence agency has faced criticism and scrutiny over its spying methods in the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks. While an N.S.A. spokesperson refused comment on a possible link between this most recent disclosure and increased interest in working for the espionage giant, the application swell should come as a relief to intelligence officials..

“While the agency has seen a dip in applications over the last six months, over the last 48 hours, we’ve more than made up for the lost numbers, and are on pace to exceed our recruitment target for the year,” N.S.A. spokesperson Vanee Vines told reporters. “Unfortunately, from what we’re seeing, a large number of the applicants are already disqualified by virtue of their criminal record,” adding that an equally large number were “already under surveillance by one or more of our sister agencies.”

It remains speculative if the pornography revelations and employment applications are connected, but reporters managed to catch up with one applicant who spoke of his sense of duty.

“I’ve always wanted to serve my country, and I think I have a particular set of skills that the N.S.A. would be very interested,” said one recent N.S.A. applicant whose name was withheld for security reasons, adding that he feels he is “uniquely qualified” to engage in the data collection and surveillance that is the N.S.A.’s purview. “I think the government really needs me out there, monitoring the dirty things the bad men get up to.”

Vines also dismissed accusations of a connection between the pornography exposé and a fall report noting that several N.S.A. employees illegally used the agency’s surveillance powers to snoop on their love interests.

“Those incidents were rogue perverts who overstepped their authority,” insisted Vines. “This was a textbook case of our dedicated agents keeping tabs on somebody’s pornography collection. Two completely unrelated occurrences.”","2013-12-03 11:52:14","0","25.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","449","96.24","71.87","20.41","41.90","21.38","29.18","77.51","44.99","9.35","4.23","1.34","1.11","0.00","0.67","1.11","5.12","11.58","13.59","5.57","1.56","4.01","0.22","10.47","3.56","2.23","1.34","2.23","2.00","4.45","2.67","1.78","0.45","0.45","0.22","8.02","0.22","0.00","0.22","0.89","8.02","3.12","0.67","1.34","1.11","0.89","1.78","2.45","0.89","1.11","0.22","1.78","0.22","0.00","1.34","0.00","8.46","1.56","1.11","4.68","0.67","0.67","5.35","4.90","0.22","11.80","0.89","6.46","4.23","6.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.26","8.91","4.01","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.56","1.56","0.00","0.22","2248","9.25","25.22222222222222","714","432","22","43.12","14.3","12.1","14.27","14.0","127","10.7","21.59925925925926","263","22.39","29","0.46","0","12","10","50","0","59","26","2","0","3","75","40","0","37","0","0","12","9","13","0","1","2","11","0","13","20","13","16","12","11","1","4","1","0"
"http://newslo.com/michigan-abortion-insurance-rates-based-on-hotness/","Michigan: Abortion Insurance Rates Based on Hotness","LANSING, Mich. – The Michigan Legislature recently approved a measure that will require women covered under Affordable Care Act insurance plans to purchase additional coverage for abortions unless their lives are in danger. The additional coverage has been deemed “rape insurance” because the legislation stipulates that rates will be based “solely on a woman’s physical appearance.”

Michigan State Senator Gretchen Whitmer called the law “one of the most misogynistic proposals I’ve ever seen in the Michigan Legislature.”

“Lining the pockets of the insurance companies by forcing women to purchase additional policies is bad enough,” continued Whitmer, “but basing the cost of these policies on unquantifiable characteristics such as the curvature of a woman’s body or the perceived perkiness of her breasts is beyond the pale. We are not numbers; we are humans.”

Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville (R-Monroe), who voted in favor of the legislation, believes that female characteristics are indeed quantifiable.

“More attractive women are more likely to be raped and should thus pay higher insurance premiums,” said Richardville. “On the flip side, of course, rapists have better things to do than to rape homely gals. I think we’d be remiss not to incorporate these facts into the rates, like they do with auto insurance. ”

Richardville went on to admit that neither he nor the legislature possessed actual figures to back up their assertions, but instead went with their “collective gut feelings on rape and such.”

“I’m sure the insurance companies will let the statisticians figure out the number-crunching and come up with a particular atrractiveness quotient for each woman,” continued Richardville. “Weight, height, facial features, breasts—all that good stuff. I can also see the companies progressively reducing a woman’s premium for each month that she isn’t raped. You know, like a reward.”

Currently, only 3.3% of abortions in Michigan are covered by insurance, and Richardville—a long-time opponent of abortion—doesn’t believe the numbers stand to increase any time soon, especially after the legislation’s passage.

“Listen, if you want to call me or members of the legislature (of which approximately 80% are men) misogynistic, then that’s fine,” said Richardville. “But know this. Women can just as easily fight back for more affordable insurance rates. All they need to do is put on a few pounds and leave the makeup at home.”","2013-12-16 12:27:57","0","26.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","386","88.23","65.13","23.07","25.77","19.30","27.20","80.05","45.85","8.29","4.66","1.30","0.78","0.52","0.78","1.30","3.63","8.29","14.25","8.29","3.63","4.66","1.55","13.73","5.96","3.89","0.52","0.78","3.11","4.66","2.33","2.33","0.00","1.81","0.00","9.07","0.00","0.00","3.11","0.52","10.62","2.59","0.78","1.04","1.81","1.81","3.63","2.33","0.78","0.78","0.52","4.40","1.30","1.30","2.85","0.26","5.44","1.04","1.04","2.85","0.78","0.52","2.07","10.36","1.55","10.88","1.55","6.48","3.37","2.85","0.00","0.26","3.63","0.00","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","22.02","5.18","5.44","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.78","6.22","2.59","1.04","0.52","1979","8.59","28.357142857142858","606","382","20","52.09","13.2","10.7","14.39","13.8","97","12.75","19.797068062827226","238","25.29","6","0.45","0","12","4","40","0","48","31","2","0","6","56","31","0","35","1","0","14","4","18","3","1","4","11","0","18","11","4","9","22","9","2","1","0","0"

Al Sharpton Signs A Book Deal Via Cash Money Records!","Just weeks after signing socialite Paris Hilton Newsday LI reports that Rev. Al Sharpton is working on a book to be co-released this October 8th by the publishing arm of Cash Money Records, home to Lil Wayne, with whom Sharpton has feuded over some of the rapper’s lyrics.

Sharpton‘s “The Rejected Stone” will be published by Cash Money Content and Massenburg Media.

The book will cover Sharpton’s “personal evolution” from New York street activist to political candidate and civil rights spokesman.

Sharpton told The Associated Press on Thursday that the book would include his thoughts on Lil Wayne and other rappers and that he was anxious to have a positive dialogue.

He added: “Just because we disagree doesn’t mean we have to be disagreeable.”

Partners In Crime?

Jay Z may have once schooled his fans on the “A’s, B’s and Kilos of Coke” — but the admitted ex D-boy now seems to be looking to create rules over what’s published to the internet.

“We need to write the new rules.” ~Jay Z

During last night’s fifth game of the NBA finals, the “Magna Carta Holy Grail” rapper appeared to have taken a play straight out of the PR bible — using the half-time break to debut as the face of Samsung, while letting his internet plans be known. We’re talking about the same internet the business mogul remains using to cash-in.

“We don’t have any rules, everyone is trying to figure it out. That’s why the internet is like the wild wild west.” ~Jay Z Uh oh looks like a takeover….



Here’s what The Wall Street Journal is reporting:

“The connection: Samsung has purchased 1 million copies of Jay-Z’s coming album, entitled ‘Magna Carta Holy Grail,’ slated for release July 4, and plans to give them to Samsung Galaxy smartphone users for free – 72 hours ahead of the release. The users are to receive the music through an app they’ll receive later this month. (Recipients won’t be able to share it until the official release date.) Samsung paid $5 apiece for the albums, according to a person familiar with the matter. It wasn’t immediately clear if Nielsen SoundScan will count Samsung’s purchases in its sales tallies.”

Was the estranged eldest daughter of Samsung’s chairman, Lee Kun-hee, busted with $500,000 worth of marijuana — about five-years after her younger sister committed suicide? Of course. Just ask Lee Myung-Hee.

"http://viralactions.com/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/","NRA President Jim Porter: “It’s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again”","It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.

“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”

When asked to clarify Porter said,

“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”

Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”

It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.

Robert Williams aka Meek Mill, filed the lawsuit against police officers Andre Boyer and Michael Vargas, in Federal Court in Philadelphia on Monday (January 14).

Court documents state that “on October 31, 2012, at approximately 7:30 p.m., plaintiff was driving a Range Rover SUV when Philadelphia Police Officers Andre Boyer and Michael Vargas, without cause or justification, conducted a motor vehicle stop in the area of 11th Street and Girard Avenue in Philadelphia.”

“Following the vehicle stop, police officers Boyer and Vargas handcuffed plaintiff at the scene, transported him in custody to the 22nd Police District, took photographs of plaintiff which the officers posted and published, or caused to be posted and published, on Instagram and other social media websites, depicting plaintiff in police custody, held plaintiff in custody against his will in a jail cell for approximately nine (9) hours, after which time plaintiff was released on November 1, 2012, at 4:30 a.m., without being charged with any criminal activity and having caused plaintiff to miss a scheduled promotional appearance in Atlanta, Georgia.”

Meek says that the arrest’s timing caused him to refund “his deposit for the private jet that was booked to fly plaintiff in the evening of October 31, 2012 to a promotional appearance in Atlanta,” and cost him “the loss of numerous sponsorships and endorsements.

Meek is also suing for “anxiety and embarrassment associated with plaintiff being placed in a false light; and the anxiety and embarrassment of being seized, detained, confined and imprisoned against plaintiff’s will.”

Meek is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for civil rights violations, false imprisonment, invasion of privacy and civil conspiracy.

In the lawsuit, Meek’s attorney makes it clear that this has been a practice of the Philadelphia Police Department and that the stops have been racial in nature, much like the “stop and frisks” in New York City.

“Prior to October 31, 2012, the defendant City of Philadelphia, through the high command of the Philadelphia Police Department, implemented and enforced a policy and practice of stops, frisks, searches and detentions of persons, including plaintiff, without probable cause or reasonable suspicion as required by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1 section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution”

“The stops, frisks, searches and detentions by Philadelphia Police

Department officers are often based on constitutionally impermissible considerations of race and/or national origin in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The victims of such racial and/or national origin profiling are principally African-American and Latino.”

"http://viralactions.com/here-are-5-arguments-against-for-the-existence-of-god/","Here Are 5 Arguments Against & For The Existence Of God","Religious topics abound on here and they are frequently the most commented upon. It has been some time since the last one so it seems like the time is ripe for another – and this one is a great one for discussion. Here we present five arguments in favor of the existence of God, and the counterargument for it. Feel free to comment on the veracity (or your opinion of) each but remember to keep calm and argue reasonably. After all, it is our ability to be reasonable (rationality) which separates us from the other animals! Note: These all deal with the Judeo-Christian God.

5 Ontological Argument

First formulated by St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, then taken up by Alvin Plantinga. “God exists, provided that it is logically possible for him to exist.”

This argument is quite brazen in its simplicity, requiring not only a belief in God, but a belief in the necessity of God. If you believe he is necessary, then you must believe he exists.

The Counterargument:

Criticism typically deals with the Ontological Argument committing a “bare assertion fallacy,” which means it asserts qualities inherent solely to an unproven statement, without any support for those qualities. It is also criticized as a circular argument, revolving from a premise to a conclusion which relies on the premise, which relies on the conclusion.

4 Moral Argument

This argument is very old, and states that God must exist for the following reason: 1. An aspect of morality is observed. 2. Belief in God is a better explanation for this morality than any alternative. 3. Belief in God is thus preferable to disbelief in God.

The Counterargument:

This argument is technically valid, provided that the three constituents are accepted, and most critics refuse to accept the first. Morality, they argue, is not universal. Murder was perfectly fine for the soldiers of the First Crusade, who slaughtered every man, woman, and child in Jerusalem in 1099. Thomas Hobbes argued that morality is based on the society around it, and is thus not objective.

3 Argument from Degree

This is one of St. Thomas Aquinas’s “Five Proofs of God,” and still causes debate among the two sides. Here is Aquinas’s statement of it, which I have translated from Latin, for a sense of thoroughness:

The fourth proof originates from the degrees discovered in things. For there is discovered greater and lesser degrees of goodness, truth, nobility, and others. But “more” or “less” are terms spoken concerning various things that approach in diverse manners toward something that is the “greatest,” just as in the case of “hotter” approaching nearer the “greatest” heat. There exists, therefore, something “truest,” and “best,” and “noblest,” which, in consequence, is the “greatest” being. For those things which are the greatest truths are the greatest beings, as is stated in Metaphysics Bk. II. 2. Furthermore, that which is the greatest in its way, is, in another way, the cause of all things belonging to it; thus fire, which is the greatest heat, is the cause of all heat, as is said in the same book (cf. Plato and Aristotle). Therefore, there exists something that is the cause of the existence of all things, and of goodness, and of every perfection whatever. We call this “God.”

The Counterargument:

The most prevalent criticism of this argument considers that we do not have to believe in an object of a greater degree in order to believe in an object of a lesser degree. Richard Dawkins, the most famous, or infamous, Atheist around these days, argues that just because we come across a “smelly” object, does not require that we believe that we believe in a “preeminently peerless stinker,” in his words.

2

Argument from Reason

One of my favorites, with very intricate abstraction. C. S. Lewis (who wrote “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe”) came up with this. It begins as an argument from design, and then continues into something new. Very basically, it argues that God must exist, because, in Lewis’s words:

“Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It’s like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can’t trust my own thinking, of course I can’t trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.”

The Counterargument:

It sounds powerful, and the final judgment on it is still out there. But its primary weak point is that, in the strictest sense, it is not a proof of God’s existence because it requires the assumption that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim, and it requires that human minds can be convinced by argumentation.

But in order to reject the assumption that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim, a human mind must assume that this claim is true or false, which immediately proves that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim.

But none of this has anything to do with God’s existence. Thus, the argument is better treated as a disproof of naturalistic materialism. However, given that most Atheists use naturalistic materialism as the foundation of Atheism, is is a very viable argument.

1 Cosmological Argument

Thomas Aquinas’s most famous proof of God refuses to go away. You’ve probably already heard of it in some form. It was around before Aquinas, at least as early as Plato and Aristotle, and in basic terms, it goes like this:

1. Every finite and contingent being has a cause.

2. Nothing finite and contingent can cause itself.

3. A causal chain cannot be of infinite length.

4. Therefore, a First Cause (or something that is not an effect) must exist.

This is especially impressive in that it was theorized by the Ancient Greeks, at a time when the Universe was not known to have had an origin. Today, we call this “the Big Bang,” and the argument has changed to this form:

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.

2. The Universe began to exist.

3. Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

The Counterargument:

Sequentially speaking, these three points are true. But the second point requires the Universe to have had a cause, and we still aren’t sure it did. “The Big Bang” is the most prevalent astrophysical theory today, but it has its detractors, most arguing that because the mathematics that leads back to a big bang do not function at the point immediately prior to the big bang, those mathematics were invalid to begin with.

Better than this, however, is the argument that this proof of God commits the logical fallacy called “infinite regression.” If the Universe had a first cause, what caused that first cause? Criticism declares that it is unfair to argue for every thing’s cause, and then argue for the sole exception of a “First Cause,” which did not have a cause.

"http://viralactions.com/sarah-palin-believes-that-global-warming-will-bring-back-the-dinosaurs/","Sarah Palin Believes That Global Warming Will ‘Bring Back the Dinosaurs’","Sarah Palin said today that concern over global warming is overblown because returning the climate to its state millions of years ago will allow dinosaurs to make a comeback.

In an interview with Fox News, the former Alaska governor admitted that climate change will hurt some plants and animals but argued that it will also provide an opportunity for ancient, warm-weather species to thrive.

“I’ve been hearing all this hootin’ and hollarin’ from the liberals about how CO 2 is going up to levels we haven’t seen in 5 million years,” Palin told Fox and Friends‘ host Gretchen Carlson. “But the truth is, life was pretty good millions of years ago.

“There were plenty of plants and animals back then, and they did just fine in the heat. And as Earth starts to warm up, all our old friends will start coming back. The polar bears might die off, but think of all the dinosaurs we’re gonna get!

“But you don’t hear the liberal, lamestream media talk about that do you? All you hear is doom and gloom, the sky is falling. Personally, I can’t wait to see what a triceratops looks like in real life.”

Page Right Out of History

The overwhelming majority of scientists believe that the Earth’s climate is warming due to emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases created by industrial activity.

If left unchecked, this process could increase temperatures significantly by the end of the century and lead to increased drought, severe weather and mass extinctions across the globe.

According to Palin, however, these negative effects are outweighed by the positive, which apparently includes the dubious idea that restoring a Pliocene climate will bring Cretaceous species back to life.

“Just to be clear,” Carlson interrupted, “you’re saying that if some animals go extinct because it’s too hot, they’ll be replaced by heat-loving animals that went extinct millions of years ago?”

“Well, yes exactly,” Palin responded. “That’s what I call logic, Gretchen. Something the Looney Left in this country doesn’t understand. They’re so Debbie Downer about this whole thing, they can’t see the bright side.”

“I don’t think you can actually bring back the dinosaurs,” interjected co-host Steve Doocy. “Once something is extinct it’s gone forever. Also, dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago, so your dates are a bit off as well. “

“Really?” a surprised Palin inquired. “But they did it in Jurassic Park. Are you telling me that movie wasn’t based on a true story?”

Stunned by Palin’s ignorance of basic scientific concepts, the Fox and Friends team turned the conversation to the ongoing Benghazi scandal.

Palin served as Alaska’s governor from 2006-2009 and was the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008. She is currently an author and Fox News contributor.

After an awkward confrontation with Joe Budden, Cons addressed his problem with Rosenberg’s comments during a recent Pusha T interview that he had been “put off” by some oft the things Cons has been saying recently.

Rosenberg also took issue with Cons doing an interview with Power 105.1 before Hot 97.

Consequence goes on to address friction with Raqi Thunda, Kanye West, Pusha T and his cousin Q-Tip. He apologizes to Kim Kardahsian for involving her in the Kanye beef and says Kanye didn’t buy his teeth.



Joe Budden Confronts Consequence At Hot 97 About Cons Slick Talk Towards Him In Interviews [Video]

Things got extremely awkward recently when Joe Budden crossed paths with Consequence in between their interviews at Hot 97.

The tension between the two “Love & Hip Hop New York” co-stars has been bubbling ever since Cons said some negative things about Joe in interviews with The Breakfast Club and Vlad TV.

While at Hot 97 yesterday Joe confronted Cons to see what all the talk was about. Joe said he wasn’t used to seeing people on a show one day then giving a negative interview about him the next.

Cons placed the blame on Raqi Thunda, saying she had instigated things with disparaging remarks about Joe. Cons also said he was gassed up in the interviews by the hosts which led to him saying slick sh*t about Joe.

Check out the confrontation below. Who backs down in your opinion?

The former wife of a man reported to have treated K Michelle like a common whore is speaking out! According to the woman, the one time Love & Hip Hop cast member accepted $60-bucks and a fast food meal, in return for her oral sex delivery. That’s before we’re told K Michelle was sent on her way, dropped off at a Chicago train station.

The source says the incident went down about seven-years ago, just before K Michelle first landed a ticket into the studio with R Kelly – who our source says was close to the couple.

While it’s now confirmed that Clive is too far gone to be called bi-curious, what we’re curious about is who among his crew were most likely to be covering up for Clive.

Scroll Down for the most likely suspects…

Diddy

Diddy is pretty famous for his freaky ways and it’s long been implied that he’s batted for both teams. Clive’s coming out only sheds more suspicion on the Bad Boy because it’s public knowledge that Diddy borrowed millions from Clive when the label was in trouble and at one point Clive’s Arista label actually owned a 50% stake of Bad Boy. Coincidence? We think not.

Christina Aguilera

Xtina has always been known for letting her freak flag fly freely, and no wonder she’s felt so comfortable, with Clive playing a large role in her career, even to this day.

Andre Harrell

How many execs do you know take such a STRONG interest in their unpaid INTERN that they bring them on as an A&R? Not many. But it’s not just his shady relationship with Diddy that puts Harrell under the microscope. It also doesn’t help that he may be the only man on this list with a private life more private than Clive’s.

His latest stop was to the Sway In the Morning Show.

He talks about the Rick Ross shooting, saying he thought it was just a rumor until his engineer confirmed it.

The Virginia rapper also addresses rumors that have followed Kanye West and Jay-Z for years, that they are somehow part of the Illuminati and devil worshipers. The rumors now include Pusha himself.

“I never asked [Kanye] about the Illuminati, but just in conversation I hear him be like ‘man people saying I’m part of the Illuminati, people are crazy.’ It’s bled over to everybody,” Pusha said. “I was just saying that my mother asked me the other day ‘I heard you part of something called the Illuminessence.’ And I’m like mom what are you talking about? She’s like ‘you part of something called the Illuminessence. The people in church told me you are part of something called the Illuminessence!’ Come to find out she’s talking about the Illuminati. And I’m talking about I was so hot because y’all all in church telling my mom this kind of stuff.”

Push said there isn’t any devil worshiping going on with Kanye either.

"http://viralactions.com/dayummmm-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-faces-1-billion-dollar-tax-bill/","DAYUMMMM! Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Faces $1 Billion Dollar Tax Bill","Facebook’s stock market debut left founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg with a paper fortune currently valued at $13 billion — and a 2012 tax bill of around $1.1 billion.

Zuckerberg’s whopping tax hit stems from his move last May to increase his stake in Facebook. On the day of Facebook’s initial public offering, Zuckerberg exercised a stock option and purchased 60 million Facebook shares at a “strike price” of 6 cents each.

Even if those shares are never sold, the IRS treats them as ordinary income at the time the options are exercised. The rationale is that such options are a form of compensation, just like regular wages.

For Zuckerberg, that means reporting income last year of nearly $2.3 billion from his stock options alone. Add together the top 2012 federal tax rate of 35% and the top California rate of 13.3% — the highest in the nation — and you get a total tax rate of 48.3%.

That’s before factoring in some deductions and any other income Zuckerberg collected last year. Only Uncle Sam and California’s tax agency know exactly what’s in Zuckerberg’s return, but three California CPAs that CNNMoney consulted ran the numbers and believe Zuckerberg’s bill for the year will probably exceed $1 billion.

That’s really unusual … even for billionaires.

“With numbers that large, it’s usually capital gains, not ordinary income,” said Toby Johnston, a partner at tax firm Moss Adams LLP‘s Silicon Valley office who works with wealthy clients. Investors profiting off their gains paid a significantly lower tax rate last year than Facebook’s founder will. The highest federal capital gains rate in 2012 was 15%. It goes up to 23.8% (including a Medicare surtax) this year.

The Internal Revenue Service doesn’t comment on the returns of individual taxpayers, but each year it releases aggregate data on the 400 U.S. tax filers with the largest reported incomes. Theaverage top earner had income of $202 million and a federal income tax bill of $41 million for 2009, the most recent data available.

A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on Zuckerberg’s taxes.

To cover the giant bill he knew was coming, Zuckerberg dipped into his trove of Facebook stock. He sold 30.2 million shares during Facebook’s IPO, taking in $1.135 billion. At the time, Facebook said in a regulatory filing that Zuckerberg planned to use the “substantial majority” of those proceeds to cover the taxes on his stock-option purchase.

And Zuckerberg has another big tax hit looming: He is still sitting on 60 million unexercised options that expire in late 2015. At Facebook’s (FB) current share price, those options would generate taxable income of $1.6 billion if he cashed them in. If he cashed then in today at current tax rates, that would amount to a $826 million bill.

The U.S. Treasury will benefit from Zuckerberg’s taxes. So will California, which is getting awindfall as thousands of Facebook employees cash in on stock grants and options. California expects to collect roughly $1.5 billion in tax revenue tied to Facebook’s IPO, according to the latest estimate from the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office.

So how do you pay a tax bill that’s bigger than some nations’ entire annual GDP? (We’re looking at you, Grenada.)

California requires an electronic payment for all tax bills larger than $80,000, but the IRS will take a paper check for any amount.

Watching a sum that big vanish from your bank account sounds scary, right? The flip side is that at least you can afford it.

“Most people are thrilled, to tell you the truth,” said Stan Pollock, a San Francisco area accountant who specializes in handling tax issues for tech workers. “I have had very few clients that get these huge windfalls who have resented paying the tax. They know they got lucky.”","2013-03-29 00:00:00","0","41.0","34.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","67.0","38.0","0.0","164.0","7.0","22.0","6","629","93.57","74.80","16.94","49.44","18.50","25.44","77.90","38.47","8.27","3.66","0.16","0.16","0.95","1.59","0.79","4.61","7.31","13.35","4.93","2.54","3.66","0.48","10.33","4.93","3.34","0.95","6.84","2.86","2.54","1.91","0.64","0.16","0.16","0.32","8.11","0.16","0.16","0.00","1.75","8.27","1.27","0.79","1.11","3.50","0.95","1.91","1.11","0.32","0.79","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","8.11","2.23","1.75","3.18","2.07","0.00","2.38","6.52","1.59","14.63","0.79","8.90","4.93","9.54","1.27","0.00","10.17","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.24","5.88","3.97","0.16","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.16","1.75","3.50","0.95","2.54","2992","7.76","19.441176470588236","916","630","41","64.3","10.3","8.1","11.19","9.9","134","8.6","16.66793650793651","344","18.09","14","0.39","0","14","50","59","0","77","52","3","6","8","111","70","0","40","0","0","20","7","22","0","1","1","11","0","15","23","15","9","17","16","9","4","0","1"

When Meek Mill dropped his Cassidy diss “Repo,” he mentions former Larsiny Family member AR-AB. Meek claimed in the song that Cass never let AR eat, even after he caught a body for him.

In a new video blog, AR backs up Meek’s claims.

While maintaining that he is still cool with Cass, AR says that The Hustla has been lying about his 2005 murder case. AR claims he actually killed Desmond Hawkins, while Cass ran into his house and locked him outside.

“Claim your rape, don’t claim my homicide,” AR says.

When AR returned home from prison he claims Cass only gave him $200 and made him sleep on his couch. AR says he starved the entire time he was with Larsiny Family.



AR further claims that Cass was scared to fight Jim Jones and Gillie Da Kid when they stepped to him.

Cassidy responded to AR via Twitter this morning.

Plans To Fight Louisiana Charges","Lil Flip is vowing to fight recent drug and gun charges. As we previously reported, the 31-year old Houston rapper was pulled over in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana on December 25, for speeding.

During a search of his 2010 Dodge Challenger, deputies reportedly found weed and a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle. Flip was arrested and booked on charges of third-offense possession of marijuana, possession of a firearm in the presence of a controlled dangerous substance, and speeding

During a new interview with TMZ, Flip said he has a license to carry the weapon, which he claims is not automatic firing and there was no weed in the car. He said police found “Black and Mild” wine flavored cigars and clove cigarettes

Flip, real name Wesley Eric Weston, says he is “not one of those rappers who would carry drugs on me. I know better.”

The rapper also presented TMZ wirh a copy of his concealed handgun license, which he says is also valid in 22 other states, including Louisiana. He said he has been shot before and as an entertainer needs a gun for protection.

“I know they don’t mess around in Louisiana and I wouldn’t do anything to make me go to the big house. Especially on Christmas night,” he told TMZ.

Flip plans on pleading not guilty to all charges.","2013-01-02 00:00:00","0","13.0","17.0","3.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","34.0","28.0","0.0","86.0","5.0","0.0","1","224","85.31","63.97","14.80","6.15","20.36","20.09","74.11","45.54","10.27","7.59","2.23","0.45","0.00","4.46","0.45","2.68","6.70","14.73","6.25","2.23","5.80","2.68","13.39","4.46","2.23","1.34","3.12","0.45","4.46","1.34","3.12","0.45","1.79","0.00","9.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.46","7.14","1.79","0.89","1.34","0.45","0.89","1.79","3.57","0.89","2.23","0.00","2.23","0.00","1.79","0.00","1.34","5.80","0.45","1.34","3.12","0.45","0.89","4.91","7.59","0.45","14.73","2.23","6.70","5.80","3.12","1.79","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.62","4.91","5.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.34","2.68","0.89","0.00","0.00","998","7.78","22.6","309","221","11","67.99","11.6","8.8","10.15","10.9","44","12.75","18.00380090497738","144","20.5","7","0.43","0","9","6","18","0","25","16","0","0","1","33","27","0","9","0","0","15","2","9","0","0","1","5","0","6","12","4","7","6","11","2","1","0","0"

Before Brown punched him, Ocean admitted to excusing Brown of taking his parking spot and not being willing to shake his hand to reconcile.

After taking a blow to the face, the “Novacane” singer told police he found himself in a corner with Brown‘s homies attempting to kick him.

Frank is unsure who made the f*ggot comment, but he did report that Chris threaten to shoot him by saying, “We can bust on you too!”

Overall, Ocean remembers the fight lasting two to three minutes. He endured minor injuries.

On Frank‘s blog he said he has no plans to press charges, however, he did tell the police he wants to see Breezy in jail. Hmmm.

Frank Ocean is expected to move forward with pressing assault charges against Chris Brown — after the recent brawl between the pair(Click Here) broke out at Westlake Recording Studios, Sunday. While Breezy continues to maintain a story of being ambushed, Frank Ocean says Chris threw the first punch.

Now, LAPD is reported to be looking to question Breezy over the incident.

Sources say the tension may have all been sparked over…get this, a parking spot! After the incident, Frank Ocean – who, unlike Chris – remained on scene to speak with responding cops – took to Twitter to talk about the fight.

Here’s what Frank Ocean had to say, wishing his Bernese Mountain Dog “Everest” were there to protect him:

“got jumped by chris and a couple guys. lol. i only wish everest was there.”

Here’s what’s being reported:

“Last night, tensions between Frank Ocean and Chris Brown mounted after the two engaged in a skirmish at a studio in Los Angeles, California. According to NY Post, the Odd Future crooner is looking to press charges against Brown for “punching him and starting an all-out brawl” outside of Westlake Studios. Police claim that Ocean is “desirous of prosecution” and that they’re looking to question Brown, who is on probation until August 2014, stemming from his beating Rihanna in 2009.

Was Frank Ocean advised by higher-ups in the entertainment industry to press charges? Of course. Don’t believe me..

"http://viralactions.com/wesley-snipes-released-from-prison/","Wesley Snipes Released From Prison!","Wesley Snipes Out Of Prison!

Actor Wesley Snipes has reportedly been released from prison since April 2nd…..just in time for tax season!

He will be on house arrest until April 19th.

Story Below:

Wesley Snipes is a free man… mostly. TMZ is reporting that the 50-year-old film actor has been released from prison. According to the popular site, Snipes was released on April 2 and transferred to the New York Community Corrections Office. He will be on house arrest thereafter until July 19.

If my math is correct, that means that Snipes served 845 days (remember 2012 was a leap year) of his three-year sentence. He was originally slated to be released on July 19, 2013, which means he served nearly 90% of his sentence (I’m going to assume some credit for time served and good behavior).

The Wesley Snipes saga began in 2006 when he was accused of tax fraud. He was originally indicted on charges of attempting to claim nearly $12 million in fraudulent tax refunds and not filing any tax returns for several years. Snipes’ first attorney, Billy Martin, said in a statement at the time, “We believe the evidence in the case will show he has been the victim of unscrupulous tax advice. And this trial will help vindicate him.”

The matter did go to trial in 2008. Despite a lengthy list of potential witnesses, and claims that the defense to the trial could take up to a month, the Snipes defense team rested – after less than an hour – without offering any witnesses. The defense felt pretty confident that the government had not proved its burden, saying: “We could have put on a big show, but we don’t do that. We’re not going to waste the jury’s time.” In contrast, the week before, IRS agent Steward Stich testified that Snipes earned almost $40 million in the years 1999 through 2004 and failed to file tax returns or pay any taxes on that income. He also alleged that Snipes also tried to have almost $12 million in taxes paid in prior years 1996 and 1997 refunded to him.

Snipes pleaded not guilty on all counts. He was eventually acquitted of felony federal tax fraud and conspiracy charges. Snipes was, however, convicted of failing to file tax returns from 1999 to 2004, which were misdemeanor charges. He faced up to three years in prison for the failure to file and he received the maximum sentence.

Snipes’ co-defendants and financial/tax “advisors”, Eddie Ray Kahn and Douglas P. Rosile, were convicted by the same jury of tax fraud and conspiracy. Kahn, a former CPA who is no longer allowed to practice in Florida and Ohio, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and Rosile was sentenced to four and half years in prison.

After his conviction, Snipes immediately promised an appeal, which he delivered (more than once) claiming, among other pleadings and filings that his sentence was unreasonable, that his defense was lacking and that he was not able to get a fair trial in “racist” Ocala, Florida, which Snipes had previously referred to as a “hotbed of KKK activity.” He was originally slated to report to prison on June 3, 2008, but that was delayed, pending the outcome of the appeal. His request for a new trial was denied on November 19, 2010, and he subsequently reported to prison on December 9, 2010, at McKean Federal Correctional Institution, in northwest Pennsylvania.

That wasn’t the last of Snipes’ arguments, however. While serving time, Snipes appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 6, 2011, Snipes’ petition for certiorari was denied, which means that the Supreme Court declined to hear the matter. With that, the appeals officially came to an end. Snipes remained in custody until this week.

It’s worth noting that, at the time of the initial allegations, Snipes was filming a movie, “Gallowwalkers” in Namibia. The film, summarized as “[a] cursed gunman (Snipes) whose victims come back from the dead recruits a young warrior to help in the fight against a gang of zombies” was released in the U.K. in 2012 and is scheduled to be released in the U.S. in 2013. No actual release date has been noted (IMDB just says “2013″) and the website for the film remains a blank screen. Likewise, the link to the trailer now says “this video does not exist.” A movie poster was released just last month (you can see it here). Speculation had been building that the release of the film might just coincide with Snipes’ release. I guess now we’ll see.

"http://viralactions.com/sad-statistics-more-u-s-troops-committed-suicide-in-2012-than-were-killed-in-the-afghanistan-war-video/","Sad Statistics: More U.S. Troops Committed Suicide In 2012 Than Were Killed In The Afghanistan War [Video]","U.S. soldiers are committing suicide at an alarming rate. NBC News reports that through November 2012, 177 active-duty soldiers had committed suicide. In all of 2012, 176 soldiers were killed in action while serving in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

Russia Today reports the suicide rate is much higher when you take into account soldiers who have returned home from combat. According to their report, nearly 500 American troops and veterans took their own lives last year.

Many soldiers feel they will be looked at as being weak or denied promotion if they seek mental health aid. Families of some suicide victims blame the military for not doing enough to help troops deal with the stress of combat.

“The Pentagon hasn’t spent the money that it has for suicide prevention for this year — and that money wasn’t nearly enough money to reach all the soldiers who need help. Now we are hearing about bureaucratic technicalities at the Pentagon that are preventing them from acting. This is unconscionable,” Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Washington, told NBC. “The Pentagon is funded to help soldiers and needs to do much more on the epidemic of suicides.”

The Department of Defense says that they are working on this growing epidemic and that “anti-suicide programs installed throughout the armed services soon will curb military suicides — and that such initiatives already have helped douse mental-health stigmas.”

“We have seen several programs that we are optimistic are going to start making a dent in this issue,” said Jackie Garrick, acting director of the DOD suicide prevention office. “We’ve asked all of the services to use the same messaging, the same talking points. So the Army, included in that, is trying to adapt and promote those same messages because we realize that this is an across-the-board problem.”

Tim Kenney of the Army National Guard says that he battled suicidal thoughts when he returned home from the war, but was able to overcome them. He thinks many servicemen have a hard time adjusting back into civilian life.

“What these guys end up doing is I think is they feel ‘I can’t cope anymore with civilian life.’ A lot of guys end up killing themselves because they don’t think they will ever fit back into normal society,” Kenney told Russia Today.

If he did, what would have been a routine car accident with no injuries would now be considered a hit-and-run.

Brown and girlfriend Karrueche Tran were riding in Los Angeles on Tuesday May 21st, when Brown rear ended another vehicle. According to TMZ, the singer gave the other driver false insurance information and refused to give her his driver’s license number.



Chris is on probation for assaulting Rihanna in 2009. If the police find that he broke the law by leaving the scene of an accident without fully disclosing all of the information required by law, his probation could be violated. As a result Chris could be sentenced to up to four years in prison.

Did Chris Brown do the dastardly deed!?

The word on the street is that Christ Brown proposed to Rihanna on New Years. I really don’t know that he did for sure, but it was trending on twitter. Seems that there was a report debunking this rumor, but some said something happened! The pair were apparently all snuggled up in Africa, shining like a pair of blood diamonds. SMH! Anyway, the official world right now is that they are just friends, but I don’t believe that BS and sources maintain that something significant happened as the new year rang in.

Chris’ Ex And Teyanna Taylor Were Seen Kissing!

On the flip side, Chris’ ex and his rumored jump off were reportedly out there kissing and making out on new years! YEP! Teyanna Taylor and…freaking Karrueche. Had to google Karrueche’s name just to know how to spell it. Anyway, there are a couple instagram pics floating. Here are some.

Keef, real name, Keith Cozart, was accused of moving to Northbrook, Illinois without telling authorities. He was also accused of not checking in with his probation officer since the December 18 release of his debut album, Finally Rich. Prosecutors sought to have the 17-year old locked up pending a full hearing later this month.

Keef’s attorney argued that he had been spending time at the Northbrook home of his manager recording music at the studio there.

After hearing testimony from Keef’s probation officer, Juvenile Court Judge Carl Anthony Walker ruled that there was no “credible evidence” that the rapper had moved to Northbrook according to the Chicago Tribune.

Keef is on on probation after a juvenile conviction for pointing a gun at a police office. He still faces a hearing on on January 28, 2013 for another alleged probation violation for holding a gun during a 2012 interview with Pitchfork at a gun range in New York.

Pitchfork has since taken the video down, but have been ordered by a judge to turn over the footage, as it will be used to determine if Keef should be sent back to juvenile detention for firing weapons.","2013-01-04 00:00:00","0","32.0","26.0","3.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","61.0","38.0","0.0","165.0","7.0","22.0","6","209","97.95","63.11","29.12","5.42","23.22","27.75","72.73","45.93","5.74","2.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.87","0.00","2.87","8.61","19.14","7.66","2.87","1.91","1.44","11.96","3.35","1.91","0.00","2.39","0.48","2.87","0.48","2.39","0.48","1.91","0.00","6.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.87","5.26","1.44","1.44","0.96","0.48","0.00","1.91","2.87","0.96","1.91","0.00","0.48","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.09","0.00","0.48","8.13","0.48","0.48","5.74","4.31","0.48","18.18","1.91","8.61","8.13","2.87","1.44","0.96","0.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.00","4.31","4.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.96","0.96","0.00","0.00","993","8.27","23.444444444444443","315","208","9","56.49","13.4","11.1","11.61","13.3","46","7.25","20.08615384615385","136","21.22","0","0.43","0","1","5","21","0","34","6","0","0","2","42","31","0","2","0","0","4","3","5","1","0","3","7","0","5","10","11","11","1","5","0","0","0","0"

“Media manipulation currently shapes everything you read, hear and watch online. Everything.”

– Forbes magazine article on mass media influence, 7/16/2012

The influence of the mass media on public perception is widely acknowledged, yet few know the incredible degree to which this occurs. Key excerpts from the rare, revealing mass media news articles below show how blatantly the media sometimes distort critical facts, omit vital stories, and work hand in hand with the military-industrial complex to keep their secrets safe and promote greedy and manipulative corporate agendas.

Once acclaimed as the watchdog of democracy and the political process, these riveting articles clearly show that the major media can no longer be trusted to side with the people over business and military interests. For ideas on how you can further educate yourself and what you can do to change all this, see the “What you can do” section below the article summaries. Together, we can make a difference.

U.S. Suppressed Footage of Hiroshima for Decades

2005-08-03, New York Times/Reuters

http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/news/news-media-anniversary.html

In the weeks following the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, U.S. authorities seized and suppressed film shot in the bombed cities by U.S. military crews and Japanese newsreel teams to prevent Americans from seeing the full extent of devastation wrought by the new weapons. It remained hidden until the early 1980s and has never been fully aired. “Although there are clearly huge differences with Iraq, there are also some similarities,” said Mitchell, co-author of “Hiroshima in America” and editor of Editor & Publisher. “The chief similarity is that Americans are still being kept at a distance from images of death, whether of their own soldiers or Iraqi civilians.” The Los Angeles Times released a survey of six months of media coverage of the Iraq war in six prominent U.S. newspapers and two news magazines — a period during which 559 coalition forces, the vast majority American, were killed. It found they had run almost no photographs of Americans killed in action. “So much of the media is owned by big corporations and they would much rather focus on making money than setting themselves up for criticism from the White House and Congress,” said Ralph Begleiter, a former CNN correspondent. In 1945, U.S. policymakers wanted to be able to continue to develop and test atomic and eventually nuclear weapons without an outcry of public opinion. “They succeeded but the subject is still a raw nerve.”

That dude is getting a lot of mainstream attention thanks to the attempt on his life! But the cops are taking it very serious and they don’t think its staged like 50 Cent suggested. The popo are looking directly at the GD’s and they are looking specifically at the GD’s in Chicago! They are basically suggesting that this is coming from the man Larry Hoover! If that should be the case, s**t would be MAJOR THICK suddenly!

See, what happened – supposedly – is Rick Ross used some of the symbols and and logos of the GDs and didn’t pay the required “fees.” When Ross was in Fort Lauderdale, they opened fire with the AK-47!!!!

There’s another theory of a boss out there that wants Rick Ross’ head on a platter but I’m gonna leave that along.

Mayor ‘Redskins’ Is RACIST … It’s Time for a Change!","It’s damn time the Washington Redskins changed its racist name … at least if the team ever plans to move inside D.C. city limits — so says District mayor Vincent Gray.

Now that the Redskins are winning again, there’s been a lot of talk about bringing the team back to D.C. — instead of leaving them in nearby FedEx Field, located in Maryland.

But Mayor Gray has some conditions before the Redskins move a muscle — claiming, “I think that if they get serious with the team coming back to Washington, there’s no doubt there’s going to have to be a discussion about [changing the team name].”

Gray added, “I think it has become a lightning rod, and I would love to be able to sit down with the team … and see if a change should be made. There’s a precedent for this, and I think there needs to be a dispassionate discussion about this, and do the right thing.”

Joe Budden Confronts Consequence At Hot 97 About Cons Slick Talk Towards Him In Interviews [Video]

Things got extremely awkward recently when Joe Budden crossed paths with Consequence in between their interviews at Hot 97.

The tension between the two “Love & Hip Hop New York” co-stars has been bubbling ever since Cons said some negative things about Joe in interviews with The Breakfast Club and Vlad TV.

While at Hot 97 yesterday Joe confronted Cons to see what all the talk was about. Joe said he wasn’t used to seeing people on a show one day then giving a negative interview about him the next.

Cons placed the blame on Raqi Thunda, saying she had instigated things with disparaging remarks about Joe. Cons also said he was gassed up in the interviews by the hosts which led to him saying slick sh*t about Joe.

"http://20minutenews.com/meek-miilz-is-suing-the-philadelphia-police-department/","Meek Millz Is Suing The Philadelphia Police Department – 20minutenews","Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill is suing the Philadelphia Police Department, after being jailed for nine hours without cause, stemming from an October 31 traffic stop.

Robert Williams aka Meek Mill, filed the lawsuit against police officers Andre Boyer and Michael Vargas, in Federal Court in Philadelphia on Monday (January 14).

Court documents state that “on October 31, 2012, at approximately 7:30 p.m., plaintiff was driving a Range Rover SUV when Philadelphia Police Officers Andre Boyer and Michael Vargas, without cause or justification, conducted a motor vehicle stop in the area of 11th Street and Girard Avenue in Philadelphia.”

“Following the vehicle stop, police officers Boyer and Vargas handcuffed plaintiff at the scene, transported him in custody to the 22nd Police District, took photographs of plaintiff which the officers posted and published, or caused to be posted and published, on Instagram and other social media websites, depicting plaintiff in police custody, held plaintiff in custody against his will in a jail cell for approximately nine (9) hours, after which time plaintiff was released on November 1, 2012, at 4:30 a.m., without being charged with any criminal activity and having caused plaintiff to miss a scheduled promotional appearance in Atlanta, Georgia.”

Meek says that the arrest’s timing caused him to refund “his deposit for the private jet that was booked to fly plaintiff in the evening of October 31, 2012 to a promotional appearance in Atlanta,” and cost him “the loss of numerous sponsorships and endorsements.

Meek is also suing for “anxiety and embarrassment associated with plaintiff being placed in a false light; and the anxiety and embarrassment of being seized, detained, confined and imprisoned against plaintiff’s will.”

Meek is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for civil rights violations, false imprisonment, invasion of privacy and civil conspiracy.

In the lawsuit, Meek’s attorney makes it clear that this has been a practice of the Philadelphia Police Department and that the stops have been racial in nature, much like the “stop and frisks” in New York City.

“Prior to October 31, 2012, the defendant City of Philadelphia, through the high command of the Philadelphia Police Department, implemented and enforced a policy and practice of stops, frisks, searches and detentions of persons, including plaintiff, without probable cause or reasonable suspicion as required by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1 section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution”

“The stops, frisks, searches and detentions by Philadelphia Police

Department officers are often based on constitutionally impermissible considerations of race and/or national origin in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The victims of such racial and/or national origin profiling are principally African-American and Latino.”

"http://20minutenews.com/here-are-5-arguments-against-for-the-existence-of-god/","Here Are 5 Arguments Against & For The Existence Of God – 20minutenews","Religious topics abound on here and they are frequently the most commented upon. It has been some time since the last one so it seems like the time is ripe for another – and this one is a great one for discussion. Here we present five arguments in favor of the existence of God, and the counterargument for it. Feel free to comment on the veracity (or your opinion of) each but remember to keep calm and argue reasonably. After all, it is our ability to be reasonable (rationality) which separates us from the other animals! Note: These all deal with the Judeo-Christian God.

5 Ontological Argument

First formulated by St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, then taken up by Alvin Plantinga. “God exists, provided that it is logically possible for him to exist.”

This argument is quite brazen in its simplicity, requiring not only a belief in God, but a belief in the necessity of God. If you believe he is necessary, then you must believe he exists.

The Counterargument:

Criticism typically deals with the Ontological Argument committing a “bare assertion fallacy,” which means it asserts qualities inherent solely to an unproven statement, without any support for those qualities. It is also criticized as a circular argument, revolving from a premise to a conclusion which relies on the premise, which relies on the conclusion.

4 Moral Argument

This argument is very old, and states that God must exist for the following reason: 1. An aspect of morality is observed. 2. Belief in God is a better explanation for this morality than any alternative. 3. Belief in God is thus preferable to disbelief in God.

The Counterargument:

This argument is technically valid, provided that the three constituents are accepted, and most critics refuse to accept the first. Morality, they argue, is not universal. Murder was perfectly fine for the soldiers of the First Crusade, who slaughtered every man, woman, and child in Jerusalem in 1099. Thomas Hobbes argued that morality is based on the society around it, and is thus not objective.

3 Argument from Degree

This is one of St. Thomas Aquinas’s “Five Proofs of God,” and still causes debate among the two sides. Here is Aquinas’s statement of it, which I have translated from Latin, for a sense of thoroughness:

The fourth proof originates from the degrees discovered in things. For there is discovered greater and lesser degrees of goodness, truth, nobility, and others. But “more” or “less” are terms spoken concerning various things that approach in diverse manners toward something that is the “greatest,” just as in the case of “hotter” approaching nearer the “greatest” heat. There exists, therefore, something “truest,” and “best,” and “noblest,” which, in consequence, is the “greatest” being. For those things which are the greatest truths are the greatest beings, as is stated in Metaphysics Bk. II. 2. Furthermore, that which is the greatest in its way, is, in another way, the cause of all things belonging to it; thus fire, which is the greatest heat, is the cause of all heat, as is said in the same book (cf. Plato and Aristotle). Therefore, there exists something that is the cause of the existence of all things, and of goodness, and of every perfection whatever. We call this “God.”

The Counterargument:

The most prevalent criticism of this argument considers that we do not have to believe in an object of a greater degree in order to believe in an object of a lesser degree. Richard Dawkins, the most famous, or infamous, Atheist around these days, argues that just because we come across a “smelly” object, does not require that we believe that we believe in a “preeminently peerless stinker,” in his words.

2

Argument from Reason

One of my favorites, with very intricate abstraction. C. S. Lewis (who wrote “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe”) came up with this. It begins as an argument from design, and then continues into something new. Very basically, it argues that God must exist, because, in Lewis’s words:

“Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It’s like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can’t trust my own thinking, of course I can’t trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.”

The Counterargument:

It sounds powerful, and the final judgment on it is still out there. But its primary weak point is that, in the strictest sense, it is not a proof of God’s existence because it requires the assumption that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim, and it requires that human minds can be convinced by argumentation.

But in order to reject the assumption that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim, a human mind must assume that this claim is true or false, which immediately proves that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim.

But none of this has anything to do with God’s existence. Thus, the argument is better treated as a disproof of naturalistic materialism. However, given that most Atheists use naturalistic materialism as the foundation of Atheism, is is a very viable argument.

1 Cosmological Argument

Thomas Aquinas’s most famous proof of God refuses to go away. You’ve probably already heard of it in some form. It was around before Aquinas, at least as early as Plato and Aristotle, and in basic terms, it goes like this:

1. Every finite and contingent being has a cause.

2. Nothing finite and contingent can cause itself.

3. A causal chain cannot be of infinite length.

4. Therefore, a First Cause (or something that is not an effect) must exist.

This is especially impressive in that it was theorized by the Ancient Greeks, at a time when the Universe was not known to have had an origin. Today, we call this “the Big Bang,” and the argument has changed to this form:

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.

2. The Universe began to exist.

3. Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

The Counterargument:

Sequentially speaking, these three points are true. But the second point requires the Universe to have had a cause, and we still aren’t sure it did. “The Big Bang” is the most prevalent astrophysical theory today, but it has its detractors, most arguing that because the mathematics that leads back to a big bang do not function at the point immediately prior to the big bang, those mathematics were invalid to begin with.

Better than this, however, is the argument that this proof of God commits the logical fallacy called “infinite regression.” If the Universe had a first cause, what caused that first cause? Criticism declares that it is unfair to argue for every thing’s cause, and then argue for the sole exception of a “First Cause,” which did not have a cause.

After Lil Wayne’s back-handed jab at her and her man, Chris Bosh, she just served him a big plate of kindness.

READ STORY HERE: Lil Wayne Says “I F**ked Chris Bosh’s Wife [VIDEO]

The wife of the NBA baller took the high road via twitter today after the Young Money CEO said he “f*cked Chris Bosh wife.”

She started it off with a series of retweets which read:

“Truth prevails. Today stand in your truth and ignore the chatter around and about you. #myhighestself #TodayICan #chakrawisdom. Some people create hate for profit, and some people create love for free. Pay no mind to the haters, embrace the love. #TodayICan ignore those who live in hate for their own ego, and keep my eyes on pure love. They will never bring me down.

Mrs. Bosh then continued to kill him with kindness by telling Wayne ‘what goes around comes around.’ She even tweeted a picture to let Weezy know karma is real.

What do you think about the way Adrienne Bosh handled today’s rumors?

Keef, real name, Keith Cozart, was accused of moving to Northbrook, Illinois without telling authorities. He was also accused of not checking in with his probation officer since the December 18 release of his debut album, Finally Rich. Prosecutors sought to have the 17-year old locked up pending a full hearing later this month.

Keef’s attorney argued that he had been spending time at the Northbrook home of his manager recording music at the studio there.

After hearing testimony from Keef’s probation officer, Juvenile Court Judge Carl Anthony Walker ruled that there was no “credible evidence” that the rapper had moved to Northbrook according to the Chicago Tribune.

Keef is on on probation after a juvenile conviction for pointing a gun at a police office. He still faces a hearing on on January 28, 2013 for another alleged probation violation for holding a gun during a 2012 interview with Pitchfork at a gun range in New York.

Pitchfork has since taken the video down, but have been ordered by a judge to turn over the footage, as it will be used to determine if Keef should be sent back to juvenile detention for firing weapons.","2013-01-04 00:00:00","0","31.0","26.0","3.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","63.0","40.0","0.0","169.0","7.0","26.0","6","209","97.95","63.11","29.12","5.42","23.22","27.75","72.73","45.93","5.74","2.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.87","0.00","2.87","8.61","19.14","7.66","2.87","1.91","1.44","11.96","3.35","1.91","0.00","2.39","0.48","2.87","0.48","2.39","0.48","1.91","0.00","6.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.87","5.26","1.44","1.44","0.96","0.48","0.00","1.91","2.87","0.96","1.91","0.00","0.48","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.09","0.00","0.48","8.13","0.48","0.48","5.74","4.31","0.48","18.18","1.91","8.61","8.13","2.87","1.44","0.96","0.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.00","4.31","4.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.96","0.96","0.00","0.00","993","8.27","23.444444444444443","315","208","9","56.49","13.4","11.1","11.61","13.3","46","7.25","20.08615384615385","136","21.22","0","0.43","0","1","5","21","0","34","6","0","0","2","42","31","0","2","0","0","4","3","5","1","0","3","7","0","5","10","11","11","1","5","0","0","0","0"
"http://20minutenews.com/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/","NRA President Jim Porter: “It’s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again” – 20minutenews","It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.

“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”

When asked to clarify Porter said,

“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”

Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”

It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.

"http://20minutenews.com/sarah-palin-believes-that-global-warming-will-bring-back-the-dinosaurs/","Sarah Palin Believes That Global Warming Will ‘Bring Back the Dinosaurs’ – 20minutenews","Sarah Palin said today that concern over global warming is overblown because returning the climate to its state millions of years ago will allow dinosaurs to make a comeback.

In an interview with Fox News, the former Alaska governor admitted that climate change will hurt some plants and animals but argued that it will also provide an opportunity for ancient, warm-weather species to thrive.

“I’ve been hearing all this hootin’ and hollarin’ from the liberals about how CO 2 is going up to levels we haven’t seen in 5 million years,” Palin told Fox and Friends‘ host Gretchen Carlson. “But the truth is, life was pretty good millions of years ago.

“There were plenty of plants and animals back then, and they did just fine in the heat. And as Earth starts to warm up, all our old friends will start coming back. The polar bears might die off, but think of all the dinosaurs we’re gonna get!

“But you don’t hear the liberal, lamestream media talk about that do you? All you hear is doom and gloom, the sky is falling. Personally, I can’t wait to see what a triceratops looks like in real life.”

Page Right Out of History

The overwhelming majority of scientists believe that the Earth’s climate is warming due to emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases created by industrial activity.

If left unchecked, this process could increase temperatures significantly by the end of the century and lead to increased drought, severe weather and mass extinctions across the globe.

According to Palin, however, these negative effects are outweighed by the positive, which apparently includes the dubious idea that restoring a Pliocene climate will bring Cretaceous species back to life.

“Just to be clear,” Carlson interrupted, “you’re saying that if some animals go extinct because it’s too hot, they’ll be replaced by heat-loving animals that went extinct millions of years ago?”

“Well, yes exactly,” Palin responded. “That’s what I call logic, Gretchen. Something the Looney Left in this country doesn’t understand. They’re so Debbie Downer about this whole thing, they can’t see the bright side.”

“I don’t think you can actually bring back the dinosaurs,” interjected co-host Steve Doocy. “Once something is extinct it’s gone forever. Also, dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago, so your dates are a bit off as well. “

“Really?” a surprised Palin inquired. “But they did it in Jurassic Park. Are you telling me that movie wasn’t based on a true story?”

Stunned by Palin’s ignorance of basic scientific concepts, the Fox and Friends team turned the conversation to the ongoing Benghazi scandal.

Palin served as Alaska’s governor from 2006-2009 and was the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008. She is currently an author and Fox News contributor.

"http://20minutenews.com/sad-statistics-more-u-s-troops-committed-suicide-in-2012-than-were-killed-in-the-afghanistan-war-video/","Sad Statistics: More U.S. Troops Committed Suicide In 2012 Than Were Killed In The Afghanistan War [Video] – 20minutenews","U.S. soldiers are committing suicide at an alarming rate. NBC News reports that through November 2012, 177 active-duty soldiers had committed suicide. In all of 2012, 176 soldiers were killed in action while serving in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

Russia Today reports the suicide rate is much higher when you take into account soldiers who have returned home from combat. According to their report, nearly 500 American troops and veterans took their own lives last year.

Many soldiers feel they will be looked at as being weak or denied promotion if they seek mental health aid. Families of some suicide victims blame the military for not doing enough to help troops deal with the stress of combat.

“The Pentagon hasn’t spent the money that it has for suicide prevention for this year — and that money wasn’t nearly enough money to reach all the soldiers who need help. Now we are hearing about bureaucratic technicalities at the Pentagon that are preventing them from acting. This is unconscionable,” Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Washington, told NBC. “The Pentagon is funded to help soldiers and needs to do much more on the epidemic of suicides.”

The Department of Defense says that they are working on this growing epidemic and that “anti-suicide programs installed throughout the armed services soon will curb military suicides — and that such initiatives already have helped douse mental-health stigmas.”

“We have seen several programs that we are optimistic are going to start making a dent in this issue,” said Jackie Garrick, acting director of the DOD suicide prevention office. “We’ve asked all of the services to use the same messaging, the same talking points. So the Army, included in that, is trying to adapt and promote those same messages because we realize that this is an across-the-board problem.”

Tim Kenney of the Army National Guard says that he battled suicidal thoughts when he returned home from the war, but was able to overcome them. He thinks many servicemen have a hard time adjusting back into civilian life.

“What these guys end up doing is I think is they feel ‘I can’t cope anymore with civilian life.’ A lot of guys end up killing themselves because they don’t think they will ever fit back into normal society,” Kenney told Russia Today.

"http://20minutenews.com/wesley-snipes-released-from-prison/","Wesley Snipes Released From Prison! – 20minutenews","Wesley Snipes Out Of Prison!

Actor Wesley Snipes has reportedly been released from prison since April 2nd…..just in time for tax season!

He will be on house arrest until April 19th.

Story Below:

Wesley Snipes is a free man… mostly. TMZ is reporting that the 50-year-old film actor has been released from prison. According to the popular site, Snipes was released on April 2 and transferred to the New York Community Corrections Office. He will be on house arrest thereafter until July 19.

If my math is correct, that means that Snipes served 845 days (remember 2012 was a leap year) of his three-year sentence. He was originally slated to be released on July 19, 2013, which means he served nearly 90% of his sentence (I’m going to assume some credit for time served and good behavior).

The Wesley Snipes saga began in 2006 when he was accused of tax fraud. He was originally indicted on charges of attempting to claim nearly $12 million in fraudulent tax refunds and not filing any tax returns for several years. Snipes’ first attorney, Billy Martin, said in a statement at the time, “We believe the evidence in the case will show he has been the victim of unscrupulous tax advice. And this trial will help vindicate him.”

The matter did go to trial in 2008. Despite a lengthy list of potential witnesses, and claims that the defense to the trial could take up to a month, the Snipes defense team rested – after less than an hour – without offering any witnesses. The defense felt pretty confident that the government had not proved its burden, saying: “We could have put on a big show, but we don’t do that. We’re not going to waste the jury’s time.” In contrast, the week before, IRS agent Steward Stich testified that Snipes earned almost $40 million in the years 1999 through 2004 and failed to file tax returns or pay any taxes on that income. He also alleged that Snipes also tried to have almost $12 million in taxes paid in prior years 1996 and 1997 refunded to him.

Snipes pleaded not guilty on all counts. He was eventually acquitted of felony federal tax fraud and conspiracy charges. Snipes was, however, convicted of failing to file tax returns from 1999 to 2004, which were misdemeanor charges. He faced up to three years in prison for the failure to file and he received the maximum sentence.

Snipes’ co-defendants and financial/tax “advisors”, Eddie Ray Kahn and Douglas P. Rosile, were convicted by the same jury of tax fraud and conspiracy. Kahn, a former CPA who is no longer allowed to practice in Florida and Ohio, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and Rosile was sentenced to four and half years in prison.

After his conviction, Snipes immediately promised an appeal, which he delivered (more than once) claiming, among other pleadings and filings that his sentence was unreasonable, that his defense was lacking and that he was not able to get a fair trial in “racist” Ocala, Florida, which Snipes had previously referred to as a “hotbed of KKK activity.” He was originally slated to report to prison on June 3, 2008, but that was delayed, pending the outcome of the appeal. His request for a new trial was denied on November 19, 2010, and he subsequently reported to prison on December 9, 2010, at McKean Federal Correctional Institution, in northwest Pennsylvania.

That wasn’t the last of Snipes’ arguments, however. While serving time, Snipes appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 6, 2011, Snipes’ petition for certiorari was denied, which means that the Supreme Court declined to hear the matter. With that, the appeals officially came to an end. Snipes remained in custody until this week.

It’s worth noting that, at the time of the initial allegations, Snipes was filming a movie, “Gallowwalkers” in Namibia. The film, summarized as “[a] cursed gunman (Snipes) whose victims come back from the dead recruits a young warrior to help in the fight against a gang of zombies” was released in the U.K. in 2012 and is scheduled to be released in the U.S. in 2013. No actual release date has been noted (IMDB just says “2013″) and the website for the film remains a blank screen. Likewise, the link to the trailer now says “this video does not exist.” A movie poster was released just last month (you can see it here). Speculation had been building that the release of the film might just coincide with Snipes’ release. I guess now we’ll see.

That dude is getting a lot of mainstream attention thanks to the attempt on his life! But the cops are taking it very serious and they don’t think its staged like 50 Cent suggested. The popo are looking directly at the GD’s and they are looking specifically at the GD’s in Chicago! They are basically suggesting that this is coming from the man Larry Hoover! If that should be the case, s**t would be MAJOR THICK suddenly!

See, what happened – supposedly – is Rick Ross used some of the symbols and and logos of the GDs and didn’t pay the required “fees.” When Ross was in Fort Lauderdale, they opened fire with the AK-47!!!!

There’s another theory of a boss out there that wants Rick Ross’ head on a platter but I’m gonna leave that along.

While it’s now confirmed that Clive is too far gone to be called bi-curious, what we’re curious about is who among his crew were most likely to be covering up for Clive.

Scroll Down for the most likely suspects…

Diddy

Diddy is pretty famous for his freaky ways and it’s long been implied that he’s batted for both teams. Clive’s coming out only sheds more suspicion on the Bad Boy because it’s public knowledge that Diddy borrowed millions from Clive when the label was in trouble and at one point Clive’s Arista label actually owned a 50% stake of Bad Boy. Coincidence? We think not.

Christina Aguilera

Xtina has always been known for letting her freak flag fly freely, and no wonder she’s felt so comfortable, with Clive playing a large role in her career, even to this day.

Andre Harrell

How many execs do you know take such a STRONG interest in their unpaid INTERN that they bring them on as an A&R? Not many. But it’s not just his shady relationship with Diddy that puts Harrell under the microscope. It also doesn’t help that he may be the only man on this list with a private life more private than Clive’s.

His latest stop was to the Sway In the Morning Show.

He talks about the Rick Ross shooting, saying he thought it was just a rumor until his engineer confirmed it.

The Virginia rapper also addresses rumors that have followed Kanye West and Jay-Z for years, that they are somehow part of the Illuminati and devil worshipers. The rumors now include Pusha himself.

“I never asked [Kanye] about the Illuminati, but just in conversation I hear him be like ‘man people saying I’m part of the Illuminati, people are crazy.’ It’s bled over to everybody,” Pusha said. “I was just saying that my mother asked me the other day ‘I heard you part of something called the Illuminessence.’ And I’m like mom what are you talking about? She’s like ‘you part of something called the Illuminessence. The people in church told me you are part of something called the Illuminessence!’ Come to find out she’s talking about the Illuminati. And I’m talking about I was so hot because y’all all in church telling my mom this kind of stuff.”

Push said there isn’t any devil worshiping going on with Kanye either.

Mayor ‘Redskins’ Is RACIST … It’s Time for a Change! – 20minutenews","It’s damn time the Washington Redskins changed its racist name … at least if the team ever plans to move inside D.C. city limits — so says District mayor Vincent Gray.

Now that the Redskins are winning again, there’s been a lot of talk about bringing the team back to D.C. — instead of leaving them in nearby FedEx Field, located in Maryland.

But Mayor Gray has some conditions before the Redskins move a muscle — claiming, “I think that if they get serious with the team coming back to Washington, there’s no doubt there’s going to have to be a discussion about [changing the team name].”

Gray added, “I think it has become a lightning rod, and I would love to be able to sit down with the team … and see if a change should be made. There’s a precedent for this, and I think there needs to be a dispassionate discussion about this, and do the right thing.”

There’s no question, the term “redskins” is flat-out racist … but we still gotta ask …#LOZR

Before Brown punched him, Ocean admitted to excusing Brown of taking his parking spot and not being willing to shake his hand to reconcile.

After taking a blow to the face, the “Novacane” singer told police he found himself in a corner with Brown‘s homies attempting to kick him.

Frank is unsure who made the f*ggot comment, but he did report that Chris threaten to shoot him by saying, “We can bust on you too!”

Overall, Ocean remembers the fight lasting two to three minutes. He endured minor injuries.

On Frank‘s blog he said he has no plans to press charges, however, he did tell the police he wants to see Breezy in jail. Hmmm.

Frank Ocean is expected to move forward with pressing assault charges against Chris Brown — after the recent brawl between the pair(Click Here) broke out at Westlake Recording Studios, Sunday. While Breezy continues to maintain a story of being ambushed, Frank Ocean says Chris threw the first punch.

Now, LAPD is reported to be looking to question Breezy over the incident.

Sources say the tension may have all been sparked over…get this, a parking spot! After the incident, Frank Ocean – who, unlike Chris – remained on scene to speak with responding cops – took to Twitter to talk about the fight.

Here’s what Frank Ocean had to say, wishing his Bernese Mountain Dog “Everest” were there to protect him:

“got jumped by chris and a couple guys. lol. i only wish everest was there.”

Here’s what’s being reported:

“Last night, tensions between Frank Ocean and Chris Brown mounted after the two engaged in a skirmish at a studio in Los Angeles, California. According to NY Post, the Odd Future crooner is looking to press charges against Brown for “punching him and starting an all-out brawl” outside of Westlake Studios. Police claim that Ocean is “desirous of prosecution” and that they’re looking to question Brown, who is on probation until August 2014, stemming from his beating Rihanna in 2009.

Was Frank Ocean advised by higher-ups in the entertainment industry to press charges? Of course. Don’t believe me..

Flip, real name Wesley Eric Weston, says he is “not one of those rappers who would carry drugs on me. I know better.”

The rapper also presented TMZ wirh a copy of his concealed handgun license, which he says is also valid in 22 other states, including Louisiana. He said he has been shot before and as an entertainer needs a gun for protection.

My dog killed a body for ya, damn he didn’t eat from it.” Meek Mill – “Repo”

When Meek Mill dropped his Cassidy diss “Repo,” he mentions former Larsiny Family member AR-AB. Meek claimed in the song that Cass never let AR eat, even after he caught a body for him.

In a new video blog, AR backs up Meek’s claims.

While maintaining that he is still cool with Cass, AR says that The Hustla has been lying about his 2005 murder case. AR claims he actually killed Desmond Hawkins, while Cass ran into his house and locked him outside.

“Claim your rape, don’t claim my homicide,” AR says.

When AR returned home from prison he claims Cass only gave him $200 and made him sleep on his couch. AR says he starved the entire time he was with Larsiny Family.



AR further claims that Cass was scared to fight Jim Jones and Gillie Da Kid when they stepped to him.

Cassidy responded to AR via Twitter this morning.

"http://20minutenews.com/dayummmm-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-faces-1-billion-dollar-tax-bill/","DAYUMMMM! Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Faces $1 Billion Dollar Tax Bill – 20minutenews","Facebook’s stock market debut left founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg with a paper fortune currently valued at $13 billion — and a 2012 tax bill of around $1.1 billion.

Zuckerberg’s whopping tax hit stems from his move last May to increase his stake in Facebook. On the day of Facebook’s initial public offering, Zuckerberg exercised a stock option and purchased 60 million Facebook shares at a “strike price” of 6 cents each.

Even if those shares are never sold, the IRS treats them as ordinary income at the time the options are exercised. The rationale is that such options are a form of compensation, just like regular wages.

For Zuckerberg, that means reporting income last year of nearly $2.3 billion from his stock options alone. Add together the top 2012 federal tax rate of 35% and the top California rate of 13.3% — the highest in the nation — and you get a total tax rate of 48.3%.

That’s before factoring in some deductions and any other income Zuckerberg collected last year. Only Uncle Sam and California’s tax agency know exactly what’s in Zuckerberg’s return, but three California CPAs that CNNMoney consulted ran the numbers and believe Zuckerberg’s bill for the year will probably exceed $1 billion.

That’s really unusual … even for billionaires.

“With numbers that large, it’s usually capital gains, not ordinary income,” said Toby Johnston, a partner at tax firm Moss Adams LLP‘s Silicon Valley office who works with wealthy clients. Investors profiting off their gains paid a significantly lower tax rate last year than Facebook’s founder will. The highest federal capital gains rate in 2012 was 15%. It goes up to 23.8% (including a Medicare surtax) this year.

The Internal Revenue Service doesn’t comment on the returns of individual taxpayers, but each year it releases aggregate data on the 400 U.S. tax filers with the largest reported incomes. Theaverage top earner had income of $202 million and a federal income tax bill of $41 million for 2009, the most recent data available.

A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on Zuckerberg’s taxes.

To cover the giant bill he knew was coming, Zuckerberg dipped into his trove of Facebook stock. He sold 30.2 million shares during Facebook’s IPO, taking in $1.135 billion. At the time, Facebook said in a regulatory filing that Zuckerberg planned to use the “substantial majority” of those proceeds to cover the taxes on his stock-option purchase.

And Zuckerberg has another big tax hit looming: He is still sitting on 60 million unexercised options that expire in late 2015. At Facebook’s (FB) current share price, those options would generate taxable income of $1.6 billion if he cashed them in. If he cashed then in today at current tax rates, that would amount to a $826 million bill.

The U.S. Treasury will benefit from Zuckerberg’s taxes. So will California, which is getting awindfall as thousands of Facebook employees cash in on stock grants and options. California expects to collect roughly $1.5 billion in tax revenue tied to Facebook’s IPO, according to the latest estimate from the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office.

So how do you pay a tax bill that’s bigger than some nations’ entire annual GDP? (We’re looking at you, Grenada.)

California requires an electronic payment for all tax bills larger than $80,000, but the IRS will take a paper check for any amount.

Watching a sum that big vanish from your bank account sounds scary, right? The flip side is that at least you can afford it.

“Most people are thrilled, to tell you the truth,” said Stan Pollock, a San Francisco area accountant who specializes in handling tax issues for tech workers. “I have had very few clients that get these huge windfalls who have resented paying the tax. They know they got lucky.”","2013-03-29 00:00:00","0","40.0","34.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","69.0","40.0","0.0","168.0","7.0","26.0","6","629","93.57","74.80","16.94","49.44","18.50","25.44","77.90","38.47","8.27","3.66","0.16","0.16","0.95","1.59","0.79","4.61","7.31","13.35","4.93","2.54","3.66","0.48","10.33","4.93","3.34","0.95","6.84","2.86","2.54","1.91","0.64","0.16","0.16","0.32","8.11","0.16","0.16","0.00","1.75","8.27","1.27","0.79","1.11","3.50","0.95","1.91","1.11","0.32","0.79","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","8.11","2.23","1.75","3.18","2.07","0.00","2.38","6.52","1.59","14.63","0.79","8.90","4.93","9.54","1.27","0.00","10.17","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.24","5.88","3.97","0.16","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.16","1.75","3.50","0.95","2.54","2992","7.76","19.441176470588236","916","630","41","64.3","10.3","8.1","11.19","9.9","134","8.6","16.66793650793651","344","18.09","14","0.39","0","14","50","59","0","77","52","3","6","8","111","70","0","40","0","0","20","7","22","0","1","1","11","0","15","23","15","9","17","16","9","4","0","1"

Did Chris Brown do the dastardly deed!?

The word on the street is that Christ Brown proposed to Rihanna on New Years. I really don’t know that he did for sure, but it was trending on twitter. Seems that there was a report debunking this rumor, but some said something happened! The pair were apparently all snuggled up in Africa, shining like a pair of blood diamonds. SMH! Anyway, the official world right now is that they are just friends, but I don’t believe that BS and sources maintain that something significant happened as the new year rang in.

Chris’ Ex And Teyanna Taylor Were Seen Kissing!

On the flip side, Chris’ ex and his rumored jump off were reportedly out there kissing and making out on new years! YEP! Teyanna Taylor and…freaking Karrueche. Had to google Karrueche’s name just to know how to spell it. Anyway, there are a couple instagram pics floating. Here are some.

If he did, what would have been a routine car accident with no injuries would now be considered a hit-and-run.

Brown and girlfriend Karrueche Tran were riding in Los Angeles on Tuesday May 21st, when Brown rear ended another vehicle. According to TMZ, the singer gave the other driver false insurance information and refused to give her his driver’s license number.



Chris is on probation for assaulting Rihanna in 2009. If the police find that he broke the law by leaving the scene of an accident without fully disclosing all of the information required by law, his probation could be violated. As a result Chris could be sentenced to up to four years in prison.

“Media manipulation currently shapes everything you read, hear and watch online. Everything.”

– Forbes magazine article on mass media influence, 7/16/2012

The influence of the mass media on public perception is widely acknowledged, yet few know the incredible degree to which this occurs. Key excerpts from the rare, revealing mass media news articles below show how blatantly the media sometimes distort critical facts, omit vital stories, and work hand in hand with the military-industrial complex to keep their secrets safe and promote greedy and manipulative corporate agendas.

Once acclaimed as the watchdog of democracy and the political process, these riveting articles clearly show that the major media can no longer be trusted to side with the people over business and military interests. For ideas on how you can further educate yourself and what you can do to change all this, see the “What you can do” section below the article summaries. Together, we can make a difference.

U.S. Suppressed Footage of Hiroshima for Decades

2005-08-03, New York Times/Reuters

http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/news/news-media-anniversary.html

In the weeks following the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, U.S. authorities seized and suppressed film shot in the bombed cities by U.S. military crews and Japanese newsreel teams to prevent Americans from seeing the full extent of devastation wrought by the new weapons. It remained hidden until the early 1980s and has never been fully aired. “Although there are clearly huge differences with Iraq, there are also some similarities,” said Mitchell, co-author of “Hiroshima in America” and editor of Editor & Publisher. “The chief similarity is that Americans are still being kept at a distance from images of death, whether of their own soldiers or Iraqi civilians.” The Los Angeles Times released a survey of six months of media coverage of the Iraq war in six prominent U.S. newspapers and two news magazines — a period during which 559 coalition forces, the vast majority American, were killed. It found they had run almost no photographs of Americans killed in action. “So much of the media is owned by big corporations and they would much rather focus on making money than setting themselves up for criticism from the White House and Congress,” said Ralph Begleiter, a former CNN correspondent. In 1945, U.S. policymakers wanted to be able to continue to develop and test atomic and eventually nuclear weapons without an outcry of public opinion. “They succeeded but the subject is still a raw nerve.”

That dude is getting a lot of mainstream attention thanks to the attempt on his life! But the cops are taking it very serious and they don’t think its staged like 50 Cent suggested. The popo are looking directly at the GD’s and they are looking specifically at the GD’s in Chicago! They are basically suggesting that this is coming from the man Larry Hoover! If that should be the case, s**t would be MAJOR THICK suddenly!

See, what happened – supposedly – is Rick Ross used some of the symbols and and logos of the GDs and didn’t pay the required “fees.” When Ross was in Fort Lauderdale, they opened fire with the AK-47!!!!

There’s another theory of a boss out there that wants Rick Ross’ head on a platter but I’m gonna leave that along.

Before Brown punched him, Ocean admitted to excusing Brown of taking his parking spot and not being willing to shake his hand to reconcile.

After taking a blow to the face, the “Novacane” singer told police he found himself in a corner with Brown‘s homies attempting to kick him.

Frank is unsure who made the f*ggot comment, but he did report that Chris threaten to shoot him by saying, “We can bust on you too!”

Overall, Ocean remembers the fight lasting two to three minutes. He endured minor injuries.

On Frank‘s blog he said he has no plans to press charges, however, he did tell the police he wants to see Breezy in jail. Hmmm.

“I never asked [Kanye] about the Illuminati, but just in conversation I hear him be like ‘man people saying I’m part of the Illuminati, people are crazy.’ It’s bled over to everybody,” Pusha said. “I was just saying that my mother asked me the other day ‘I heard you part of something called the Illuminessence.’ And I’m like mom what are you talking about? She’s like ‘you part of something called the Illuminessence. The people in church told me you are part of something called the Illuminessence!’ Come to find out she’s talking about the Illuminati. And I’m talking about I was so hot because y’all all in church telling my mom this kind of stuff.”

My dog killed a body for ya, damn he didn’t eat from it.” Meek Mill – “Repo”

When Meek Mill dropped his Cassidy diss “Repo,” he mentions former Larsiny Family member AR-AB. Meek claimed in the song that Cass never let AR eat, even after he caught a body for him.

In a new video blog, AR backs up Meek’s claims.

While maintaining that he is still cool with Cass, AR says that The Hustla has been lying about his 2005 murder case. AR claims he actually killed Desmond Hawkins, while Cass ran into his house and locked him outside.

“Claim your rape, don’t claim my homicide,” AR says.

When AR returned home from prison he claims Cass only gave him $200 and made him sleep on his couch. AR says he starved the entire time he was with Larsiny Family.



AR further claims that Cass was scared to fight Jim Jones and Gillie Da Kid when they stepped to him.

Cassidy responded to AR via Twitter this morning.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/meek-miilz-is-suing-the-philadelphia-police-department/","Meek Millz Is Suing The Philadelphia Police Department","Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill is suing the Philadelphia Police Department, after being jailed for nine hours without cause, stemming from an October 31 traffic stop.

Robert Williams aka Meek Mill, filed the lawsuit against police officers Andre Boyer and Michael Vargas, in Federal Court in Philadelphia on Monday (January 14).

Court documents state that “on October 31, 2012, at approximately 7:30 p.m., plaintiff was driving a Range Rover SUV when Philadelphia Police Officers Andre Boyer and Michael Vargas, without cause or justification, conducted a motor vehicle stop in the area of 11th Street and Girard Avenue in Philadelphia.”

“Following the vehicle stop, police officers Boyer and Vargas handcuffed plaintiff at the scene, transported him in custody to the 22nd Police District, took photographs of plaintiff which the officers posted and published, or caused to be posted and published, on Instagram and other social media websites, depicting plaintiff in police custody, held plaintiff in custody against his will in a jail cell for approximately nine (9) hours, after which time plaintiff was released on November 1, 2012, at 4:30 a.m., without being charged with any criminal activity and having caused plaintiff to miss a scheduled promotional appearance in Atlanta, Georgia.”

Meek says that the arrest’s timing caused him to refund “his deposit for the private jet that was booked to fly plaintiff in the evening of October 31, 2012 to a promotional appearance in Atlanta,” and cost him “the loss of numerous sponsorships and endorsements.

Meek is also suing for “anxiety and embarrassment associated with plaintiff being placed in a false light; and the anxiety and embarrassment of being seized, detained, confined and imprisoned against plaintiff’s will.”

Meek is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for civil rights violations, false imprisonment, invasion of privacy and civil conspiracy.

In the lawsuit, Meek’s attorney makes it clear that this has been a practice of the Philadelphia Police Department and that the stops have been racial in nature, much like the “stop and frisks” in New York City.

“Prior to October 31, 2012, the defendant City of Philadelphia, through the high command of the Philadelphia Police Department, implemented and enforced a policy and practice of stops, frisks, searches and detentions of persons, including plaintiff, without probable cause or reasonable suspicion as required by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1 section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution”

“The stops, frisks, searches and detentions by Philadelphia Police

Plans To Fight Louisiana Charges","Lil Flip is vowing to fight recent drug and gun charges. As we previously reported, the 31-year old Houston rapper was pulled over in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana on December 25, for speeding.

During a search of his 2010 Dodge Challenger, deputies reportedly found weed and a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle. Flip was arrested and booked on charges of third-offense possession of marijuana, possession of a firearm in the presence of a controlled dangerous substance, and speeding

During a new interview with TMZ, Flip said he has a license to carry the weapon, which he claims is not automatic firing and there was no weed in the car. He said police found “Black and Mild” wine flavored cigars and clove cigarettes

Flip, real name Wesley Eric Weston, says he is “not one of those rappers who would carry drugs on me. I know better.”

The rapper also presented TMZ wirh a copy of his concealed handgun license, which he says is also valid in 22 other states, including Louisiana. He said he has been shot before and as an entertainer needs a gun for protection.

“I know they don’t mess around in Louisiana and I wouldn’t do anything to make me go to the big house. Especially on Christmas night,” he told TMZ.

Flip plans on pleading not guilty to all charges.","2013-01-02 00:00:00","0","13.0","17.0","3.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","48.0","42.0","0.0","88.0","5.0","1.0","1","224","85.31","63.97","14.80","6.15","20.36","20.09","74.11","45.54","10.27","7.59","2.23","0.45","0.00","4.46","0.45","2.68","6.70","14.73","6.25","2.23","5.80","2.68","13.39","4.46","2.23","1.34","3.12","0.45","4.46","1.34","3.12","0.45","1.79","0.00","9.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.46","7.14","1.79","0.89","1.34","0.45","0.89","1.79","3.57","0.89","2.23","0.00","2.23","0.00","1.79","0.00","1.34","5.80","0.45","1.34","3.12","0.45","0.89","4.91","7.59","0.45","14.73","2.23","6.70","5.80","3.12","1.79","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.62","4.91","5.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.34","2.68","0.89","0.00","0.00","998","7.78","22.6","309","221","11","67.99","11.6","8.8","10.15","10.9","44","12.75","18.00380090497738","144","20.5","7","0.43","0","9","6","18","0","25","16","0","0","1","33","27","0","9","0","0","15","2","9","0","0","1","5","0","6","12","4","7","6","11","2","1","0","0"
"http://smhwtfnews.com/here-are-5-arguments-against-for-the-existence-of-god/","Here Are 5 Arguments Against & For The Existence Of God","Religious topics abound on here and they are frequently the most commented upon. It has been some time since the last one so it seems like the time is ripe for another – and this one is a great one for discussion. Here we present five arguments in favor of the existence of God, and the counterargument for it. Feel free to comment on the veracity (or your opinion of) each but remember to keep calm and argue reasonably. After all, it is our ability to be reasonable (rationality) which separates us from the other animals! Note: These all deal with the Judeo-Christian God.

5 Ontological Argument

First formulated by St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, then taken up by Alvin Plantinga. “God exists, provided that it is logically possible for him to exist.”

This argument is quite brazen in its simplicity, requiring not only a belief in God, but a belief in the necessity of God. If you believe he is necessary, then you must believe he exists.

The Counterargument:

Criticism typically deals with the Ontological Argument committing a “bare assertion fallacy,” which means it asserts qualities inherent solely to an unproven statement, without any support for those qualities. It is also criticized as a circular argument, revolving from a premise to a conclusion which relies on the premise, which relies on the conclusion.

4 Moral Argument

This argument is very old, and states that God must exist for the following reason: 1. An aspect of morality is observed. 2. Belief in God is a better explanation for this morality than any alternative. 3. Belief in God is thus preferable to disbelief in God.

The Counterargument:

This argument is technically valid, provided that the three constituents are accepted, and most critics refuse to accept the first. Morality, they argue, is not universal. Murder was perfectly fine for the soldiers of the First Crusade, who slaughtered every man, woman, and child in Jerusalem in 1099. Thomas Hobbes argued that morality is based on the society around it, and is thus not objective.

3 Argument from Degree

This is one of St. Thomas Aquinas’s “Five Proofs of God,” and still causes debate among the two sides. Here is Aquinas’s statement of it, which I have translated from Latin, for a sense of thoroughness:

The fourth proof originates from the degrees discovered in things. For there is discovered greater and lesser degrees of goodness, truth, nobility, and others. But “more” or “less” are terms spoken concerning various things that approach in diverse manners toward something that is the “greatest,” just as in the case of “hotter” approaching nearer the “greatest” heat. There exists, therefore, something “truest,” and “best,” and “noblest,” which, in consequence, is the “greatest” being. For those things which are the greatest truths are the greatest beings, as is stated in Metaphysics Bk. II. 2. Furthermore, that which is the greatest in its way, is, in another way, the cause of all things belonging to it; thus fire, which is the greatest heat, is the cause of all heat, as is said in the same book (cf. Plato and Aristotle). Therefore, there exists something that is the cause of the existence of all things, and of goodness, and of every perfection whatever. We call this “God.”

The Counterargument:

The most prevalent criticism of this argument considers that we do not have to believe in an object of a greater degree in order to believe in an object of a lesser degree. Richard Dawkins, the most famous, or infamous, Atheist around these days, argues that just because we come across a “smelly” object, does not require that we believe that we believe in a “preeminently peerless stinker,” in his words.

2

Argument from Reason

One of my favorites, with very intricate abstraction. C. S. Lewis (who wrote “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe”) came up with this. It begins as an argument from design, and then continues into something new. Very basically, it argues that God must exist, because, in Lewis’s words:

“Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It’s like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can’t trust my own thinking, of course I can’t trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.”

The Counterargument:

It sounds powerful, and the final judgment on it is still out there. But its primary weak point is that, in the strictest sense, it is not a proof of God’s existence because it requires the assumption that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim, and it requires that human minds can be convinced by argumentation.

But in order to reject the assumption that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim, a human mind must assume that this claim is true or false, which immediately proves that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim.

But none of this has anything to do with God’s existence. Thus, the argument is better treated as a disproof of naturalistic materialism. However, given that most Atheists use naturalistic materialism as the foundation of Atheism, is is a very viable argument.

1 Cosmological Argument

Thomas Aquinas’s most famous proof of God refuses to go away. You’ve probably already heard of it in some form. It was around before Aquinas, at least as early as Plato and Aristotle, and in basic terms, it goes like this:

1. Every finite and contingent being has a cause.

2. Nothing finite and contingent can cause itself.

3. A causal chain cannot be of infinite length.

4. Therefore, a First Cause (or something that is not an effect) must exist.

This is especially impressive in that it was theorized by the Ancient Greeks, at a time when the Universe was not known to have had an origin. Today, we call this “the Big Bang,” and the argument has changed to this form:

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.

2. The Universe began to exist.

3. Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

The Counterargument:

Sequentially speaking, these three points are true. But the second point requires the Universe to have had a cause, and we still aren’t sure it did. “The Big Bang” is the most prevalent astrophysical theory today, but it has its detractors, most arguing that because the mathematics that leads back to a big bang do not function at the point immediately prior to the big bang, those mathematics were invalid to begin with.

Better than this, however, is the argument that this proof of God commits the logical fallacy called “infinite regression.” If the Universe had a first cause, what caused that first cause? Criticism declares that it is unfair to argue for every thing’s cause, and then argue for the sole exception of a “First Cause,” which did not have a cause.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/dayummmm-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-faces-1-billion-dollar-tax-bill/","DAYUMMMM! Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Faces $1 Billion Dollar Tax Bill","Facebook’s stock market debut left founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg with a paper fortune currently valued at $13 billion — and a 2012 tax bill of around $1.1 billion.

Zuckerberg’s whopping tax hit stems from his move last May to increase his stake in Facebook. On the day of Facebook’s initial public offering, Zuckerberg exercised a stock option and purchased 60 million Facebook shares at a “strike price” of 6 cents each.

Even if those shares are never sold, the IRS treats them as ordinary income at the time the options are exercised. The rationale is that such options are a form of compensation, just like regular wages.

For Zuckerberg, that means reporting income last year of nearly $2.3 billion from his stock options alone. Add together the top 2012 federal tax rate of 35% and the top California rate of 13.3% — the highest in the nation — and you get a total tax rate of 48.3%.

That’s before factoring in some deductions and any other income Zuckerberg collected last year. Only Uncle Sam and California’s tax agency know exactly what’s in Zuckerberg’s return, but three California CPAs that CNNMoney consulted ran the numbers and believe Zuckerberg’s bill for the year will probably exceed $1 billion.

That’s really unusual … even for billionaires.

“With numbers that large, it’s usually capital gains, not ordinary income,” said Toby Johnston, a partner at tax firm Moss Adams LLP‘s Silicon Valley office who works with wealthy clients. Investors profiting off their gains paid a significantly lower tax rate last year than Facebook’s founder will. The highest federal capital gains rate in 2012 was 15%. It goes up to 23.8% (including a Medicare surtax) this year.

The Internal Revenue Service doesn’t comment on the returns of individual taxpayers, but each year it releases aggregate data on the 400 U.S. tax filers with the largest reported incomes. Theaverage top earner had income of $202 million and a federal income tax bill of $41 million for 2009, the most recent data available.

A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on Zuckerberg’s taxes.

To cover the giant bill he knew was coming, Zuckerberg dipped into his trove of Facebook stock. He sold 30.2 million shares during Facebook’s IPO, taking in $1.135 billion. At the time, Facebook said in a regulatory filing that Zuckerberg planned to use the “substantial majority” of those proceeds to cover the taxes on his stock-option purchase.

And Zuckerberg has another big tax hit looming: He is still sitting on 60 million unexercised options that expire in late 2015. At Facebook’s (FB) current share price, those options would generate taxable income of $1.6 billion if he cashed them in. If he cashed then in today at current tax rates, that would amount to a $826 million bill.

The U.S. Treasury will benefit from Zuckerberg’s taxes. So will California, which is getting awindfall as thousands of Facebook employees cash in on stock grants and options. California expects to collect roughly $1.5 billion in tax revenue tied to Facebook’s IPO, according to the latest estimate from the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office.

So how do you pay a tax bill that’s bigger than some nations’ entire annual GDP? (We’re looking at you, Grenada.)

California requires an electronic payment for all tax bills larger than $80,000, but the IRS will take a paper check for any amount.

Watching a sum that big vanish from your bank account sounds scary, right? The flip side is that at least you can afford it.

“Most people are thrilled, to tell you the truth,” said Stan Pollock, a San Francisco area accountant who specializes in handling tax issues for tech workers. “I have had very few clients that get these huge windfalls who have resented paying the tax. They know they got lucky.”","2013-03-29 00:00:00","0","40.0","34.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","85.0","50.0","0.0","169.0","7.0","23.0","6","629","93.57","74.80","16.94","49.44","18.50","25.44","77.90","38.47","8.27","3.66","0.16","0.16","0.95","1.59","0.79","4.61","7.31","13.35","4.93","2.54","3.66","0.48","10.33","4.93","3.34","0.95","6.84","2.86","2.54","1.91","0.64","0.16","0.16","0.32","8.11","0.16","0.16","0.00","1.75","8.27","1.27","0.79","1.11","3.50","0.95","1.91","1.11","0.32","0.79","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","8.11","2.23","1.75","3.18","2.07","0.00","2.38","6.52","1.59","14.63","0.79","8.90","4.93","9.54","1.27","0.00","10.17","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.24","5.88","3.97","0.16","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.16","1.75","3.50","0.95","2.54","2992","7.76","19.441176470588236","916","630","41","64.3","10.3","8.1","11.19","9.9","134","8.6","16.66793650793651","344","18.09","14","0.39","0","14","50","59","0","77","52","3","6","8","111","70","0","40","0","0","20","7","22","0","1","1","11","0","15","23","15","9","17","16","9","4","0","1"
"http://smhwtfnews.com/sad-statistics-more-u-s-troops-committed-suicide-in-2012-than-were-killed-in-the-afghanistan-war-video/","Sad Statistics: More U.S. Troops Committed Suicide In 2012 Than Were Killed In The Afghanistan War [Video]","U.S. soldiers are committing suicide at an alarming rate. NBC News reports that through November 2012, 177 active-duty soldiers had committed suicide. In all of 2012, 176 soldiers were killed in action while serving in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

Russia Today reports the suicide rate is much higher when you take into account soldiers who have returned home from combat. According to their report, nearly 500 American troops and veterans took their own lives last year.

Many soldiers feel they will be looked at as being weak or denied promotion if they seek mental health aid. Families of some suicide victims blame the military for not doing enough to help troops deal with the stress of combat.

“The Pentagon hasn’t spent the money that it has for suicide prevention for this year — and that money wasn’t nearly enough money to reach all the soldiers who need help. Now we are hearing about bureaucratic technicalities at the Pentagon that are preventing them from acting. This is unconscionable,” Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Washington, told NBC. “The Pentagon is funded to help soldiers and needs to do much more on the epidemic of suicides.”

The Department of Defense says that they are working on this growing epidemic and that “anti-suicide programs installed throughout the armed services soon will curb military suicides — and that such initiatives already have helped douse mental-health stigmas.”

“We have seen several programs that we are optimistic are going to start making a dent in this issue,” said Jackie Garrick, acting director of the DOD suicide prevention office. “We’ve asked all of the services to use the same messaging, the same talking points. So the Army, included in that, is trying to adapt and promote those same messages because we realize that this is an across-the-board problem.”

Tim Kenney of the Army National Guard says that he battled suicidal thoughts when he returned home from the war, but was able to overcome them. He thinks many servicemen have a hard time adjusting back into civilian life.

“What these guys end up doing is I think is they feel ‘I can’t cope anymore with civilian life.’ A lot of guys end up killing themselves because they don’t think they will ever fit back into normal society,” Kenney told Russia Today.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/sarah-palin-believes-that-global-warming-will-bring-back-the-dinosaurs/","Sarah Palin Believes That Global Warming Will ‘Bring Back the Dinosaurs’","Sarah Palin said today that concern over global warming is overblown because returning the climate to its state millions of years ago will allow dinosaurs to make a comeback.

In an interview with Fox News, the former Alaska governor admitted that climate change will hurt some plants and animals but argued that it will also provide an opportunity for ancient, warm-weather species to thrive.

“I’ve been hearing all this hootin’ and hollarin’ from the liberals about how CO 2 is going up to levels we haven’t seen in 5 million years,” Palin told Fox and Friends‘ host Gretchen Carlson. “But the truth is, life was pretty good millions of years ago.

“There were plenty of plants and animals back then, and they did just fine in the heat. And as Earth starts to warm up, all our old friends will start coming back. The polar bears might die off, but think of all the dinosaurs we’re gonna get!

“But you don’t hear the liberal, lamestream media talk about that do you? All you hear is doom and gloom, the sky is falling. Personally, I can’t wait to see what a triceratops looks like in real life.”

Page Right Out of History

The overwhelming majority of scientists believe that the Earth’s climate is warming due to emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases created by industrial activity.

If left unchecked, this process could increase temperatures significantly by the end of the century and lead to increased drought, severe weather and mass extinctions across the globe.

According to Palin, however, these negative effects are outweighed by the positive, which apparently includes the dubious idea that restoring a Pliocene climate will bring Cretaceous species back to life.

“Just to be clear,” Carlson interrupted, “you’re saying that if some animals go extinct because it’s too hot, they’ll be replaced by heat-loving animals that went extinct millions of years ago?”

“Well, yes exactly,” Palin responded. “That’s what I call logic, Gretchen. Something the Looney Left in this country doesn’t understand. They’re so Debbie Downer about this whole thing, they can’t see the bright side.”

“I don’t think you can actually bring back the dinosaurs,” interjected co-host Steve Doocy. “Once something is extinct it’s gone forever. Also, dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago, so your dates are a bit off as well. “

“Really?” a surprised Palin inquired. “But they did it in Jurassic Park. Are you telling me that movie wasn’t based on a true story?”

Stunned by Palin’s ignorance of basic scientific concepts, the Fox and Friends team turned the conversation to the ongoing Benghazi scandal.

After an awkward confrontation with Joe Budden, Cons addressed his problem with Rosenberg’s comments during a recent Pusha T interview that he had been “put off” by some oft the things Cons has been saying recently.

Rosenberg also took issue with Cons doing an interview with Power 105.1 before Hot 97.

Joe Budden Confronts Consequence At Hot 97 About Cons Slick Talk Towards Him In Interviews [Video]

Things got extremely awkward recently when Joe Budden crossed paths with Consequence in between their interviews at Hot 97.

The tension between the two “Love & Hip Hop New York” co-stars has been bubbling ever since Cons said some negative things about Joe in interviews with The Breakfast Club and Vlad TV.

While at Hot 97 yesterday Joe confronted Cons to see what all the talk was about. Joe said he wasn’t used to seeing people on a show one day then giving a negative interview about him the next.

Cons placed the blame on Raqi Thunda, saying she had instigated things with disparaging remarks about Joe. Cons also said he was gassed up in the interviews by the hosts which led to him saying slick sh*t about Joe.

Check out the confrontation below. Who backs down in your opinion?

Al Sharpton Signs A Book Deal Via Cash Money Records!","Just weeks after signing socialite Paris Hilton Newsday LI reports that Rev. Al Sharpton is working on a book to be co-released this October 8th by the publishing arm of Cash Money Records, home to Lil Wayne, with whom Sharpton has feuded over some of the rapper’s lyrics.

Sharpton‘s “The Rejected Stone” will be published by Cash Money Content and Massenburg Media.

The book will cover Sharpton’s “personal evolution” from New York street activist to political candidate and civil rights spokesman.

Sharpton told The Associated Press on Thursday that the book would include his thoughts on Lil Wayne and other rappers and that he was anxious to have a positive dialogue.

He added: “Just because we disagree doesn’t mean we have to be disagreeable.”

If he did, what would have been a routine car accident with no injuries would now be considered a hit-and-run.

Brown and girlfriend Karrueche Tran were riding in Los Angeles on Tuesday May 21st, when Brown rear ended another vehicle. According to TMZ, the singer gave the other driver false insurance information and refused to give her his driver’s license number.



Chris is on probation for assaulting Rihanna in 2009. If the police find that he broke the law by leaving the scene of an accident without fully disclosing all of the information required by law, his probation could be violated. As a result Chris could be sentenced to up to four years in prison.

Keef, real name, Keith Cozart, was accused of moving to Northbrook, Illinois without telling authorities. He was also accused of not checking in with his probation officer since the December 18 release of his debut album, Finally Rich. Prosecutors sought to have the 17-year old locked up pending a full hearing later this month.

Keef’s attorney argued that he had been spending time at the Northbrook home of his manager recording music at the studio there.

After hearing testimony from Keef’s probation officer, Juvenile Court Judge Carl Anthony Walker ruled that there was no “credible evidence” that the rapper had moved to Northbrook according to the Chicago Tribune.

Keef is on on probation after a juvenile conviction for pointing a gun at a police office. He still faces a hearing on on January 28, 2013 for another alleged probation violation for holding a gun during a 2012 interview with Pitchfork at a gun range in New York.

Pitchfork has since taken the video down, but have been ordered by a judge to turn over the footage, as it will be used to determine if Keef should be sent back to juvenile detention for firing weapons.","2013-01-04 00:00:00","0","31.0","26.0","3.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","90.0","50.0","0.0","170.0","7.0","23.0","6","209","97.95","63.11","29.12","5.42","23.22","27.75","72.73","45.93","5.74","2.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.87","0.00","2.87","8.61","19.14","7.66","2.87","1.91","1.44","11.96","3.35","1.91","0.00","2.39","0.48","2.87","0.48","2.39","0.48","1.91","0.00","6.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.87","5.26","1.44","1.44","0.96","0.48","0.00","1.91","2.87","0.96","1.91","0.00","0.48","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.09","0.00","0.48","8.13","0.48","0.48","5.74","4.31","0.48","18.18","1.91","8.61","8.13","2.87","1.44","0.96","0.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.00","4.31","4.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.96","0.96","0.00","0.00","993","8.27","23.444444444444443","315","208","9","56.49","13.4","11.1","11.61","13.3","46","7.25","20.08615384615385","136","21.22","0","0.43","0","1","5","21","0","34","6","0","0","2","42","31","0","2","0","0","4","3","5","1","0","3","7","0","5","10","11","11","1","5","0","0","0","0"

READ STORY HERE: Lil Wayne Says “I F**ked Chris Bosh’s Wife [VIDEO]

The wife of the NBA baller took the high road via twitter today after the Young Money CEO said he “f*cked Chris Bosh wife.”

She started it off with a series of retweets which read:

“Truth prevails. Today stand in your truth and ignore the chatter around and about you. #myhighestself #TodayICan #chakrawisdom. Some people create hate for profit, and some people create love for free. Pay no mind to the haters, embrace the love. #TodayICan ignore those who live in hate for their own ego, and keep my eyes on pure love. They will never bring me down.

Mrs. Bosh then continued to kill him with kindness by telling Wayne ‘what goes around comes around.’ She even tweeted a picture to let Weezy know karma is real.

Partners In Crime?

Jay Z may have once schooled his fans on the “A’s, B’s and Kilos of Coke” — but the admitted ex D-boy now seems to be looking to create rules over what’s published to the internet.

“We need to write the new rules.” ~Jay Z

During last night’s fifth game of the NBA finals, the “Magna Carta Holy Grail” rapper appeared to have taken a play straight out of the PR bible — using the half-time break to debut as the face of Samsung, while letting his internet plans be known. We’re talking about the same internet the business mogul remains using to cash-in.

“We don’t have any rules, everyone is trying to figure it out. That’s why the internet is like the wild wild west.” ~Jay Z Uh oh looks like a takeover….



Here’s what The Wall Street Journal is reporting:

“The connection: Samsung has purchased 1 million copies of Jay-Z’s coming album, entitled ‘Magna Carta Holy Grail,’ slated for release July 4, and plans to give them to Samsung Galaxy smartphone users for free – 72 hours ahead of the release. The users are to receive the music through an app they’ll receive later this month. (Recipients won’t be able to share it until the official release date.) Samsung paid $5 apiece for the albums, according to a person familiar with the matter. It wasn’t immediately clear if Nielsen SoundScan will count Samsung’s purchases in its sales tallies.”

Was the estranged eldest daughter of Samsung’s chairman, Lee Kun-hee, busted with $500,000 worth of marijuana — about five-years after her younger sister committed suicide? Of course. Just ask Lee Myung-Hee.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/","NRA President Jim Porter: “It’s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again”","It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.

“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”

When asked to clarify Porter said,

“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”

Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”

It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/wesley-snipes-released-from-prison/","Wesley Snipes Released From Prison!","Wesley Snipes Out Of Prison!

Actor Wesley Snipes has reportedly been released from prison since April 2nd…..just in time for tax season!

He will be on house arrest until April 19th.

Story Below:

Wesley Snipes is a free man… mostly. TMZ is reporting that the 50-year-old film actor has been released from prison. According to the popular site, Snipes was released on April 2 and transferred to the New York Community Corrections Office. He will be on house arrest thereafter until July 19.

If my math is correct, that means that Snipes served 845 days (remember 2012 was a leap year) of his three-year sentence. He was originally slated to be released on July 19, 2013, which means he served nearly 90% of his sentence (I’m going to assume some credit for time served and good behavior).

The Wesley Snipes saga began in 2006 when he was accused of tax fraud. He was originally indicted on charges of attempting to claim nearly $12 million in fraudulent tax refunds and not filing any tax returns for several years. Snipes’ first attorney, Billy Martin, said in a statement at the time, “We believe the evidence in the case will show he has been the victim of unscrupulous tax advice. And this trial will help vindicate him.”

The matter did go to trial in 2008. Despite a lengthy list of potential witnesses, and claims that the defense to the trial could take up to a month, the Snipes defense team rested – after less than an hour – without offering any witnesses. The defense felt pretty confident that the government had not proved its burden, saying: “We could have put on a big show, but we don’t do that. We’re not going to waste the jury’s time.” In contrast, the week before, IRS agent Steward Stich testified that Snipes earned almost $40 million in the years 1999 through 2004 and failed to file tax returns or pay any taxes on that income. He also alleged that Snipes also tried to have almost $12 million in taxes paid in prior years 1996 and 1997 refunded to him.

Snipes pleaded not guilty on all counts. He was eventually acquitted of felony federal tax fraud and conspiracy charges. Snipes was, however, convicted of failing to file tax returns from 1999 to 2004, which were misdemeanor charges. He faced up to three years in prison for the failure to file and he received the maximum sentence.

Snipes’ co-defendants and financial/tax “advisors”, Eddie Ray Kahn and Douglas P. Rosile, were convicted by the same jury of tax fraud and conspiracy. Kahn, a former CPA who is no longer allowed to practice in Florida and Ohio, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and Rosile was sentenced to four and half years in prison.

After his conviction, Snipes immediately promised an appeal, which he delivered (more than once) claiming, among other pleadings and filings that his sentence was unreasonable, that his defense was lacking and that he was not able to get a fair trial in “racist” Ocala, Florida, which Snipes had previously referred to as a “hotbed of KKK activity.” He was originally slated to report to prison on June 3, 2008, but that was delayed, pending the outcome of the appeal. His request for a new trial was denied on November 19, 2010, and he subsequently reported to prison on December 9, 2010, at McKean Federal Correctional Institution, in northwest Pennsylvania.

That wasn’t the last of Snipes’ arguments, however. While serving time, Snipes appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 6, 2011, Snipes’ petition for certiorari was denied, which means that the Supreme Court declined to hear the matter. With that, the appeals officially came to an end. Snipes remained in custody until this week.

It’s worth noting that, at the time of the initial allegations, Snipes was filming a movie, “Gallowwalkers” in Namibia. The film, summarized as “[a] cursed gunman (Snipes) whose victims come back from the dead recruits a young warrior to help in the fight against a gang of zombies” was released in the U.K. in 2012 and is scheduled to be released in the U.S. in 2013. No actual release date has been noted (IMDB just says “2013″) and the website for the film remains a blank screen. Likewise, the link to the trailer now says “this video does not exist.” A movie poster was released just last month (you can see it here). Speculation had been building that the release of the film might just coincide with Snipes’ release. I guess now we’ll see.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/states-outlaw-videotaping-of-animal-cruelty/","States Outlaw Videotaping of Animal Cruelty","What kind of society passes laws like these? Well about 12 states in the US, for a start. Richard A. Oppel, Jr. reports for the New York Times:

On one covert video, farm workers illegally burn the ankles of Tennessee walking horses with chemicals. Another captures workers in Wyoming punching and kicking pigs and flinging piglets into the air. And at one of the country’s largest egg suppliers, a video shows hens caged alongside rotting bird corpses, while workers burn and snap off the beaks of young chicks.

Each video — all shot in the last two years by undercover animal rights activists — drew a swift response: Federal prosecutors in Tennessee charged the horse trainer and other workers, who have pleaded guilty, with violating the Horse Protection Act. Local authorities in Wyoming charged nine farm employees with cruelty to animals. And the egg supplier, which operates in Iowa and other states, lost one of its biggest customers, McDonald’s, which said the video played a part in its decision.

But a dozen or so state legislatures have had a different reaction: They proposed or enacted bills that would make it illegal to covertly videotape livestock farms, or apply for a job at one without disclosing ties to animal rights groups. They have also drafted measures to require such videos to be given to the authorities almost immediately, which activists say would thwart any meaningful undercover investigation of large factory farms.

Critics call them “Ag-Gag” bills.

Some of the legislation appears inspired by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a business advocacy group with hundreds of state representatives from farm states as members. The group creates model bills, drafted by lobbyists and lawmakers, that in the past have included such things as “stand your ground” gun laws and tighter voter identification rules.

One of the group’s model bills, “The Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act,” prohibits filming or taking pictures on livestock farms to “defame the facility or its owner.” Violators would be placed on a “terrorist registry.”…","2013-04-08 00:00:00","0","32.0","27.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","79.0","50.0","0.0","169.0","4.0","23.0","6","333","96.10","61.82","11.56","13.56","19.59","29.73","72.07","39.04","6.31","1.50","0.00","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.90","4.80","8.71","13.81","3.00","2.40","6.31","0.30","7.21","3.00","2.10","1.50","3.00","3.00","3.30","1.20","2.10","0.90","0.90","0.30","5.71","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","8.71","1.50","1.50","0.90","3.00","0.30","3.00","4.20","2.70","0.60","0.90","1.20","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.60","8.41","1.80","2.40","5.41","0.30","0.30","2.40","3.30","0.00","10.21","0.60","6.91","2.70","5.11","2.40","0.00","2.40","0.00","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","15.92","5.11","5.41","0.90","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.30","3.00","0.90","0.00","0.00","1681","8.98","24.071428571428573","517","335","15","57.3","13.5","10.8","13.29","14.3","90","7.333333333333334","21.666268656716422","217","22.36","2","0.37","0","16","8","34","0","41","17","1","2","3","50","30","1","53","0","0","4","4","7","0","0","0","7","0","9","12","7","8","10","6","5","2","0","0"

RELATED: ARE WE BEING LIED 2?? WERE THERE 3 SHOOTERS IN THE SANDY HOOK MASSACRE??(VIDEO)

The net is flooding with conspiracy theory about this shooting. Most of them are total bunk. However there are major issues with the initial, and evolved reports; and indeed something is not passing the sniff test for me either.



We are going to thin it down to the pertinent ones; can you think of any to add to the list? Starting with…. why the pictures of a 20 year old shooter as a child? Where’s the recent pics?

1.) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was found with his older brother’s ID, and it was not stolen. However, older brother Ryan–who officials say is very cooperative–claims not to have even seen his brother since 2010. Where would Adam get this ID?

2.) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was wearing a black outfit with a mask and bulletproof vest. Why would he want to hide his identity, and why would he wear a bulletproof vest, if he planned to kill himself?

3.) Where did he get the bulletproof vest? Guns stolen from Mom – vest too? If so, why did she need one?

4.) The medical examiner asserts that all wounds were caused by a rifle or other long weapon, and police/FBI say that the school was littered with .223 (rifle) casings. But Adam Lanza was found dead in the school with only handguns. The police stated a rifle (long gun) was found in the trunk of his car. But now claim that’s the murder weapon?

4-b) What did he kill himself with? Kinda hard to use a .223 long gun.

5.) According to the official story, the killing was tightly confined to two classrooms, near the front door and office. So why were so many children told to close their eyes while leaving the building through other exits where nothing was even close?

5-b) Why were the kids in the Gym told to cover their eyes exiting the back of the building?

6.) Why were there such persistent reports that Mrs. Lanza was a kindergarten teacher, and that she died at the school, when the new official story is that she was not connected to the school and was killed at home?

7.) What happened to the report that Adam Lanza’s girlfriend and another friend were missing in New Jersey?

8.) What happened to the woodsman in a black jacket and camo pants who was arrested and handcuffed outside the school? Seen in overhead helicopter media reporting. He actually shouted to parents, “It wasn’t me.” Who was he and what was he doing there?

9.) The official story is that Nancy Lanza was a gun collector who obeyed the law. It appears she was diligent in her firearm responsibility. But since 20-year-olds are not permitted to buy guns or ammo or carry guns in Connecticut, why would she give her “autistic” son easy access to both guns and ammo?

Last night it also emerged Nancy was a member of the Doomsday Preppers movement, which believes people should prepare for end of the world. Her former sister-in-law Marsha said she had turned her home ‘into a fortress’. She added: ‘Nancy had a survivalist philosophy which is why she was stockpiling guns. She had them for defense. ‘She was stockpiling food. She grew up on a farm in New Hampshire. She was skilled with guns. We talked about preppers and preparing for the economy collapsing.’

9-b) The baby sitter for Adam (when he was 10) said mom was insistent he never be left alone for a second – even in the bathroom. But yet mom never secured the weapons?

9-c) How come in such a “small town” we have not heard about Adam Lanza’s primary care physician? Psychiatrist? Psychologist?

10) Would real parents of real children aged 6-7 really be satisfied with pictures of their children? Wouldn’t they demand to see their children one last time firsthand?

10-a) Not even one parent, just one, wanted to see their child?

11) According to the official story, 28 people died only 1 was wounded. The dead included 20 small, squirmy children — difficult targets even for professionals. How could Adam Lanza achieve such amazingly deadly accuracy, in such a short length of recorded time?

12) When Ryan Lanza was falsely identified as the shooter, who deleted his Facebook profile? How did it reappear when he was in custody?

Ryan, 24, who was originally thought to have been the shooter, was being questioned by police after he was arrested at his home in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was on a bus on his way home from work when he was being named as the gunman and posted on Facebook that it wasn’t him. Ryan Lanza had been extremely cooperative and was not under arrest or in custody by Saturday morning, but investigators were still searching his computers and phone records. He told law enforcement he had not been in touch with his brother since about 2010.

13) Why did the police say on Friday that they were going to leave the bodies in the school until Sunday, then Saturday morning announce that they had spirited the bodies away in the middle of the night? Perhaps to ensure that the transport, if any, would go unrecorded on photos or video?

14.) With a bazillion media there, staked out anyway, how did they pull off the body transport without even a single highpower telephoto lens photo? You know some media would have staked out the morgue too?

15) Did the school have one or more security cameras CCTV? You would think with a “buzz-in” entry system they would have at least one camera on the door, no?

16 ) Why is Adam Lanza reported to be a loner when a teenager said (oxymoronically), “[Lanza and his friends] always gathered alone in a corner in school”?

‘Everyone just assumed he was a smart kid and that’s why he didn’t like talking to people all the time,’ Peter Lalli, 20, who graduated with Lanza in 2010, told the New York Daily News. ‘He hung out with the smart crowd.’

17) Why did police assign an individual state trooper to every grieving family? Has this ever been done before? Media concern?

18) Why are Ryan Lanza and his roommates still in custody, and why are the police pretending that it’s for their own benefit?

19) Is it a coincidence that Nancy Lanza’s brother is Kingston Police Officer James Champion, who lives next door to the former Lanza home?

20) What “exactly” did Nancy Lanza do for a living? Retired or not, how come not a single current or former co-worker is in the media talking about her?

21) Why would Nancy Lanza own a Bullet Proof vest? The media is framing her numerous gun collection as her being a possible ”prepper”, where’s the evidence of that?

22) Dad is a VP of GE Global Financial? And a witness in the LIBOR financial scandal? That deserves a looksee.

23) When was the last time you saw an M.E. give a presser in a labcoat?","2013-01-13 00:00:00","0","67.0","27.0","3.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","50.0","0.0","169.0","7.0","23.0","6","1202","68.56","78.05","6.30","18.42","13.07","17.64","79.70","50.67","10.48","6.41","0.33","0.33","0.33","4.33","1.08","4.08","8.65","11.48","9.82","6.57","5.32","1.66","15.56","3.24","1.41","3.99","4.58","1.50","2.33","0.92","1.41","0.00","0.75","0.50","12.23","1.41","0.33","1.91","3.33","10.15","1.25","2.33","1.58","1.91","1.25","3.16","2.58","1.41","0.75","0.33","1.16","0.58","0.50","0.00","0.08","6.91","2.08","0.67","3.16","0.58","0.58","8.15","5.41","0.42","12.98","1.33","6.66","5.07","3.66","0.58","0.92","0.42","0.17","1.00","0.50","0.00","0.33","0.08","0.00","0.08","19.47","3.99","3.49","0.17","0.17","4.16","0.00","1.00","1.58","1.50","3.16","0.25","5187","7.29","13.522222222222222","1620","1190","82","73.68","9.2","6.6","8.92","7.6","221","4.388888888888889","15.228571428571428","544","12.59","23","0.48","0","36","52","116","0","125","80","3","4","12","179","109","1","52","2","0","59","23","57","0","0","6","30","0","34","88","29","34","17","22","3","12","0","30"

While it’s now confirmed that Clive is too far gone to be called bi-curious, what we’re curious about is who among his crew were most likely to be covering up for Clive.

Scroll Down for the most likely suspects…

Diddy

Diddy is pretty famous for his freaky ways and it’s long been implied that he’s batted for both teams. Clive’s coming out only sheds more suspicion on the Bad Boy because it’s public knowledge that Diddy borrowed millions from Clive when the label was in trouble and at one point Clive’s Arista label actually owned a 50% stake of Bad Boy. Coincidence? We think not.

Christina Aguilera

Xtina has always been known for letting her freak flag fly freely, and no wonder she’s felt so comfortable, with Clive playing a large role in her career, even to this day.

Andre Harrell

How many execs do you know take such a STRONG interest in their unpaid INTERN that they bring them on as an A&R? Not many. But it’s not just his shady relationship with Diddy that puts Harrell under the microscope. It also doesn’t help that he may be the only man on this list with a private life more private than Clive’s.

Mayor ‘Redskins’ Is RACIST … It’s Time for a Change!","It’s damn time the Washington Redskins changed its racist name … at least if the team ever plans to move inside D.C. city limits — so says District mayor Vincent Gray.

Now that the Redskins are winning again, there’s been a lot of talk about bringing the team back to D.C. — instead of leaving them in nearby FedEx Field, located in Maryland.

RELATED: Racism In Sports: Should The “Washington Redskins” Change There Disrespectful Racist Name??

But Mayor Gray has some conditions before the Redskins move a muscle — claiming, “I think that if they get serious with the team coming back to Washington, there’s no doubt there’s going to have to be a discussion about [changing the team name].”

Gray added, “I think it has become a lightning rod, and I would love to be able to sit down with the team … and see if a change should be made. There’s a precedent for this, and I think there needs to be a dispassionate discussion about this, and do the right thing.”

FYI — the federal government controls the land where a new Redskins stadium would be built in D.C. … so it does have some say.

There’s no question, the term “redskins” is flat-out racist … but we still gotta ask …#LOZR

The former wife of a man reported to have treated K Michelle like a common whore is speaking out! According to the woman, the one time Love & Hip Hop cast member accepted $60-bucks and a fast food meal, in return for her oral sex delivery. That’s before we’re told K Michelle was sent on her way, dropped off at a Chicago train station.

The source says the incident went down about seven-years ago, just before K Michelle first landed a ticket into the studio with R Kelly – who our source says was close to the couple.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/this-is-how-mass-media-manipulates-public-opinion/","This Is How Mass Media Manipulates Public Opinion","Exposing the bias inherent in all media is always a priority for disinformation editors, so we really enjoyed this roundup of examples of media manipulation by Fred Burks at Examiner.com :

“Media manipulation currently shapes everything you read, hear and watch online. Everything.”

– Forbes magazine article on mass media influence, 7/16/2012

The influence of the mass media on public perception is widely acknowledged, yet few know the incredible degree to which this occurs. Key excerpts from the rare, revealing mass media news articles below show how blatantly the media sometimes distort critical facts, omit vital stories, and work hand in hand with the military-industrial complex to keep their secrets safe and promote greedy and manipulative corporate agendas.

Once acclaimed as the watchdog of democracy and the political process, these riveting articles clearly show that the major media can no longer be trusted to side with the people over business and military interests. For ideas on how you can further educate yourself and what you can do to change all this, see the “What you can do” section below the article summaries. Together, we can make a difference.

U.S. Suppressed Footage of Hiroshima for Decades

2005-08-03, New York Times/Reuters

In the weeks following the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, U.S. authorities seized and suppressed film shot in the bombed cities by U.S. military crews and Japanese newsreel teams to prevent Americans from seeing the full extent of devastation wrought by the new weapons. It remained hidden until the early 1980s and has never been fully aired. “Although there are clearly huge differences with Iraq, there are also some similarities,” said Mitchell, co-author of “Hiroshima in America” and editor of Editor & Publisher. “The chief similarity is that Americans are still being kept at a distance from images of death, whether of their own soldiers or Iraqi civilians.” The Los Angeles Times released a survey of six months of media coverage of the Iraq war in six prominent U.S. newspapers and two news magazines — a period during which 559 coalition forces, the vast majority American, were killed. It found they had run almost no photographs of Americans killed in action. “So much of the media is owned by big corporations and they would much rather focus on making money than setting themselves up for criticism from the White House and Congress,” said Ralph Begleiter, a former CNN correspondent. In 1945, U.S. policymakers wanted to be able to continue to develop and test atomic and eventually nuclear weapons without an outcry of public opinion. “They succeeded but the subject is still a raw nerve.”

“I started with a box Chevy / then I got a blue Lexus,” the Maybach Music mogul raps on “Box Chevy,” a track that aims its automotive boasts squarely at his critics.

The hard-hitting lead single is the first from “Mastermind,” Ross’ follow-up to last year’s “God Forgives, I Don’t,” a quick turnaround given his previous effort’s July release. “God Forgives, I Don’t” bowed at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2012, his fourth chart-topping set and his best debut week yet with 218,000 copies sold.

You may recall that it came out last year that the New Zealand equivalent of the NSA, the GCSB, illegally spied on Kim Dotcom (oh, and dozens of others), possibly with the help of the NSA, despite not being allowed to spy on those in New Zealand.An investigation by the police has agreed that the GCSB clearly broke the law… but the police have said that they don’t plan to prosecute the spy agency . Because, you know, that might hold them accountable. Now, at least, the GCSB knows that it can abuse the law at will with no punishment.

Instead, it appears that the excuse being used by the police is the same one we’ve been hearing from NSA defenders: because these abuses weren’t intentional, they can be ignored:

Today, Detective Superintendent Peter Read told a media conference that in spite of the GCSB committing one breach under the provisions of the Crimes Act, no criminal “intent” by the GCSB could be established.

I’m not sure that actually makes sense. Yes, when it comes to criminal activity, intent can be important in determining if it’s actually criminal, but there’s little doubt that the GCSB intentionally spied on Dotcom. It wouldn’t have taken very much at all to recognize that Dotcom was a resident of New Zealand who GCSB is forbidden from surveilling. So it seems like the intent was pretty clear.","2013-09-03 12:20:28","0","6.0","3.0","3.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","15.0","10.0","0.0","15.0","0.0","0.0","0","251","71.97","40.56","25.94","4.99","31.38","17.13","85.26","53.39","12.75","2.79","0.40","0.40","0.80","0.00","1.20","9.96","9.56","13.15","11.55","3.98","3.59","3.19","17.13","3.19","1.59","0.80","1.20","1.20","5.18","1.59","3.59","0.40","1.59","0.40","5.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.93","3.19","3.98","1.20","3.59","1.99","5.18","1.99","0.80","0.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.97","0.80","0.40","5.98","0.40","0.80","4.78","10.36","1.99","9.56","1.20","5.18","3.19","5.98","0.00","0.40","0.80","0.00","0.00","2.39","0.00","1.59","0.40","0.40","0.00","16.33","3.98","6.77","0.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.80","3.19","0.80","0.00","1137","8.3","32.375","362","250","9","60.18","13.4","11.8","10.51","14.8","52","17.333333333333332","21.44","161","27.12","12","0.51","0","4","2","30","0","42","14","0","1","7","25","37","0","7","0","0","15","0","13","0","0","1","5","1","10","9","8","8","7","10","0","1","0","1"

This wide ranging talk under scores how government and the rule of law is systematically abused by a few.

Constructive and creative ways are highlighted for living and nurturing the 9/11 Truth movement and the very many other all inter-related movements a foot across the planet. Main stream media at one time had a mass audience of over 70 million people each night which was used along with major universities to dominate what the American and world public. thought. Today that nightly number is under 7 million. The internet allows everyone to find out about much of what is actually happening.

Only a certain few buildings were evacuated during 9/11. Buildings near by were not evacuated. Many other discrepancies are covered showing this kind of decision making has been going in high places since the country was founded. Some people are well aware of this. Too many people think it could not happen to them and look the other way. September 11 was another wake up call that it can happen to anyone.

It is imperative the internet is used to get beyond the usual choir so that everyday people can see for themselves what is actually going on.

October 13, 2013 Ex-UN, WHO officials reveal political interference to suppress scientific evidence of postwar environmental health catastrophe Last month, the World Health Organisation (WHO) published a long awaited document summarising the findings of an in-depth investigation into the prevalence of congenital birth defects (CBD) in Iraq, which many experts believe is linked to the use of depleted uranium (DU) munitions by Allied forces. According to the ‘summary report’: “The rates for spontaneous abortion, stillbirths and congenital birth defects found in the study are consistent with or even lower than international estimates. The study provides no clear evidence to suggest an unusually high rate of congenital birth defects in Iraq.” Jaffar Hussain, WHO’s Head of Mission in Iraq, said that the report is based on survey techniques that are “renowned worldwide” and that the study was peer reviewed “extensively” by international experts. Backtrack But the conclusions contrasted dramatically from previous statements about the research findings from Iraqi Ministry of Health (MOH) officials involved in the study. Earlier this year, BBC News spoke to MOH researchers who confirmed the joint report would furnish “damning evidence” that rates of birth defects are higher in areas experiencing heavy fighting in the 2003 war. In an early press release, WHO similarly acknowledged “existing MOH statistics showing high number of CBD cases” in the “high risk” areas selected for study. The publication of this ‘summary document’ on the World Health Organisation’s website has raised questions from independent experts and former United Nations and WHO officials, who question the validity of its findings and its anonymous authorship. They highlight the existence of abundant research demonstrating not only significant rates of congenital birth defects in many areas of Iraq, but also a plausible link to the impact of depleted uranium. For years, medical doctors in Iraq have reported “a high level of birth defects.” Other peer-reviewed studies have documented a dramatic increase in infant mortality, cancer and leukaemia in the aftermath of US military bombardment. In Fallujah, doctors are witnessing a “massive unprecedented number” of heart defects, and an increase in the number of nervous system defects. Analysis of pre-2003 data compared to now showed that “the rate of congenital heart defects was 95 per 1,000 births – 13 times the rate found in Europe.” The purpose of the WHO study was to probe the data further, but some say the project is deeply flawed. Politicised science Dr. Keith Bavistock of the Department of Environmental Science, University of Eastern Finland, is a retired 13-year WHO expert on radiation and health. He told me that the new ‘summary document’ was at best “disappointing.” He condemned the decision from “the very outset to preclude the possibility of looking at the extent to which the increase of birth defects is linked to the use of depleted uranium”, and further slammed the document’s lack of scientific credibility. “This document is not of scientific quality. It wouldn’t pass peer review in one of the worst journals. One of the biggest methodological problems, among many, is that the document does not even attempt to look at existing medical records in Iraqi hospitals – these are proper clinical records which document the diagnoses of the relevant cases being actually discovered by Iraqi doctors. These medics collecting clinical records are reporting higher birth defects than the study acknowledges. Instead, the document focuses on interviews with mothers as a basis for diagnosis, many of whom are traumatised in this environment, their memories unreliable, and are not qualified to make diagnosis.” I asked Dr. Baverstock if, given the document’s avoidance of analysing the key evidence – clinical records compiled by Iraqi medics – there was reason to believe the research findings were compromised under political pressure. He said: “The way this document has been produced is extremely suspicious. There are question marks about the role of the US and UK, who have a conflict of interest in this sort of study due to compensation issues that might arise from findings determining a link between higher birth defects and DU. I can say that the US and UK have been very reluctant to disclose the locations of DU deployment, which might throw further light on this correlation.” If so, it would not be the first time the WHO had reportedly quashed research on DU potentially embarrassing for the Allies. In 2001, Baverstock was on the editorial board for a WHO research project clearing the US and UK of responsibility for environmental health hazards involved in DU deployment. His detailed editorial recommendations accounting for new research proving uranium’s nature as as a genotoxin (capable of changing DNA) were ignored and overruled: “My editorial changes were suppressed, even though some of the research was from Department of Defense studies looking at subjects who had ingested DU from friendly fire, clearly proving that DU was genutoxic.” Baverstock then co-authored his own scientific paper on the subject arguing for plausibility of the link between DU and high rates of birth defects in Iraq, but said that WHO blocked publication of the study “because they didn’t like its conclusions.” “The extent to which scientific principles are being bent to fit politically convenient conclusions is alarming”, said Baverstock. Environmental contamination from the Iraq War Other independent experts have also weighed in criticising the WHO study. The British medical journal, The Lancet, reports that despite the study’s claims, a “scientific standard of peer review… may not have been fully achieved.” One scientist named as a peer-reviewer for the project, Simon Cousens, professor of epidemiology and statistics at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), told The Lancet that he “attended a relatively brief meeting of around one and a half hours, so just gave some comments on an early presentation of the results. I wouldn’t classify that as thorough peer review.” Just how distant the new WHO-sponsored study is from the last decade’s scientific literature is clear from a new report released earlier this year by a Tokyo-based NGO, Human Rights Now (HRN), which conducted a review of the existing literature as well as a fact-finding mission to Fallujah. The HRN report investigated recorded birth defects at a major hospital in Fallujah for the year 2012, confirmed first hand birth defect incidences over a one-month period in 2013, and interviewed doctors and parents of children born with birth defects. The report concluded there was: “… an extraordinary situation of congenital birth defects in both nature and quantity. The investigation demonstrated a significant rise of these health consequences in the period following the war… An overview of scientific literature relating to the effects of uranium and heavy metals associated with munitions used in the 2003 Iraq War and occupation, together with potential exposure pathways, strongly suggest that environmental contamination resulting from combat during the Iraq War may be playing a significant role in the observed rate of birth defects.” The report criticised both the UN and the WHO for approaches that are “insufficient to meet the needs of the issues within their mandate.” Definitive evidence According to Hans von Sponeck, former UN assistant secretary general and UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, the gap between previous claims made by MOH researchers about the study, and the new ‘summary document’, justified public scepticism. “The brevity of this report is unacceptable”, he told me: “Everybody was expecting a proper, professional scientific paper, with properly scrutinised and checkable empirical data. Although I would be guarded about jumping to conclusions, WHO cannot be surprised if people ask questions about whether the body is giving into bilateral political pressures.” Von Sponeck said that US political pressure on WHO had scuppered previous investigations into the impact of DU on Iraq: “I served in Baghdad and was confronted with the reality of the environmental impact of DU. In 2001, I saw in Geneva how a WHO mission to conduct on-spot assessments in Basra and southern Iraq, where depleted uranium had led to devastating environmental health problems, was aborted under US political pressure.” I asked him if such political pressure on the UN body could explain the unscientific nature of the latest report. “It would not be surprising if such US pressure has continued”, he said: “There is definitive evidence of an alarming rise in birth defects, leukaemia, cancer and other carcinogenic diseases in Iraq after the war. Looking at the stark difference between previous descriptions of the WHO study’s findings and this new report, it seems that someone, somewhere clumsily decided that they would not release these damning findings, but instead obscure them.” The International Coalition to Ban Depleted Uranium (ICBUW) has called for WHO to release the project’s data-set so that it can be subjected to independent, transparent analysis. The UN body continues to ignore these calls and defend the integrity of the research.","2013-10-14 10:00:20","0","9.0","3.0","3.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","14.0","10.0","6.0","15.0","0.0","0.0","1","1471","95.77","62.29","34.61","1.00","29.42","33.24","77.97","43.78","7.48","2.18","0.68","0.48","0.00","0.61","0.41","5.23","9.59","15.02","5.57","2.72","4.28","0.88","9.18","3.94","1.90","2.24","1.50","0.61","4.83","0.61","4.15","0.95","0.95","0.20","6.66","0.14","0.07","0.07","0.61","10.27","4.01","1.77","1.22","1.70","0.68","2.31","1.77","0.75","0.61","0.34","2.65","0.48","2.11","0.07","0.14","5.85","0.88","0.54","3.47","0.20","1.09","4.01","4.55","0.54","13.46","1.02","8.29","4.35","7.27","0.20","0.00","0.41","0.07","0.48","0.27","0.14","0.00","0.00","0.07","0.00","15.50","3.74","4.49","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.88","3.67","1.16","1.09","0.00","7646","9.12","42.371428571428574","2454","1462","52","34.49","16.2","15.4","14.28","18.0","379","17.833333333333332","23.60935704514364","611","35.94","64","0.42","0","39","19","162","1","219","151","4","3","12","238","140","3","113","0","0","25","7","45","3","1","1","29","0","31","58","41","53","31","31","9","7","0","3"

It is time to crank up the Looney Tunes theme song because Wall Street has officially entered crazytown territory. Stocks just keep going higher and higher, and at this point what is happening in the stock market does not bear any resemblance to what is going on in the overall economy whatsoever. So how long can this irrational state of affairs possibly continue? Stocks seem to go up no matter what happens. If there is good news, stocks go up. If there is bad news, stocks go up. If there is no news, stocks go up. On Thursday, the day after Christmas, the Dow was up another 122 points to another new all-time record high. In fact, the Dow has had an astonishing 50 record high closes this year. This reminds me of the kind of euphoria that we witnessed during the peak of the housing bubble. At the time, housing prices just kept going higher and higher and everyone rushed to buy before they were “priced out of the market”. But we all know how that ended, and this stock market bubble is headed for a similar ending.

It is almost as if Wall Street has not learned any lessons from the last two major stock market crashes at all. Just look at Twitter. At the current price, Twitter is supposedly worth 40.7 BILLION dollars. But Twitter is not profitable. It is a seven-year-old company that has never made asingle dollar of profit.

Not one single dollar.

In fact, Twitter actually lost 64.6 million dollars last quarter alone. And Twitter is expected to continue losing money for all of 2015 as well.

But Twitter stock is up 82 percent over the last 30 days, and nobody can really give a rational reason for why this is happening.

Overall, the Dow is up more than 25 percent so far this year. Unless something really weird happens over the next few days, it will be the best year for the Dow since 1996.

It has been a wonderful run for Wall Street. Unfortunately, there are a whole host of signs that we have entered very dangerous territory.

The median price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 has reached an all-time record high, and margin debt at the New York Stock Exchange has reached a level that we have never seen before. In other words, stocks are massively overpriced and people have been borrowing huge amounts of money to buy stocks. These are behaviors that we also saw just before the last two stock market bubbles burst.

And of course the most troubling sign is that even as the stock market soars to unprecedented heights, the state of the overall U.S. economy is actually getting worse…

-During the last full week before Christmas, U.S. store visits were 21 percent lower than a year earlier and retail sales were 3.1 percentlower than a year earlier.

-The number of mortgage applications just hit a new 13 year low.

-The yield on 10 year U.S. Treasuries just hit 3 percent.

For many more signs like this, please see my previous article entitled “37 Reasons Why ‘The Economic Recovery Of 2013′ Is A Giant Lie“.

And most Americans don’t realize this, but the U.S. financial system and the overall U.S. economy are now in much weaker condition than they were the last time we had a major financial crash back in 2008. Employment is at a much lower level than it was back then and our banking system is much more vulnerable than it was back then. Just before the last financial crash, the U.S. national debt was sitting at about 10 trillion dollars, but today it has risen to more than 17.2 trillion dollars. The following excerpt from a recent article posted on thedailycrux.com contains even more facts and figures which show how our “balance sheet numbers” continue to get even worse…

Since the fourth quarter of 2009, the U.S. current account deficit has been more than $100 billion per quarter. As a result, foreigners now own $4.2 trillion more U.S. investment assets than we own abroad. That’s $1.7 trillion more than when Buffett first warned about this huge problem in 2003. Said another way, the problem is 68% bigger now. And here’s a number no one else will tell you – not even Buffett. Foreigners now own $25 trillion in U.S. assets. And yet… we continue to consume far more than we produce, and we borrow massively to finance our deficits. Since 2007, the total government debt in the U.S. (federal, state, and local) has doubled from around $10 trillion to $20 trillion. Meanwhile, the size of Fannie and Freddie’s mortgage book declined slightly since 2007, falling from $4.9 trillion to $4.6 trillion. That’s some good news, right? Nope. The excesses just moved to a new agency. The “other” federal mortgage bank, the Federal Housing Administration, now is originating 20% of all mortgages in the U.S., up from less than 5% in 2007. Student debt, also spurred on by government guarantees, has also boomed, doubling since 2007 to more than $1 trillion. Altogether, total debt in our economy has grown from around $50 trillion to more than $60 trillion since 2007.

So don’t be fooled by this irrational stock market bubble.

Just because a bunch of half-crazed investors are going into massive amounts of debt in a desperate attempt to make a quick buck does not mean that the overall economy is in good shape.

In fact, much of the country is in such rough shape that “reverse shopping” has become a huge trend. Even big corporations such as McDonald’s are urging their employees to return their Christmas gifts in order to bring in some much needed money…

In a stark reminder of how tough things still are for low-income families in America, McDonalds has advised workers to dig themselves “out of holiday debt” by cashing in their Christmas haul. “You may want to consider returning some of your unopened purchases that may not seem as appealing as they did,” said a website set up for employees. “Selling some of your unwanted possessions on eBay or Craigslist could bring in some quick cash.”

This irrational stock market bubble is not going to last for too much longer. And a lot of top financial experts are now warning their clients to prepare for the worst. For example, David John Marotta of Marotta Wealth Management recently told his clients that they should all have a“bug-out bag” that contains food, a gun and some ammunition…","2013-12-28 14:15:34","0","74.0","9.0","165.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","562.0","510.0","100.0","49.0","0.0","7.0","0","1105","86.91","52.17","65.80","9.21","18.73","20.72","83.71","45.70","7.06","2.71","0.18","1.27","0.36","0.09","0.81","4.34","6.97","14.84","7.51","5.52","4.98","1.54","12.22","7.69","5.52","1.00","6.33","4.98","3.44","1.00","2.35","0.45","0.00","0.63","4.25","0.09","0.00","0.00","0.09","10.95","1.18","1.99","1.09","2.71","1.63","3.62","1.00","0.45","0.45","0.09","0.18","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.09","8.33","1.90","0.63","4.34","0.81","1.18","3.17","9.23","1.18","19.64","2.26","9.68","7.96","5.97","1.00","0.72","6.97","0.36","0.00","0.63","0.00","0.54","0.00","0.09","0.00","16.83","7.60","4.07","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","1.09","1.72","0.63","0.18","1.36","4944","7.06","19.517241379310345","1517","1095","75","73.58","9.9","6.6","9.56","8.1","187","6.571428571428571","14.671050228310504","505","18.0","26","0.45","0","28","67","112","0","144","94","22","3","8","164","88","3","55","1","0","26","12","77","4","1","7","25","0","28","24","22","27","27","46","3","3","0","7"

"https://theinternetpost.net/2013/10/15/us-army-defines-christian-ministry-as-domestic-hate-group/","US Army defines Christian ministry as ‘domestic hate group’","US Army defines Christian ministry as ‘domestic hate group’

Several dozen U.S. Army active duty and reserve troops were told last week that the American Family Association , a well-respected Christian ministry, should be classified as a domestic hate group because the group advocates for traditional family values.

The briefing was held at Camp Shelby in Mississippi and listed the AFA alongside domestic hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, Neo-Nazis, the Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam.

A soldier who attended the briefing contacted me and sent me a photograph of a slide show presentation that listed AFA as a domestic hate group. Under the AFA headline is a photograph of Westboro Baptist Church preacher Fred Phelps holding a sign reading “No special law for f***.”

American Family Association has absolutely no affiliation with the controversial church group known for picketing the funerals of American servicemembers.

It looks like the Obama administration is separating the military from the American people.

“I had to show Americans what our soldiers are now being taught,” said the soldier who asked not to be identified. “I couldn’t just let this one pass.”

The soldier said a chaplain interrupted the briefing and challenged the instructor’s assertion that AFA is a hate group.

“The instructor said AFA could be considered a hate group because they don’t like gays,” the soldier told me. “The slide was talking about how AFA refers to gays as sinners and heathens and derogatory terms.”

The soldier, who is an evangelical Christian, said the chaplain defended the Christian ministry.

“He kept asking the instructor, ‘Are you sure about that, son? Are you sure about that?’” he said, recalling the back and forth.

Later in the briefing, the soldiers were reportedly told that they could face punishment for participating in organizations that are considered hate groups.

That considered, the soldier contacted me because he is a financial contributor to the AFA ministry.

“I donate to AFA as often as I can,” he said. “Am I going to be punished? I listen to American Family Radio all day. If they hear it on my radio, will I be faced with a Uniformed Code of Military Justice charge?”

The soldier said he was “completely taken back by this blatant attack not only on the AFA but Christians and our beliefs.”

It’s not the first time the Army has accused conservative Christian groups of being domestic hate groups.

Earlier this year, I exposed Army briefings that classified evangelical Christians and Catholics as examples of religious extremism.

Another briefing told officers to pay close attention to troops who supported groups like AFA and the Family Research Council.

One officer said the two Christian ministries did not “share our Army Values.”

“When we see behaviors that are inconsistent with Army Values – don’t just walk by – do the right thing and address the concern before it becomes a problem,” the officer wrote in an email to his subordinates.

At the time the military assured me those briefings were isolated incidents and did not reflect official Army policy.

If that’s true, how do they explain what happened at Camp Shelby?

I contacted the Pentagon for an answer but they referred me to Army public affairs. And so far – they haven’t returned my calls.

And their claim that the classifications are “isolated” is not washing with AFA.

“The American Family Association has received numerous accounts of military installations as well as law enforcement agencies using a list compiled by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which wrongfully identifies and defames AFA,” reads a statement they sent me.

Bryan Fischer hosts a talk show on American Family Radio. He called the Army’s allegations “libelous, slanderous and blatantly false.”

“This mischaracterization of AFA is reprehensible and inexcusable,” he told me. “We have many military members who are a part of the AFA network who know these accusations are a tissue of lies.”

Fischer said their views on gay marriage and homosexuality are not hate – it’s simply a disagreement.

“If our military wasn’t headed by a commander-in-chief who is hostile to Christian faith, these allegations would be laughed off every military base in the world,” he said.

Hiram Sasser, of the Liberty Institute, told me the Army’s briefing is a smear.

He recalled what President Obama said last year when Muslim extremists attacked our diplomatic outpost in Libya.

“Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths,” President Obama said. “We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others.”

Sasser said he wished the president and the Army would treat the American Family Association with the same deference and respect they show those who mean to harm us.

“Why must the Army under this administration continue to attack Americans of faith and smear them?” Sasser wondered.

I fear the answer to that question.

Because it appears the Obama administration is separating the military from the American people – and planting seeds of doubt about Christians and some of our nation’s most prominent Christian ministries.

Forensics of the Malala False Flag Operation

And they planned, and Allah planned; And Allah is the Best of Planners! (Holy Quran 8: 30)

Introduction

Some mysteries are never solved for the public, especially the intriguing thrillers presented in Pakistani politics! Whether it is the Osama Bin Laden fiasco or the Memo-Gate scandal or the latest ‘Malala myth’, the Pakistanis and the rest of the world are left guessing as to what really happened. They are only left to work it out using the ‘Cui Bono’ formula-meaning ‘who benefits’.

Forensic Medicine is a branch of medicine that involves the study and application of medical knowledge in the legal field. Because modern medicine is a legal creation and medico-legal cases involving death, rape, paternity etc. require a medical practitioner to produce evidence and appear as an expert witness, these two fields have traditionally been inter-dependent. We shall use forensic expertise to solve this mysterious case of ‘attempt to murder’.

Prelude to the Malala ‘Drama’

Emotions were running high and public opinion was changing rapidly against the American drone strikes in Pakistan after the Anti-Islamic film against the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and the successful Peach March against drones by PTI under the leadership of Imran Khan. America had to do something to stop this and do it fast!

Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) had blocked YouTube plus a thousand other websites that may leak sensitive information about the events to occur ahead.

The Pakistani patriots are sick of American drones blowing up their children while a study just came out exposing the fact that for every assumed “terrorists’ they kill, drones kill 40 or so innocent people. The attention of the world to the cruelties and barbaric bombardment of innocent civilians in FATA as revealed by the participation of 32 Americans and several British in the PTI march, its coverage by the BBC and the denunciation of drone attacks by the visiting Russian foreign minister, editorials against drone attacks in the Financial Times and other newspapers reveal the global attention that US crimes against the people of Pakistan were getting

The fake liberal fascists of the Pakistani media were also getting battered and bruised on social media by true patriots and were looking towards their masters for an answer!

The timing of the attack on Malala Yousafzai on October 9 just one day after the PTI march against drone attacks is most intriguing and thus, little innocent Malala’s attack could not have come at a better time for the American government and the fake liberals!

Background of Malala, her Father and the CIA

Malala was a SHY 11 year old girl, who is somehow suddenly transoformed into a publically fearless teenager who becomes an educational activist!

Malala’s father a businessman, who is a school owner and whose business had gone down after the trouble in Swat, was looking for more opportunities. Whether it was the father or her daughter or both who seemed extremely enthusiastic to restore female education (which is a very good thing) can be guessed.

The school OWNER’s business is about to be shut down and out of the blue his “obedient” daughter takes up his “personal crusade” to bring more for-profit schools to Pakistan (and thus increase his wealth). There must be a third hand involved and that is where the meeting of Malala & her family with US envoy late Richard Halbrooke in 2010 comes in!

Many suggest that Malala herself was there to meet and come up with a plan to help the Americans out. A journalist covering her story, Mr Adam, said to be a CIA agent, says she was there to plead with Holbrooke to help oust the Taliban from the district so her school could reopen. There may be a different theory. It wasn’t Malala meeting with Holbrooke, but her dedicated businessman father.

Now remember, in 2009, this little girl was just one of many who had a blog about what was happening in her country. But it’s hard to say if the blog was even hers since it was posted under a different name and the only real evidence of it resides at the globalist BBC blog page. But somehow little 11 year old Malala was catapulted to international attention by a documentary film, made by the CIA reporter Adam! The family, in collaberation with the CIA (in exchange for some good), made a documentary about the plight of schools and education in the terror-struck area of SWAT.

According to Adam, he started filming little Malala the day before her school was to be shut down by the Taliban (American Taliban) after meeting with the father and Malala 10 days prior to the shut down. What a coincidence. Seems like they had everything in place.

And so Malala would become the face of the for-profit global school system CIA wants to impose in many underdeveloped countries for its own political interests! Now, is that bravery or simple business? Doesn’t this tells us about the true nature of this whole drama?

Questioning of the Timing & the Perpretators of the Attack

Just two days after a protest against U.S. drone strikes killing innocent civilians in Pakistan, along comes the fake Taliban to claim credit for shooting little innocent Malala in cold blood. The fake Taliban spokesman in Pakistan, Ehsanullah Ehsan, took credit for the attack on the schoolgirl by a “phone call” claiming they did it because she liked Barack Obama and because she supported “Western Ideas”.

This by the way is the same fake Taliban spokesman who told the drone protesters to basically “f*ck off” after the protest was turned back. This is the same Ehsanullah Ehsan who took credit for a double bombing in 2011 claiming it was in response to the killing of bin Laden. That confession was also by phone from an “undisclosed location

And with them the whole fake liberal brigade, who had been severely wounded by the protests against anti-Islam film and the drones, and were looking for some opportunity for a strike back, came out with their weapons blazing!

Discrepancies in the Malala Hoax

Remember the different stories that were being related on the Mainstream Media (MSM) concerning the events of 9/11? For example, the live report on BBC of building 7 falling before it actually fell. This is one way in which God plans; He knows humans make mistakes, they are never perfect; that lies never have any feet. Soon after the stories became coming out on about the Malala drama, disprecancies were noted in the stories that were being related.

First there was report of a single bullet injury. A single bullet went from her forehead into her skull, then somehow manged to end up in her shoulder near her neck. They had to change the story of her being shot in the head AND the neck because even as they kept putting out pics of her with her neck covered up someone screwed up and published the photo which clearly shows she wasn’t shot in the neck.

There was also a two bullet report: “Malala was shot twiceonce in the head and once in the neck but HER WOUNDS WERE NOT LIFE-THREATENING”, according to Tariq Mohammad, a doctor at the main hospital in Mingora. But pictures show no wound on her neck.

Then pictures came out in the electronic media of a certain man and a smaller girl walking towards the helicopter that was ready to take Malala to a hospital in Peshawar. They do have a canny resemblance to Malala and her father. The question is: if they are not THEM according to liberals, then WHO ARE THEY? Could any TOM, DICK and HARRY get into that helicopter or even get the courage to do and WHY do so?

Then there is a picture of Malala with bandage on the RIGHT side of her forehead and another picture of Malala with a bandage on her LEFT. There is one picture of her on the stretcher with RED clothes and another with a BLUE dress. Now WE HAVE PICTURES OF HER RECOVERING IN A HOSPITAL IN UK WITH NO SCAR ON HER FOREHEAD OR ANY OTHER SIGN TO SHOW THAT SHE HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE FOREHEAD. SO NOT SHOT IN THE NECK, NOR IN THE FOREHEAD, WHERE WAS SHE SHOT?

Also, banners and posters printed in English, were ready in such a short time, within 24 hours in protest against the Malala attack and were displayed in protest demonstrations the next day. Were they prepared beforehand?

The Medical Miracle

This is the report by the operating surgeon in Pakistan: “The surgeon who operated on her said a high-velocity bullet, shot from close-range, damaged critical areas of her brain. It is not just Malala’s survival which is in question, but what kind of survival.” This report contradicts the report of the doctor mentioned above at the hospital at Mingora hospital. “It’s a miracle that the gunmen didn’t kill these girls, considering they were at close range.”

Is the main stream media trying to tell me that ‘the bullet that went into her skull from the front temple above her left eye, traveled through her head, down through her neck and lodged itself in her shoulder, that bullet, fired by an evil Taliban member, did absolutely no damage to her brain as it bounced around inside her head til it slipped down her neck and into her shoulder’!?

Then suddenly Malala undergoes miraculous surgery with no brain damage: “The medical tests done on Malala Yousafzai after a bullet was successfully removed from the gunshot victim have revealed that her brain had not sustained any damage”

Now the story from UK doctors is that the bullet grazed off her young skull at the left temple or just above it and it moved down her cheek area damaging her jawbone (or the connection of the jaw) then down the neck somehow passing the carotid artery without nicking it.

What Dr. Rosser at UK wants us to believe is that no other medical facility noticed the fact that she was having trouble breathing due to the fact that her airway was swollen by the passage of the bullet during that entire time. A swelling caused by a bullet wound is VERY MUCH OBVIOUS EVEN TO A LAYMAN. That is highly unlikely.

Furthermore, there is a photo of Malala that was taken while she was at one of the two military facilities, it clearly shows she has not had a tracheostomy at that point and there is no apparent swelling of either her face or her neck.

Malala has also now been given a tracheostomy because as Dr. Rosser says, “her airway was swollen by the passage of the bullet”. This does not conform to what we know about her previous treatments.

It is unlikely as well that a bullet passing her airways would cause swelling some 5-6 days after the contact, though certainly hospital malpractice could explain it, but aside from that, I don’t know what would delay a body’s reaction to a bullet in this way. But clearly, the swelling was not present when this photo was taken of Malala in the hospital some days after the event. No swelling and no tracheotomy.

Dr. Rosser then goes on to explain the path of the bullet which he claims entered her skin at the left temple and traveled under the skin but apparently above or outside the skull, down past the front of her ear to the jaw connection where it may or may not have damaged the bone, and then down her neck and ending up in her back near her spine.

I’m not exactly sure how the bullet is supposed to damage her airway and then end up in her back, but somehow the bullet is supposed to have done that. Perhaps he is suggesting it changed direction after making contact with her jaw but if that is the case, how did it cause swelling in her airway?

Another good question becomes how did the bullet not damage her carotid artery?

In looking at the pictures of Malala after the shooting, it seems highly unlikely to me that a bullet passed through her skin under her temple and down the side of her face through her jawline area, to say nothing of her throat. Gunshot wounds to the face leave very serious swelling behind and the photos of her after the attack show absolutely nothing with regard to a possible bullet path moving along the side of her face under the skin. Just go look at that first photo of her.

She is ‘now opening eyes and uttering words’ and ‘will fully recover’ to tell the world her story and what should be done about it.

.Conclusion

There is enough forensic medicine evidence to prove that Malala was not shot. Many pictures were photoshopped and the film made of her injury was just an action thriller!

Such false flag operations for political purposes using ‘innocent children’ have been done before. Just google Jessica Lynch of USA and Aesha of Afghanistan, other children that were chosen for playing the dirty games. IF CHILDREN CAN BE BRAINWASHED INTO DOING THIS, THEN THEY CAN ALSO BE BRAINWASHED INTO SUICIDE BOMBING!

I will be discussing this under the motives of this false-flag operation in a future column!

For me the case of Malala has been solved and is now closed

Note: Any facial changes/distortions afterwards may have been produced deliberately by surgeons unless explained medically on how the injuries and required changes occurred. From her latest pics circulating on social & other media, it seems her facial nerve has been damaged which was not obvious in previous pictures!

01 Jul 2013 It is a striking image: Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, flanked by six men, signing stringent abortion restrictions into law as part of the state’s new budget Sunday night. Karen Kasler, a local reporter for Ohio Public Radio and TV’s Statehouse News Bureau, captured the image and shared it on Twitter, where it received a flurry of comments asking: “Where are the women?” While there were female reporters in the room, no female elected officials were present.

28 Feb 2013 Syria’s opposition has won fresh financial and material support from the US but its demands for weapons to fight Bashar al-Assad were ignored in favour of calls for a “political solution” to end the crisis. John Kerry, the new US secretary of state, announced at a conference in Rome on Thursday that $60m (£45m) in “non-lethal” assistance would go to the western-backed Syrian National Coalition (SNC) while food and medical supplies would — for the first time — go directly to the opposition’s supreme military council, attempting to co-ordinate strategy by the Free Syrian Army and other units.

"https://theinternetpost.net/2013/10/23/the-illuminati-and-the-black-nobility/","THE ILLUMINATI AND THE BLACK NOBILITY","This whole thing with the Illuminati and a Shadow Government may be unreal to many people, but stay with me for a while and give it a chance. Most of us can agree upon that something is very wrong with this planet. Civil wars, diseases, famine, ethnic cleansing, religious wars, different violations of human rights … the list is long and it just goes on. Are all those bad conditions totally separated from each other, or do they have a common source?

All I ask from you is to think for yourself. Throw away everything “you’ve been told”, things “you’ve learnt in school”, what you’ve “heard on the radio”, what you’ve “seen on Television”, what “politicians have told you” etc. – just for a moment. Let’s start thinking for ourselves for just awhile. It’s not too often we have that opportunity. We are constantly fed with propaganda, bad news, opinions, lies and there are tons of untold secrets. Life is hectic; we have to earn a living, and we are afraid to be laid off work. Our survival is threatened on a daily basis, and this is the direction in which much thinking goes these days. So what is it that causes so much fear and uncertainty in our lives? Is life really this threatening, or is somebody creating this condition on purpose? Much of the fear and terror is spread through Media, which is owned by a few people at the very top of the society. And those people have their very own agenda …

The Illuminati (or Moriah Conquering Wind as they prefer to call themselves these days) is a very secretive group of occult practitioners who have been around for thousands and thousands of years. It is not a boys’ club or a group of adults parents trying to get some excitement in life; this is something much bigger than that. This is a very well structured organization consisting of people in extremely High Places. Those people are the Super Wealthy, who stand above the law. Many of them don’t even appear on the list of the wealthiest people in the world – it’s that secret.

This web site has a certain purpose. First of all I will try to brief you on the current scene, especially the political one, in the world of today. When this is done, I will try to explain what is really happening, not the false information you get when you follow the news on Television or in the newspapers. I will try to comment on important things we are fed with through different Media and explain or debate them. All this based on the facts I am going to give you soon. Also, this web site will be currently updated as new information comes in. But to understand it all, you have to be briefed on the scene of this planet, the version you were never meant to get – the truth certain people don’t want you to know…

To Govern a Republic, One Must Know the Minds That Created It.

“…while a nation goes speculation crazy the people neglect to think of fundamental principles.”

These were the words of Franklin Roosevelt in the months leading into the Democratic National Convention of 1932. Roosevelt knew that the fight for the United States Presidency was not simply a game of political machines and punditry, but that this coming fight demanded a leader who understood the historic enemy of the United States and the founding principles of the nation.

Hillary Clinton has wasted no time cashing in on the lecture circuit as it was revealed today that she will be charging $200,000 per speech.

The massive fee means that she will be making more from a two-hour lecture than she did in a year as Secretary of State.

The announcement that Mrs Clinton has hired a top talent agency to represent her as she begins to give paid speeches following her departure from the State Department came earlier this week, but her $200,000 asking price was only reported on Wednesday.

According to Buzzfeed, that puts her in the same league as her husband former President Bill Clinton who is so in-demand that he can command the six-figure fee.

The volume of the sum is made clear when looked at in comparison to her salary for a year as Secretary of State, which was $186,000.

Mrs Clinton is now represented by the Harry Walker Agency which is known for getting famous politicians and newsmakers plum gigs on the lecture circuit.

The venture is her first formal decision about what she is going to do now that she is no longer working, though she is widely considered to be the Democratic front runner should she decide to run for the presidency in 2016.

Her decision to attach her name to his particular New York-based agency comes as little surprise since her husband former President Bill Clinton has long been represented by the group since he left office in 2000.

Senator Dick Durbin thinks that one of the safest food supplements on the planet – supplements that causes less deaths per year than bee stings, should be labeled. Why so much attention to dietary supplements that can boost fat loss and improve health when GMO foods, which are known to cause cancer, organ failure and reproductive issues as drastic as uterine swelling and endometriosis, go unnoticed? Perhaps the supplement industry is competing with Big Pharma and Big Agriculture – the deadly duo that will first poison you with genetically modified foods and then offer the ‘medicine’ to cure it, only to poison you a second time with unnatural drugs, chemotherapy and radiation. Maybe.

The bill was first introduced by Senator Durbin as S.1310, ‘The Dietary Supplement Labeling Act’ and now is being re-presented as S.1425. It seems to be just another attack on ‘alternative’ medicine or natural therapies which cost pennies compared to the Pharmaceutical and Big Ag companies inflated prices. Some very astute individuals have called this an orchestrated monopoly on our health.

"https://theinternetpost.net/2013/01/05/deciphering-government-thought-crimes/","Deciphering Government Thought-Crimes","THIS MUST BE TAKEN ONE-STEP AT A TIME

BECAUSE IT’S CLEAR THAT THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN

POISONED

Since 911 this government has been ruling the USA by various Bureaucratic Fiats’ that are kept in place by psy-op events and false-flag CRIMES that continue to be committed against the American-public; to justify that which cannot be justified.

To get to the bottom of this we must engage in an overall decryption of the time-line: Exactly HOW & WHY this nation has become—and has remained—totally-paralyzed in the face of the WAR that began on September 11, 2001.

Sandy-Hook to 911 and back-again to Sandy-Hook

At the moment the government is trying desperately to force the current false-flag operation down the collective-throats of the public: To justify the criminalization of gun-ownership while eliminating the right of Americans to defend themselves against the government. The public must DEMAND an immediate FREEZE on anything & everything that congress wants to do TODAY: At least until the government’s own 90-day cover-up has run its course.

PROBLEM-REACTION-SOLUTION

The public has always been the KEY-TARGET of every act committed in this war against us. This is why every step has happened—on national-television—in ways that have tried to force the public to believe in that which they have failed to clearly show: From 911 all the way to Sandy Hook.

On 911 – Television reporters were claiming that Osama bin Laden did the attacks, just fifteen minutes into an attack that lasted an hour and 47 minutes: Because that was what the whole world was supposed to believe, from that botched false-flag attack which started the global WAR on America.

The same clutter of false-information and blatant-government-lies was also used to convince the public again, in the WAR-on-IRAQ of Weapons of Mass-Destruction. No such weapons were ever present. From that point government has expanded our war-footing to now include, not just the Middle-East, but 32 more nations in Africa as well. This was made possible by DRONES that augment the dying effectiveness of our failed military-missions, in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Ironically all of these military-announcements are meant to show Americans the government’s picture of the planet; which is false and misleading. These lies were told to DISTRACT the American public from the truth which is that the WAR-on-AMERICA is about to totally DISARM the public, in order to triumph over the Constitution and the now dead Republic. This crime has ALWAYS BEEN THE REAL TARGET OF EVERYTHING that this nation has been trying to finish since 911.

In Aurora Colorado another botched massacre plot was tried, but fell apart almost immediately. That failure necessitated Sandy Hook, to finally-force the disarmament of America’s Second Amendment citizens, in order to trigger arrests, imprisonment, torture and murder of anyone that resists being formally disarmed.

The continuing Psy-OP incident in Sandy Hook continues the basic plan, on television, to evoke a FASLE-REACTION to a fictional crime. Their version was already-in-place for the FICTIONAL-SOLUTION to conclude their version for their NEED TO DISARM AMERICA.

This government is following the Communist-Manifesto to the letter.

The dumbing-down of the public, mentioned prominently in the Manifesto, was thought to have been completed long before Sandy-Hook ever took place. However, each level of implementation to alter our ability to think-critically has now been shown to have failed. Now the public is DECONSTRUCTING this lying-government, their sponsors and the corporations. Individuals can and will be prosecuted for what they’ve done throughout this WAR-on-US and for their continuing assaults upon humanity; as well as their destruction of the oceans, skies and the earth in order to end the freedoms enjoyed by humanity—anywhere upon the planet.

Sandy Hook was a colossal failure. This classic-psy-op can now be used to prosecute every part of the government that had anything to do with whatever was done, or lied about, inside this supposedly FINAL STRAW that was needed to finish disarming the American public… (1)

What can now clearly be seen from what happened with the destroyed evidence in Sandy Hook is nothing short of a USI, Mossad, FBI, CIA, Connecticut State Police coverup. Imagine a giant-blender with every agency involved. When the public started asking the QUESTIONS that must be asked: Once that happened everything from every agency was clearly complicit, not just SUSPECT. The public must DEMAND a HALT to everything. An open and public investigation, of our “Just-Us System” and every clearly-wrong-fact in what supposedly happened at Sandy Hook is REQUIRED!

From the local police to the president; whatever this government has claimed, as part of the truth in this entire psy-op—must be challenged and thoroughly investigated. This can be done during the 90-day freeze: Before any congressional action can be taken concerning the public’s right to have and keep the Second Amendment untouched, by government or the police-state in any way.

The government has been so determined to force the public to surrender, that they rushed this latest series of crimes through and blew every facet of it, so badly, that the exact opposite of what they wanted to happen—has happened.

The determination of the people has overcome the criminal elements of the government. The subjugation of this criminal element is slowly being implemented: That’s why this congress is trying to crush us with forced changes to the Second Amendment, before their crimes become clear to the whole world. Everyone is “WATCHING” and now we’re on the verge to taking direct action to end this nightmare.

The dominance of the American people has become so frightening to the criminals that they must now submit to the people. This is why there is a government-panic to push their latest criminal-legislation into being: Before the public DEMANDS real PROSECUTIONS for everything and everyone involved from 911 to the present moment.

The subjugation of our criminally-elected officials, has become obvious and will now come back to bite them. It is now they who will submit to the LAW as written in the constitution. This is what happened recently that brought on this awakening of the American public.

The government got caught; fabricating evidence, falsifying the

existence of people, of weapons, of victims and potential shooters not to mention all the blatant lies of the government at every phase in this supposed “official-explanation” of what happened at Sandy Hook.

None of what happened there could have been done without the collusion of Lt. Paul Vance, the bogus cooperation of the coroner, the media and the total rearrangement of every part of this event, hour by hour, over most of the last twenty days since the behind-the-scenes-CRIMES in Sandy Hook took place.

Where are the bodies? Where are the supposed perpetrators? What happened to the weapons or the evidence surrounding the bullets used to kill the bodies that have never been displayed! What is the actual and provable evidence that crimes were committed? What did happen? How much was fabricated and how much was part of the psy-op?

Before 911 the Patriot Act had already been written and was just waiting to be implemented; which it was. Sandy Hook on the other hand was created to fulfill the legislation that Senator Feinstein had already written, to DISARM the American Public, and was just waiting for the false-flag to succeed in Connecticut to make everything look necessary. Instead, that backfired!

Feinstein & Obama got busted. They can no longer just skip-over “the evidence” or the supposed FACTS. They have not proven anything which they initially claimed. This is why the government wants to go straight to CRIMIALIZING GUNS & GUN OWNERS throughout AMERICA!

The public does NOT agree with the government on criminalizing guns. Feinstein, when she realized that Sandy Hook FAILED, leapt directly to her supposedly new Bio-weapon (false-flag) attack on America that would pale-everything that has supposedly already happened to America. Her new fantasy would “kill hundreds of thousands of people” and would prove her-contention that there is a “THREAT” to be afraid of, besides her and the entirely criminal-government of this failed nation.

The truth is that Zionists want to kill us. They “live” just to see the blood because they like it—and they love the idea of killing Americans!

The dominance of the American people over the servile government is being implemented, whether they like it or not, one day at a time!

According to statistics assembled from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Center for Disease Control and the Federal Government, firearms related homicides are minuscule in comparison to other the other “big killers” in the United States.

If we look at homicide statistics in the United States it’s clear that more murders are committed with knives, bats, hammers and poisons than with firearms. As Kurt Nimmo recently noted, “ the number of murders committed annually with hammers and clubs far outpaces the number of murders committed with a rifle.”

The facts, not the drivel being spewed by the anti-gun propaganda machine, leave us wondering why some State and Federal lawmakers are so adamant about restricting the sale and ownership of handguns and rifles, especially since the majority of gun owners – close to 99% – have never committed a violent crime in their lives, let alone used a gun to do so.

Here is the chart they never want you to see:

The chart above proves that politicians and those who would disarm Americans by going so far as to call for a repeal of the 2nd Amendment have ulterior motives – or they’re completely ignorant of the facts.

Perhaps their goal is to trigger a revolution in an effort to implement a total police state over the American people.

It wouldn’t be the first time that a government has tried something like this.

Ted Turner, in an interview with Audubon Magazine

To my mind controlled friends, I temporarily interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to inform you that America is now entering into martial law. In order to receive this information, you must temporarily suspend all other previous programming whether it be from CNN, FOX, CBS, ABC, NBC or any of the other 98% of media outlets controlled by only five corporations.

You have allowed your media to make you ignorant, passive, unable to engage in critical thinking and blind to the fact that you have been made a slave to the state, controlled by the megabanks, who have hijacked your government. Soon you will awaken to a life where every choice, every action and even every belief has been predetermined for you. Soon you will come to realize that that your neighbor was correct when he tried to tell you that if you let the illegitimate government come and take your guns, it would not be long until they would come and take you. We are witnessing the first stage of the total destruction of the United States.

Well, except for the American politics, which has been stripped of the effective multiple-party system it needs to evolve and thrive.

Whatevs, back to Ryan being an idiot with his morals stuck in all the wrong holes.

In an unsurprising turn of events, Ryan has signed on as cosponsor to the Sanctity of Human Life Act again. The original bill — which declares that life begins with fertilization, and would give states the right to ban all abortion, even in the cases involving incest, rape, or the life of the mother — thankfully died in Congress in 2011.

But now it’s baaaaack, which is scary because not only is the above terrifying, there’s all sorts of other creepy shit hidden in this monster. Like, if a woman who was raped in a state that banned abortions went to a state that didn’t ban abortions and had an abortion? Her rapist could theoretically sue to stop the abortion from happening, and probably win. And it doesn’t stop there with the reproductive weirdness, if passed, it’ll probably make many forms of IVF illegal.

Luckily, it’s almost for sure gonna die again, but I wonder if Ryan’s career will go the way of the dodo bird soon after? The tide is turning, and a majority of voters don’t want politicians making women’s health choices for them. For everyone’s sake, it would be best for Ryan and politicians like him to see this as the death rattle. Pack up your moral indignation and head home, guys, I’m sure there’s a pot roast in your kitchen you can mansplain your garbage feelings on women’s reproductive rights to.

By Bob Allen

Five new anonymous plaintiffs have joined the three original litigants in a lawsuit alleging a cover-up of sexual abuse by a church-planting network with ties to Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.

New allegations in an amended lawsuit filed Jan. 11 accuse a co-founder of Sovereign Grace Ministries of physically abusing a female over a 25-year period spanning her childhood and young adulthood. The expanded complaint also describes a “pedophilia ring” on Sovereign Grace church and school premises, where perpetrators were not reported to police and went on to prey on additional children.

C.J. Mahaney

Sovereign Grace Ministries, which recently relocated from Maryland to Louisville in part to strengthen informal ties with Southern Seminary, responded to amendments added to a class action lawsuit originally filed Oct. 17, 2012, in Maryland’s Montgomery County Circuit Court with a statement requesting “patience as we continue to investigate these new allegations.”

“As we initially stated and continue to reiterate, SGM considers the mistreatment of any child reprehensible and evil,” Tommy Hill, director of administration for Sovereign Grace Ministries, said in the statement. “We grieve deeply for any individual who has been a victim of abuse. We want to minister the love, grace, and healing of God to every child we encounter who has suffered such horror.”

Police in Washington DC frequently fail to investigate reports of rape, and treat victims so dismissively at times, that they experience fresh trauma while the chances of the perpetrator being caught are undermined, according to a comprehensive report due out next week.

Campaign group Human Rights Watch is expected to uncover “disturbing evidence of police failure” in a 200-plus page report after a two-year investigation into law enforcement practices in the US capital.

But although shocking, the situation in Washington is far from isolated. There are widespread examples across the US of the police routinely neglecting crimes of sexual violence and refusing to believe victims.

“This is a national crisis requiring federal action. We need a paradigm shift in police culture, because rapes and sexual assaults are being swept under the rug, and too many victims are being bullied,” said Carol Tracy of the Women’s Law Project, a legal advocacy group that specialises in sexual violence cases.

Human Rights Watch began looking into the situation in Washington after discovering evidence that the city’s Metropolitan police department (MPD) were refusing even to document a significant number of reports of sexual assaults coming in from the central hospital where victims are treated.

Full details and statistics will be disclosed by HRW in its final report, due to be published on 24 January.

For a little over six months, I was paid to spread disinformation and argue political points on the Internet. This site, ATS, was NOT one that I was assigned to post on, although other people in the same organization were paid to be here, and I assume they still walk among you. But more on this later.

I quit this job in the latter part of 2011, because I became disgusted with it, and with myself. I realized I couldn’t look myself in the mirror anymore. If this confession triggers some kind of retribution against me, so be it. Part of being a real man in this world is having real values that you stand up for, no matter what the consequences.

My story begins in early 2011. I had been out of work for almost a year after losing my last job in tech support. Increasingly desperate and despondent, I jumped at the chance when a former co-worker called me up and said she had a possible lead for me. “It is an unusual job, and one that requires secrecy. But the pay is good. And I know you are a good writer, so its something you are suited for.” (Writing has always been a hobby for me).

NEWTOWN — Members of government, law enforcement, and mainstream media alike, including CNN, Anderson Cooper and possibly members of his staff have now been implicated in aiding in a treasonous plot to destroy the Constitution of the United States of America at the presidential level by way of Executive Order to limit and possibly ban all guns.

Media giant CNN has now been caught airing what appears to be “active-shooter drill footage” from another school location and passing it off as the LIVE breaking news feed of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that was reported to take place on the 14th of December, 2012 in the morning.

Photograph: Alessandra Benedetti/Corbis

Few passing London tourists would ever guess that the premises of Bulgari, the upmarket jewellers in New Bond Street, had anything to do with the pope. Nor indeed the nearby headquarters of the wealthy investment bank Altium Capital, on the corner of St James’s Square and Pall Mall.

But these office blocks in one of London’s most expensive districts are part of a surprising secret commercial property empire owned by the Vatican.

Behind a disguised offshore company structure, the church’s international portfolio has been built up over the years, using cash originally handed over by Mussolini in return for papal recognition of the Italian fascist regime in 1929.

Since then the international value of Mussolini’s nest-egg has mounted until it now exceeds £500m. In 2006, at the height of the recent property bubble, the Vatican spent £15m of those funds to buy 30 St James’s Square. Other UK properties are at 168 New Bond Street and in the city of Coventry. It also owns blocks of flats in Paris and Switzerland.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has proposed a rule that would allow security guards to wield machine guns and “enhanced weapons” to guard spent fuel rods being stored at nuclear power plants.

The cost of the weapons upgrade, training and background checks envisioned in the NRC rule could cost the industry between $26.5 million and $34.7 million, according to NRC estimates.

"https://theinternetpost.net/2013/01/23/psychotic-paranoia-insanity-2/","Psychotic Paranoia & Insanity","I’m just a man, not a shrink, not a lawyer, not even a journalist. I’m just a word-slinger who comments from time to time, about some of the glaring disasters that pass for life in the twenty-first century.

Once upon a time I was an internationally-published artist, designer, writer and illustrator for over thirty years: Before the illegal-IRS snatched that away along with several other occupations which they decided to turn into wholly-owned-cash-registers, under their required-labels that have made everything in Amerikkka into “just business”.

The methodology I employ for my work on the web, involves having to find ways to distance myself daily, from the intensity of what I continue to write about every day. Some of these distractions involve much of the output from Hollywood, and the world, in the category of films and books.

Lately what has been coming out of Hollywood and Media for at least the last fifteen years has been instructive about the methods and processes that are supposedly used by feral agencies around the world—to keep what is in place at the moment both hidden and simultaneously “known” in order to terrify the public. The idea being that their operations are not something that we can ever win-against. That is a total lie. It is this lie that I’d like to offer for your consideration; as this directly concerns the Psychotic-Paranoid-Insanity at the base of everything that the Police-State wants the world to believe is real.

What is clear throughout their films, videos, and the spin-that-never-stops-spinning, is something that those who chose to employ this junk, have never realized: When it comes to the built-in flaws which they continue to flaunt to the wider-world.

The message of the New World Order, the globalist bankers, the various criminally-religious-factions along with everything from the Illuminati, the Jesuits, Zionism, Opus Dei, Skull & Bones and all the way down through the Vatican and the Masons is all just part of this evil-equation. In every instance we the public of this planet have always been their targets and it is way past time that more of us begin to understand what exactly has been going on.

Yesterday I tried to offer an explanation for why Sandy Hook has just chosen to create its own death-knell. Half the illustrations in that article were blocked from being shown, which rendered the information almost moot for many people. The thrust of what I tried to reveal was simple, and deadly, to the premise which the government said took place.

“At 0:06 in and at 1:02 into the following video on CNN’s website the active-shooter drill footage that aired LIVE as most of America has been “duped” in what some would say is an even more sophisticated and diabolic false flag operation than the government staged terror attacks that took place on September 11, 2001.”

k): The video shown here was missing in the article, which clearly shows the absence of the crosswalk that means that this video did not come from Sandy Hook.

“Take a very close look at the video starting at 1:02 into it. You will notice the police running through a cross walk area that simply does not exist at Sandy Hook Elementary.

Take note of the rounded curb area that leads into a grassy area of some sort with a tree present in the center of the grassy area. This area does not exist on Sandy Hook Elementary Schools property as factions of our government, law enforcement, and media have conspired to stage what could become the end of our once great nation.” (1)

The same kinds of facts are also obscured from this point on, all the way through the rest of yesterday’s article “Cracking the Edifice of Evil”- Part One. You can however watch the whole story at the first footnote below.

The complexity surrounding “HOW” the false-flags of Sandy Hook were carried out was the key to walking the public through event after event since that day it began. Information overload and purposeful confusion was key to overwhelming the public with such things as the fact that the supposed shooter’s body has disappeared, and as far as telling the public goes, the government has not furnished any clarifications about the confusing statements which the cops themselves, along with the FBI & State Police have all conspired to create—in order to keep the FEAR alive while trashing any admissions by either themselves or any of the “explanations” that have since been offered by the public.

All this feral-government needs to do is to keep the massive lies & confusion alive until the NEXT much larger FALSE-FLAG can be perpetrated.

Beyond this lays the core-corruption of the entirely preposterous concept that anyone could ever-succeed in “conquering the world” using Psychotic-Paranoid-Insanity as a means to achieve anything except their own colossal-and permanent-DEFEAT. Ironically the fascist-police-state seems totally unaware of this major flaw at the very heart of their entire agenda.

In film after film supposedly dealing with national and international “intelligence agencies” the government is presented as being beyond reproach from ordinary human failings. So ABSOLUTELY cynical are the spies and government agencies: So thoroughly immune to any human feeling that their various political-odyssey’s appear farcical in the extreme: At the end of every hair-brained and literally impossible scheme they are shown as being the undisputed-masters of every circumstance because they FEAR any and every human aspect in favor of their reliance on THE PARANOIA of the INSANITY behind the NATIONAL-INSECURITY apparatus that can never be enough.

People are never treated as people, but only as cogs in the machinery of a soulless-machine without any overriding point or purpose beyond the supposed-power of the global-political-machine which is supposedly ABSOLUTE, and always totally impregnable. Therefore the unsubtle media & corporate-government message is:

“RESISTANCE IS ALWAYS FUTILE”

Except that their “SYSTEM” is itself totally unworkable and can never succeed because there is nothing human, anywhere within the dictates being advocated on every level.

Each and every new-toy created by these outlaws is always subject to the often much-cheaper and far more effective counter-measures that will ALWAYS be used to defeat them. Thus with each new intrusion by NATO-UN-USI-Mossad into the life of the planet, there will always be forces which they can never control who will upend them in every action they plan to undertake—and we will crush them like the cockroaches they truly are.

There is no doubt that the Business of Warmaking is BIG Business, but for every BREAKTHROUGH they discover: The world finds ways through their supposed infallibility—much like the common mirrors that are about to be used to screw up the targeting-systems of the vaunted DRONE technologies, world-wide. (2)

What the public needs to understand is that whatever the feral governments tell us: They are LYING! Whatever terror or fear continues to be ON-SALE for the timid and terrified peoples of the world to swallow—the truth is entirely different from anything they are promising to deliver.

THIS IS WHY THERE WILL BE THE NEXT ATTACK, AN ATTACK THAT WILL KILL THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS,

TO PROVE THAT

WHICH THEY CANNOT CONVINCE ANYONE ‘WILL HAPPEN’

IN ANY OTHER WAY.

However the biggest LIE of all is simply the truth which cannot be disguised. No one can ever build anything even remotely successful on fear and paranoia alone: And INSANITY which they have tried to add as their final game-changer will also backfire. There is simply no-way that any people could ever be totally ruled by such a ridiculous set of assumptions.

Theirs is a paper-world; while the world they want to completely subsume is real. While this presents its own set of problems, it is NOT POSSIBLE to hold the entire planet in lockdown, while they try and erase the global-population and finish destroying the world through poison, contamination and political and morally reprehensible-designs. The job is too-big, and “they” are nothing but freaks-of-nature that have no skills at all when it comes to making anything work—much less how any of their so-called forces will be able to keep any surviving force alive, once four-fifths of the planet has been slaughtered.

Could there be a Military Coup coming to America? The only real problem with this could well be the fact that America no longer has any gold as the last of it disappeared from the World Trade Center when we allowed that coup to succeed on 911. (3)

Everything from Agenda 21 thru the New World Order—while it represents BAD-NEWS for the earth and its people—is nothing more than the pipedreams of the current set of global élites who have no experience with actually being alive. They are being joined by the “exceptionalism” of Amerikkka’s richest-class, coupled with the SPECIALNESS of Zion’s freak-show that believes that THEY are the only people who should be allowed to live freely on the planet. Neither of these criminally-based-disaster-classes will survive the next five years of major changes. Think very carefully about all of this, as we begin to face THE NEXT-ATTACK upon the USA and what we must do, by keeping our heads, and

QUESTIONING EVERYTHING & EVERYONE

…as we go deeper into the nightmare of the blood-drenched twenty-first century.

You can read that story in the Canada Free Press which reports::

The war against U.N. Agenda 21 just got hotter in Virginia. Thinking Americans understand now what U.N. Agenda 21 is and are not backing down from fighting the anti-American, anti-prosperity, wealth redistribution scheme of the United Nations against our way of life.

The U.N. has deemed commercial agriculture unsustainable and has used taxpayer dollars and local supervisors to re-zone, re-shape, and prohibit land use for local agriculture or building that is not approved by their bio-diversity plan of limiting human habitation – all in the name of saving the planet.

Our planet does not need saving, Mother Earth is doing fine. The problem lies with progressive humans in positions of power who want to control everything we do while they line their pockets with our hard-earned taxpayer dollars.

Unfair regulatory actions against Martha Boneta, a farmer in Fauquier County, Virginia, “violate fundamental rights and unfairly restrict her property rights.” Delegate L. Scott Lingamfelter (R-Woodbridge/31st district) plans to strengthen Virginia’s Right to Farm Act and to “protect farmers against future encroachments by local government.”

Delegate Lingamfelter, who represents four of the Fauquier County’s 20 voting precincts, is planning a press conference to discuss his proposed legislation on January 8, 2013 in Richmond, Virginia. Two prominent property rights advocates will be in attendance, Joel Salatin and Mark Fitzgibbons.","2013-01-18 14:13:39","0","48.0","5.0","165.0","0.0","15.0","0.0","539.0","510.0","101.0","48.0","0.0","7.0","0","261","91.22","77.83","7.27","25.77","18.64","30.65","70.11","38.31","7.66","4.98","0.00","1.53","1.53","0.77","1.15","2.68","4.60","14.18","5.75","1.15","4.60","1.15","8.81","3.45","1.53","1.53","2.68","1.15","4.60","2.30","2.30","0.00","1.53","0.00","8.81","0.38","0.00","0.77","0.38","8.43","0.77","1.15","1.53","0.38","1.92","3.07","1.53","0.00","0.00","1.53","2.30","0.38","0.38","1.53","0.00","10.34","1.53","1.92","5.75","0.77","0.77","1.15","6.51","1.92","10.73","0.38","8.81","1.53","3.83","0.00","0.00","2.68","0.00","0.38","1.92","0.00","1.53","0.00","0.38","0.00","19.54","6.51","5.36","0.77","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.07","1.53","1.15","0.77","0.38","1334","9.89","26.4","406","250","13","51.99","13.4","10.8","15.08","14.5","84","7.75","23.12","177","23.4","8","0.39","0","9","9","16","0","29","17","0","0","3","43","46","3","17","0","0","4","7","8","1","0","2","6","0","10","3","7","5","4","10","2","3","0","0"

Sharpton‘s “The Rejected Stone” will be published by Cash Money Content and Massenburg Media.

The book will cover Sharpton’s “personal evolution” from New York street activist to political candidate and civil rights spokesman.

Sharpton told The Associated Press on Thursday that the book would include his thoughts on Lil Wayne and other rappers and that he was anxious to have a positive dialogue.

He added: “Just because we disagree doesn’t mean we have to be disagreeable.”

"http://tmzbreaking.com/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/","NRA President Jim Porter: “It’s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again”","It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.

“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”

When asked to clarify Porter said,

“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”

Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”

It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.

Partners In Crime?

Jay Z may have once schooled his fans on the “A’s, B’s and Kilos of Coke” — but the admitted ex D-boy now seems to be looking to create rules over what’s published to the internet.

“We need to write the new rules.” ~Jay Z

During last night’s fifth game of the NBA finals, the “Magna Carta Holy Grail” rapper appeared to have taken a play straight out of the PR bible — using the half-time break to debut as the face of Samsung, while letting his internet plans be known. We’re talking about the same internet the business mogul remains using to cash-in.

“We don’t have any rules, everyone is trying to figure it out. That’s why the internet is like the wild wild west.” ~Jay Z Uh oh looks like a takeover….



Here’s what The Wall Street Journal is reporting:

“The connection: Samsung has purchased 1 million copies of Jay-Z’s coming album, entitled ‘Magna Carta Holy Grail,’ slated for release July 4, and plans to give them to Samsung Galaxy smartphone users for free – 72 hours ahead of the release. The users are to receive the music through an app they’ll receive later this month. (Recipients won’t be able to share it until the official release date.) Samsung paid $5 apiece for the albums, according to a person familiar with the matter. It wasn’t immediately clear if Nielsen SoundScan will count Samsung’s purchases in its sales tallies.”

Was the estranged eldest daughter of Samsung’s chairman, Lee Kun-hee, busted with $500,000 worth of marijuana — about five-years after her younger sister committed suicide? Of course. Just ask Lee Myung-Hee.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/sarah-palin-believes-that-global-warming-will-bring-back-the-dinosaurs/","Sarah Palin Believes That Global Warming Will ‘Bring Back the Dinosaurs’","Sarah Palin said today that concern over global warming is overblown because returning the climate to its state millions of years ago will allow dinosaurs to make a comeback.

In an interview with Fox News, the former Alaska governor admitted that climate change will hurt some plants and animals but argued that it will also provide an opportunity for ancient, warm-weather species to thrive.

“I’ve been hearing all this hootin’ and hollarin’ from the liberals about how CO 2 is going up to levels we haven’t seen in 5 million years,” Palin told Fox and Friends‘ host Gretchen Carlson. “But the truth is, life was pretty good millions of years ago.

“There were plenty of plants and animals back then, and they did just fine in the heat. And as Earth starts to warm up, all our old friends will start coming back. The polar bears might die off, but think of all the dinosaurs we’re gonna get!

“But you don’t hear the liberal, lamestream media talk about that do you? All you hear is doom and gloom, the sky is falling. Personally, I can’t wait to see what a triceratops looks like in real life.”

Page Right Out of History

The overwhelming majority of scientists believe that the Earth’s climate is warming due to emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases created by industrial activity.

If left unchecked, this process could increase temperatures significantly by the end of the century and lead to increased drought, severe weather and mass extinctions across the globe.

According to Palin, however, these negative effects are outweighed by the positive, which apparently includes the dubious idea that restoring a Pliocene climate will bring Cretaceous species back to life.

“Just to be clear,” Carlson interrupted, “you’re saying that if some animals go extinct because it’s too hot, they’ll be replaced by heat-loving animals that went extinct millions of years ago?”

“Well, yes exactly,” Palin responded. “That’s what I call logic, Gretchen. Something the Looney Left in this country doesn’t understand. They’re so Debbie Downer about this whole thing, they can’t see the bright side.”

“I don’t think you can actually bring back the dinosaurs,” interjected co-host Steve Doocy. “Once something is extinct it’s gone forever. Also, dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago, so your dates are a bit off as well. “

“Really?” a surprised Palin inquired. “But they did it in Jurassic Park. Are you telling me that movie wasn’t based on a true story?”

Stunned by Palin’s ignorance of basic scientific concepts, the Fox and Friends team turned the conversation to the ongoing Benghazi scandal.

Palin served as Alaska’s governor from 2006-2009 and was the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008. She is currently an author and Fox News contributor.

His latest stop was to the Sway In the Morning Show.

He talks about the Rick Ross shooting, saying he thought it was just a rumor until his engineer confirmed it.

The Virginia rapper also addresses rumors that have followed Kanye West and Jay-Z for years, that they are somehow part of the Illuminati and devil worshipers. The rumors now include Pusha himself.

“I never asked [Kanye] about the Illuminati, but just in conversation I hear him be like ‘man people saying I’m part of the Illuminati, people are crazy.’ It’s bled over to everybody,” Pusha said. “I was just saying that my mother asked me the other day ‘I heard you part of something called the Illuminessence.’ And I’m like mom what are you talking about? She’s like ‘you part of something called the Illuminessence. The people in church told me you are part of something called the Illuminessence!’ Come to find out she’s talking about the Illuminati. And I’m talking about I was so hot because y’all all in church telling my mom this kind of stuff.”

Push said there isn’t any devil worshiping going on with Kanye either.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/here-are-5-arguments-against-for-the-existence-of-god/","Here Are 5 Arguments Against & For The Existence Of God","Religious topics abound on here and they are frequently the most commented upon. It has been some time since the last one so it seems like the time is ripe for another – and this one is a great one for discussion. Here we present five arguments in favor of the existence of God, and the counterargument for it. Feel free to comment on the veracity (or your opinion of) each but remember to keep calm and argue reasonably. After all, it is our ability to be reasonable (rationality) which separates us from the other animals! Note: These all deal with the Judeo-Christian God.

5 Ontological Argument

First formulated by St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, then taken up by Alvin Plantinga. “God exists, provided that it is logically possible for him to exist.”

This argument is quite brazen in its simplicity, requiring not only a belief in God, but a belief in the necessity of God. If you believe he is necessary, then you must believe he exists.

The Counterargument:

Criticism typically deals with the Ontological Argument committing a “bare assertion fallacy,” which means it asserts qualities inherent solely to an unproven statement, without any support for those qualities. It is also criticized as a circular argument, revolving from a premise to a conclusion which relies on the premise, which relies on the conclusion.

4 Moral Argument

This argument is very old, and states that God must exist for the following reason: 1. An aspect of morality is observed. 2. Belief in God is a better explanation for this morality than any alternative. 3. Belief in God is thus preferable to disbelief in God.

The Counterargument:

This argument is technically valid, provided that the three constituents are accepted, and most critics refuse to accept the first. Morality, they argue, is not universal. Murder was perfectly fine for the soldiers of the First Crusade, who slaughtered every man, woman, and child in Jerusalem in 1099. Thomas Hobbes argued that morality is based on the society around it, and is thus not objective.

3 Argument from Degree

This is one of St. Thomas Aquinas’s “Five Proofs of God,” and still causes debate among the two sides. Here is Aquinas’s statement of it, which I have translated from Latin, for a sense of thoroughness:

The fourth proof originates from the degrees discovered in things. For there is discovered greater and lesser degrees of goodness, truth, nobility, and others. But “more” or “less” are terms spoken concerning various things that approach in diverse manners toward something that is the “greatest,” just as in the case of “hotter” approaching nearer the “greatest” heat. There exists, therefore, something “truest,” and “best,” and “noblest,” which, in consequence, is the “greatest” being. For those things which are the greatest truths are the greatest beings, as is stated in Metaphysics Bk. II. 2. Furthermore, that which is the greatest in its way, is, in another way, the cause of all things belonging to it; thus fire, which is the greatest heat, is the cause of all heat, as is said in the same book (cf. Plato and Aristotle). Therefore, there exists something that is the cause of the existence of all things, and of goodness, and of every perfection whatever. We call this “God.”

The Counterargument:

The most prevalent criticism of this argument considers that we do not have to believe in an object of a greater degree in order to believe in an object of a lesser degree. Richard Dawkins, the most famous, or infamous, Atheist around these days, argues that just because we come across a “smelly” object, does not require that we believe that we believe in a “preeminently peerless stinker,” in his words.

2

Argument from Reason

One of my favorites, with very intricate abstraction. C. S. Lewis (who wrote “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe”) came up with this. It begins as an argument from design, and then continues into something new. Very basically, it argues that God must exist, because, in Lewis’s words:

“Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It’s like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can’t trust my own thinking, of course I can’t trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.”

The Counterargument:

It sounds powerful, and the final judgment on it is still out there. But its primary weak point is that, in the strictest sense, it is not a proof of God’s existence because it requires the assumption that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim, and it requires that human minds can be convinced by argumentation.

But in order to reject the assumption that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim, a human mind must assume that this claim is true or false, which immediately proves that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim.

But none of this has anything to do with God’s existence. Thus, the argument is better treated as a disproof of naturalistic materialism. However, given that most Atheists use naturalistic materialism as the foundation of Atheism, is is a very viable argument.

1 Cosmological Argument

Thomas Aquinas’s most famous proof of God refuses to go away. You’ve probably already heard of it in some form. It was around before Aquinas, at least as early as Plato and Aristotle, and in basic terms, it goes like this:

1. Every finite and contingent being has a cause.

2. Nothing finite and contingent can cause itself.

3. A causal chain cannot be of infinite length.

4. Therefore, a First Cause (or something that is not an effect) must exist.

This is especially impressive in that it was theorized by the Ancient Greeks, at a time when the Universe was not known to have had an origin. Today, we call this “the Big Bang,” and the argument has changed to this form:

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.

2. The Universe began to exist.

3. Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

The Counterargument:

Sequentially speaking, these three points are true. But the second point requires the Universe to have had a cause, and we still aren’t sure it did. “The Big Bang” is the most prevalent astrophysical theory today, but it has its detractors, most arguing that because the mathematics that leads back to a big bang do not function at the point immediately prior to the big bang, those mathematics were invalid to begin with.

Better than this, however, is the argument that this proof of God commits the logical fallacy called “infinite regression.” If the Universe had a first cause, what caused that first cause? Criticism declares that it is unfair to argue for every thing’s cause, and then argue for the sole exception of a “First Cause,” which did not have a cause.

READ STORY HERE: Lil Wayne Says “I F**ked Chris Bosh’s Wife [VIDEO]

The wife of the NBA baller took the high road via twitter today after the Young Money CEO said he “f*cked Chris Bosh wife.”

She started it off with a series of retweets which read:

“Truth prevails. Today stand in your truth and ignore the chatter around and about you. #myhighestself #TodayICan #chakrawisdom. Some people create hate for profit, and some people create love for free. Pay no mind to the haters, embrace the love. #TodayICan ignore those who live in hate for their own ego, and keep my eyes on pure love. They will never bring me down.

Mrs. Bosh then continued to kill him with kindness by telling Wayne ‘what goes around comes around.’ She even tweeted a picture to let Weezy know karma is real.

After an awkward confrontation with Joe Budden, Cons addressed his problem with Rosenberg’s comments during a recent Pusha T interview that he had been “put off” by some oft the things Cons has been saying recently.

Rosenberg also took issue with Cons doing an interview with Power 105.1 before Hot 97.

Consequence goes on to address friction with Raqi Thunda, Kanye West, Pusha T and his cousin Q-Tip. He apologizes to Kim Kardahsian for involving her in the Kanye beef and says Kanye didn’t buy his teeth.



Joe Budden Confronts Consequence At Hot 97 About Cons Slick Talk Towards Him In Interviews [Video]

Things got extremely awkward recently when Joe Budden crossed paths with Consequence in between their interviews at Hot 97.

The tension between the two “Love & Hip Hop New York” co-stars has been bubbling ever since Cons said some negative things about Joe in interviews with The Breakfast Club and Vlad TV.

While at Hot 97 yesterday Joe confronted Cons to see what all the talk was about. Joe said he wasn’t used to seeing people on a show one day then giving a negative interview about him the next.

Cons placed the blame on Raqi Thunda, saying she had instigated things with disparaging remarks about Joe. Cons also said he was gassed up in the interviews by the hosts which led to him saying slick sh*t about Joe.

Check out the confrontation below. Who backs down in your opinion?

While it’s now confirmed that Clive is too far gone to be called bi-curious, what we’re curious about is who among his crew were most likely to be covering up for Clive.

Scroll Down for the most likely suspects…

Diddy

Diddy is pretty famous for his freaky ways and it’s long been implied that he’s batted for both teams. Clive’s coming out only sheds more suspicion on the Bad Boy because it’s public knowledge that Diddy borrowed millions from Clive when the label was in trouble and at one point Clive’s Arista label actually owned a 50% stake of Bad Boy. Coincidence? We think not.

Christina Aguilera

Xtina has always been known for letting her freak flag fly freely, and no wonder she’s felt so comfortable, with Clive playing a large role in her career, even to this day.

Andre Harrell

How many execs do you know take such a STRONG interest in their unpaid INTERN that they bring them on as an A&R? Not many. But it’s not just his shady relationship with Diddy that puts Harrell under the microscope. It also doesn’t help that he may be the only man on this list with a private life more private than Clive’s.

When Meek Mill dropped his Cassidy diss “Repo,” he mentions former Larsiny Family member AR-AB. Meek claimed in the song that Cass never let AR eat, even after he caught a body for him.

In a new video blog, AR backs up Meek’s claims.

While maintaining that he is still cool with Cass, AR says that The Hustla has been lying about his 2005 murder case. AR claims he actually killed Desmond Hawkins, while Cass ran into his house and locked him outside.

“Claim your rape, don’t claim my homicide,” AR says.

When AR returned home from prison he claims Cass only gave him $200 and made him sleep on his couch. AR says he starved the entire time he was with Larsiny Family.



AR further claims that Cass was scared to fight Jim Jones and Gillie Da Kid when they stepped to him.

Cassidy responded to AR via Twitter this morning.

“Media manipulation currently shapes everything you read, hear and watch online. Everything.”

– Forbes magazine article on mass media influence, 7/16/2012

The influence of the mass media on public perception is widely acknowledged, yet few know the incredible degree to which this occurs. Key excerpts from the rare, revealing mass media news articles below show how blatantly the media sometimes distort critical facts, omit vital stories, and work hand in hand with the military-industrial complex to keep their secrets safe and promote greedy and manipulative corporate agendas.

Once acclaimed as the watchdog of democracy and the political process, these riveting articles clearly show that the major media can no longer be trusted to side with the people over business and military interests. For ideas on how you can further educate yourself and what you can do to change all this, see the “What you can do” section below the article summaries. Together, we can make a difference.

U.S. Suppressed Footage of Hiroshima for Decades

2005-08-03, New York Times/Reuters

http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/news/news-media-anniversary.html

In the weeks following the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, U.S. authorities seized and suppressed film shot in the bombed cities by U.S. military crews and Japanese newsreel teams to prevent Americans from seeing the full extent of devastation wrought by the new weapons. It remained hidden until the early 1980s and has never been fully aired. “Although there are clearly huge differences with Iraq, there are also some similarities,” said Mitchell, co-author of “Hiroshima in America” and editor of Editor & Publisher. “The chief similarity is that Americans are still being kept at a distance from images of death, whether of their own soldiers or Iraqi civilians.” The Los Angeles Times released a survey of six months of media coverage of the Iraq war in six prominent U.S. newspapers and two news magazines — a period during which 559 coalition forces, the vast majority American, were killed. It found they had run almost no photographs of Americans killed in action. “So much of the media is owned by big corporations and they would much rather focus on making money than setting themselves up for criticism from the White House and Congress,” said Ralph Begleiter, a former CNN correspondent. In 1945, U.S. policymakers wanted to be able to continue to develop and test atomic and eventually nuclear weapons without an outcry of public opinion. “They succeeded but the subject is still a raw nerve.”

The popo are looking directly at the GD’s and they are looking specifically at the GD’s in Chicago! They are basically suggesting that this is coming from the man Larry Hoover! If that should be the case, s**t would be MAJOR THICK suddenly!

See, what happened – supposedly – is Rick Ross used some of the symbols and and logos of the GDs and didn’t pay the required “fees.” When Ross was in Fort Lauderdale, they opened fire with the AK-47!!!!

There’s another theory of a boss out there that wants Rick Ross’ head on a platter but I’m gonna leave that along.

Mayor ‘Redskins’ Is RACIST … It’s Time for a Change!","It’s damn time the Washington Redskins changed its racist name … at least if the team ever plans to move inside D.C. city limits — so says District mayor Vincent Gray.

Now that the Redskins are winning again, there’s been a lot of talk about bringing the team back to D.C. — instead of leaving them in nearby FedEx Field, located in Maryland.

But Mayor Gray has some conditions before the Redskins move a muscle — claiming, “I think that if they get serious with the team coming back to Washington, there’s no doubt there’s going to have to be a discussion about [changing the team name].”

Gray added, “I think it has become a lightning rod, and I would love to be able to sit down with the team … and see if a change should be made. There’s a precedent for this, and I think there needs to be a dispassionate discussion about this, and do the right thing.”

There’s no question, the term “redskins” is flat-out racist … but we still gotta ask …#LOZR

Before Brown punched him, Ocean admitted to excusing Brown of taking his parking spot and not being willing to shake his hand to reconcile.

After taking a blow to the face, the “Novacane” singer told police he found himself in a corner with Brown‘s homies attempting to kick him.

Frank is unsure who made the f*ggot comment, but he did report that Chris threaten to shoot him by saying, “We can bust on you too!”

Overall, Ocean remembers the fight lasting two to three minutes. He endured minor injuries.

On Frank‘s blog he said he has no plans to press charges, however, he did tell the police he wants to see Breezy in jail. Hmmm.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/wesley-snipes-released-from-prison/","Wesley Snipes Released From Prison!","Wesley Snipes Out Of Prison!

Actor Wesley Snipes has reportedly been released from prison since April 2nd…..just in time for tax season!

He will be on house arrest until April 19th.

Story Below:

Wesley Snipes is a free man… mostly. TMZ is reporting that the 50-year-old film actor has been released from prison. According to the popular site, Snipes was released on April 2 and transferred to the New York Community Corrections Office. He will be on house arrest thereafter until July 19.

If my math is correct, that means that Snipes served 845 days (remember 2012 was a leap year) of his three-year sentence. He was originally slated to be released on July 19, 2013, which means he served nearly 90% of his sentence (I’m going to assume some credit for time served and good behavior).

The Wesley Snipes saga began in 2006 when he was accused of tax fraud. He was originally indicted on charges of attempting to claim nearly $12 million in fraudulent tax refunds and not filing any tax returns for several years. Snipes’ first attorney, Billy Martin, said in a statement at the time, “We believe the evidence in the case will show he has been the victim of unscrupulous tax advice. And this trial will help vindicate him.”

The matter did go to trial in 2008. Despite a lengthy list of potential witnesses, and claims that the defense to the trial could take up to a month, the Snipes defense team rested – after less than an hour – without offering any witnesses. The defense felt pretty confident that the government had not proved its burden, saying: “We could have put on a big show, but we don’t do that. We’re not going to waste the jury’s time.” In contrast, the week before, IRS agent Steward Stich testified that Snipes earned almost $40 million in the years 1999 through 2004 and failed to file tax returns or pay any taxes on that income. He also alleged that Snipes also tried to have almost $12 million in taxes paid in prior years 1996 and 1997 refunded to him.

Snipes pleaded not guilty on all counts. He was eventually acquitted of felony federal tax fraud and conspiracy charges. Snipes was, however, convicted of failing to file tax returns from 1999 to 2004, which were misdemeanor charges. He faced up to three years in prison for the failure to file and he received the maximum sentence.

Snipes’ co-defendants and financial/tax “advisors”, Eddie Ray Kahn and Douglas P. Rosile, were convicted by the same jury of tax fraud and conspiracy. Kahn, a former CPA who is no longer allowed to practice in Florida and Ohio, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and Rosile was sentenced to four and half years in prison.

After his conviction, Snipes immediately promised an appeal, which he delivered (more than once) claiming, among other pleadings and filings that his sentence was unreasonable, that his defense was lacking and that he was not able to get a fair trial in “racist” Ocala, Florida, which Snipes had previously referred to as a “hotbed of KKK activity.” He was originally slated to report to prison on June 3, 2008, but that was delayed, pending the outcome of the appeal. His request for a new trial was denied on November 19, 2010, and he subsequently reported to prison on December 9, 2010, at McKean Federal Correctional Institution, in northwest Pennsylvania.

That wasn’t the last of Snipes’ arguments, however. While serving time, Snipes appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 6, 2011, Snipes’ petition for certiorari was denied, which means that the Supreme Court declined to hear the matter. With that, the appeals officially came to an end. Snipes remained in custody until this week.

It’s worth noting that, at the time of the initial allegations, Snipes was filming a movie, “Gallowwalkers” in Namibia. The film, summarized as “[a] cursed gunman (Snipes) whose victims come back from the dead recruits a young warrior to help in the fight against a gang of zombies” was released in the U.K. in 2012 and is scheduled to be released in the U.S. in 2013. No actual release date has been noted (IMDB just says “2013″) and the website for the film remains a blank screen. Likewise, the link to the trailer now says “this video does not exist.” A movie poster was released just last month (you can see it here). Speculation had been building that the release of the film might just coincide with Snipes’ release. I guess now we’ll see.

Frank Ocean is expected to move forward with pressing assault charges against Chris Brown — after the recent brawl between the pair(Click Here) broke out at Westlake Recording Studios, Sunday. While Breezy continues to maintain a story of being ambushed, Frank Ocean says Chris threw the first punch.

Now, LAPD is reported to be looking to question Breezy over the incident.

Sources say the tension may have all been sparked over…get this, a parking spot! After the incident, Frank Ocean – who, unlike Chris – remained on scene to speak with responding cops – took to Twitter to talk about the fight.

Here’s what Frank Ocean had to say, wishing his Bernese Mountain Dog “Everest” were there to protect him:

“got jumped by chris and a couple guys. lol. i only wish everest was there.”

Here’s what’s being reported:

“Last night, tensions between Frank Ocean and Chris Brown mounted after the two engaged in a skirmish at a studio in Los Angeles, California. According to NY Post, the Odd Future crooner is looking to press charges against Brown for “punching him and starting an all-out brawl” outside of Westlake Studios. Police claim that Ocean is “desirous of prosecution” and that they’re looking to question Brown, who is on probation until August 2014, stemming from his beating Rihanna in 2009.

Was Frank Ocean advised by higher-ups in the entertainment industry to press charges? Of course. Don’t believe me..

Here’s what Gunplay had to say:

“He good, he good. Rozay is good, man. He’s unfuckwitable, man. It’s the untouchable Maybach, man. You don’t understand. It’s for real, for real, though.”

Plans To Fight Louisiana Charges","Lil Flip is vowing to fight recent drug and gun charges. As we previously reported, the 31-year old Houston rapper was pulled over in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana on December 25, for speeding.

During a search of his 2010 Dodge Challenger, deputies reportedly found weed and a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle. Flip was arrested and booked on charges of third-offense possession of marijuana, possession of a firearm in the presence of a controlled dangerous substance, and speeding

During a new interview with TMZ, Flip said he has a license to carry the weapon, which he claims is not automatic firing and there was no weed in the car. He said police found “Black and Mild” wine flavored cigars and clove cigarettes

Flip, real name Wesley Eric Weston, says he is “not one of those rappers who would carry drugs on me. I know better.”

The rapper also presented TMZ wirh a copy of his concealed handgun license, which he says is also valid in 22 other states, including Louisiana. He said he has been shot before and as an entertainer needs a gun for protection.

“I know they don’t mess around in Louisiana and I wouldn’t do anything to make me go to the big house. Especially on Christmas night,” he told TMZ.

Flip plans on pleading not guilty to all charges.","2013-01-02 00:00:00","0","13.0","18.0","3.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","36.0","30.0","0.0","86.0","5.0","1.0","1","224","85.31","63.97","14.80","6.15","20.36","20.09","74.11","45.54","10.27","7.59","2.23","0.45","0.00","4.46","0.45","2.68","6.70","14.73","6.25","2.23","5.80","2.68","13.39","4.46","2.23","1.34","3.12","0.45","4.46","1.34","3.12","0.45","1.79","0.00","9.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.46","7.14","1.79","0.89","1.34","0.45","0.89","1.79","3.57","0.89","2.23","0.00","2.23","0.00","1.79","0.00","1.34","5.80","0.45","1.34","3.12","0.45","0.89","4.91","7.59","0.45","14.73","2.23","6.70","5.80","3.12","1.79","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.62","4.91","5.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.34","2.68","0.89","0.00","0.00","998","7.78","22.6","309","221","11","67.99","11.6","8.8","10.15","10.9","44","12.75","18.00380090497738","144","20.5","7","0.43","0","9","6","18","0","25","16","0","0","1","33","27","0","9","0","0","15","2","9","0","0","1","5","0","6","12","4","7","6","11","2","1","0","0"
"http://tmzbreaking.com/dayummmm-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-faces-1-billion-dollar-tax-bill/","DAYUMMMM! Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Faces $1 Billion Dollar Tax Bill","Facebook’s stock market debut left founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg with a paper fortune currently valued at $13 billion — and a 2012 tax bill of around $1.1 billion.

Zuckerberg’s whopping tax hit stems from his move last May to increase his stake in Facebook. On the day of Facebook’s initial public offering, Zuckerberg exercised a stock option and purchased 60 million Facebook shares at a “strike price” of 6 cents each.

Even if those shares are never sold, the IRS treats them as ordinary income at the time the options are exercised. The rationale is that such options are a form of compensation, just like regular wages.

For Zuckerberg, that means reporting income last year of nearly $2.3 billion from his stock options alone. Add together the top 2012 federal tax rate of 35% and the top California rate of 13.3% — the highest in the nation — and you get a total tax rate of 48.3%.

That’s before factoring in some deductions and any other income Zuckerberg collected last year. Only Uncle Sam and California’s tax agency know exactly what’s in Zuckerberg’s return, but three California CPAs that CNNMoney consulted ran the numbers and believe Zuckerberg’s bill for the year will probably exceed $1 billion.

That’s really unusual … even for billionaires.

“With numbers that large, it’s usually capital gains, not ordinary income,” said Toby Johnston, a partner at tax firm Moss Adams LLP‘s Silicon Valley office who works with wealthy clients. Investors profiting off their gains paid a significantly lower tax rate last year than Facebook’s founder will. The highest federal capital gains rate in 2012 was 15%. It goes up to 23.8% (including a Medicare surtax) this year.

The Internal Revenue Service doesn’t comment on the returns of individual taxpayers, but each year it releases aggregate data on the 400 U.S. tax filers with the largest reported incomes. Theaverage top earner had income of $202 million and a federal income tax bill of $41 million for 2009, the most recent data available.

A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on Zuckerberg’s taxes.

To cover the giant bill he knew was coming, Zuckerberg dipped into his trove of Facebook stock. He sold 30.2 million shares during Facebook’s IPO, taking in $1.135 billion. At the time, Facebook said in a regulatory filing that Zuckerberg planned to use the “substantial majority” of those proceeds to cover the taxes on his stock-option purchase.

And Zuckerberg has another big tax hit looming: He is still sitting on 60 million unexercised options that expire in late 2015. At Facebook’s (FB) current share price, those options would generate taxable income of $1.6 billion if he cashed them in. If he cashed then in today at current tax rates, that would amount to a $826 million bill.

The U.S. Treasury will benefit from Zuckerberg’s taxes. So will California, which is getting awindfall as thousands of Facebook employees cash in on stock grants and options. California expects to collect roughly $1.5 billion in tax revenue tied to Facebook’s IPO, according to the latest estimate from the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office.

So how do you pay a tax bill that’s bigger than some nations’ entire annual GDP? (We’re looking at you, Grenada.)

California requires an electronic payment for all tax bills larger than $80,000, but the IRS will take a paper check for any amount.

Watching a sum that big vanish from your bank account sounds scary, right? The flip side is that at least you can afford it.

“Most people are thrilled, to tell you the truth,” said Stan Pollock, a San Francisco area accountant who specializes in handling tax issues for tech workers. “I have had very few clients that get these huge windfalls who have resented paying the tax. They know they got lucky.”","2013-03-29 00:00:00","0","41.0","35.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","67.0","41.0","0.0","164.0","7.0","22.0","6","629","93.57","74.80","16.94","49.44","18.50","25.44","77.90","38.47","8.27","3.66","0.16","0.16","0.95","1.59","0.79","4.61","7.31","13.35","4.93","2.54","3.66","0.48","10.33","4.93","3.34","0.95","6.84","2.86","2.54","1.91","0.64","0.16","0.16","0.32","8.11","0.16","0.16","0.00","1.75","8.27","1.27","0.79","1.11","3.50","0.95","1.91","1.11","0.32","0.79","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","8.11","2.23","1.75","3.18","2.07","0.00","2.38","6.52","1.59","14.63","0.79","8.90","4.93","9.54","1.27","0.00","10.17","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.24","5.88","3.97","0.16","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.16","1.75","3.50","0.95","2.54","2992","7.76","19.441176470588236","916","630","41","64.3","10.3","8.1","11.19","9.9","134","8.6","16.66793650793651","344","18.09","14","0.39","0","14","50","59","0","77","52","3","6","8","111","70","0","40","0","0","20","7","22","0","1","1","11","0","15","23","15","9","17","16","9","4","0","1"
"http://tmzbreaking.com/meek-miilz-is-suing-the-philadelphia-police-department/","Meek Millz Is Suing The Philadelphia Police Department","Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill is suing the Philadelphia Police Department, after being jailed for nine hours without cause, stemming from an October 31 traffic stop.

Robert Williams aka Meek Mill, filed the lawsuit against police officers Andre Boyer and Michael Vargas, in Federal Court in Philadelphia on Monday (January 14).

Court documents state that “on October 31, 2012, at approximately 7:30 p.m., plaintiff was driving a Range Rover SUV when Philadelphia Police Officers Andre Boyer and Michael Vargas, without cause or justification, conducted a motor vehicle stop in the area of 11th Street and Girard Avenue in Philadelphia.”

“Following the vehicle stop, police officers Boyer and Vargas handcuffed plaintiff at the scene, transported him in custody to the 22nd Police District, took photographs of plaintiff which the officers posted and published, or caused to be posted and published, on Instagram and other social media websites, depicting plaintiff in police custody, held plaintiff in custody against his will in a jail cell for approximately nine (9) hours, after which time plaintiff was released on November 1, 2012, at 4:30 a.m., without being charged with any criminal activity and having caused plaintiff to miss a scheduled promotional appearance in Atlanta, Georgia.”

Meek says that the arrest’s timing caused him to refund “his deposit for the private jet that was booked to fly plaintiff in the evening of October 31, 2012 to a promotional appearance in Atlanta,” and cost him “the loss of numerous sponsorships and endorsements.

Meek is also suing for “anxiety and embarrassment associated with plaintiff being placed in a false light; and the anxiety and embarrassment of being seized, detained, confined and imprisoned against plaintiff’s will.”

Meek is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for civil rights violations, false imprisonment, invasion of privacy and civil conspiracy.

In the lawsuit, Meek’s attorney makes it clear that this has been a practice of the Philadelphia Police Department and that the stops have been racial in nature, much like the “stop and frisks” in New York City.

“Prior to October 31, 2012, the defendant City of Philadelphia, through the high command of the Philadelphia Police Department, implemented and enforced a policy and practice of stops, frisks, searches and detentions of persons, including plaintiff, without probable cause or reasonable suspicion as required by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1 section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution”

“The stops, frisks, searches and detentions by Philadelphia Police

Department officers are often based on constitutionally impermissible considerations of race and/or national origin in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The victims of such racial and/or national origin profiling are principally African-American and Latino.”

Anyway, the official world right now is that they are just friends, but I don’t believe that BS and sources maintain that something significant happened as the new year rang in.

If he did, what would have been a routine car accident with no injuries would now be considered a hit-and-run.

Brown and girlfriend Karrueche Tran were riding in Los Angeles on Tuesday May 21st, when Brown rear ended another vehicle. According to TMZ, the singer gave the other driver false insurance information and refused to give her his driver’s license number.



Chris is on probation for assaulting Rihanna in 2009. If the police find that he broke the law by leaving the scene of an accident without fully disclosing all of the information required by law, his probation could be violated. As a result Chris could be sentenced to up to four years in prison.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/sad-statistics-more-u-s-troops-committed-suicide-in-2012-than-were-killed-in-the-afghanistan-war-video/","Sad Statistics: More U.S. Troops Committed Suicide In 2012 Than Were Killed In The Afghanistan War [Video]","U.S. soldiers are committing suicide at an alarming rate. NBC News reports that through November 2012, 177 active-duty soldiers had committed suicide. In all of 2012, 176 soldiers were killed in action while serving in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

Russia Today reports the suicide rate is much higher when you take into account soldiers who have returned home from combat. According to their report, nearly 500 American troops and veterans took their own lives last year.

Many soldiers feel they will be looked at as being weak or denied promotion if they seek mental health aid. Families of some suicide victims blame the military for not doing enough to help troops deal with the stress of combat.

“The Pentagon hasn’t spent the money that it has for suicide prevention for this year — and that money wasn’t nearly enough money to reach all the soldiers who need help. Now we are hearing about bureaucratic technicalities at the Pentagon that are preventing them from acting. This is unconscionable,” Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Washington, told NBC. “The Pentagon is funded to help soldiers and needs to do much more on the epidemic of suicides.”

The Department of Defense says that they are working on this growing epidemic and that “anti-suicide programs installed throughout the armed services soon will curb military suicides — and that such initiatives already have helped douse mental-health stigmas.”

“We have seen several programs that we are optimistic are going to start making a dent in this issue,” said Jackie Garrick, acting director of the DOD suicide prevention office. “We’ve asked all of the services to use the same messaging, the same talking points. So the Army, included in that, is trying to adapt and promote those same messages because we realize that this is an across-the-board problem.”

Tim Kenney of the Army National Guard says that he battled suicidal thoughts when he returned home from the war, but was able to overcome them. He thinks many servicemen have a hard time adjusting back into civilian life.

“What these guys end up doing is I think is they feel ‘I can’t cope anymore with civilian life.’ A lot of guys end up killing themselves because they don’t think they will ever fit back into normal society,” Kenney told Russia Today.

RELATED: ARE WE BEING LIED 2?? WERE THERE 3 SHOOTERS IN THE SANDY HOOK MASSACRE??(VIDEO)

The net is flooding with conspiracy theory about this shooting. Most of them are total bunk. However there are major issues with the initial, and evolved reports; and indeed something is not passing the sniff test for me either.



We are going to thin it down to the pertinent ones; can you think of any to add to the list? Starting with…. why the pictures of a 20 year old shooter as a child? Where’s the recent pics?

1.) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was found with his older brother’s ID, and it was not stolen. However, older brother Ryan–who officials say is very cooperative–claims not to have even seen his brother since 2010. Where would Adam get this ID?

2.) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was wearing a black outfit with a mask and bulletproof vest. Why would he want to hide his identity, and why would he wear a bulletproof vest, if he planned to kill himself?

3.) Where did he get the bulletproof vest? Guns stolen from Mom – vest too? If so, why did she need one?

4.) The medical examiner asserts that all wounds were caused by a rifle or other long weapon, and police/FBI say that the school was littered with .223 (rifle) casings. But Adam Lanza was found dead in the school with only handguns. The police stated a rifle (long gun) was found in the trunk of his car. But now claim that’s the murder weapon?

4-b) What did he kill himself with? Kinda hard to use a .223 long gun.

5.) According to the official story, the killing was tightly confined to two classrooms, near the front door and office. So why were so many children told to close their eyes while leaving the building through other exits where nothing was even close?

5-b) Why were the kids in the Gym told to cover their eyes exiting the back of the building?

6.) Why were there such persistent reports that Mrs. Lanza was a kindergarten teacher, and that she died at the school, when the new official story is that she was not connected to the school and was killed at home?

7.) What happened to the report that Adam Lanza’s girlfriend and another friend were missing in New Jersey?

8.) What happened to the woodsman in a black jacket and camo pants who was arrested and handcuffed outside the school? Seen in overhead helicopter media reporting. He actually shouted to parents, “It wasn’t me.” Who was he and what was he doing there?

9.) The official story is that Nancy Lanza was a gun collector who obeyed the law. It appears she was diligent in her firearm responsibility. But since 20-year-olds are not permitted to buy guns or ammo or carry guns in Connecticut, why would she give her “autistic” son easy access to both guns and ammo?

Last night it also emerged Nancy was a member of the Doomsday Preppers movement, which believes people should prepare for end of the world. Her former sister-in-law Marsha said she had turned her home ‘into a fortress’. She added: ‘Nancy had a survivalist philosophy which is why she was stockpiling guns. She had them for defense. ‘She was stockpiling food. She grew up on a farm in New Hampshire. She was skilled with guns. We talked about preppers and preparing for the economy collapsing.’

9-b) The baby sitter for Adam (when he was 10) said mom was insistent he never be left alone for a second – even in the bathroom. But yet mom never secured the weapons?

9-c) How come in such a “small town” we have not heard about Adam Lanza’s primary care physician? Psychiatrist? Psychologist?

10) Would real parents of real children aged 6-7 really be satisfied with pictures of their children? Wouldn’t they demand to see their children one last time firsthand?

10-a) Not even one parent, just one, wanted to see their child?

11) According to the official story, 28 people died only 1 was wounded. The dead included 20 small, squirmy children — difficult targets even for professionals. How could Adam Lanza achieve such amazingly deadly accuracy, in such a short length of recorded time?

12) When Ryan Lanza was falsely identified as the shooter, who deleted his Facebook profile? How did it reappear when he was in custody?

Ryan, 24, who was originally thought to have been the shooter, was being questioned by police after he was arrested at his home in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was on a bus on his way home from work when he was being named as the gunman and posted on Facebook that it wasn’t him. Ryan Lanza had been extremely cooperative and was not under arrest or in custody by Saturday morning, but investigators were still searching his computers and phone records. He told law enforcement he had not been in touch with his brother since about 2010.

13) Why did the police say on Friday that they were going to leave the bodies in the school until Sunday, then Saturday morning announce that they had spirited the bodies away in the middle of the night? Perhaps to ensure that the transport, if any, would go unrecorded on photos or video?

14.) With a bazillion media there, staked out anyway, how did they pull off the body transport without even a single highpower telephoto lens photo? You know some media would have staked out the morgue too?

15) Did the school have one or more security cameras CCTV? You would think with a “buzz-in” entry system they would have at least one camera on the door, no?

16 ) Why is Adam Lanza reported to be a loner when a teenager said (oxymoronically), “[Lanza and his friends] always gathered alone in a corner in school”?

‘Everyone just assumed he was a smart kid and that’s why he didn’t like talking to people all the time,’ Peter Lalli, 20, who graduated with Lanza in 2010, told the New York Daily News. ‘He hung out with the smart crowd.’

17) Why did police assign an individual state trooper to every grieving family? Has this ever been done before? Media concern?

18) Why are Ryan Lanza and his roommates still in custody, and why are the police pretending that it’s for their own benefit?

19) Is it a coincidence that Nancy Lanza’s brother is Kingston Police Officer James Champion, who lives next door to the former Lanza home?

20) What “exactly” did Nancy Lanza do for a living? Retired or not, how come not a single current or former co-worker is in the media talking about her?

"http://politicalblindspot.com/native-american-grandmas-capture-the-flag-from-neo-nazis-in-north-dakota/","Native American Grandmas ‘Capture the Flag’ From Neo-Nazis in North Dakota","We have reported on the recent protests against Neo-Nazi groups who have joined together in an attempt to take over the small town of Leith, North Dakota. The small town has only one African American resident holding out and refusing to give in to the intimidation. While he says he’s not moving, he is only one problem for the Neo-Nazi fascists.

Leith is right next to the Standing Rock Indian Nation, and as of last Sunday, Leith has seen scores of Native American and other Anti-Racist and Anti-Fascist protestors swarming the town in an attempt to show the Nazis that they are not going to be intimidated nor driven out by any hate group.

Perhaps the highlight of the protests was when four Native American grandmothers came together to play an improv “game” of “capture the flag” from the Nazis.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/how-a-wealthy-clean-cut-duck-dynasty-tricked-the-world-for-publicity/","How A Wealthy, Clean-Cut ‘Duck Dynasty’ Tricked The World For Publicity","In the wake of the recent homophobia and racism scandals surrounding A&E’s popular so-called “reality” show Duck Dynasty, there is an important, little-known detail that should be remembered: it’s all fake… all of it.

Sources close to the show have time and time again leaked details that the show is literally scripted. Because of non-disclosure agreements, cameramen, and others who wish to go public with this information have proven unable to do so. As a result, without a name attached to such leaked information, many of these claims of inauthenticity are seen as lacking credibility.

But as the saying goes, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” One thing that the so-called “Duck Dynasty” family cannot deny are family pictures taken before their fabricated “reality” show was scripted for them. These pictures all showcase a family devoid of backwoods attire: no camouflage, no face paint, no headbands, and no beards.

In the place of Real Tree camo shotguns, we see the family above with golf clubs.

Below is the real Jase Robertson and Family. They look like any other clean-cut wealthy Caucasian family. Admittedly, we see a very trim, socially acceptable beard in this picture… nothing like the costumes the family dons for the popular A&E show.

Here are Jase and Missy Robertson. Jase is a whole lot hairier and a whole lot richer.

But Jase isn’t the only one pulling the proverbial wool over viewers’ eyes. Willie Robertson too used to look a whole lot more like everyone else in his socio-economic caste. Instead of camo, we see hair bleach. And we are supposed to believe that these were backwards hill-folk, who raised themselves up from the trailer park?

You’ve seen the before image, now here’s the after:

These guys aren’t alone with the fakery. Below is a picture of the real Jep Robertson and family.

Here’s Jep now, after the A&E treatment:

The costumes are for show, the beards and bandanas are for show – and more than likely, even the recent “scandals” are for show. We have recently learned that A&E will keep Phil Robertson even after previously announcing he would be kicked off the show for breach of contract, due to racist and homophobic comments. In all likelihood, the scandals were part of a well-orchestrated hoax to get even more ratings, even more attention, and ultimately, even more money for this already filthy-rich family.

Remember, that while this fake scandal was front page news, the NDAA was passed without a peep from the mainstream media. The bill which is infamous for its language regarding “disappearing” U.S. citizens and indefinite detention was passed via “Fast-Tracking” while a huge number of Americans were distracted by the Phil Robertson “scandal.” Let’s stop giving this Schmuck Dynasty the attention and money that they so obviously don’t deserve.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/terror-nail-bomb-explodes-at-mosque-media-barely-mentions/","‘Terror nail bomb’ explodes at mosque, media barely mentions…","A major atrocity was narrowly averted yesterday after a large nail bomb exploded outside a mosque just two hours after the funeral of terror victim Lee Rigby. A West Midlands Police spokesperson confirmed counter-terrorism officers had been dispatched to the scene…

The homemade device exploded near the Kanz Ul Iman Masjid mosque in Tipton, West Midlands, shortly after 1pm – when up to 200 worshippers would normally have been in the area for Friday prayers.

However, the prayers had been moved back an hour because of Ramadan and no one was injured in the blast.

The bomb, which was left on a disused railway line behind the mosque, showered the area with nails and other debris.

Police were last night treating the explosion as a terrorist incident and were investigating whether there are any links to a small explosion near a mosque in nearby Walsall last month.

Officers were also examining whether there is any connection to right wing extremists.

It was being treated as a suspected terror attack because of the size of the explosion, the fact nails were included and it appeared to have been timed to coincide with the Friday prayers.

One police source said such factors “appear to indicate at this stage intent to cause serious injury or damage”.

Residents in Tipton believed the attack had also been timed to coincide with the day of the funeral of Drummer Rigby in Bury.

The soldier died in an alleged Islamic terror attack in Woolwich, east London, in May.

Police in Tipton cordoned off an area of up to half a mile around Binfield Street while forensic experts, bomb specialists and counter-terrorism officers examined the scene.

Residents reported finding nails in gardens several hundred yards away.

Adrian Bailey, the local MP, said: “Given that it is Drummer Lee Rigby’s funeral today, and previous attacks at mosques across the country, it certainly seems that this may have been connected in some way.

“A nail bomb had exploded shortly after 1pm, when the mosque is usually at full capacity, but fortunately, as it is Ramadan, prayer times have changed and the devastation and potential loss of life that may have been suffered was avoided.

“At the early stages, everything points towards this being a premeditated attack.”

The attack came just two weeks after police arrested a 75-year-old man in connection with another explosion outside a mosque in nearby Walsall.

Mushtaq Hussain, chairman of the Kanzul Iman Mosque was inside the building at the time of the explosion.

He said: “There was huge disruption and somebody told me that there had been an explosion.

“We immediately investigated and alerted police. We tried to remain calm as we weren’t sure what was going on.

“It happened just after one o’clock which on a Friday is the busiest time of the day for our mosque usually.

“If it wasn’t Ramadan there would be at least 200 people here but thankfully at the time there were only a handful of people and everybody escaped without injury.

“If what I’m hearing is correct and it was a targeted attack you can’t help but feel unsafe, worried for your friends, family and your own life.”

Ahmadul Haque, councillor for Tipton, said: “I think it may be a retaliation to Lee Rigby’s funeral today. It seems like it was planned to go off at the busiest time of the day and if that’s the case, we can only be thankful that the timings were wrong.”

Razmullah Khan, 27, a local resident who lives next to the mosque, said: “It’s terrifying to be around, this is a place of worship not a war zone and with what happened in Walsall things are becoming terrifying people are starting to not feel safe about walking down the streets.”

Hartahn Hussain, 23, who prays up to five times a day at the mosque added: “This is a multicultural and cohesive community, there is never any trouble here.

“What’s happened today is completely out of the blue and it’s taken us all by surprise.

“We’re all completely shocked and each time I’ll be going to pray in future I’ll be worried and looking over my shoulder.”

In a joint statement, the board of trustees and management committee of the Kanz Ul Iman Masjid mosque said: “We express our deep shock and utter dismay regarding the incident that has occurred this afternoon. We jointly on behalf of the local community condemn this senseless and mindless act. It’s a blessing from God that thankfully no one was injured in the blast.

Speaking at a press conference, Assistant Chief Constable Gareth Cann said: “Just after 1pm today a member of the public phoned 999 and reported a loud bang close to the mosque.

“As a result of this, officers initiated a search of the area, and people started to report finding debris and nails in the area.

“People were evacuated and a cordon was put in place while officers worked with the army bomb disposal experts and specialist officers.

“There was minor damage to a nearby home, and the army are still searching the area and I believe that it is ready to be declared safe soon, and we can get people to return home.

“It’s likely that this is an attack given the factors and evidence found already. This includes the loud bang, reports of smoke, the finding of nails and the location of a mosque. From this, we can draw the most likely conclusion that there was a serious explosion and that somebody sought to create a devastating amount of damage.

“We are treating this as a terror attack, but we are still working to establish if this is connected to any other incidents that have occurred.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/texas-police-confirm-george-zimmerman-is-armed-again/","Texas Police Confirm George Zimmerman is ARMED Again","Celebrity gossip site TMZ is reporting that George Zimmerman has been stopped by Texas cops Sunday for speeding. During the traffic stop, Zimmerman revealed to the officer that he did have a gun in his truck’s glove compartment.

Zimmerman was speeding in Forney, Texas on Sunday, just after noon, when he was stopped by police. Zimmerman told cops he was headed “nowhere in particular,” and informed them he had a firearm in his glove compartment. Zimmerman was given a warning, after cops determined he was free of warrants. He was sent on his way with a polite goodbye, “Have a safe trip.”

Jurors have found former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old black teenager Trayvon Martin.

The six-member, all-woman jury deliberated for more than 15 hours over two days before reaching their decision Saturday night.

Zimmerman was to get his gun back from the collection of evidence, but the federal Department of Justice has taken the gun and evidence as part of a federal civil rights investigation.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/texas-swat-raids-organic-farm-over-rumors/","Texas SWAT Raids Organic Farm Over Rumors","Micah Naziri

Everything is bigger in Texas… Even when it comes to violating your civil rights apparently.

Radley Balko, author of the book, Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America’s Police Forces, writes that a small organic farm in Arlington, Texas, was recently the target of a massive police action.

This raid last week included aerial surveillance, and a 10-hour search, all while the farmers faced the barrels of SWAT M4 machine guns and MP5 submachine guns.

Members of the local police raiding party had a search warrant for marijuana plants, which they failed to find at the Garden of Eden farm. But farm owners and residents who live on the property told a Dallas-Ft. Worth NBC station that the real reason for the law enforcement exercise appears to have been code enforcement. The police seized “17 blackberry bushes, 15 okra plants, 14 tomatillo plants … native grasses and sunflowers,” after holding residents inside at gunpoint for at least a half-hour, property owner Shellie Smith said in a statement. The raid lasted about 10 hours, she said.

According to Balko, “local authorities had cited the Garden of Eden in recent weeks for code violations,” including the ever-dubious claim of “grass that was too tall, bushes growing too close to the street,” as well as the classic “couch and piano in the yard.” These egregious violations were nothing compared to the “chopped wood that was not properly stacked,” and the violation borne of “a piece of siding that was missing from the side of the house.”

Shellie Smith’s statement explained that the police refused to produce a warrant for a full two hours. This was well after the raid began. When farmers asked to see their badge numbers, “officers shielded their name tags so they couldn’t be identified.”

In spite of the dastardly crimes of having unstacked wood and tall grass, according to ABC affiliate WFAA, Quinn Eaker was the only resident on the property who was arrested. The charge: outstanding traffic violations.

So this is what it’s come to?

The city of Arlington said that the SWAT raid came after “the Arlington Police Department received a number of complaints that the same property owner was cultivating marijuana plants on the premises.” And yet the police admit that, “No cultivated marijuana plants were located on the premises.”

Balko explains that this is part of a broader trend of militarized SWAT raids for the most trivial of infractions, or simply on the suspicion of wrong-doing.

The raid on the Garden of Eden farm appears to be the latest example of police departments using SWAT teams and paramilitary tactics to enforce less serious crimes. A Fox television affiliate reported this week, for example, that police in St. Louis County, Mo., brought out the SWAT team to serve an administrative warrant. The report went on to explain that all felony warrants are served with a SWAT team, regardless whether the crime being alleged involves violence… Other raids have been conducted on food co-ops and Amish farms suspected of selling unpasteurized milk products. The federal government has for years been conducting raids on medical marijuana dispensaries in states that have legalized them, even though the businesses operate openly and are unlikely to pose any threat to the safety of federal enforcers.

What can we do? First and foremost, we have to get educated. Articles like this and Radley Balko’s book are good places to start. Beyond that, we have to educate others, our families, friends, and/or neighbors. Each one, teach one.

SPREAD THE WORD! NOTHING WILL CHANGE UNTIL WE CHANGE IT!

"http://politicalblindspot.com/syrias-assad-asks-u-n-to-intervene-to-stop-u-s-attack/","Syria’s Assad Asks U.N. to Intervene to Stop U.S. Attack","After Bush and Cheney, Obama and Biden decided to follow in the footsteps of the Bush administration in their rational for a strike on Syria, Bashar al-Assad has asked the United Nations to step in to prevent “any aggression” against Syria.

The Obama administration says more than 1,400 people – including children – have been killed in worst chemical attack since Saddam Hussein gassing of Kurds in 1988.

Syrian U.N. envoy Ambassador Bashar Ja’afari called on the President of the U.N. Security Council, and U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, to “maintain its role as a safety valve to prevent the absurd use of force out of the frame of international legitimacy”.

According to state news agency SANA early this morning, “the U.N. Secretary General to shoulder his responsibilities for preventing any aggression on Syria and pushing forward reaching a political solution to the crisis in Syria”.

Ja’afari said the United States should “play its role, as a peace sponsor and as a partner to Russia in the preparation for the international conference on Syria and not as a state that uses force against whoever opposes its policies”.

Syria has repeatedly denied any role in the chemical attacks and blames its opponents for carrying them out. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that tests have proven the chemical agent was the prohibited sarin gas. But what the substance is hardly proves who released it. Ja’afari said Kerry had “adopted old stories fabricated by terrorists” based on false evidence by proxy of internet rumors.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/snowden-on-the-move/","Snowden On The Move?","Russia’s Federal Migration Service has issued a document saying that the U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden will be allowed to leave Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport in which he’s holed up while he awaits asylum.

Russian media say the migration service issued the document, but the service has not yet commented. He has stayed in transit since arriving from Hong Kong on 23 June, and recently requested temporary asylum in Russia.

The US authorities want him extradited for leaking details of government surveillance programs. Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to hand him to the US authorities, but said he could stay in Russia only if he stopped leaking. Still, it was just announced that Edward Snowden is free to leave the airport, significantly opening up his options for relocating under the radar.

Snowden Timeline

Mr Snowden’s lawyer Anatoly Kucherena arrived at the airport earlier, telling reporters only that he was going to see his client.

Unnamed airport officials later told local media that the lawyer had handed Mr Snowden the documents he needed to leave the airport.

The Interfax news agency reported that the American would be provided with new clothes before leaving the airport.

There was no official comment on news of the pass, which is believed to be an official paper confirming that his asylum application is being considered and allowing him to enter Russian territory.

A number of Latin American states say they are willing to offer Mr Snowden asylum, but he says he first needs Russian asylum in order to be able to travel because the US has cancelled his passport.

The US has charged Mr Snowden with leaking classified information.

Mr Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA) was collecting Americans’ phone records, which civil liberties campaigners say is an unwarranted invasion of privacy.

The White House is urging Congress to reject an attempt to end the practice.

Congressman Justin Amash has introduced an amendment to a defence spending bill that would block funding for the controversial programme. A vote is due shortly.

Other revelations stemming from the leaked documents include allegations that US intelligence agencies have been spying on Latin American politicians and businesses, diplomatic missions and EU offices.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/russia-suggests-that-war-may-be-necessary-to-stop-monsanto/","RUSSIA Suggests that WAR May Be Necessary To Stop MONSANTO","While I was listening to a recent interview with Graham Hancock about his new novel and his TED lecture, the startling claim was made that Russian President Vladimir Putin commented that war might be a necessary result of the Monsanto Protection Act. I was skeptical, but did a little digging around, and it turns out the story checks out…

The shocking minutes relating to President Putin’s meeting last month with US Secretary of State John Kerry reveal the Russian leaders “extreme outrage” over the Obama regimes continued protection of global seed and plant bio-genetic giants Syngenta and Monsanto in the face of a growing “bee apocalypse” that the Kremlin warns “will most certainly” lead to world war.

According to these minutes, released in the Kremlin today by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (MNRE), Putin was so incensed over the Obama regimes refusal to discuss this grave matter that he refused for three hours to even meet with Kerry, who had traveled to Moscow on a scheduled diplomatic mission, but then relented so as to not cause an even greater rift between these two nations.

At the center of this dispute between Russia and the US, this MNRE report says, is the “undisputed evidence” that a class of neuro-active insecticides chemically related to nicotine, known as neonicotinoids, are destroying our planets bee population, and which if left unchecked could destroy our world’s ability to grow enough food to feed its population.

So grave has this situation become, the MNRE reports, the full European Commission (EC) this past week instituted a two-year precautionary ban (set to begin on 1 December 2013) on these “bee killing” pesticides following the lead of Switzerland, France, Italy, Russia, Slovenia and Ukraine, all of whom had previously banned these most dangerous of genetically altered organisms from being used on the continent.

Two of the most feared neonicotinoids being banned are Actara and Cruiser made by the Swiss global bio-tech seed and pesticide giant Syngenta AG which employs over 26,000 people in over 90 countries and ranks third in total global sales in the commercial agricultural seeds market.

Important to note, this report says, is that Syngenta, along with bio-tech giants Monsanto, Bayer, Dow and DuPont, now control nearly 100% of the global market for genetically modified pesticides, plants and seeds.

Also to note about Syngenta, this report continues, is that in 2012 it was criminally charged in Germany for concealing the fact that its genetically modified corn killed cattle, and settled a class-action lawsuit in the US for $105 million after it was discovered they had contaminated the drinking supply of some 52 million Americans in more than 2,000 water districts with its “gender-bending” herbicide Atrazine.

To how staggeringly frightful this situation is, the MNRE says, can be seen in the report issued this past March by the American Bird Conservancy (ABC) wherein they warned our whole planet is in danger, and as we can, in part, read:

“As part of a study on impacts from the world’s most widely used class of insecticides, nicotine-like chemicals called neonicotinoids, American Bird Conservancy (ABC) has called for a ban on their use as seed treatments and for the suspension of all applications pending an independent review of the products’ effects on birds, terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, and other wildlife.

“It is clear that these chemicals have the potential to affect entire food chains. The environmental persistence of the neonicotinoids, their propensity for runoff and for groundwater infiltration, and their cumulative and largely irreversible mode of action in invertebrates raise significant environmental concerns,” said Cynthia Palmer, co-author of the report and Pesticides Program Manager for ABC, one of the nation’s leading bird conservation organizations.

ABC commissioned world renowned environmental toxicologist Dr. Pierre Mineau to conduct the research. The 100-page report, “The Impact of the Nation’s Most Widely Used Insecticides on Birds,” reviews 200 studies on neonicotinoids including industry research obtained through the US Freedom of Information Act. The report evaluates the toxicological risk to birds and aquatic systems and includes extensive comparisons with the older pesticides that the neonicotinoids have replaced. The assessment concludes that the neonicotinoids are lethal to birds and to the aquatic systems on which they depend.

“A single corn kernel coated with a neonicotinoid can kill a songbird,” Palmer said. “Even a tiny grain of wheat or canola treated with the oldest neonicotinoid — called imidacloprid — can fatally poison a bird. And as little as 1/10th of a neonicotinoid-coated corn seed per day during egg-laying season is all that is needed to affect reproduction.”

The new report concludes that neonicotinoid contamination levels in both surface- and ground water in the United States and around the world are already beyond the threshold found to kill many aquatic invertebrates.”

Quickly following this damning report, the MRNE says, a large group of group of American beekeepers and environmentalists sued the Obama regime over the continued use of these neonicotinoids stating: “We are taking the EPA to court for its failure to protect bees from pesticides. Despite our best efforts to warn the agency about the problems posed by neonicotinoids, the EPA continued to ignore the clear warning signs of an agricultural system in trouble.”

And to how bad the world’s agricultural system has really become due to these genetically modified plants, pesticides and seeds, this report continues, can be seen by the EC’s proposal this past week, following their ban on neonicotinoids, in which they plan to criminalize nearly all seeds and plants not registered with the European Union, and as we can, in part, read:

“Europe is rushing towards the good ol days circa 1939, 40… A new law proposed by the European Commission would make it illegal to “grow, reproduce or trade” any vegetable seeds that have not been “tested, approved and accepted” by a new EU bureaucracy named the “EU Plant Variety Agency.” It’s called the Plant Reproductive Material Law, and it attempts to put the government in charge of virtually all plants and seeds. Home gardeners who grow their own plants from non-regulated seeds would be considered criminals under this law.”

This MRNE report points out that even though this EC action may appear draconian, it is nevertheless necessary in order to purge the continent from continued contamination of these genetically bred “seed monstrosities.”

Most perplexing in all of this, the MRNE says, and which led to Putin’s anger at the US, has been the Obama regimes efforts to protect pesticide-producer profits over the catastrophic damaging being done to the environment, and as the Guardian News Service detailed in their 2 May article titled “US rejects EU claim of insecticide as prime reason for bee colony collapse” and which, in part, says:

“The European Union voted this week for a two-year ban on a class of pesticides, known as neonicotinoids, that has been associated with the bees’ collapse. The US government report, in contrast, found multiple causes for the collapse of the honeybees.”

To the “truer” reason for the Obama regimes protection of these bio-tech giants destroying our world, the MRNE says, can be viewed in the report titled “How did Barack Obama become Monsanto’s man in Washington?” and which, in part, says:

“After his victory in the 2008 election, Obama filled key posts with Monsanto people, in federal agencies that wield tremendous force in food issues, the USDA and the FDA: At the USDA, as the director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Roger Beachy, former director of the Monsanto Danforth Center. As deputy commissioner of the FDA, the new food-safety-issues czar, the infamous Michael Taylor, former vice-president for public policy for Monsanto. Taylor had been instrumental in getting approval for Monsanto’s genetically engineered bovine growth hormone.”

Even worse, after Russia suspended the import and use of an Monsanto genetically modified corn following a study suggesting a link to breast cancer and organ damage this past September, the Russia Today News Service reported on the Obama regimes response:

“The US House of Representatives quietly passed a last-minute addition to the Agricultural Appropriations Bill for 2013 last week – including a provision protecting genetically modified seeds from litigation in the face of health risks. The rider, which is officially known as the Farmer Assurance Provision, has been derided by opponents of biotech lobbying as the “Monsanto Protection Act,” as it would strip federal courts of the authority to immediately halt the planting and sale of genetically modified (GMO) seed crop regardless of any consumer health concerns. The provision, also decried as a “biotech rider,” should have gone through the Agricultural or Judiciary Committees for review. Instead, no hearings were held, and the piece was evidently unknown to most Democrats (who hold the majority in the Senate) prior to its approval as part of HR 993, the short-term funding bill that was approved to avoid a federal government shutdown.”

On 26 March, Obama quietly signed this “Monsanto Protection Act” into law thus ensuring the American people have no recourse against this bio-tech giant as they fall ill by the tens of millions, and many millions will surely end up dying in what this MRNE report calls the greatest agricultural apocalypse in human history as over 90% of feral (wild) bee population in the US has already died out, and up to 80% of domestic bees have died out too.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/saudi-government-websites-hacked/","Sa`udi Government Websites Hacked","Reuters

RIYADH – Several government websites in Saudi Arabia were sabotaged in a series of heavy cyber attacks from abroad in recent days, disabling them briefly until the attacks were repelled, the government said.

An investigation traced the “coordinated and simultaneous attacks” to hundreds of Internet protocol addresses in a number of countries, an unnamed source at the Saudi Interior Ministry told state news agency SPA.

The interior ministry website crashed on Wednesday after it received a “huge amount” of service requests, but was back online less than two hours later after the “necessary technical drills” were performed to counter the attack, the source said.

The report made no mention of a possible motive.

Businesses, government agencies and critical infrastructure operators face unprecedented challenges from increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks launched by criminals, hacker activists and foreign governments.

An attack last year on national oil company Saudi Aramco – the world’s biggest oil company – damaged some 30,000 computers and was one of the most destructive cyber strikes conducted against a single business.

That attack used a computer virus known as Shamoon. A group that claimed responsibility said Saudi Aramco was the main source of income for the Saudi government, which it blamed for “crimes and atrocities” in several countries including Syria and Bahrain.

On Friday, the website and Twitter feed of the Financial Times newspaper were hacked, apparently by the “Syrian Electronic Army”, a group of online activists who say they supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Transcript:

It is a name that Americans are hearing more and more, Monsanto.

An agriculture company that has become connected to the term GMO’s. So what is Monsanto? What exactly are GMO’s? and why are people so up in arms about a company that grows food?

And the big question, is Monsanto one of the best examples of America’s crony capitalist system?

The first step toward truth is to inform.

If the name Monsanto is not familiar to you, lets get you caught up.

According to Monsanto’s website,

“Monsanto is a sustainable agriculture company. We deliver agricultural products that support farmers all around the world. We are focused on empowering farmers—large and small—to produce more from their land while conserving more of our world’s natural resources such as water and energy. We do this with our leading seed brands in crops like corn, cotton, oilseeds and fruits and vegetables.”

Sounds pretty good.

In short, Monsanto is company that among other things, produces the herbicide roundup. But the controversy surrounding Monsanto begins with their development of genetically modified seeds or GMOs that are called “round up ready”. Round up ready crops are reportedly more resistant to weed killer and insects.

According to Natural News, a growing body of evidence does connect GMOs with health problems, environmental damage and violation of farmers’ and consumers’ rights.

According to professor John Fagan, an award winning geneticist:

“The process of genetic engineering always involves the risk of altering the genetics and cellular functioning of a food organism in unanticipated ways. These unanticipated alterations can result in (GMO) foods being allergenic, toxic, or reduced in nutritional value”. – Professor John Fagan, Maharishi University of Management, Iowa

Concerns like those have pushed millions worldwide into the streets to protest Monsanto and their GMOs. In May 2013, two million people in over 50 countries expressed outrage over a number of issues surrounding Monsanto.

The first issue with Monsanto is the safety of those GMOs. But there is more.

While there is growing concern over the safety of GMOs, the United States for all of the requirements placed on the food industry, requires no GMO food labeling.

Whether you agree or disagree on whether or not GMO’s are dangerous, 64 other countries require GMO labeling. Again, the United states does not. Could it be that most Americans just don’t care? Actually no. Despite the lack of political will on this issue, a poll, conducted earlier this year by The New York Times found that three-quarters of Americans are concerned about the number of genetically modified or engineered foods. What’s more, a staggering 93% support mandatory labeling of GMO foods.



So to recap, first, there is the concern over GMOs. Second the concerns over labeling and third, there is the issue of Monsanto holding a patent on all of its seeds.

Monsanto explains on their website the need for that patents saying,

“Monsanto patents many of the seed varieties we develop. Patents are necessary to ensure that we are paid for our products and for all the investments we put into developing these products. This is one of the basic reasons for patents. … Monsanto invests more than $2.6 million per day in research and development that ultimately benefits farmers and consumers. Without the protection of patents, this would not be possible.”

You see, when a farmer purchases these genetically modified seeds from Monsanto, they sign a signed a licensing agreement promising to use all the seed and not to use any regenerated seed for future.

So to recap… the issues with Monsanto, questions about the safety of GMOs are out there though we should be clear. there are those who argue that GMO’s are perfectly safe and no issues with consuming them. There are questions about labeling. Regardless of whether GMOs are good or bad shouldn’t the public have the right to know what they are putting in their bodies and have the right to consume or walk away? And questions about the ability of a corporation to be able to patent seeds, preventing farmers from replanting crops without paying a fee?

Ben Swann Monsanto Reality Check

What you need to know, is that all those questions may actually be secondary to this one, is the biggest problem with a company like Monsanto its relationship with government?

In the early 1990’s the FDA took a look at these genetically modified foods. There were a lot of concerns including tests that showed rats were developing stomach lesions from the Genetically modified tomatoes they were fed. According to Jeffery Smith at the Huffington Post, in memo after memo, these experts “described toxins, new diseases, nutritional deficiencies, and hard-to-detect allergens,”

So what changed? In 1994 the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service hired a new administrator, Mike Taylor.

Taylor had worked for the FDA in the 1970’s and then in the 1980’s he became a private sector lawyer for a firm that represented Monsanto.

In 1994 Taylor takes over the FSIS and remains in that post until 1996.

1996, GMO foods began showing up on plates in American homes.

After 1996 Mike Taylor goes back into the private sector and goes to work for Monsanto itself.

For the next 16 months he works directly for the company.

In 2009 returns to the public sector now leading the food side of the FDA.

In fairness, Mike Taylor says he is not Monsanto’s man. That claims that he is bought and paid for could not be further from the truth.

In fairness, I don’t know if that is true or not. What I do know is that regardless of whether or not its true the revolving door of government and private sector and the advantages big corporations have in the system is undeniable.

Monsanto’s influence over food supply is troubling. Their ability to seemingly prevent GMO labeling also troubling. Their connections with people like Mike Taylor who have the ability to control what does and does not show up on our families tables, sure smells like crony capitalism and that is Reality Check.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/occupation-2024-u-s-troops-arent-leaving-afghanistan-next-year/","Occupation 2024: U.S. Troops Aren’t Leaving Afghanistan Next Year","This week, the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced startling news that the United States and Afghanistan had finalized an agreement that could see American military presence in Afghanistan until 2024. This received virtually no attention in the mainstream corporate media. What does Afghanistan get out of this deal? In short: billions of dollars of international assistance will continue to flow into Kabul bank accounts.

The deal was approved by an Afghan grand council of elders starting today. President Hamid Karzai, for his part, demanded that U.S. President Obama write a letter acknowledging American military mistakes over the past 12 years of military presence in the region. This was apparently too much for President Obama, as Wednesday, Kerry insisted that the deal was reached without such an apology.

In fact, Kerry asserts, “President Karzai didn’t ask for an apology,” he claimed, “There was no discussion of an apology. I mean, it’s just not even on the table.”

Now the draft continues with the Afghan loya jirga, for further refinement. The original language of the security agreement that was posted on the Afghan Foreign Ministry website last night was substantially different from earlier versions given to journalists.

While Kerry insisted there would be no White House apology for illegal actions in Afghanistan, he did suggest there might be some communication from President Obama to Karzai in the next few days.

“It’s very important for President Karzai to know that the issues that he’s raised with us for many years have been properly addressed, and it’s very important for us to know that issues we have raised with him for a number of years are properly addressed.”

Strangely, this is the same man who used to regard himself as a peace activist. Even stranger, extending U.S. military presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014 is a move by the Obama administration that reaches well beyond the deadline for pullout set by former president George W. Bush. Drone use and “collateral damage” has surpassed that of the former president by many times. Wars have been extended beyond what Bush had said. Guantanamo Bay’s detention center has been given extension after extension, directly by president Obama. All of this has left many legitimate peace activists wondering how President Obama was ever awarded a Nobel Peace Prize?

Russell George are sworn before a full House Ways and Means Committee hearing Friday. Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images

by BRIAN NAYLOR

The IRS was in the hot seat Friday, with its outgoing acting commissioner testifying before a House committee. A Senate panel is scheduled for Tuesday. Congress is prodding to find out why the agency singled out conservative groups for special scrutiny.

Attention has focused on the IRS’s flagging of these groups starting in 2010. But some liberal groups and journalism organizations say their applications for tax-exempt status also faced long delays and were closely scrutinized during the same period.

2010 began a busy period for the IRS office in Cincinnati, the home of the tax-exempt determinations unit. In January of that year, the Supreme Court handed down its Citizens United decision, which loosened the rules governing contributions to political causes and candidates. Applications flooded in to the office from groups seeking tax-exempt status, many with a political agenda.

The IRS has admitted it flagged applications from groups with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names. But applications from other groups were closely scrutinized as well.

An Austin-based progressive group, Progress Texas, was one of them. Its executive director, Ed Espinoza, says it took almost a year and a half for the IRS to review the application from his organization. The process included answering a very detailed questionnaire.

“It was nine pages and 21 questions, and inside those 21 questions, there were additional questions,” Espinoza says. “So it was fairly extensive, and it was fairly thorough.”

In 2010, some 1,700 applications for what’s known as 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status came into the Cincinnati office. That number nearly doubled by 2012. Yet according to the IRS Inspector General report, just one person was originally given the task of sifting through the applications deemed politically sensitive. Marcus Owens, a former IRS official, says that’s a lot of work for one staffer.

“It’s a thousand applications, and these were applications that were identified because they were likely to have issues that were complex, which means that they were going to take more time,” Owens says. “So it seems like that would be more than one person could easily handle.”

Another application that seemingly got caught up in the backlog came from a group of journalists in Chicago. The Chicago News Cooperative provided news for the Midwest edition of The New York Times. The co-op also sought tax-exempt status. Veteran journalist James O’Shea, a former managing editor of The Chicago Tribune, was in charge.

“There were political organizations trying to get these exemptions, and I think the IRS was concerned — and probably appropriately so — that some of these news organizations were really political organizations,” he says, “and so they were examining that, and we just got caught up in that.”

For more than two years, the Chicago News Cooperative waited for an IRS ruling. But without tax-exempt status, foundation support dried up, and the cooperative went out of business.

Progress Texas did eventually get its tax-exempt status. And director Espinoza says he has no trouble with the scrutiny his organization underwent.

“Look, if you want a tax exemption, you’ve got to jump through some hoops,” he says. “You need to be able to demonstrate that what you’re doing is legitimately a tax-exempt activity, and that’s what we saw it as.”

There’s no sign the backlog of applications for tax-exempt status at the IRS has eased. Owens, now a tax lawyer in Washington, says according to the IRS website, the agency is now looking at applications made in March of last year. That means there are some 20,000 applications still in the queue.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/ron-paul-worries-obama-will-have-nsa-whistleblower-assassinated-with-a-drone-video/","Ron Paul Worries Obama Will Have NSA Whistleblower Assassinated With a Drone (Video)","Former representative Ron Paul explained recently in interview with FOX Business, that he was seriously concerned for the well-being of National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden.

“I’m worried about somebody in our government might kill him with a cruise missile or a drone missile,” Paul explained. “I mean we live in a bad time where American citizens don’t even have rights and that they can be killed, but the gentlemen is trying to tell the truth about what’s going on.”

If Paul is right, Snowden would be the fifth US citizen assassinated by the Obama administration by drone strikes, without due process.

Paul added that there were no signs of the NSA whistlerblower defecting to a foreign country, which meant that he was not really a threat.

“It’s a shame that we are in an age where people who tell the truth about what the government is doing gets into trouble,” Paul concluded.

As an Illinois senator, Obama was responsible for passing legislation to protect government employees who come forward and risk their jobs to expose waste, corruption and national security lapses. And during his 2008 election campaign, Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, saying their “acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled.”

But since in office, the president has proven unwilling to stand by those who blow the whistle on illegal government activity. It seems that corruption is bad as long as it is the other guy doing it. When it is the White House, the NSA or the military, then you have to keep quiet, even when witnessing clearly illegal activity.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/nevada-republican-says-yeah-i-would-vote-to-bring-back-slavery/","Nevada Republican Says: ‘Yeah, I would’ Vote To Bring Back Slavery","No, this is not an article from The Onion. Remarkably, truth is stranger than fiction at times. Take for instance a Republican Nevada state assemblyman saying that he would vote for legislation that reinstates slavery.

Specifically, he states that if constituents wanted him to do it, he would vote to legalize human slavery. Jim Wheeler of Gardnerville, Nevada, was speaking to the Storey County Republican Party when he made these offensive remarks. This happened all the way back in August, but the video of the statement has only now been made public.

“If that’s what they wanted, I’d have to hold my nose, I’d have to bite my tongue and they’d probably have to hold a gun to my head, but yeah, if that’s what the citizens of the, if that’s what the constituency wants that elected me, that’s what they elected me for,” Wheeler said. “That’s what a republic is about.”

A conservative commentator named Chuck Muth asked Wheeler during his candidacy, “[W]hat if those citizens decided they want to, say, bring back slavery? Hey, if that’s what the citizens want, right Jim?”

Wheeler said unequivocally, “yeah I would.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/obama-white-house-threatens-egypt/","Obama White House Threatens Egyptian Military Unless Morsi is Restored to Power!","One of countless anti-Obama and Anti-US interference banners and signs seen today at Tahrir square. The people of egypt are claiming that the Obama administration is trying to keep morsi in power through threats and INTIMIDATION.

US President Barack Obama is standing behind the wildly unpopular regime in Egypt as the military coup proceeded in a more or less bloodless fashion.

President Obama said he was “Deeply concerned” by Egyptian Armed forces removing President Morsi and suspending the Egyptian constitution. While the suspension of the constitution is indeed a concern, it came as no surprise to the people on the streets of Egypt who clamored for the military to intervene on their behalf.

As the military ignored Obama’s “concerns” the US President called for a review of American assistance to Egypt in the aftermath of Mohammed Morsi’s ouster and urged the Egyptian military to quickly restore power “back to the people” …by which he meant Morsi.

“Given today’s developments, I have also directed the relevant departments and agencies to review the implications under U.S. law for our assistance to the Government of Egypt,” the White House statement said, indicating that the aid would be cut to Egypt unless Morsi was restored to the presidency.

“I now call on the Egyptian military to move quickly and responsibly to return full authority back to a democratically elected civilian government as soon as possible through an inclusive and transparent process, and to avoid any arbitrary arrests of President Morsi and his supporters,” he said.

The change in power came after days of the biggest protests Egypt has seen since Hosni Mubarak was kicked out of power and one year after Morsi was chosen president in the country’s first democratic elections. Some have said that the 30,000+ protests were the largest in the world. Either way, it is clear that while Morsi was democratically elected, he was also democratically ousted, by the people and for the people.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/israel-bombs-syria-angered-at-u-s-leaders-for-revealing-while-the-media-ignores/","Israel Bombs Syria, Angered At U.S. Leaders For Revealing, While the Media Ignores","In what former Green Party Presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney calls “a conspiracy of media silence”, the mainstream media has virtually ignored, or mentioned quickly, in passing, a major Israeli military offensive in Syria recently. Now, Israeli officials say they are “furious” with the Obama Administration after the White House revealed that the bombing of Syria’s port city of Latakia was the result of Israeli airstrikes.

The White House confirmed that the Israeli attack targeting a Syrian air base on Wednesday evening will not result in a Syrian retaliation. Israeli TV stations said they were “concerned” that a public acknowledgement of Israeli culpability could “start a regional war.” The blame, they said, would fall at the feet of the White House.

Lebanon, however, had confirmed Israeli overflights just hours after the bombing, stating the planes were going in the direction of Latakia and were without a doubt Israeli planes. The White House confirmation, therefore, seems to be more an attempt to distance itself from the bombing than anything else. The big question, however, is why the corporate media refuses to highlight these important issues and stories.

Mohammed Mukhashaf reported recently for Reuters that local officials and residents in Yemen’s southern Lahj Province experienced devastating drone strike, killing another round of victims in the region already plagued by US drone strikes.

Angus McDowall explains the vehicle was traveling on a mountain road late on Saturday evening “killing its two occupants and bringing to 15 the death toll from four strikes in three days.”

Local officials and residents alike said the vehicle was traveling between Yafe and Radfan, and was believed to be carrying arms. Reuters suggests that its occupants were suspected members of al Qaeda. Residents claimed, however, that these were civilian casualties.

Reuters also claimed that an airstrike on Friday, in Yemen’s eastern Hadramout Province, killed five suspected militants, while two strikes in Hadramout and Marib Province killed eight militants on Thursday.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/inside-monsantos-rural-police-state/","Inside Monsanto’s Rural Police State","By Jacob Sloan and David Warner

The GMO regime has initiated a “new era of feudalism,” by powerful multinationals who have consolidated their control over the lives and practices of farmers everywhere.

Monsanto boasts one of the largest corporate security operations in the world, with agents working both openly and undercover in rural counties throughout the United States and Canada. Monsanto’s investigators show up at front doors, and in some cases in the middle of farmers fields, making accusations, brandishing surveillance photos and demanding to see the farmer’s private records or to be handed over their hard drives.

Monsanto also has its own toll-free tip-line (1-800-ROUNDUP) where farmers are invited to inform on their neighbors, as thousands have reportedly already done. “Instead of helping each other with barn-raisings and equipment sharing,” a CFS report states, “those caught saving seed, a practice that is hundreds of years old, were turned into ‘spies’ against their neighbors, replacing the atmosphere of cooperation with one of distrust and suspicion.” Critics accuse the company of fraying the delicate social fabric which holds farming communities together.

In its war against “seed pirates,” Monsanto employs methods that are better known in law enforcement and military intelligence than in the world of farming. Monsanto analyzes satellite images, USDA planting data and bank records in its effort to track down errant farmers.

As early as 2003, the corporation had a department of 75 employees (dubbed “the gene police”) with a budget of $10 million for the sole purpose of pursuing farmers for patent infringement. It has also hired a private investigation firm, McDowell & Associates in Saint Louis. This investment has produced ample returns over the years. As of 2006, farmers had paid the company an estimated $85 to $160 million in out-of-court settlements.

Of the hundreds of cases that Monsanto pursues every year, “the great majority end in out-of-court settlements. Farmers are terrified of standing up to the multinational and losing everything.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/french-court-overturns-recent-ban-on-monsanto-gmo-corn/","French Court OVERTURNS Recent BAN on Monsanto GMO Corn","By David Warner

Recently, Italy moved to BAN MONSANTO and all GMO Crops, around the same time that a group of scientists published that ‘GMO Damages red blood cells’, and a new study concluding that pesticides can cause Parkinson’s Disease. Monsanto was also found guilty of ‘Chemical Poisoning’ in France. But in an outrageous reversal, one of France’s top courts has overturned the ban on genetically modified corn, which had been in place since March 2012, leaving the door open for Monsanto’s GMO seed to be introduced into the country’s farmland.

The decision by the top administrative court on Thursday argued that the moratorium on the GMO MON810 corn, one of two types of genetically altered crops approved by the European Union, lacked legal basis, according to AFP reports. According to the Council of State court, a ban “can only be taken by a member state in case of an emergency or if a situation poses a major risk” to the health of people or animals, or to the environment.

The EU, which arguably has the most restrictive GMO regulations in the world, requires extensive testing and evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority before authorizing any genetically modified products. The EU approved Monsanto’s MON810 corn in 1998 for a period of 10 years, and the biotech giant applied in 2007 for that period to be extended, although Brussels has yet to make a final decision on the matter. In the meantime, MON810 is currently being cultivated in small scale within countries such as Spain and Portugal that are more receptive to GMOs, which are widely rejected within the Eurozone.

France’s Agriculture Minister Stephane LE Foll has said that his government opposes genetically modified crops, and suggested that they will seek other legal routes to halt their use. The court’s overturn of the MON810 corn ban is only the latest phase in a long-running dispute between the agriculture sector and French public opinion, which is highly critical of GMOs in general.

In September of last year Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that France would be maintaining its ban on the GMO maize after a previous moratorium was thrown out by a top court in November.

Likewise, France is sensitive to the use of chemicals on its crop as well. Last year a French court found Monsanto guilty of chemical poisoning based on a case from a farmer in Lyon, who claimed to have suffered neurological damage caused by one of the biotech’s weedkillers.

Frustrated by the EU’s GMO approval process, Monsanto withdrew all pending approval requests for new types of GMO crops in July.

“We will be withdrawing the approvals in the coming months,” said Monsanto’s President and Managing Director for Europe, Jose Manuel Madero.

Facing inhospitable public opinion of their GMO products German biotech company BASF also halted the development of new crops in 2011, and moved its entire European GMO research operations to the United States.

Germany along with France and Italy have all imposed national bans on GMOs, though Germany permitted Amflora, a potato modified with higher levels of starch, for industrial purposes. Other EU countries with bans and cultivation on GMOs include Austria, Luxembourg and Hungary. In May, Hungary went so far as to burn 1,200 acres of GMO corn after its government became aware of the banned crop.

This, however, is not how it should be, since women “might be hypochondriacs.” Thus, as a result, they might visit the doctor more often than their male counterparts, with no legitimate reason.

Stossel attempted to say that it is good women go to the doctor when they need to (whereas men often do not), but this hardly cushioned his other sexist remarks. In addition, he seemed concerned about all the mysterious parts of the female anatomy, which he was certain should require higher premiums as well.

Sounds unbelievable right? Watch the catastrophe of a discussion below.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/police-state-in-the-uk-shocking-new-laws-ban-protest-imply-thought-crime/","Police State in the UK? Shocking New Laws Ban Protest, Imply ‘Thought Crime’","Former Director of Public Prosecutions Lord Macdonald recently said that the new bill to replace Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBO) in the United Kingdom includes plans which are assault on basic freedom.

This proposed bill includes wide-ranging new orders known as Ipnas (Injunctions to Prevent Nuisance and Annoyance). This bill could restrict protests around the country, granting local authorities, police and even private security firms sweeping powers to ban citizens from lawful public assembly.

The bill plans to replace existing ASBO laws with new civil injunctions that Lord Macdonald said are “gross state interference” with “shockingly” weak proposed safeguards to prevent abuse of the new system. John Bingham writes for the Guardian UK that:

The new system will allow courts to impose sweeping curbs on people’s liberty if they think they are “capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to any person”. They will be able to impose them if they think it is “just and convenient” to do so.

Writing in a legal opinion commission drafted for the Christian Institute, which is opposing the plans alongside secularist campaign groups, he said: “Of course political demonstrations, street performers and corner preachers may be ‘annoying’ to some – they may even, from time to time be a ‘nuisance’.

The danger in this Bill is that it potentially empowers State interference against such activities in the face of shockingly low safeguards and little apparent acknowledgement of the potential effect of its provisions on the ability of citizens to exercise core rights without undue interference. A lone individual standing outside the entrance to a bank holding a sign objecting to its role in the financial crisis, a busker outside a shopping centre, or a street preacher proclaiming the end of days to passers-by may all be capable of causing nuisance and annoyance to some person, but the question is whether they should be subject to such broad legislative intervention as is proposed in this bill. Indeed, the pressing question is whether state interference in the context of behaviour that is merely potentially annoying could ever be justifiable or amount to a proportionate interference in those critical rights to freedom of speech, assembly and religion, or indeed to private life.

The Director of the “Reform Clause 1” campaign alliance, Simon Calvert said that “Just a few months ago the Government ditched a law criminalising unintentionally insulting words or behaviour. Now they want to criminalise unintentionally annoying words or behaviour. This is a crazy law. It will not deter thugs and hooligans who are normally already breaking lots of other laws anyway. But it will give massive power to the authorities to seek court orders to silence people guilty of nothing more than breaching political correctness or social etiquette. It is chilling that there is a complete absence of safeguards and any clear definition of what is deemed to be annoying. What this means in practice is that people going about their ordinary business, such as charity collectors, protestors, carol singers, street pastors – even people simply expressing strong opinions in public – could be classed as annoying and hauled before the courts. I am sure this was not the intention of the Government, but this legislation was badly conceived, is badly written and will stop many reasonable and hither to lawful activities.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/protesters-tell-senator-feinstein-whistleblowing-is-not-treason/","Protesters Tell Senator Feinstein: “Whistleblowing is Not Treason”","By April Short

People in pink appeared with drones, tracking devices, and magnifying glasses on the doorstep of Senator Dianne Feinstein’s San Francisco mansion on Saturday, June 15. The group was organized by the women-initiated grassroots peace and social justice organization, Code Pink.

Their mission? To protest the Calif. senator’s accusation of treason aimed at 29-year-old whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Snowden leaked information about the vast surveillance networks the Pentagon’s spy agencies—particularly the National Security Agency (NSA)—are using to spy on US citizens, including top-secret details on the government’s collection of Americans’ phone and Internet records. The young whistleblower sought refuge in Hong Kong following the leak, and has been accused of spying for China, though he adamently denies the charge.

“Truth is coming, and it cannot be stopped,” Snowden told The Guardian, which held a live chat on its website. Snowden also told The Guardian the US government “is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me.”

Snowded’s leak revealed that the U.S. government extracts private audio, video, photographs, e-mails, documents, and connection logs, allowing analysts to track any person’s movements and contacts over time. Using the surveillance programs, any individual’s private communications, both abroad and in the US, can be swept even without any suspicion of crime or association with a terrorist organization.

Nancy Mancias of Code Pink told AlterNet the protesters employed “guerrilla theater,” complete with costumes, props and music, “in a farcical manner” in order to relay the seriousness of the issue at stake.



Oustide of Feinstein’s mansion, Code Pink proclaimed: “Whistleblowing is Not Treason!” They called out the senator—chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence committee—for having known for years of the extent of the surveillance programs.

“What Edward Snowden did was not treason,” Mancias told AlterNet. “It was a tremendous public service at the expense of his own career and his own future.”

Mancias continued, “What the NSA has been doing in its surveillance program is un-American. The NSA is abusing a controversial section of the PATRIOT Act to collect the call records of millions of Americans. … This type of blanket data collection by the government strikes at bedrock American values of freedom and privacy.”

Protesters demanded Feinstein push for an immediate halt of the surveillance of US citizens. The activists also demanded Feinstein provide full public accounting of the NSA and FBI’s data collection programs.

Mancias told AlterNet the surveillance programs are unconstitutional and in violation of both the First and Fourth Ammendments to the US Constitution, which protect citizens’ right to speak and associate anonymously and guard against unreasonable searches and seizures that protect the right to privacy.

“Americans deserve government transparency and personal privacy,” she said.

Three Code Pink members held their magnifying glasses up to Feinstein’s door, in a satirical attempt to draw the senator’s attention, imploring her to support, rather than criminalize, whistleblowers.","2013-06-18 12:59:26","1","42.0","8.0","159.0","1.0","36.0","0.0","239.0","163.0","54.0","165.0","0.0","33.0","3","487","97.39","75.11","12.04","25.77","20.29","35.93","70.64","39.63","5.34","2.87","0.21","1.03","0.00","1.03","0.62","2.46","9.24","14.58","4.52","1.44","4.72","1.03","8.83","3.08","0.41","0.82","1.23","1.44","3.08","1.44","1.44","0.41","0.82","0.00","9.24","0.00","0.21","0.62","0.62","6.16","1.64","0.82","0.21","1.23","0.62","2.26","3.29","2.26","1.03","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.41","0.00","0.00","9.45","2.46","0.82","4.72","0.00","1.64","4.11","4.11","0.62","11.09","1.03","6.98","2.87","4.72","0.82","0.41","0.41","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.12","5.13","6.37","0.21","0.00","0.21","0.21","1.23","3.70","2.67","0.41","0.00","2605","9.51","26.263157894736842","804","478","24","42.82","14.6","12.2","15.9","15.5","148","7.833333333333334","22.344937238493724","284","23.58","13","0.4","0","21","2","51","0","56","41","2","0","1","84","74","3","37","0","0","6","6","13","0","0","3","13","0","17","23","16","8","5","12","3","2","0","0"
"http://politicalblindspot.com/egypts-muslim-brotherhood-leaders-arrested-by-military-as-the-people-rage-at-obama/","Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood Leaders Arrested By Military, As the People Rage At Obama","Egyptian sources report that senior officials in the Muslim Brotherhood have been placed under house arrest and the military is securing strategic facilities across the country.

But as Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood Leader are arrested by the military, the People Rage at Obama for his perceived support of Morsi. Predictably, the Obama administration’s efforts to practive a “nuanced” foreign policy end up leaving America worse off than it could otherwise be. While trying to resist any impression that it is involved in Egypt’s affairs, it is projecting the image of indifference to the plight and the wishes of the Egyptian people. As a result, anti-Obama sentiment (and, by extension, anti-American sentiment) is in evidence

The Muslim Brotherhood that backed President Mohamed Morsi in last year’s successful bid to win the nation’s first democratic election is also now being scrutinized for corruption in the ranks.

The group’s funding structure and records are being probed, according to a report posted Wednesday by the Egyptian Al-Ahram newspaper.

The report also claimed the Egyptian Army has begun to hermetically seal strategic installations across the country in accordance with a military “road map” plan that mandates implementation by the army if politicians could not resolve the leadership crisis by Wednesday.

The army reportedly had already taken control of all weapons and munitions arsenal sites.

However, an Egyptian military source denied the reports, saying he instead expected political, social and economic figures to gather for talks on the “road map” plan.

Military leaders are mulling three options for transitional leadership of Egypt, in the fast-approaching aftermath of the almost certain ouster of President Mohamed Morsi, according to the London-based al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper.

The first would be appointment of the president of the Constitutional Court as transitional leader, supported by a national council comprised of military and government officials.

A second option would be leadership by the Higher Military Council.

The third option to lead the nation would be appointment of a presidential council comprised of military and civilian officials.

Morsi continues to insist that he will remain in office and has refused to resign. Nevertheless, a local media source told foreign reporters Wednesday morning that after the 48-hour ultimatum to the president by the army expires, “one of two things” would happen: “Either Morsi announces his resignation himself, or the declaration of his removal through the road map for the future [is] set out by the armed forces.”

Any transitional government is expected to be in place for at least nine to twelve months, during which a new constitution would be drafted, with presidential elections to be held at the end of the transitional period.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/supreme-court-gets-it-wrong-ruling-on-adopted-native-american-children-threatens-tribes/","SUPREME COURT GETS IT WRONG: Ruling on adopted Native American Children Threatens Tribes","Leaders worry that the Supreme Court ruling opens the door to what was happening before Indian Child Welfare Act.

Native American leaders say they still have problems with state welfare agencies ignoring federal laws

Sometimes American Indian children are taken from parents, given to non-Native families to foster, adopt

Some tribes would like to set up their own foster care programs, not rely on states

What happened Tuesday

A Supreme Court decision that undercuts the presumptive rights of biological Native American parents could threaten an entire slate of legislation passed almost 40 years ago to strengthen tribal sovereignty, according to a former South Dakota senator.

The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 vote, said that the law doesn’t require that a Native American child be taken away from her adoptive parents and given to her biological father. The decision involved a South Carolina case in which a young girl was taken from a couple who raised her for the first 27 months of her life and given to her biological father.

Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians, said the court’s ruling in favor of the South Carolina couple involves a technicality, and that what the justices decided Tuesday leaves the Indian Child Welfare Act in place.

What the court said

Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court’s majority, said the federal law didn’t apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of the child and abandoned her before birth. Alito also said the law doesn’t stop non-Native Americans from adopting an American Indian child when no other eligible candidates step forward.

What the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 is

The federal law known as the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act intends to keep Indian children from being taken from their homes and placed with non-Indian adoptive or foster parents. Its purpose was to preserve the familial bonds between Indian parents and their children and, more broadly, Indian tribes’ relationships with those children.

Former Sen. Jim Abourezk, D-S.D., is critical of Tuesday’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling affecting the Indian Child Welfare Act.

“It’s an attack on tribal sovereignty through the children. I can’t believe they did this,” retired Sen. James Abourezk, D-S.D., who was the driving force behind the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act and the other bills, said Tuesday of the court’s decision.

In a 5-4 ruling, the court said federal law doesn’t require that a Native American child be taken away from her adoptive parents and given to her biological father. The court sent the case back to the South Carolina courts, which had decided in favor of the father, a member of the Cherokee tribe who had given up parental rights.

The non-Indian couple who raised the girl, called Baby Veronica in the suit, for her first 27 months appealed the state decision. The Supreme Court’s intent was to allow the couple to adopt the now-3-year-old girl. Veronica is 3/256ths Cherokee.

Professor Frank Pommersheim of the University of South Dakota School of Law said the main thing the justices did was create confusion about the application of the Indian Child Welfare Act.

And Daniel Sheehan, general counsel for the Lakota People’s Law Project, suggested the Supreme Court ruling could point the way toward a resolution that strengthens tribes’ rights in adoption issues.

Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer joined Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the majority opinion.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissenting opinion. She was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elana Kagan.

In his opinion, Alito said the federal law didn’t apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of the girl and abandoned her before birth. The father, Dusten Brown of Oklahoma, objected to the adoption only after the fact. Furthermore, he said the law doesn’t stop non-Native Americans from adopting the child if no other eligible candidates stepped forward.

Giving the father the presumptive right to custody outlined in the law, which the justices refer to as the ICWA, “would put certain vulnerable children at a great disadvantage solely because an ancestor — even a remote one — was an Indian,” Alito said. “A biological Indian father could abandon his child in utero and refuse any support for the birth mother — perhaps contributing to the mother’s decision to put the child up for adoption — and then could play his ICWA trump card at the 11th hour to override the mother’s decision and the child’s best interest.

“If this were possible, many prospective adoptive parents would surely pause before adopting any child who might possibly qualify as an Indian under the ICWA,” Alito wrote.

Tribal sovereignty

Congress was trying to solve a different problem when it passed the Indian Child Welfare Act, Abourezk said. The Senate American Indian Policy Review Commission he headed “had complaints about tribes being stripped of children by white social service agencies.”

The great majority of these were from the Southwest and involved adoptions from members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Abourezk said.

“Taking kids away from tribes was our concern,” he said.

Clyde Bellecourt, an American Indian Movement activist who was a key player in the effort to develop and strengthen the principle of tribal sovereignty in the 1970s, agreed with Abourezk. He said the Supreme Court ruling “is legalizing the kidnapping, theft of children and division of Indian families once again by states and churches. Churches have a lot to do with this.”

Because of widespread adoptions of tribal children by non-Indians before the law, Bellecourt said, “there are thousands of people wandering the earth who have no idea from whence they came even though they have a culture and a traditional way of life of their own.”

Peter Lengkeek, a former member of the Crow Creek Tribal Council, challenged the South Dakota Department of Social Services for running roughshod over the Indian Child Welfare Act when he was on the council.

“I got a lot of complaints about the way DSS was coming onto the reservation without permission and carrying on the way they did,” Lengkeek said. “Mothers would tell me their child was taken and nothing was said or done about it or proper protocol was not followed.”

From this perspective, he views the Supreme Court decision as an attack on a law that is important for maintaining the integrity of Indian families and Indian children’s tribal identity.

“The Indian Child Welfare Act was put in place to preserve culture and the traditional way of life of indigenous people. The Supreme Court decision really undermines the whole concept,” he said.

“We have to fight on a daily basis for protection and strengthening of our sovereignty,” Lengkeek said. “When things like this happen, it weakens it even more. I hope all the tribes are looking at this and taking it to heart. It could change their future.”

The Indian Child Welfare Act is in line with similar laws to bolster tribal sovereignty, Abourezk said.

“That was our aim. We did everything we could to increase tribal sovereignty. That includes the Indian Child Welfare Act; the Self Determination Act,” passed in 1975; the Freedom of Religion Act, passed in 1978.

Abourezk said he fears the Supreme Court’s refusal to uphold the Indian Child Welfare Act could potentially set precedent leading to legal attacks on other aspects of tribal sovereignty.

Pommersheim said he is not convinced the Supreme Court decision strikes at tribal sovereignty because it is inherently confusing. The Supreme Court majority’s narrow interpretation of the statute seems to say the Indian Child Welfare Act is intended primarily to avoid the breakup of Indian families. Then it says the Indian father in the South Carolina case had his parental rights terminated.

“The statute applies, but this father has no rights under the statute,” Pommersheim characterizes the ruling. “You can’t make that fly. It seems to flout common sense.”

Could help tribes?

It also points the way toward a resolution that strengthens the rights of tribes in adoptions, according to Sheehan.

He and Pommersheim both were persuaded by Justice Sotomayer’s dissenting opinion that an important goal of the law was ensuring tribes did not lose children to a dominant white society, and tribal parents do not lose the connection with their children even if they do not have custody of them.

The Supreme Court ruling flouts the intent of Congress when it passed the law, Sheehan said. The answer is to enact what tribal leaders such as President Brian Brewer of the Oglala Sioux Tribe want to see happen.

In April, Brewer wrote Bruce Loudermilk, Great Plains regional director for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, pointing out that the South Dakota Department of Social Services regularly ignores the Indian Child Welfare Act. The law requires social-service agencies adhere to the principle that Indian children belong with their tribes and agencies actively seek to ensure this in adoptions and foster placements.

Brewer also mentioned that the federal government does not finance foster care on reservations adequately.

“We Sioux tribes constitute a sovereign nation, and we must assert ourselves when it comes to foster care and adoption policy,” Brewer wrote.

“The Oglala Sioux Tribe … is very eager to develop a direct relationship with the federal government when it comes to the provision of foster care services for our children.”

Exactly, Sheehan said.

“The solution to this hostile attitude toward the basic intent of ICWA is to give direct federal funding to the individual tribes to set up their own foster care with adequate oversight and get the state completely out of it,” he said.

He predicts all nine South Dakota tribes will adopt such a stand at a meeting July 8 to 10.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/down-the-memory-chute-promise-to-protect-whistleblowers-disappears-from-obamas-change-gov/","DOWN THE MEMORY CHUTE: Promise To ‘Protect Whistleblowers’ Disappears From Obama’s Change.gov","By David Harris Gershon and Micah Naziri

Since 2008, the Obama administration had made available the President’s original campaign promises at Change.gov, along with a splash screen directing readers to the White House website…

All of this was in spite of the Obama administration’s crackdown against whistleblowers…

The Sunlight Foundation discovered, recently that the Obama administration removed access to these promises on June 8, two days after Edward Snowden’s first revelation. The likely reason? One of the promises Obama made on the website was on “whistleblower protections:”

Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance. Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process.

The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment on why the page was deleted. The site had offered a way to compare Obama’s promises and administration actions and still can be viewed on the Wayback archive.

The page has long had a link to whitehouse.gov along with a note saying that “the transition has ended and the new administration has begun;” however, the website’s pages have recently become inaccessible from the site.

Prior to the Snowden leaks but after Pfc. Bradley Manning gave classified information to WikiLeaks, the Obama administration launched the Insider Threat program to combat leaks, in part by asking coworkers to keep a close eye on their fellow employees. The program also ordered more protections for those who use proper channels, but four national security whistleblowers have said that they became targets of Justice Department investigations after bringing concerns to the Department of Defense Inspector General.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/the-luis-ramirez-beating-death-verdict-is-a-model-for-federal-prosecution-of-george-zimmerman/","The Luis Ramirez Beating Death Verdict Is a Model For Federal Prosecution of George Zimmerman","By Micah Naziri

Think the Zimmerman verdict was the end? Think again! There is not only hope for putting Zimmerman behind bars still, there is legal precedence for it. Bear with me as I recount for you the story of the beating death of Luis Ramirez and the acquittal of his assailants…

Prosecutors called the beating death of an illegal immigrant from Mexico a hate crime, and they urged the all-white jury in Pennsylvania coal country to punish two white teenagers for their roles in the attack… But as you might imagine, that jury did nothing of the sort. Instead, they found the teens not guilty of all serious charges, a decision that elicited cheers and claps from the defendants’ families and friends, and cries of outrage from the victim’s loved ones.

Brandon Piekarsky, 17, was acquitted of third-degree murder and ethnic intimidation, while Derrick Donchak, 19, was acquitted of aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation. Both were convicted of simple assault following a trial in which jurors were left to sort out the facts of an epithet-filled brawl that pitted popular football players against a 25-year-old Hispanic man, Luis Ramirez, who appeared willing to fight.

The two were acquitted of murder charges in state court and convicted of simple assault. That seemed to be the end of it…

A representative of Ramirez’s family said the jurors got it wrong.

“There’s been a complete failure of justice,” said Gladys Limon, staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, who attended the trial and informed Ramirez’s family of the verdict. “It’s just outrageous and very difficult to understand how any juror could have had reasonable doubt.”

The group’s interim president, Henry Solano, called on the Justice Department to “bring justice to the Ramirez family and send a strong message that violence targeting immigrants will not be tolerated.” Piekarsky’s attorney declined comment on the possibility of federal charges against the teens.

Prosecutors had cast Ramirez as the victim of a gang of drunken white teens motivated by a dislike of their small coal town’s growing Hispanic population. They said he was killed by a kick to the head from Piekarsky after he’d been knocked unconscious by another teen.

The jury evidently sided with defense attorneys, who called Ramirez the aggressor and characterized the brawl as a street fight that ended tragically.

Jury foreman Eric Macklin said he sympathized with Ramirez’s loved ones but that the evidence pointed to an acquittal.

“I feel bad for Luis’s friends and family. I know they feel they haven’t gotten justice,” he said.

The case exposed ethnic tensions in Shenandoah, a blue-collar town of 5,000 that has lured Hispanic residents drawn by cheap housing and jobs in nearby factories and farm fields. Ramirez moved to the town about seven years ago from Iramuco, Mexico, working in a factory and picking strawberries and cherries.

The fight began late July 12 when a half-dozen teens, all Shenandoah residents who played football at Shenandoah Valley High School, were walking home from a block party and came across Ramirez and his 15-year-old girlfriend in a park.

Brian Scully, 18, asked the girl, “Isn’t it a little late for you to be out?” That enraged Ramirez, who began yelling in Spanish and dialing friends on his cell phone. Scully admitted shouting ethnic slurs. The verbal sparring soon turned into a physical altercation as Ramirez and Piekarsky traded blows, though prosecutors and defense attorneys disputed who threw the first punch.

Donchak then entered the fray and wound up on top of Ramirez. Prosecutors said he pummeled Ramirez, holding a small piece of metal in his fist to give his punches more power. Defense attorneys said Donchak tried to break up the fight between Piekarsky and Ramirez and denied he had a weapon.

The two sides eventually went their separate ways. But Scully kept yelling slurs at Ramirez, leading the immigrant to charge after the group.

Colin Walsh, 17, then hit Ramirez, knocking him out.

“Does Mr. Ramirez fit the description of an innocent soul who just happened to get picked on by a group of kids?” Piekarsky defense attorney Fred Fanelli asked jurors in closing arguments. “He’s the only adult, and he makes some bad choices.”

The sort of accusations lobbed at Ramirez were immediately called to mind by all familiar with the case, when history seemed to repeat itself in the prosecution of George Zimmerman, after he shot Trayvon Martin. Just as in the Zimmerman case, the killers thought they were out of the water. The racist and xenophobic factions which supported these boys in the Ramirez beating death thought that was the end of it, just as so many do today in the acquittal of Zimmerman. “Just accept the verdict,” “there is nothing that can be done now” are just some of the things supports of Justice for Trayvon can be heard saying. But what happened next in the Ramirez beating proves that they are wrong… there’s a lot that can still be done…

Two years later, in 2011, Derrick Donchak, of Shenandoah, and Brandon Piekarsky, of Shenandoah Heights, were found guilty in federal court in October of several charges, including hate crimes and depriving the victim Luis Ramirez of his civil rights.

Derrick Donchak, of Shenandoah, and Brandon Piekarsky, of Shenandoah Heights, were found guilty in federal court in October of several charges, including hate crimes and depriving the victim Luis Ramirez of his civil rights.

Three former Pennsylvania police officers were also charged, accused of trying to cover up the incident, with mixed results…

In January, a federal jury found former Shenandoah Police Chief Matthew Nestor and officers William Moyer and Jason Hayes not guilty of conspiracy to obstruct a federal investigation in Ramirez’s July 2008 death.

Nestor, however, was found guilty of falsifying reports, and Moyer was convicted of lying to the FBI.

Hayes, who was also accused of falsifying police reports, was acquitted of the two charges against him.

You thought the Zimmerman verdict was then end? It’s only the end if you’ve given up. Some of us are just getting started. SPREAD THE WORD and let’s KEEP THE PRESSURE ON!

"http://politicalblindspot.com/the-latest-on-the-nsa-scandal-nsa-program-collects-nearly-everything-a-user-does-on-the-internet/","The Latest on the NSA Scandal: NSA program collects ‘nearly everything a user does on the internet’","Just when you thought you had heard the worst about the NSA spying scandal, Glenn Greenwald from theguardian.com reveals the latest, and possibly biggest revelation about the US government’s electronic spying yet.

• XKeyscore gives ‘widest-reaching’ collection of online data

• NSA analysts require no prior authorization for searches

• Sweeps up emails, social media activity and browsing history

• NSA’s XKeyscore program – read one of the presentations

One presentation claims the XKeyscore program covers ‘nearly everything a typical user does on the internet’

A top secret National Security Agency program allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing emails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals, according to documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The NSA boasts in training materials that the program, called XKeyscore, is its “widest-reaching” system for developing intelligence from the internet.

The latest revelations will add to the intense public and congressional debate around the extent of NSA surveillance programs. They come as senior intelligence officials testify to the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday, releasing classified documents in response to the Guardian’s earlier stories on bulk collection of phone records and Fisasurveillance court oversight.

The files shed light on one of Snowden’s most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by the Guardian on June 10.

“I, sitting at my desk,” said Snowden, could “wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email”.

US officials vehemently denied this specific claim. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee, said of Snowden’s assertion: “He’s lying. It’s impossible for him to do what he was saying he could do.”

But training materials for XKeyscore detail how analysts can use it and other systems to mine enormous agency databases by filling in a simple on-screen form giving only a broad justification for the search. The request is not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel before it is processed.

XKeyscore, the documents boast, is the NSA’s “widest reaching” system developing intelligence from computer networks – what the agency calls Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). One presentation claims the program covers “nearly everything a typical user does on the internet”, including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as theirmetadata.

Analysts can also use XKeyscore and other NSA systems to obtain ongoing “real-time” interception of an individual’s internet activity.

Under US law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisawarrant only if the target of their surveillance is a ‘US person’, though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. But XKeyscore provides the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst.

One training slide illustrates the digital activity constantly being collected by XKeyscore and the analyst’s ability to query the databases at any time.

The purpose of XKeyscore is to allow analysts to search the metadataas well as the content of emails and other internet activity, such as browser history, even when there is no known email account (a “selector” in NSA parlance) associated with the individual being targeted.

Analysts can also search by name, telephone number, IP address, keywords, the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used.

One document notes that this is because “strong selection [search by email address] itself gives us only a very limited capability” because “a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous.”

The NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore.

Analysts are warned that searching the full database for content will yield too many results to sift through. Instead they are advised to use themetadata also stored in the databases to narrow down what to review.

A slide entitled “plug-ins” in a December 2012 document describes the various fields of information that can be searched. It includes “every email address seen in a session by both username and domain”, “every phone number seen in a session (eg address book entries or signature block)” and user activity – “the webmail and chat activity to include username, buddylist, machine specific cookies etc”.

Email monitoring

In a second Guardian interview in June, Snowden elaborated on his statement about being able to read any individual’s email if he had their email address. He said the claim was based in part on the email search capabilities of XKeyscore, which Snowden says he was authorized to use while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA.

One top-secret document describes how the program “searches within bodies of emails, webpages and documents”, including the “To, From, CC, BCC lines” and the ‘Contact Us’ pages on websites”.

To search for emails, an analyst using XKS enters the individual’s email address into a simple online search form, along with the “justification” for the search and the time period for which the emails are sought.

The analyst then selects which of those returned emails they want to read by opening them in NSA reading software.

The system is similar to the way in which NSA analysts generally can intercept the communications of anyone they select, including, as one NSA document put it, “communications that transit the United States and communications that terminate in the United States”.

One document, a top secret 2010 guide describing the training received by NSA analysts for general surveillance under the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008, explains that analysts can begin surveillance on anyone by clicking a few simple pull-down menus designed to provide both legal and targeting justifications. Once options on the pull-down menus are selected, their target is marked for electronic surveillance and the analyst is able to review the content of their communications:

Chats, browsing history and other internet activity

Beyond emails, the XKeyscore system allows analysts to monitor a virtually unlimited array of other internet activities, including those within social media.

An NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages.

An analyst can monitor such Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen.

Analysts can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.

As one slide indicates, the ability to search HTTP activity by keyword permits the analyst access to what the NSA calls “nearly everything a typical user does on the internet”.

The XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies.

The quantity of communications accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is staggeringly large. One NSA report from 2007 estimated that there were 850bn “call events” collected and stored in the NSA databases, and close to 150bn internet records. Each day, the document says, 1-2bn records were added.

William Binney, a former NSA mathematician, said last year that the agency had “assembled on the order of 20tn transactions about US citizens with other US citizens”, an estimate, he said, that “only was involving phone calls and emails”. A 2010 Washington Post article reported that “every day, collection systems at the [NSA] intercept and store 1.7bn emails, phone calls and other type of communications.”

The XKeyscore system is continuously collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content remains on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains: “At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.”

To solve this problem, the NSA has created a multi-tiered system that allows analysts to store “interesting” content in other databases, such as one named Pinwale which can store material for up to five years.

It is the databases of XKeyscore, one document shows, that now contain the greatest amount of communications data collected by the NSA.

In 2012, there were at least 41 billion total records collected and stored in XKeyscore for a single 30-day period.

Legal v technical restrictions

While the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of US persons, NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA’s foreign targets.

The ACLU’s deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, told the Guardian last month that national security officials expressly said that a primary purpose of the new law was to enable them to collect large amounts of Americans’ communications without individualized warrants.

“The government doesn’t need to ‘target’ Americans in order to collect huge volumes of their communications,” said Jaffer. “The government inevitably sweeps up the communications of many Americans” when targeting foreign nationals for surveillance.

An example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSAtarget in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and New York.

In recent years, the NSA has attempted to segregate exclusively domestic US communications in separate databases. But even NSA documents acknowledge that such efforts are imperfect, as even purely domestic communications can travel on foreign systems, and NSA tools are sometimes unable to identify the national origins of communications.

Moreover, all communications between Americans and someone on foreign soil are included in the same databases as foreign-to-foreign communications, making them readily searchable without warrants.

Some searches conducted by NSA analysts are periodically reviewed by their supervisors within the NSA. “It’s very rare to be questioned on our searches,” Snowden told the Guardian in June, “and even when we are, it’s usually along the lines of: ‘let’s bulk up the justification’.”

In a letter this week to senator Ron Wyden, director of national intelligence James Clapper acknowledged that NSA analysts have exceeded even legal limits as interpreted by the NSA in domestic surveillance.

Acknowledging what he called “a number of compliance problems”, Clapper attributed them to “human error” or “highly sophisticated technology issues” rather than “bad faith”.

However, Wyden said on the Senate floor on Tuesday: “These violations are more serious than those stated by the intelligence community, and are troubling.”

In a statement to the Guardian, the NSA said: “NSA’s activities are focused and specifically deployed against – and only against – legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests.

“XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA’s lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system.

“Allegations of widespread, unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/dept-of-homeland-security-forced-to-release-list-of-keywords-used-to-monitor-social-networking-sites/","Deptartment of Homeland Security Forced to Release List of Keywords Used to Monitor Social Networking Sites","By Reuven Cohen and Micah Naziri

In a story appearing on the U.K’s Daily Mail website, it was reported that the DHS has been forced to release a list of keywords and phrases it uses to monitor various social networking sites. The list provides a glimpse into what DHS describes as “signs of terrorist or other threats against the U.S.” The information sheds new light on how government analysts are instructed to patrol the internet searching for domestic and external threats. The Daily Mail’s article noted the Electronic Privacy Information Center wrote a letter to the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counter-terrorism and Intelligence, describing it’s choice of words as ‘broad, vague and ambiguous’.

The list was posted by the Electronic Privacy Information Center who filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act, before suing to obtain the release of the documents. The documents were part of the department’s 2011 ’Analyst’s Desktop Binder‘ used by workers at their National Operations Center which instructs workers to identify ‘media reports that reflect adversely on DHS and response activities’.

What wasn’t disclosed is how the agency actually gains access to the various search engines and social networks to monitor the specified keywords. My guess is the DHS has a “special arrangement” with companies like Google ,Facebook , Microsoft , Yahoo and Twitter to gain secure direct API access. This type of access would allow it to use distributed cloud technologies to monitor the daily flow of social media and search activity in something close to real time.

I would love to learn more about the technologies used to accomplish this type of social / web monitoring. The applications for monitoring trends and social statics are fascinating when applied to other industry sectors. Given the extent of the monitoring, I’m sure this post itself is now coming up on the DHS radar, so please feel free to leave a comment with any insights.

Full List of Keywords & Search Terms

"http://politicalblindspot.com/us-push-for-syria-invasion-meets-strong-inner-opposition/","US Push for Syria Invasion Meets Strong Inner Opposition","Barack Obama’s comments on Syrian chemical dossier are so cryptic and unclear that even hardliners in Europe feel more and more confused. It becomes more and more apparent that “humanitarian” invasion, if it is going to happen, will be about Qatar’s gas pipeline to Europe, Cheney’s drilling license near the Golan Heights and struggle over Lebanon’s offshore gas. “Human rights” pretexts do not convince anybody in Europe.

Surprisingly representatives of the US military industrial complex seem to distance themselves from armchair strategists in the White House. Interventions in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya have shown that US officials do not care what the world would say about violation of international law. That’s why there must be some objective economic contradictions that caused this sudden pacifist sentiment. Military hawks’ public statements on the real situation in the US economy may be much more informative than Kerry’s diplomatic pantomime.

“Any future defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should “have his head examined”, as general MacArthur so delicately put it,” told an audience of West Point cadets former US minister of defense Robert Gates just before his resignation in 2011. Unfortunately for American taxpayers his attempts to instill a “culture of savings and restraint” in the US military were not successful. In 2011 Joseph Lazarro precisely described this tendency as “imperial overstrech”. In his opinion, hegemon’s attempts to maintain global control may cause severe economic crises and social instability. Americans with military background know what «limited strike» really means.

Donald Rumsfeld and Zbignew Brzhezinsky, for instance, refrain from jingoism. Rumsfeld has bashed Obama on Fox news: “There really has not been any indication from the administration as to what our national interest is with respect to this particular situation”. Brzhezinsky is even more straightforward: “US foreign policy on Syria is difficult to understand in the long term”. Truly these are the last things one would expect to hear from the architects of American brutal invasions who encouraged lucrative arms contracts and field weapon tests. Retired military officials often mouth the words of their colleagues in the Army. What do officers in charge of Syrian crisis say?

”We have learned from the past 10 years, however, that it is not enough to simply alter the balance of military power without careful consideration of what is necessary in order to preserve a functioning state. <…> This is especially critical as we lose readiness due to budget cuts and fiscal uncertainty,” complained Chairman of Joint Chefs of Staff Martin Dempsey. Costs of the military operation following all proposed scenarios could average well over $1 billion per month. War overseas has never been cheap. The US will have to overuse again its privileged status in the world’s financial system and, therefore, face reputational risks. That’s why US Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew in his letter to Congress has pointed at “the threat of default” and “irreparable harm to the US economy”. He knows that trust is hard to build and very easy to lose. Dancing on the fiscal cliff after military intervention in Libya led to the downgrade of US sovereign credit rating from S&P’s AAA (outstanding) to AA+ (excellent). As a result the cost to insure US debts against default has risen from an average of around 25 basis points in 2007 to a range from 55 to 75 basis points in 2011, Bloomberg reported. American “expertocracy” did everything in their power to downplay the rating fiasco because S&P put at risk the “sancta sanctorum” of Washington’s global financial system – the strange dependence of Central Banks around the world on the international market of US Treasuries. Revenge of the administration was quick and painful. SEC and Department of Justice announced that S&P was under investigation. Two years on the situation is very similar: nobody knows how the markets will greet the news of another credit rating downgrade.

Financial witch hunts cannot change the sad reality of American debt. Splendid little war, however, is a different story – especially if Arab countries are ready “to share the cost”. In mid-October 2013 the US federal government will have to cross the real “red line” and deal with looming debt ceiling fight 2.0. It is entirely possible that threats of US military intervention in Syria are aimed at distracting public attention from the new period of financial turbulence that may ensue.

Infowars.com

A former soldier who conducted two tours of duty in Iraq gave a Tedx talk last month from prison where he described how the army taught him to harness an uncontrollable rage and how it ultimately led him to become, what one judge termed, a “threat to society.”

In an October video posted of a TEDx correctional facility talk, Army veteran Andrew “Sarge” Chambers gave a heartfelt account of his difficult transition to civilian life after the events of 9/11 convinced him to march to war.

Chambers, who is from Pickerington, Ohio, depicted one memory in which he awoke to a chaotic battle scene and gunfire, and remembered being astonished to hear someone laughing through it.

“In the middle of all this chaos, I could hear somebody laughing and I thought to myself, ‘Who could be laughing at a time like this?’ and then I realized it was me laughing,” Chambers said. “I felt like I was finally losing control of that rage they taught me to harness.”

Following his first tour, Chambers says the Army asked for volunteers to stay for an additional length of time, for which he says he volunteered as he was not married and did not have children.

Chambers recalled losing seven fellow soldiers during his second tour, in which he and others would find and neutralize roadside IEDs.

He says when he returned to the United States, the stress of combat had left him on edge.

“I was paranoid. I carried a pistol on me at all times. I assessed the threat level of every person or place I came in contact with,” Chambers stated. “Driving through my family’s neighborhood, I drove in the middle of the street in fear that the side of the road was gonna blow up and kill me.”

Chambers recollected seeking help from the Veterans Administration and being prescribed a sleep aid, but says the medication did little to quell his inner rage.

Iraqi war veteran Andrew “Sarge” Chambers.

Then one night, an argument erupted over a girl. “Someone pulled out a knife and I snapped.”

“I pulled out my pistol. The prosecutor said I moved through the room in a tactical manner, clearing the room, laid everybody on the ground. I took the knife from him and I began beating him.”

The army vet was charged with attempted murder, as well as other charges. “When I went in for sentencing, my judge told me, ‘Mr. Chambers, your service is a double-edged sword. Your time in Iraq makes you a threat to society and I have a civil obligation to lock you up.’ I received ten years and here I am today.”

The veteran’s story shines light on why many enlistees contemplate and commit suicide as an alternative to coping with pent-up, carefully-stoked rage. It also shows how the establishment casts the mental health needs of returning veterans by the wayside, and deems soldiers threats once their honed warrior instincts surface.

Chambers says he hopes his story brings insight to the mindset of military veterans, and urges people to “Find a veteran and listen to his story. A lot of us just need someone to talk to.”

The speech was given as part of a TEDx correctional facility series, which showcases stories about “incarceration and reintegration.”

According to the video’s YouTube description, parts of Chambers’ speech will be included in the documentary “Operation Resurrection: The Warrior Returns.”

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/gates-foundation-fire-pushing-dangerous-contraceptives-black-populations/","Gates Foundation Taking Fire for Pushing Dangerous Contraceptives on Black Populations","William F. Jasper

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is taking fire from leaders of Black organizations and human rights advocates for funding and promoting a new form of the controversial contraceptive Depo Provera, particularly aimed at women in Africa and developing countries. Melinda Gates, wife of Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, recently told the New York Times that she is championing wide distribution of the drug as a result of talking to poor women around the world. But Kwame Fosu, policy director for the Rebecca Project for Human Rights, says Mrs. Gates’ claims are “disingenuous” because the women she claims to be helping are not being informed about the dangers involved.

“No African woman would agree to being injected if she had full knowledge of the contraceptives’ dangerous side effects,” Kwame Fosu told C-FAM, the Catholic Family & Human Rights Institute. “In fact,” claimed Fosu, “in countries where women are educated on the harmful complications, Depo Provera use is negligible.”

“Depo Provera (made by the Pfizer Corporation), the most deadly contraceptive (according to the FDA), is being marketed with malice and forethought at our precious women and girls of African descent world wide,” said Dr. Randy Short, a spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Rebecca Project for Human Rights, in a scathing statement earlier this year exposing the Gates-Depo Provera scheme. “Many nations have outlawed it, but it continues to be used in the USA, the Caribbean, Oceania, Latin America, and Africa,” Dr. Short noted. “The use of Depo Provera,” according to Short, “contributes to and in several cases causes life threatening diseases and medical problems: cervical cancer, breast cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke, heart attack, sterility, miscarriages, HIV/AIDS, Chlamydia, and other STIs/STDs.”

Dr. Short said further:

In the USA, 84% of the Depo Provera is used by Black women. Wherever there are high rates of HIV/AIDS in Africa, the use of Depo Provera is universal. As recently as 2010, human experimentation on African women was done illegally with Depo Provera in Ghana. The USAID sends more Depo Provera to Africa than any other drug, and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation recently raised $2.6 billion dollars to buy Depo Provera to be able to “give” it to 100 million African women.

Dr. Short notes that “the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation got into trouble in Niger with some vaccination project being done on 180,000 African women.” “The Gates know that the drug is deadly,” says Short. “Mr. Gates’ father was an ardent eugenicist.”

An extensive new report by the Rebecca Project entitled “Depo-Provera: Deadly Reproductive Violence Against Women” provides a devastating critique of the unethical and criminal activities of organizations promoting the Depo Provera assault on the world’s poor. Among the many important revelations in the report is the dirty secret of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer’s ties to powerful “intermediaries.”

“Since it is illegal for Pfizer to promote off-label claims,” notes the report, “it utilizes intermediaries to evade US law who consequently become liable for the fraudulent promotion, marketing and administering of Depo Provera to women.”

According to the Rebecca Project report, the U.S. Department of Justice should charge Pfizer and its principal institutional intermediaries with fraud for the following and other reasons:

Pfizer with … Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, Population Council, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Planned Parenthood, Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health, are engaged in a pattern of fraudulent and illegal promotion schemes with other agents and contractors, to deceive and defraud patients, US taxpayers, ethical physicians, ethical birth control providers, regulators/FDA, insurance companies, federal and state health programs, to cause prescribing and payments for Depo Provera.

The report also states:

The United States has created a normative population control worldview directed through a surreptitious patchwork of policies promulgated by organizations whose ideological formation and funding eugenicists have provided. At the top tier of population control policy are organizations created by pioneers and patrons of the eugenics movement: Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Population Council, UNFPA (The United Nations Fund for Population Activities), and their patrons: the Ford Foundation, (Margaret Hempel), the Rockefeller Foundation, (Judith Rodin) and USAID. The newcomers to this elite group of eugenicist policymakers are Bill and Melinda Gates, welcomed with their foray into promoting the injectable contraceptive Depo Provera while concealing life-threatening harm.

The “Good Club” Billionaires

As we have reported previously in The New American, Bill and Melinda Gates are members of a secretive, elite clique calling itself “The Good Club,” composed of billionaire eugenicists who champion population control. The members of this group include David Rockefeller, George Soros, Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg, Ted Turner, and Oprah Winfrey. The Good Club is a major backer of the Obama administration’s Global Health Initiative, which is working, among other things, to further empower the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and other United Nations agencies and programs.

“We practiced to this not more than 3 weeks ago,” said LAX Police Chief Patrick Gannon at a press conference hours after the shooting. “We took every one of our patrol officers and a couple hundred officers from the Los Angeles Police Department and we practiced the exact scenario we played out today.”

Why is it that with so many of these terrorist events that there is usually a drill carried on or near the actual date of the atrocity? Is it just a strange coincidence?



Also, why is it that almost all of these mass shooters are labeled anti-government conspiracy theorists? Are the ranks of Alex Jones fans really a bunch of hot heads prepping for mass murders? I’d like to think otherwise as the label ‘conspiracy theorist’ tends to encompass those who simply question the official paradigm.

Of course the drill could be a coincidence. Also, the media could simply be pandering for views by stoking fear. We will likely never know.

One thing is for certain however, and that is the role of the media in the US. They serve as the Praetorian Guard for the establishment. If people like you and I begin to question the status quo, even though we are 100% peaceful, we represent a threat to this establishment; in turn the establishment calls out their guard.

Association fallacies are rife within the MSM. Being that they have no actual evidence of wrong doing by those of us who protest government corruption, they will jump on the chance to associate a murderer with any movement that seems to be gaining ground. “Someone murdered a bunch of people and we found a John Locke book at his house. I heard a libertarian mention John Locke the other day, that libertarian must want to murder people!”

Silly I know, but somehow it still seems to be an effective tool of the establishment. Someone has to be very disturbed to shoot other people for causing them no harm, so saying that this kid was a ‘conspiracy theorist’ means nothing to me and it should mean nothing to you.

If you have sick thoughts of killing innocent people, please seek help, NEVER act upon it. You will not get any credit for your supposed cause, and you will make martyrs out of the ones you opposed.

The short of it is that we may never know if there is some vast conspiracy out for world domination or if they are just a bunch of rich psychopath perverts vying for power over those willing to submit to their authority. I tend to stick with the latter.

After all, these people are nothing without the consent of those who they pretend to rule. They are not the major problem. Sycophant, child molesting rich people will always exist, we just need to stop giving them positions of authority from which they can play out their sick fantasies.

The real change will come from those around you. Spread a message of peace and liberty. Help people to relinquish their dependency upon a violent group of sociopaths that pretend to maintain a façade of order. Once enough people realize that they are their own masters, all those who claim the role of master will cease to exist.","2013-11-02 20:30:33","1","24.0","30.0","5.0","2.0","6.0","0.0","54.0","20.0","0.0","169.0","10.0","13.0","15","552","76.63","84.92","13.24","25.77","18.40","18.30","85.51","54.53","15.04","7.79","1.09","2.36","1.45","0.18","2.72","7.25","8.15","15.22","7.43","4.71","4.35","2.17","12.86","3.62","1.45","1.27","1.45","2.54","7.43","3.62","3.62","0.72","1.63","0.00","13.04","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.18","13.59","3.08","1.27","1.99","4.35","2.54","3.26","1.09","0.18","0.54","0.36","0.72","0.18","0.36","0.18","0.00","11.05","3.99","1.27","5.07","0.72","1.27","1.99","8.70","1.45","9.06","1.09","4.53","3.26","2.54","0.72","0.18","0.54","0.00","0.91","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.23","4.53","3.08","0.00","0.18","0.72","0.18","0.18","1.45","0.54","0.00","0.36","2457","7.44","19.714285714285715","766","550","30","69.82","10.8","8.1","9.57","9.5","101","8.5","16.665454545454548","302","18.07","9","0.5","0","11","7","65","0","73","32","1","0","13","82","28","0","32","2","0","41","8","25","0","0","3","21","0","30","11","11","4","27","14","3","4","0","2"

As if the technological problems facing Obamacare were not enough, a potentially major “legal glitch” could cause the healthcare law to unravel in 36 states. As the LA Times reports, The Affordable Care Act proposes to make health insurance affordable to millions of low-income Americans by offering them tax credits to help cover the cost. To receive the credit, the law twice says they must buy insurance “through an exchange established by the state.” But 36 states have decided against opening exchanges for now. Critics of the law have seized on the glitch. They have filed four lawsuits that urge judges to rule the Obama administration must abide by the strict wording of the law, even if doing so dismantles it in nearly two-thirds of the states. And the Obama administration has no hope of repairing the glitch by legislation as long as the Republicans control the House…“This has the potential to sink Obamacare. It could make the current website problems seem minor by comparison,” noted on policy expert.

Via LA Times,

President Obama’s healthcare law also has a legal glitch that critics say could cause it to unravel in more than half the nation.

…

Apparently no one noticed this when the long and complicated bill worked its way through the House and Senate. Last year, however, the Internal Revenue Service tried to remedy it by putting out a regulation that redefined “exchange” to include a “federally facilitated exchange.” This is “consistent with the language, purpose and structure … of the act as a whole,” the Treasury Department said.

“This is a problem,” said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. “This case could have legs,” although “it was never the intent of Congress to establish federal exchanges that can’t do anything.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/latest-snowden-leak-reveals-nsas-goal-continually-expand-surveillance-abilities/","Latest Snowden leak reveals NSA’s goal to continually expand surveillance abilities","Share +1 Pin Share Shares 0

RT.com

In a mission statement last year the US National Security Agency described how it would continue to expand its power and assert itself as the global leader in clandestine surveillance, according to a new report based on the Edward Snowden leaks.

The five-page document brought to light Friday by the New York Times reveals the intelligence agency’s intention to “aggressively pursue legal authorities and a policy framework mapped more fully to the information age.” The spy agency sought the ability to trace “anyone, anywhere, anytime,” according to its 2012 mission statement.

Dated February 2012, the memo was written after PRISM and many of the other programs that have since outraged the public were implemented. It describes a four-year plan to push the NSA past its current status and into “the golden age of SIGINT,” code for signals intelligence.

“The interpretation and guidelines for applying our authorities, and in some cases the authorities themselves, have not kept pace with the complexity of the technology and target environments, or the operational expectations levied on NSA’s mission.”

The document, given the name “SIGINT Strategy 2012-2016,” falls short of explaining exactly how it would go about assuming more power, but does make clear that the so-called “culture of compliance” would not give up any concessions. The paper indicates NSA leaders communicated the need for more power in order to effectively carry out its duties.

NSA officials did note their plan to subvert cyber-security techniques so intelligence analysts are able to extract information on “anyone, anytime, anywhere.” Using both technical and human intelligence gathering methods, the mission statement sought to “revolutionize” data collection by influencing “the global commercial encryption market through commercial relationships” with more foreign partners.

This memo surfaces as a number of US lawmakers have announced their support for bills that would curb the NSA’s power and possibly grant the agency less funding. Amid allegations that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, the international community has decried the NSA’s activity, with a number of nations vowing to reconsider their relations with the US.

Yet senior intelligence officials who spoke to the Times about the mission statement said its goals were plain and reasonable. One source pointed to the legal stipulation requiring the NSA, if it had been monitoring a terrorism suspect overseas, to seek legal approval in order to continue surveillance if that suspect enters the US.

“NSA’s SIGINT strategy is designed to guide investments in future capabilities and close gaps in current capabilities,” the agency said in a statement released in response to the mission statement’s publication. “In an ever-changing technology and telecommunications environment, NSA tries to get in front of the issues to better fulfill the foreign-intelligence requirements of the US government.”

To meet such requirements, the NSA notes that it hopes to rely less on installing so-called back door policies on messaging services like Google and Facebook. Instead, one of its goals is to “continue to invest in the industrial base and drive the state of the art for high performance computing to maintain pre-eminent cryptanalytic capability for the nation.”

Instead of tapering off, as the public and some lawmakers have hoped, intelligence officials make it clear they intended to “identify new access, collection and exploitation methods by leveraging global business trends in data and communication services.”

The following may just be one of the most hard-hitting GMO (danger) reports ever aired by the mainstream media. Who would have ever thought Fox news would admit the dangers of GMOs? After all, the mainstream media (MSM) have all but done a complete shut-out concerning activist concerns and anti-GMO marches that have happened around the globe. It looks like the evidence was piling up to be far too incontrovertible, though, as Carol Alt (a super model who has been on over 700 magazine covers) and Max Goldberg of LivingWell.com discussed the many studies that articulate the dangers of GMO crops.

If you are going to deliver bad news, it may as well come from a pretty face, right? At least Alt has a history for standing up for true alternative health methods, including raw milk, and the lessening of vaccine use.

Goldberg admits there are no long-term studies on human beings, but that lab tests involving animals are showing atrocious liver damage, kidney problems, and after just three generations of being fed a GMO diet, hamsters are basically sterile. The hosts of the show point out that the main problem is that GMOs are not labeled, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Even if labeling were to occur, it doesn’t change the fact that GMOs are spreading uncontrollably around the world, contaminating non-GM crops and wild plants.

And those in power are pushing GMOs hard – making it difficult to fight back. Bill Gates, for example, proudly supports GMOs and has even purchased half a million shares of Monsanto stock back in 2010, so his connection with GMO development is undeniable.

This is a small caveat that the MSM offers the public, a tiny admission of the larger problem with GMOs overall when there should be a sounding of alarms to a much larger degree as an admonition of the genetically modified world. And it goes beyond food. Paper and lumber companies already have plans to liter the forests with GMO trees, another sign big business is more concerned with their wallets than the health of the planet and its people.

Read: Did GMO and Big Pharma Break the Hippocratic Oath?

After Monsanto, and multiple large corporations spent millions to defeat a GMO labeling bill in Washington just weeks ago, perhaps they are finally getting the hint that GMO activists aren’t going to back down. If Fox News is delivering this message, it might be a sign that the GMO Goliath is stumbling on his shoe laces, and will finally be taken down.

“No long-term studies have ever been done on humans, but when you look at the studies that have been done on animals, it’s pretty appalling,” Goldberg said. “You’re talking about liver damage and kidney damage and when they fed it to hamsters, the third generation of hamsters weren’t able to produce babies, so there’s real safety issues.”

“The real big issue in our country Carol, is that genetically modified food’s are not labeled, so people do not know that they are eating genetically modified foods. Over 60 countries around the world require GMOs to be labeled but the US does not,” Goldberg added. “And why is that? According to the Food & Water Watch, the Ag-Bio tech industry, which owns all these GMOs,has spent $572 million on campaign contributions and lobbying to make sure that they don’t get labeled.”

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/journal-retracts-groundbreaking-gmo-study-monsanto-scientist-hired/","Journal Retracts Groundbreaking GMO Study After Former Monsanto Scientist Is Hired On","By Dr. Mercola



In September of last year, the first-ever lifetime feeding study assessing the health risks of genetically engineered (GE) Roundup Ready corn (NK603) was published in Reed Elsevier’s peer-reviewed journal, Food and Chemical Toxicology. The two-year long study1 led by Gilles-Eric Séralini revealed shocking health effects, including massive tumors and early death. Rats given glyphosate in their drinking water also developed tumors. Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Monsanto’s herbicide Roundup, which has recently been implicated as a major contributor to chronic disease. Needless to say, Séralini’s findings set off a fire-storm of opposition from the industry. Last month, the publisher retracted the study saying it “did not meet scientific standards.” While no errors or misrepresentation of data were found, the study had too small a sample size to make any definite conclusion about health effects, Elsevier said.2, 3, 4, 5 According to Reuters:6 “The journal said that while it received many letters expressing concerns about the validity of the findings, the proper use of animals and even allegations of fraud, its own investigation found ‘no evidence of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the data.’ ‘However, there is a legitimate cause for concern regarding both the number of animals in each study group and the particular strain selected,’ it said.”

Séralini Defends His Research

Séralini vehemently defends his research, and according to some sources may end up taking the issue to court.7 He’s certainly no stranger to legal battles. A mere two years ago, he won a libel case against the French Association of Plant Biotechnologies. As reported by GM Watch in January 2011:8 “Séralini sued for libel following a smear campaign… This was part of a furious response from the GM industry to a number of papers by Seralini and colleagues which demonstrated serious statistical and other shortcomings in the Monsanto research dossiers submitted in support of applications for the approval of three GM varieties. The papers had not argued that the Monsanto GM maize lines were actually dangerous, but had simply argued that there were no grounds for assuming them to be completely harmless. They asked for further research and longer animal feeding studies than those that had been conducted.” The research team issued the following statement9 on GMOSeralini.org: “We, authors of the paper published in FCT more than one year ago on the effects of Roundup and a Roundup-tolerant GMO, and having answered to critics in the same journal, do not accept as scientifically sound the debate on the fact that these papers are inconclusive because of the rat strain or the number of rats used. We maintain our conclusions. We already published some answers to the same critics in your Journal, which have not been answered.” It’s quite noteworthy that after an intense year-long review by the publisher—in addition to being reviewed by twice the typical number of referees prior to publication—the study was not retracted due to errors, fraud, or even the slightest misrepresentation of data. It was retracted because the strain and number of animals used allegedly rendered the findings inconclusive. However, since when are studies retracted for showing inconclusive findings?

Inconclusive Findings Are Not a Valid Ground for Retraction

As noted by GM Watch,10 inconclusiveness of findings is not a valid ground for retraction. According to the guidelines for scientific retractions set out by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), the only grounds for a retraction are: Clear evidence that the findings are unreliable due to misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error

Plagiarism or redundant publication

Unethical research Clearly, the retraction is in violation of COPE guidelines. On his website,11 Séralini defends the use of Sprague Dawley rats, stating this strain of rats is routinely used in studies investigating toxicological and tumor-inducing effects, including in some of Monsanto’s own toxicology studies. One main difference is that Monsanto ended their feeding study at 90 days, and Séralini’s team discovered that tumors and other devastating health effects occurred AFTER the 90-day mark. What’s more, contrary to Séralini’s paper, Monsanto’s study actually contains errors, yet it was never retracted. As reported by ISIS:12 “[A] study published by Monsanto in the same journal in 2004 does contain errors if not outright fraud, basically because the effect of GMOs was not compared with matched isogenic non-GMO controls, while the feed for controls was most likely contaminated with GMOs. That paper should be considered for retraction, but the issue was never even raised.” Séralini also explains and defends the number of animals used, stating that while standard research guidelines call for 20 animals per group in carcinogenicity studies, the team was not performing a carcinogenesis study. They were assessing long-term chronic toxicity, and tumors just happened to be part of the outcome; hence they were reported. As noted by GM Watch:13 “It is important that scientists do not overstate their findings or draw conclusions that are not justified by the data, but Prof Séralini’s paper does not do this. Because Prof Séralini’s study was a chronic toxicity study and not a full-scale carcinogenicity study, which normally requires larger numbers of rats, He conservatively did not do a statistical analysis of the tumors and mortality findings. Instead he simply reported them, without drawing definitive conclusions. This is in line with the OECD chronic toxicity protocol, which requires that any ‘lesions’ (including tumors) observed are recorded.”

The Controversy Deepens

Interestingly, according to one report, Séralini may be planning an experiment that could throw serious doubt on virtually all previous GMO research.14 According to Séralini, all experimental animals are routinely exposed to pollutants and (most likely) GMOs via their chow. This makes it impossible to properly distinguish spontaneous, natural tumors from tumors developed in response to GMOs and other toxic contaminants, and it doesn’t matter how many animals you use in your tests… As stated by Sustainable Pulse:15 “In short, the ultimate defense [of Seralini’s 2012 GM maize study] is to cast doubt on the relevance of the studies done so far. This statement – which would need to be seriously supported – will undoubtedly cause a wave of protest. The editors of the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology were perhaps hoping to extinguish the controversy, but instead they may have fanned the flames.” Indeed, the chemical technology industry, led by Monsanto, is not sitting so pretty right now, and victory shouts of “I told you so” in response to the retraction of Séralini’s hotly contested research falls flat when you consider that the GMO industry just lost one of its own primary scientific figure heads to a string of embarrassing study retractions. I’m talking about Pamela Ronald,16 of course, the public face of GMO research. Two of her scientific papers (published in 2009 and 2011 respectively) were retracted this year, and questions have been raised about a third paper. Her work was correctly retracted due to errors, which included mislabeled samples and failure to use replicable experimental conditions, and more. What many don’t realize is that even a small number of retracted studies can wreak absolute havoc with the science-based paradigm. Other scientists, who have based their research on the results from studies that for whatever reason end up being retracted, are now perpetuating flawed science as well. In this case, Dr. Ronald’s retracted GMO studies have been cited by at least 121 times.17, 18 That’s a large cleanup job in a field that’s already heavily criticized for its preponderance of lousy science. This probably added pressure to even the playing field by removing some of the worst evidence of harm from the table. With Séralini’s findings dismissed, they’ve managed to at least slow down the GMO industry’s demise.

Mistrust in Science Grows as Conflicts of Interest Become the Norm

As if Elsevier wasn’t in enough hot water, the retraction of Séralini’s research comes on the heels of the installation of a Monsanto employee on the publisher’s editorial staff. Earlier this year, they created a brand new editorial position, Associate Editor for Biotechnology and filled it with Richard E. Goodman,19 who was a Monsanto scientist for seven years. Goodman is also an affiliate of the GMO industry-funded group, the International Life Sciences Institute. While on Monsanto’s payroll, he assessed GE crops for allergenicity and published papers on the safety of GE food. While there’s no proof that Goodman was responsible for the retraction, the timing and obnoxiously blatant appearance of conflicts of interest are hard to ignore. As stated by the Institute of Science in Society (ISIS):20 “The journal and its publisher are operating a double standard in retracting a paper reporting adverse health impacts for which no fraud or error was found, as opposed to one claiming no health impacts where serious error at least is involved. This is not just a blatant violation of publishing ethics, it means conspiring to remove from the public record results that could be of great importance for public health. Furthermore, it is an abuse of science and amounts to corporate terrorism on independent science and scientists. It strikes at the very heart of science and democracy, and the aspiration of scientists to work for the public good.” [Emphasis mine] Indeed, regardless of Goodman’s level of involvement, the bizarre justification for retracting Séralini’s study is enough to indicate that “corporate terrorism” has seized the field and is actively undermining science as we know it. Science used to be a field held in the highest of esteem, and all of modern medicine is built on the foundation of “science-based” treatments. Now, it is abundantly clear that the preferred business model of an industry is created first, and “scientific evidence” is then concocted, sometimes almost like an afterthought, to support the established business model—not the other way around, which is how most people understand the fundamental role of science. This is precisely why the scam has worked this long. Everyone just assumes that scientific integrity is somehow assured; that there are safeguards along the way…

The Rise of Corporate Terrorism

“Corporate terrorism” is perhaps one of the most apt descriptions I’ve seen so far to describe what’s happening here. Again and again, papers assessing the prevalence scientific fraud and the impact of conflicts of interest with industry show that the situation is dire and getting worse. In short, we have lost scientific integrity. Without integrity, science is dead. Instead of evidence-based decision making, we now have decision-based evidence making. This is creating a tremendous mistrust of science, and rightfully so. The Séralini case reveals just how gaping a gulf this problem has become. If we don’t have real, independent and unbiased science, how are we to make well-informed decisions about anything—be it related to the medical, chemical, or genetic engineering industries? The entire notion of “science-based”—anything goes right out the window! Where does that ultimately leave us, and how do we proceed? Ever since the introduction of genetically engineered (GE) seeds in the mid-1990s, the market for these chemical-dependent crops have spawned a multibillion dollar industry. Funding for the development of more varieties of GE crop varieties has come primarily from the privately-owned chemical technology industry itself. Over the last 15 years, conflicts of interest within science have exponentially increased, and at this point, it’s blatantly obvious that financial conflicts of interest play a major role when it comes to what research is done; what gets published, and what doesn’t. According to one 2011 study published in the journal Food Policy:21 “In a study involving 94 articles selected through objective criteria, it was found that the existence of either financial or professional conflict of interest was associated to study outcomes that cast genetically modified products in a favorable light. While financial conflict of interest alone did not correlate with research results, a strong association was found between author affiliation to industry (professional conflict of interest) and study outcome. “ Here’s another example of corrupted science. As noted in a 2012 paper published in the journal Nature,22 when researchers looked into the reproducibility of what were considered to be “landmark” cancer studies, they were absolutely shocked to realize that scientific findings could only be confirmed in 11 percent of these “groundbreaking” research cases! Unless a finding can be successfully reproduced, the hypothesis doesn’t hold water. Conflicts of interest are also at the heart of yet another round of controversy revolving around genetically engineered foods. Corinne Lepage, a Member of the European Parliament and former French environment minister recently called for the resignation of Anne Glover, chief scientific adviser to the European Commission. Glover, a GMO-advocate, was appointed to her position two years ago. Now, all of a sudden—for the first time since 1996—the commission is considering authorizing the cultivation of GM corn in Europe.23 Coincidence? Lepage doesn’t think so. Other scientists have also spoken out about the abuse and intimidation they suffer simply for publishing findings that point to problems relating to genetically engineered foods. Some of them are addressed in Emily Waltz’s 2009 report “GM crops: Battlefield,” published in Nature.24

Take a Stand Against Unethical Science

As stated by Corinne Lepage at a November 28 press conference, Séralini’s paper raised valid questions about the safety of GMOs and Roundup, and retracting the paper “will not make these questions disappear.”25 Joël Spiroux de Vendômois, physician and co-author of the Séralini paper called the retraction “a public health scandal,” noting that the journal had already scrutinized the study more closely than other papers prior to publishing. And the European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility issued a statement26 calling the retraction “a travesty of science” that “looks like a bow to industry.” It sure does look like it, and Elsevier has the history to support such suspicions as well. Many may have forgotten this, but it was only four years ago that Elsevier was found to have created no less than six “science journals” that were nothing of the sort.27 The journals were designed to look like peer-reviewed medical journals—little did doctors know that the magazines were sponsored by unnamed pharmaceutical companies and contained reprints of favorable studies and single-source reviews. In short, it was “undercover corporate propaganda.” The publisher has also drawn enough ire from academics fed up with Elsevier’s business practices, especially its pricing. According to ISIS, more than 13,970 academics from all subjects have signed a boycott against the publisher, pledging not to publish, referee, or do editorial work for them. Now, a group of scientists have drafted an open letter requesting Elsevier reverse its retraction of the Séralini paper, and to issue a public apology to the authors. “Until this is done, we will boycott Elsevier, decline to purchase Elsevier products, submit papers for publication, review papers or do editorial work for Elsevier,” the letter states. The letter may be signed by scientists and non-scientists alike. In the time it took me to write this article, the letter received another 15 signatures by scientists. Please take a moment to sign the letter, and forward it as widely as possible.

‘There are no farms in Manhattan, but residents there have collected subsidies totaling nearly $9 million in the past seven years. Recipients also include Mark F. Rockefeller ($356,018) and David Rockefeller ($591,057). Yes, the Rockefeller family (Standard Oil, Chase Manhattan Bank, etc.). This is from a recent report by the Heritage Foundation titled, The Rich and the Famous at the Farm Bill Trough. This report illustrates that giveaways to agri-giants and fat cat bankers is the rule, not the exception.

The looting doesn’t stop with bankers and agri-giants, actual members of Congress and their families collect these subsidies as well.

Lynda L. Lucas, the wife of House Agriculture Committee chairman Frank Lucas (R–OK), collected $40,613

Senator Charles Grassley (R–IA) has collected $955,192 in taxpayer subsidies from 1995 through 2012.

Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.), has received more than $5 million in crop subsidies

Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), has received nearly $3.5 million in subsidies.

The Agriculture Risk Coverage provision, also known as crop insurance, seems like a reasonable part of the bill that would protect farmers from damage to their crops from natural disasters. However this is hardly the case, crop insurance, is actually a revenue protection program that guarantees 89 percent of their Benchmark Revenue of the last five years. With prices averaging at record highs over the last few years any natural correction of falling prices will be covered with your tax dollars.

Farmers with average incomes above the $250,000 marker make up about 10 percent of the subsidy recipients, however they receive 30% of the total payouts from crop insurance. Riceland Foods, Inc. collected $554,343,039 between 1995 and 2012. According to news reports, Riceland reported sales of $1.16 billion during 2011–2012. These agricultural behemoths do not need tax payer support. According the USDA’s Economic Research Service, “After adjusting for inflation, 2013’s net farm income, forecast at $128.2 billion, is expected to be the highest since 1973.”

Americans need to wake up. The fox is in the hen house and there are very few hens left to eat. We are threatened with force and violence by the government if we do not pay our “fair share.” Then the government takes this newly extorted revenue and gives it to their buddies. There is a term for what is happening here and it is most definitely NOT “paying our fair share,” it is called robbery. Simply because the IRS claims authority over you does not justify this theft.

When will enough be enough? How much more blood and sweat can the government squeeze from the American people to fill their own coffers before we say no? One thing is for certain, as long as they are able to rob us, they will rob us. It is up to you and I to expose the state for what they really are, a gang of thieves, writ large.

A Washington State ballot measure to label food featuring genetically modified crops is under fire as food and chemical corporations pour millions of dollars against the campaign.

On November 5, voters will head to the polls to decide whether or not to label food containing crops that have been genetically modified, but what started out as a landslide victory in the making has turned into a tight contest amidst massive corporate spending.

Supporters of ballot measure I-522 argue that this is an issue of transparency, and letting consumers know when their food contains genetically modified organisms (GMO) would enable them to make more educated decisions. They also say that GMO are not safe for human or animal consumption, and cause environmental problems by promoting the use of certain farming chemicals.

Opponents, spearheaded by the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), claim that not only is genetically modified food safe to eat, but also that the initiative would mistakenly cause people to think there’s something wrong with products featuring GMO labels. The end result would be that the cost of food at grocery stores would rise and place an unnecessary burden on shoppers.

“It would require tens of thousands of common food and beverage products to be relabeled exclusively for Washington state unless they are remade with higher-priced, specially developed ingredients,” Brian Kennedy, GMA spokesman, said to Al Jazeera America. “The measure will increase grocery costs for a typical Washington family by hundreds of dollars per year.”

Both sides have raised about $28 million combined in campaign spending, but the vast majority of the cash – $22 million, to be precise – has come from groups opposing the bill. The GMA, a group acting on the behalf of more than 300 different food and beverage companies, has raised $11 million to push back against I-522. Other corporations like PepsiCo, General Mills, Nestle, and Monsanto are major fundraising contributors. Monsanto alone contributed roughly $5.4 million in funds, according to Reuters.

Supporters of GMO labeling, meanwhile, have raised roughly $6.8 million.

“They are making this the most expensive race and are desperately adding last-minute money to try and buy this election,” Liz Larter, spokeswoman for the “Yes on 522” campaign, told Reuters.

Regardless of the reason, the race has certainly tightened. In September, one poll showed support for labeling up by a staggering 45 percent. Two recent polls tell a much different story, though: Supporters are still leading, but by much smaller margins. One poll showed them ahead 45 to 38 percent, while the other indicated an even slimmer advantage of 46 to 42 percent.

During the 2012 national election, a similar initiative was put to a vote in California, where it was defeated by a vote of 51.4 percent against to 48.6 percent in favor.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/ndian-farmers-growing-record-yields-gmo-crops-pesticides/","Indian Farmers Growing Record Yields With No GMO Crops or Pesticides","Contrary to claims by Monsanto and government conspirators, we can indeed meet the world’s hunger without the use of genetically modified seed and manufactured chemicals. Bumper crops of rice, potatoes, and wheat are being grown in India using methods of Agroecology.

Agroecology is a dynamic agricultural approach that uses scientific information and local knowledge to produce practical methods that are low-cost and ecologically sound. This is quite a contrast to the “one size fits all” approach of GMO crops and chemical inputs being peddled by Monsanto and friends.

A particular kind of agroecology called System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is being applied in India to produce the record-setting yields.

SRI was developed in the 1980’s in Madagascar by Fr. Henri de Laulanié, S.J. He sought to improve their agricultural systems without being dependent on external inputs, as poverty was a widespread problem. Fr. Laulanié established a non-governmental organization that began working with the Cornell International Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development in 1994.

Now, SRI “is being hailed as one of the most significant developments of the past 50 years for the world’s 500 million small-scale farmers and the two billion people who depend on them.”","2013-10-28 21:01:03","1","19.0","34.0","5.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","52.0","20.0","0.0","173.0","10.0","13.0","15","201","95.31","61.75","3.94","18.44","18.27","31.34","67.16","38.81","4.48","1.99","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.50","1.00","2.49","7.46","14.43","6.97","1.00","5.47","1.00","10.45","2.99","1.99","0.50","4.48","1.00","1.49","0.50","1.00","0.00","0.00","0.50","4.48","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.50","8.46","1.49","2.99","0.50","1.99","1.00","1.00","1.00","0.50","0.50","0.00","2.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.99","7.46","1.49","1.00","2.99","1.00","1.00","3.48","5.97","0.00","8.96","1.49","5.47","1.99","5.97","0.00","0.00","1.00","0.00","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.00","15.92","5.97","3.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.99","1.99","1.49","1.00","0.00","1026","9.36","18.545454545454547","335","196","10","43.12","13.8","12.1","14.74","14.4","59","11.8","21.880816326530617","135","17.45","7","0.4","0","9","9","17","0","26","18","0","0","1","26","28","0","16","0","0","3","1","5","0","1","0","5","0","5","5","7","7","3","8","3","1","0","0"

The officer said the dog jumped a fence and he feared he would harm the children.

But Freckles’ owner, SarahRose Hecht, contended her “son” would not harm anyone. She paid more than $1,000 in veterinarian bills in a futile attempt to save her pet. She later organized a “Justice for Freckles” protest at which she and others demanded mandatory training on dealing with unruly dogs for all police.

“I have no doubt my dog would still be alive if the officer had on iota of training on dog behavior and dog psychology,” said Hecht, 27, who still sobs when talking about Freckles. “There was no reason for deadly force.”

Hecht could get her wish. State Sen. David Parks, D-Las Vegas, has requested legislation to require police to go through training in dealing with dogs to avoid shooting of peoples’ prized pets.

Wall Street Journal

Everyone now is clamoring about Affordable Care Act winners and losers. I am one of the losers.

My grievance is not political; all my energies are directed to enjoying life and staying alive, and I have no time for politics. For almost seven years I have fought and survived stage-4 gallbladder cancer, with a five-year survival rate of less than 2% after diagnosis. I am a determined fighter and extremely lucky. But this luck may have just run out: My affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled effective Dec. 31.

My choice is to get coverage through the government health exchange and lose access to my cancer doctors, or pay much more for insurance outside the exchange (the quotes average 40% to 50% more) for the privilege of starting over with an unfamiliar insurance company and impaired benefits.

Parents of a sixth grade student at the Milam Elementary School in Tupelo, Mississippi were shocked when their daughter brought home a political beliefs worksheet that teachers told students to fill out.

The in-class assignment entitled “Are you a Democrat or Republican?” was posted to the “Stop Common Core in Mississippi” Facebook page with a message alleging that the young female student was told not to talk about or take the assignment outside of class, although some parents refute the claim.

Regardless, the assignment, written for 11-year-old children, asks students what their beliefs are on such issues as abortion, gun control and gay marriage, before having them tally up their “D” and “R” answers to determine which establishment party they belong to.

The worksheet, which has a clear bias towards more government control, goes on to frame such topics as healthcare as supporting care for everyone including the poor if your a Democrat, and essentially denying care to those who cannot afford it if you are a Republican. The paper gives no historical context of the incredible failures of government run healthcare, the millions currently losing their health insurance due to government intervention, or the government’s direct relation to dwindling quality, skyrocketing costs and loss of charity care as the push for government monopoly by both parties’ leadership continues.

The section regarding beliefs on military spending attempts to paint the Democratic party as more anti-war and pro-veteran with Republicans supporting more military intervention and bare minimum aid for those who served. Despite the so called anti-war left becoming nearly non-existent as President Obama expands his drone program and foreign entanglements, the reality of the Republican and Democrat leadership’s continued support of groups who kill our soldiers, while ignoring our veterans perils at home, is unsurprisingly absent.

Many parents not only found the assignment highly inappropriate, but question if the assignment was an attempt to gauge families’ political affiliations given the fact that many sixth graders would likely repeat what they heard at home, not having a true personal understanding of the listed topics. The assignment also clearly attempts to push children into the mindset that there are only two political parties and two mainline opinions to hold on any important topic.

Just last month, 12-year-old students in Colorado were given a similar assignment as well. A quiz entitled “Righty or Lefty?” had near-identical questions, clearly leading children towards the assumption that government is the answer to all issues facing the country.

In similar fashion, parents in Arkansas were shocked to learn that their sixth grade students were being asked to revise the “outdated” Bill of Rights after an assignment informed them that the U.S. government decided that it “may not remain in its current form any longer.”

Other outrages, such as fourth grade students in Illinois being forced to read a biography of the president that labels all white voters as inherently racist, have contributed to the rise in homeschooling as parents reject the MSNBC talking point that all children belong to the “collective” and not their parents.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-arrest-multiple-special-high-school-students-highly-unethical-drug-sting/","Police Arrest Multiple Special Needs High School Students in Highly Unethical Drug Sting","The war on drugs has reached a new low. 22 students at one high school alone, most of which were special needs students, were targeted in a highly disreputable ‘sting’ operation.

Children that have a hard time making friends because of their special needs, are easy prey for cops trying to persuade them into procuring drugs. These poor kids are unwilling victims of this failed system of prohibition that does more to ruin the lives of teens than keep them ‘safe.’

At any one time, 59,300 prisoners charged with or convicted of violating marijuana laws are behind bars. Of those, 17,000 are behind bars for possession ONLY, not trafficking. Enforcing marijuana laws costs an estimated $10-15 billion in direct costs alone. Not to mention the sustained costs of incarceration of the individual who has done nothing to harm anyone. It is estimated that the money spent enforcing useless marijuana laws is double what we spend on education in this country.

A recent study conducted by the University of California, Center for Medicinal Cannabis, was published that sheds light on government prohibition of marijuana and its ridiculous implications. The irony here is that this study, published in The Open Neurology Journal, was sponsored by government.

The hypocrisy of marijuana remaining a Schedule 1 drug, “No Medical Use Whatsoever,” seems criminal when considering that pharmaceutical companies reproduce a chemical version of THC and are able to market and sell it as such. Marinol is a pharmaceutical chemical drug produced by Solvay Pharmaceuticals Inc. It contains the exact molecular structure of the THC molecule and has the same effects of marijuana. However you cannot grow Marinol in your backyard. You cannot make obscene profits from the patent of a plant, because luckily, the state has not granted their mega –corporations the ability to patent nature, yet. The contradiction here is that you can make nature illegal, and then recreate nature in a lab using chemicals, put that illegal part of nature, available for profit, into a pill and make millions.

The government funded study, appropriately titled, Medical Marijuana: Clearing Away the Smoke, concludes: “Based on evidence currently available the Schedule I classification is not tenable; it is not accurate that cannabis has no medical value, or that information on safety is lacking…. The continuing conflict between scientific evidence and political ideology will hopefully be reconciled in a judicious manner.”

It’s time for this so-called ‘war’ to stop.","2013-12-09 19:40:11","1","15.0","30.0","5.0","1.0","5.0","0.0","53.0","20.0","0.0","169.0","10.0","13.0","15","408","88.85","50.98","12.90","10.35","20.40","29.90","81.13","44.85","8.82","2.45","0.25","0.25","0.98","0.00","0.98","6.37","7.84","13.73","7.60","2.21","3.92","2.45","12.75","4.17","1.47","0.98","3.19","1.47","6.13","2.45","3.68","0.00","1.23","1.47","4.66","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","10.78","2.21","2.94","0.98","2.21","0.74","2.94","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.25","4.41","0.00","3.68","0.00","0.98","9.07","0.74","0.98","6.13","0.49","1.23","1.96","9.56","0.74","9.80","0.49","6.37","2.94","7.11","2.21","0.25","2.94","0.00","0.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.44","5.15","6.13","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.49","1.72","0.98","0.00","0.25","2065","9.02","22.72222222222222","662","404","20","50.97","14.0","11.2","13.46","13.6","112","10.5","21.16910891089109","253","20.78","5","0.43","0","9","11","42","0","56","44","1","1","2","62","28","0","28","0","0","12","4","18","0","0","0","7","0","14","9","13","15","10","17","3","2","0","1"

In a White House press conference Thursday the press corps finally had enough. Questions were being asked about the lack of transparency within this administration and this was sufficient to raise a protest at this overt secrecy shown by the Obama Administration.

In fact, a recent report found that the Obama administration has gone to unprecedented lengths to thwart journalists. According to the Huffington Post, for 32 years, the Committee to Protect Journalists has been better known for investigating press freedom under authoritarian governments, or where journalists are killed with impunity or in war zones. But this spring’s revelations about the Justice Department secretly seizing phone records at The Associated Press and obtaining a Fox News reporter’s email account have increased concerns closer to home.

Downie, a journalism professor at Arizona State University, expressed concerns in late May about the future of investigative reporting in light of the AP and Fox News revelations. Shortly after that, the Committee to Protect Journalists asked Downie to investigate. Downie in recent months spoke with journalists, government transparency advocates and current and former government officials.

In the report, Downie examined a range of Obama administration tactics that hinder government transparency. These include unprecedented use of the Espionage Act in prosecuting media leaks, classifying government documents as secret when no harm could come from their release, increased government surveillance that jeopardizes the safety of news sources, Freedom of Information Act violations, and White House-produced content that can’t substitute for independent, accountability journalism.","2013-12-13 13:19:34","1","12.0","30.0","5.0","1.0","5.0","0.0","58.0","20.0","0.0","169.0","10.0","13.0","15","254","97.52","59.33","24.86","39.87","25.40","33.86","74.80","38.19","4.33","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.39","3.94","7.87","15.75","4.33","2.76","4.33","0.79","8.27","4.33","2.76","0.79","1.18","0.00","4.72","2.76","1.97","0.00","1.57","0.00","4.72","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.87","3.15","1.57","0.79","1.57","0.39","1.57","3.54","1.18","0.79","1.57","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.39","10.24","1.18","1.18","6.30","0.79","1.97","4.33","5.12","0.79","12.99","1.57","6.30","4.72","10.24","0.39","1.18","1.97","0.00","0.79","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.42","3.94","5.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.00","1.18","0.00","0.39","1453","9.51","25.7","445","253","10","28.88","17.0","15.5","17.18","19.0","74","13.0","23.819604743083005","165","23.4","1","0.37","0","9","3","26","0","36","16","0","0","2","48","41","0","22","0","0","0","1","4","1","0","0","8","0","6","10","7","7","3","4","1","0","0","2"

By Chase Madar

If all you’ve got is a hammer, then everything starts to look like a nail. And if police and prosecutors are your only tool, sooner or later everything and everyone will be treated as criminal. This is increasingly the American way of life, a path that involves “solving” social problems (and even some non-problems) by throwing cops at them, with generally disastrous results. Wall-to-wall criminal law encroaches ever more on everyday life as police power is applied in ways that would have been unthinkable just a generation ago.

By now, the militarization of the police has advanced to the point where “the War on Crime” and “the War on Drugs” are no longer metaphors but bland understatements. There is the proliferation of heavily armed SWAT teams, even in small towns; the use of shock-and-awe tactics to bust small-time bookies; the no-knock raids to recover trace amounts of drugs that often result in the killing of family dogs, if not family members; and in communities where drug treatment programs once were key, the waging of a drug version of counterinsurgency war. (All of this is ably reported on journalist Radley Balko’s blog and in his book, The Rise of the Warrior Cop.) But American over-policing involves far more than the widely reported up-armoring of your local precinct. It’s also the way police power has entered the DNA of social policy, turning just about every sphere of American life into a police matter.

The School-to-Prison Pipeline

It starts in our schools, where discipline is increasingly outsourced to police personnel. What not long ago would have been seen as normal childhood misbehavior – doodling on a desk, farting in class, a kindergartener’s tantrum – can leave a kid in handcuffs, removed from school, or even booked at the local precinct. Such “criminals” can be as young as seven-year-old Wilson Reyes, a New Yorker who was handcuffed and interrogated under suspicion of stealing five dollars from a classmate. (Turned out he didn’t do it.)

Though it’s a national phenomenon, Mississippi currently leads the way in turning school behavior into a police issue. The Hospitality State has imposed felony charges on schoolchildren for “crimes” like throwing peanuts on a bus. Wearing the wrong color belt to school got one child handcuffed to a railing for several hours. All of this goes under the rubric of “zero-tolerance” discipline, which turns out to be just another form of violence legally imported into schools.

Despite a long-term drop in youth crime, the carceral style of education remains in style. Metal detectors — a horrible way for any child to start the day — are installed in ever more schools, even those with sterling disciplinary records, despite the demonstrable fact that such scanners provide no guarantee against shootings and stabbings.

Every school shooting, whether in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, or Littleton, Colorado, only leads to more police in schools and more arms as well. It’s the one thing the National Rifle Association and Democratic senators can agree on. There are plenty of successful ways to run an orderly school without criminalizing the classroom, but politicians and much of the media don’t seem to want to know about them. The “school-to-prison pipeline,” a jargon term coined by activists, isentering the vernacular.

Go to Jail, Do Not Pass Go

Even as simple a matter as getting yourself from point A to point B can quickly become a law enforcement matter as travel and public space are ever more aggressively policed. Waiting for a bus? Such loitering just got three Rochester youths arrested. Driving without a seat belt can easily escalate into an arrest, even if the driver is a state judge. (Notably, all four of these men were black.) If the police think you might be carrying drugs, warrantless body cavity searches at the nearest hospital may be in the offing — you will be sent the bill later.

Air travel entails increasingly intimate pat-downs and arbitrary rules that many experts see as nothing more than “security theater.” As for staying at home, it carries its own risks as Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates found out when a Cambridge police officer mistook him for a burglar and hauled him away — a case that is hardly unique.

Overcriminalization at Work

Office and retail work might seem like an unpromising growth area for police and prosecutors, but criminal law has found its way into the white-collar workplace, too. Just ask Georgia Thompson, a Wisconsin state employee targetedby a federal prosecutor for the “crime” of incorrectly processing a travel agency’s bid for state business. She spent four months in a federal prison before being sprung by a federal court. Or Judy Wilkinson, hauled away in handcuffs by an undercover cop for serving mimosas without a license to the customers in her bridal shop. Or George Norris, sentenced to 17 months in prison for selling orchids without the proper paperwork to an undercover federal agent.

Increasingly, basic economic transactions are being policed under the purview of criminal law. In Arkansas, for instance, Human Rights Watch reports that a new law funnels delinquent (or allegedly delinquent) rental tenants directly to the criminal courts, where failure to pay up can result in quick arrest and incarceration, even though debtor’s prison as an institution was supposed to have ended in the nineteenth century.

And the mood is spreading. Take the asset bubble collapse of 2008 and the rising cries of progressives for the criminal prosecution of Wall Street perpetrators, as if a fundamentally sound financial system had been abused by a small number of criminals who were running free after the debacle. Instead of pushing a debate about how to restructure our predatory financial system, liberals in their focus on individual prosecution are aping the punitive zeal of the authoritarians. A few high-profile prosecutions for insider trading (which had nothing to do with the last crash) have, of course, not changed Wall Street one bit.

Criminalizing Immigration

The past decade has also seen immigration policy ingested by criminal law. According to another Human Rights Watch report — their U.S. division is increasingly busy — federal criminal prosecutions of immigrants for illegal entry have surged from 3,000 in 2002 to 48,000 last year. This novel application of police and prosecutors has broken up families and fueled the expansion of for-profit detention centers, even as it has failed to show any stronger deterrent effect on immigration than the civil law system that preceded it. Thanks to Arizona’s SB 1070 bill, police in that state are now licensed to stop and check the papers of anyone suspected of being undocumented — that is, who looks Latino.

Meanwhile, significant parts of the US-Mexico border are now militarized (as increasingly is the Canadian border), including what seem to resemble free-fire zones. And if anyone were to leave bottled water for migrants illegally crossing the desert and in danger of death from dehydration, that good Samaritan should expect to face criminal charges, too. Intensified policing with aggressive targets for arrests and deportations are guaranteed to be a part of any future bipartisan deal on immigration reform.

Digital Over-Policing

As for the Internet, for a time it was terra nova and so relatively free of a steroidal law enforcement presence. Not anymore. The late Aaron Swartz, a young Internet genius and activist affiliated with Harvard University, was caught downloading masses of scholarly articles (all publicly subsidized) from an open network on the MIT campus. Swartz was federally prosecuted under the capacious Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for violating a “terms and services agreement” — a transgression that anyone who has ever disabled a cookie on his or her laptop has also, technically, committed. Swartz committed suicide earlier this year while facing a possible 50-year sentence and up to a million dollars in fines.

Since the summer, thanks to whistleblowing contractor Edward Snowden, we have learned a great deal about the way the NSA stops and frisks our (and apparently everyone else’s) digital communications, both email and telephonic. The security benefits of such indiscriminate policing are far from clear, despite the government’s emphatic but inconsistent assurances otherwise. What comes into sharper focus with every volley of new revelations is the emerging digital infrastructure of what can only be called a police state.

Sex Police

Sex is another zone of police overkill in our post-Puritan land. Getting put on a sex offender registry is alarmingly easy — as has been done to children as young as 11 for “playing doctor” with a relative, again according to Human Rights Watch. But getting taken off the registry later is extraordinarily difficult. Across the nation, sex offender registries have expanded massively, especially in California, where one in every 380 adults is now a registered sex offender, creating a new pariah class with severe obstacles to employment, housing, or any kind of community life. The proper penalty for, say, an 18-year-old who has sex with a 14-year-old can be debated, but should that 18-year-old’s life really be ruined forever?

Equality Before the Cops?

It will surprise no one that Americans are not all treated equally by the police. Law enforcement picks on kids more than adults, the queer more than straight, Muslims more than Methodists – Muslims a lot more than Methodists — antiwar activists more than the apolitical. Above all, our punitive state targets the poor more than the wealthy and Blacks and Latinos more than white people.

A case in point: after the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School, a police presence, including surveillance cameras and metal detectors, was ratcheted up at schools around the country, particularly in urban areas with largely working-class black and Latino student bodies. It was all to “protect” the kids, of course. At Columbine itself, however, no metal detector was installed and no heavy police presence intruded. The reason was simple. At that school in the Colorado suburb of Littleton, the mostly well-heeled white families did not want their kids treated like potential felons, and they had the status and political power to get their way. But communities without such clout are less able to push back against the encroachments of police power.

Even Our Prisons Are Over-Policed

The over-criminalization of American life empties out into our vast, overcrowded prison system, which is itself over-policed. The ultimate form of punitive control (and torture) is long-term solitary confinement, in which 80,000 to 100,000 prisoners are encased at any given moment. Is this really necessary? Solitary is no longer reserved for the worst or the worst or most dangerous prisoners but can be inflicted on ones who wear Rastafari dreadlocks, have a copy of Sun Tzu’s Art of War in their cell, or are in any way suspected, no matter how tenuous the grounds, of gang affiliations.

Not every developed nation does things this way. Some 30 years ago, Great Britain shifted from isolating prisoners to, whenever possible, giving them greater responsibility and autonomy — with less violent results. But don’t even bring the subject up here. It will fall on deaf ears.

Extreme policing is exacerbated by extreme sentencing. For instance, more than 3,000 Americans have been sentenced to life terms without chance of parole for nonviolent offenses. These are mostly but not exclusively drug offenses, including life for a pound of cocaine that a boyfriend stashed in the attic; selling LSD at a Grateful Dead concert; and shoplifting three belts from a department store.

Our incarceration rate is the highest in the world, triple that of the now-defunct East Germany. The incarceration rate for African American men is about five times higher than that of the Soviet Union at the peak of the gulag.

The Destruction of Families

Prison may seem the logical finale for this litany of over-criminalization, but the story doesn’t actually end with those inmates. As prisons warehouse ever more Americans, often hundreds of miles from their local communities, family bonds weaken and disintegrate. In addition, once a parent goes into the criminal justice system, his or her family tends to end up on the radar screens of state agencies. “Being under surveillance by law enforcement makes a family much more vulnerable to Child Protective Services,” says Professor Dorothy Roberts of the University of Pennsylvania Law school. An incarcerated parent, especially an incarcerated mother, means a much stronger likelihood that children will be sent into foster care, where, according to one recent study, they will be twice as likely as war veterans to suffer from PTSD.

In New York State, the Administration for Child Services and the juvenile justice system recently merged, effectively putting thousands of children in a heavily policed, penalty-based environment until they age out. “Being in foster care makes you much more vulnerable to being picked up by the juvenile justice system,” says Roberts. “If you’re in a group home and you get in a fight, that could easily become a police matter.” In every respect, the creeping over-criminalization of everyday life exerts a corrosive effect on American families.

Do We Live in a Police State?

The term “police state” was once brushed off by mainstream intellectuals as the hyperbole of paranoids. Not so much anymore. Even in the tweediest precincts of the legal system, the over-criminalization of American life is remarked upon with greater frequency and intensity. “You’re probably a (federal) criminal” is the accusatory title of a widely read essay co-authored by Judge Alex Kozinski of the 9th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. A Republican appointee, Kozinski surveys the morass of criminal laws that make virtually every American an easy target for law enforcement. Veteran defense lawyer Harvey Silverglate has written an entire book about how an average American professional could easily commit three felonies in a single day without knowing it.

The daily overkill of police power in the U.S. goes a long way toward explaining why more Americans aren’t outraged by the “excesses” of the war on terror, which, as one law professor has argued, are just our everyday domestic penal habits exported to more exotic venues. It is no less true that the growth of domestic police power is, in this positive feedback loop, the partial result of our distant foreign wars seeping back into the homeland (the “imperial boomerang” that Hannah Arendt warned against).

Many who have long railed against our country’s everyday police overkill have reacted to the revelations of NSA surveillance with detectable exasperation: of course we are over-policed! Some have even responded with peevish resentment: Why so much sympathy for this Snowden kid when the daily grind of our justice system destroys so many lives without comment or scandal? After all, in New York, the police department’s “stop and frisk” tactic, which targets African American and Latino working-class youth for routinized street searches, was until recently uncontroversial among the political and opinion-making class. If “the gloves came off” after September 11, 2001, many Americans were surprised to learn they had ever been on to begin with.

A hammer is necessary to any toolkit. But you don’t use a hammer to turn a screw, chop a tomato, or brush your teeth. And yet the hammer remains our instrument of choice, both in the conduct of our foreign policy and in our domestic order. The result is not peace, justice, or prosperity but rather a state that harasses and imprisons its own people while shouting ever less intelligibly about freedom.

How far would you go to protest the police state? Pyotr Pavlensky, a Russian performance artist, takes his protest to the ultimate extreme.

In the past, he’s wrapped himself in barbed wire and even sewn up his mouth to protest the imprisonment of Pussy Riot.

But this week, he takes it to a whole new level. He actually nails his scrotum to Red Square in protest of the police state.","2013-11-13 16:11:04","1","11.0","30.0","5.0","1.0","5.0","0.0","52.0","20.0","0.0","169.0","10.0","13.0","15","76","92.84","88.18","1.00","9.56","15.20","18.42","78.95","44.74","13.16","10.53","0.00","0.00","1.32","9.21","0.00","2.63","9.21","14.47","2.63","3.95","3.95","0.00","6.58","7.89","0.00","1.32","2.63","1.32","9.21","3.95","5.26","0.00","5.26","0.00","14.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.21","5.26","0.00","1.32","1.32","0.00","0.00","2.63","2.63","2.63","0.00","0.00","2.63","2.63","0.00","1.32","0.00","10.53","3.95","0.00","3.95","2.63","0.00","1.32","9.21","0.00","13.16","1.32","7.89","3.95","3.95","1.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.32","1.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.47","5.26","5.26","0.00","0.00","1.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.32","0.00","1.32","325","6.68","15.4","93","76","5","89.89","8.2","4.5","8.23","7.4","11","6.8","13.869473684210528","56","15.0","0","0.42","0","2","2","8","0","5","4","0","0","1","18","9","0","0","0","0","6","3","3","0","0","1","5","0","4","1","0","0","0","5","0","0","0","0"

Adam Kredo

The National Security Agency recorded information about more than 124 billion phone calls during a 30-day period earlier this year, including around 3 billion calls from U.S. sources, according to a tally from top-secret documents released by multiple news outlets.

Documents revealing details about the NSA’s Boundless Informant program show that information regarding billions of phone calls and computer communications was collected by the agency from across the world.

Boundless Informant “allows users to select a country on a map and view the meta data volume and select details about the collections against that country,” according to the Guardian, which first reported on the top secret program earlier this year.

Multiple leaked screenshots of the Boundless Informant program show that information on around 124.8 billion phone calls were collected in just 30-days this year, according to documents released by the Guardian and other news sites.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/rate-shock-obamacare-causing-539-increase-health-insurance-costs-texans-see-proof/","RATE SHOCK: Obamacare causing 539% increase in health insurance costs for Texans (see proof)","Mike Adams

It is crucial for the White House that the Healthcare.gov website continue to fail, because once the site actually starts functioning, Americans are going to be hit with such devastating rate shock that the Obama administration may never recover.

Obamacare is named the “Affordable Care Act,” after all, and the President promised the rates would be “as low as a phone bill.” But I just received a confirmed letter from a friend in Texas showing a 539% rate increase on an existing policy that’s been in good standing for years.

As the letter reveals (see below), the cost for this couple’s policy under Humana is increasing from $212.10 per month to $1,356.60 per month. This is for a couple in good health whose combined income is less than $70K — a middle-class family, in other words.

That’s a 539% rate increase!

$1,356.60 per month is not “affordable” health care. It’s monopolistic price gouging mandated by the Obama administration and enforced essentially at gunpoint. This isn’t health care; it’s highway robbery.

To clarify: this increased rate policy is not “under” Healthcare.gov, but the 539% rate increase is being caused because of Obamacare’s new rules and requirements. If Obamacare hadn’t become law, this couple could have continued spending $212 per month. Instead, they’re now going to have to spend $1,356 per month or sign up for Obamacare and hope to get a better rate there (if the website even functions long enough to enroll).

Here’s a scan of the actual letter:

Millions are losing health care coverage thanks to Obamacare

All across America, people are getting hit with letters like these. Some letters inform you that you’ll have to pay double, triple or quadruple the current rates; other letters tell you your coverage is being dropped completely. According to one health policy expert, 16 million Americans will lose their health insurance due to Obamacare.

This mass wipeout of health insurance coverage is already under way. So far 1.5 million Americans have already lost their health insurance thanks to Obamacare. That number is a large multiple of how many people have actually enrolled in Obamacare. (Far more people are losing health insurance than gaining it.)

Also, according to NBC News, Obama knew well in advance that millions of Americans would lose their insurance. This didn’t stop him from lying to the public, however, and claiming, “You can keep your current insurance” if you like it.

Everything about Obamacare has been a blatant lie, it seems: the Affordable Care Act is not affordable; you can’t necessarily keep your doctor; and you can’t even shop for policies because the Healthcare.gov website continues to crash worse than a low-budget carnival ride.

It’s so bad that even Saturday Night Live, which practically functions as the comedy mouthpiece for the Democratic party, tore into the fiasco with a blistering comedy skit that paints HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius as a delusional, out-of-touch Obamacare apologist. Watch it at:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsT_q_MR7Xw

or

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx7Nwj5M1Kc

In the parody video, Sebelius says:

“If our site keeps freezing, we’ve also provided helpful links to other websites such as Kayak.com, where you can purchase airline tickets to Canada, where you can buy cheaper prescription drugs.”

Obamacare has five critical, show-stopper problems, each of which could independently bring down the whole system

Problem #1) The disastrous Healthcare.gov website which still doesn’t work.

Problem #2) RATE SHOCK as Americans realize they are going to have to pay up to 539% more just to keep their current health insurance plans.

Problem #3) The massive, widespread cancellation of existing health insurance policies because of Obamacare. Millions of Americans are losing their health care coverage right now…

Problem #4) Critical failures communicating insurance status to doctors, hospitals and health service providers (this hasn’t even been tested, and once it is initiated, it will crash hard).

Problem #5) Massive hacker theft of personal data thanks to disastrous security engineered into Healthcare.gov. Expect to see widespread theft of personal data (social security numbers, bank account information and more) if the Healthcare.gov website ever starts to function. The only reason personal data hasn’t yet been stolen from the site is because the servers crash too quickly for hackers to get through.

Bottom line: Obamacare is an economic apocalypse for America

Beyond the lies and campaign promises, the real ramifications of Obamacare are:

• Widespread job losses as employers cut hours and fire workers they can no longer afford to keep on the payroll thanks to Obamacare.

• Millions of Americans losing their existing health insurance coverage.

• Insane rate increases under a monopoly system that forces Americans to pay exorbitant fees to a cabal of insurance companies and drug companies.

• The widespread medical bankruptcy of American workers, families and employers.

This is all by design, and it was all made possible by the people who got suckered into voting for a President who deliberately seeks to utterly destroy America.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/russian-lawmaker-seeks-ban-dollar-predicts-2017-collapse/","Russian lawmaker seeks to ban US dollar, predicts 2017 collapse","RT.com

To protect Russians against the “collapsing US debt pyramid”, a Russian legislator has filed a draft bill to ban circulation of the currency in Russia.

Once a Moscow mayoral hopeful, Mikhail Degtyarev, 32, likens the US dollar to a worldwide ponzi scheme which he says is scheduled to end in 2017.

“If US national debt continues to grow at its current rate, the dollar system will collapse in 2017,” the submitted draft legislation says.

“In light of this, the fact that confidence in the US dollar is growing among Russian citizens is extremely dangerous,” Degtyarev wrote in his explanatory note attached to the bill.

The bill would impose a ban on dollars within a year of its passage, and any private citizen holding accounts in dollars would either need to spend the money or convert it to another currency. There is no proposed ban on the euro, British pound, yen, or yuan.

If one doesn’t exchange or transfer dollars within a year, the dollars will be seized by officials, and reimbursed in rubles within 30 calendar days.

Under the proposed legislation, Russians would still be able to use dollars abroad and have foreign bank accounts, as well as buy goods on the Internet in dollars.

The Russian government, Central Bank, Foreign Ministry, Federal Treasury, Federal Security Service, and other state branches would be exempt from the law.

To protect Russian nationals, Degtyarev proposes to end dollar transactions and deposits at Russian banks, which would give rise to the ruble, and end dependence on the world’s dominant currency.

Part of the bill aims to restore the prestige of the ruble, which has weakened as the Russian economy battles inflation and slow growth.

Raising the prestige of the ruble by nixing foreign currency isn’t a novel idea- it was practiced during the Soviet Union when holding foreign currencies was illegal. A similar ‘anti-dollar’ proposal was filed by Duma deputies in 2003, but completely flopped.

Moscow, a developing financial center, is home to several international corporations, and many companies pay their employees in dollars, or ruble salaries pegged to the dollar.

If the bill garners enough support, it will continue onto as many as three preliminary hearings before being passed into law.

Degtyarev has made a name for himself with his outlandish proposals- from giving women extra holidays during menstruation, to his declaration Russia would lead the fight in defeating the antichrist. He serves as the head of the science and technology committee in the lower house of the Duma.

The populist Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) is a political platform for Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is famous for political antics and outlandish bills.

On the same day, November 13, Belarus issued a statement denying rumors they were mulling a similar currency ban, after an opposition group reported a currency circulation ban that would get rid of dollars and euros in two months.

Citing Alexander Timoshenko, a representative of the Belarus’s National Bank, Interfax reported the rumors were “absolute nonsense” for a country with an open economy.

Dollars in demand

Public demand for foreign banknotes in Russia, especially dollars, has greatly increased as the ruble continues its slow devaluation.

The Russia’s Central Bank (CBR) said they believe the ruble has stabilized, but that hasn’t curbed investors, both private and public, to not put all their rubles in one basket.

The aggregate demand for foreign currency in September 2013 increased $9.1 billion, up 7 percent from August, according data from the the Bank’s September 2013 Review of State and Domestic Foreign Currency Market report, available on its website.

The Bank has allowed the ruble to flow more freely to accommodate foreign investment and financial markets, but this has created a tough inflation balancing act for the CBR.

Demand for dollars in September 2013 rose $5.9 billion, up 11 percent from August. Over the last year, aggregate demand for dollars has dropped 1 percent, but has jumped 12 percent by individuals’ purchase and conversion of greenbacks.

The ruble’s daily trade range is 32.45–39.45, which the regulator increased on Tuesday. The bank buys between $200 and $400 million in rubles per day to counter losses. At 20:15 Moscow time, the ruble was trading 32.7643 per one US dollar.

Consumer prices rose 6.3 percent from October, year-on-year, which is within the bank’s target inflation range of 5-6 percent. Inflation fears have prevented the bank from cutting the official interest rate for the last 14 month.

Over $13.3 billion in foreign currency flowed into (bought, acquired) authorized Russian banks in September, and nearly $13.1 billion flowed out.

In foreign currencies, total demand for the dollar in September was 65 percent, and 34 percent for euros.

RT.com

Two U.S. Border Patrol agents who forced four suspected drug traffickers to eat marijuana and run aimlessly into the Arizona desert have each been sentenced to two years in federal prison.

Back in April, both Dario Castillo, 25, and Ramon Zuniga, 31, were convicted for violating the civil rights of the four Mexican men, who had entered the United States illegally. U.S. District Judge Jennifer Zipps handed down the sentence, which includes three years of probation after release.

Border Patrol had previously fired both men, though they said they were stressed and fatigued at the time of the incident, which occurred at the end of their shift. Before their sentences were given, Zuniga and Castillo read short statements expressing remorse for their behavior.

“I allowed these individuals to get the best of me that night,” Zuniga said to the judge, according to Reuters. “I’ve regretted those actions every single day for the past five years.”

The incident began in 2008, when an agent on horse patrol found a group of 20 individuals sleeping in a dry stream in the Arizona desert, a popular route for drug smugglers and those bringing illegal immigrants into the United States. When the horse patrol called for assistance, Castillo and Zuniga arrived on the scene.

The group of men dispersed immediately, but the agents were able to round up four of them, all of which remain unidentified. Border Patrol also confiscated bundles of marijuana worth $600,000 at the scene.

After removing the men’s jackets and shoes – standard procedure for situations involving numerous suspects – Castillo lit a fire and began burning their clothing, according to the witness accounts heard in court. Zuniga then forced the men to eat marijuana while they were on their knees in handcuffs before casting them off into the desert night, when the temperature was at 50 F.

Castillo was convicted on four felony counts of violating civil rights, each of which holds a maximum of 10 years in prison. Zuniga faced up to one year in prison for each of his four misdemeanor counts.

According to Judge Zipps, however, both men were equally to blame in the situation and deserved the same sentence, even though they were convicted on different charges.

All of the suspected smugglers were deported after authorities declined to charge them with a crime.

Last Thursday the Senate Banking Committee held hearings on Janet Yellen’s nomination as Federal Reserve Board Chairman. As expected, Ms. Yellen indicated that she would continue the Fed’s “quantitative easing” (QE) polices, despite QE’s failure to improve the economy. Coincidentally, two days before the Yellen hearings, Andrew Huszar, an ex-Fed official, publicly apologized to the American people for his role in QE. Mr. Huszar called QE “the greatest backdoor Wall Street bailout of all time.”

As recently as five years ago, it would have been unheard of for a Wall Street insider and former Fed official to speak so bluntly about how the Fed acts as a reverse Robin Hood. But a quick glance at the latest unemployment numbers shows that QE is not benefiting the average American. It is increasingly obvious that the Fed’s post-2008 policies of bailouts, money printing, and bond buying benefited the big banks and the politically-connected investment firms. QE is such a blatant example of crony capitalism that it makes Solyndra look like a shining example of a pure free market!

It would be a mistake to think that QE is the first time the Fed’s policies have benefited the well-to-do at the expense of the average American. The Fed’s polices have always benefited crony capitalists and big spending politicians at the expense of the average American.

By manipulating the money supply and the interest rate, Federal Reserve polices create inflation and thereby erode the value of the currency. Since the Federal Reserve opened its doors one hundred years ago, the dollar has lost over 95 percent of its purchasing power —that’s right, today you need $23.70 to buy what one dollar bought in 1913!

As pointed out by the economists of the Austrian School, the creation of new money does not impact everyone equally. The well-connected benefit from inflation, as they receive the newly-created money first, before general price increases have spread through the economy. It is obvious, then, that middle- and working-class Americans are hardest hit by the rising level of prices.

Congress also benefits from the devaluation of the currency, as it allows them to increase welfare- and warfare-spending without directly taxing the people. Instead, the increase is only felt via the hidden “inflation tax.” I have often said that the inflation tax is one of the worst taxes because it is hidden and because it is regressive. Of course, there is a limit to how long the Fed can facilitate big government spending without causing an economic crisis.

Far from promoting a sound economy for all, the Federal Reserve is the main cause of the boom-and-bust economy, as well as the leading facilitator of big government and crony capitalism. Fortunately, in recent years more Americans have become aware of how the Fed is impacting their lives. These Americans have joined efforts to educate their fellow citizens on the dangers of the Federal Reserve and have joined efforts to bring transparency to the Federal Reserve by passing the Audit the Fed bill.

Auditing the Fed is an excellent first step toward restoring a monetary policy that works for the benefit of the American people, not the special interests. Another important step is to repeal legal tender laws that restrict the ability of the people to use the currency of their choice. This would allow Americans to protect themselves from the effects of the Fed’s polices. Auditing and ending the Fed, and allowing Americans to use the currency of their choice, must be a priority for anyone serious about restoring peace, prosperity, and liberty.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/shock-interview-welfare-recipient-i-sit-home-smoke-weed-gonna-paid/","Shock Interview: Welfare Recipient: “I Get to Sit Home, I Get to Smoke Weed, We Still Gonna Get Paid”","The welfare system in this country is in a horrible state of affairs. Rife with abuse and theft, it has declined into a perpetual trap of dependence and entitlement.

This caller sums up some of the major problems that the welfare system has to deal with. Quite eloquently, Lucy lays out the reality that is the dependency formed around the welfare state. Why would you work if you can get paid without working?

The Cato institute conducted a study, state by state of the monetary value of welfare benefits for a mother with two children. They found that in New York benefits would be around $38,000, the seventh highest in the nation.

The study explains the comparison of such an amount, “While that might not sound overly generous, remember that welfare benefits aren’t taxed, while wages are. So someone in New York would have to earn more than $21 per hour to be better off than they would be on welfare. That’s more than the average statewide entry-level salary for a teacher.

Plus, going to work means added costs such as paying for child care, transportation and clothing. Not to mention that, even if it’s not a money-loser, a person moving from welfare to work will see some form of loss — namely, less time for leisure as opposed to work.”

Obviously people apply for welfare benefits because they have come across hard times. However the incentive created by this particular program has some daunting implications. It seems that this once generous program started in the 30’s has turned into an unsustainable model of redistribution. What is to happen when the state can no longer afford to pay out these benefits? What will the tens of millions of welfare recipients do when this unsustainable model reaches its precipice of total collapse, which happens to be a mathematical certainty?

It is evident that the current system is broken and rife with negative incentive. So what is the answer? Should we try to petition the government for welfare reform? Good luck with that! Taking a proactive approach in your community is far more effective than petitioning bureaucrats with the sole intention of re-election.

This proactive approach is starting to pop-up around the country. Once we look at what people actually need to survive the choice on how to help them is quite evident. People need two basic things and they are food and shelter. Community gardens are a particularly effective method of providing the former.

Urban gardening is spreading and with good reason. Not only are food deserts a large problem in urban areas, but there happen to be large areas of wasted land. A recent article in the Smithsonian highlighted the ‘Guerrilla Gardening’ efforts of a man named Ron Finley. About three years ago, South Los Angeles resident Finley got fed up with having to drive more than half an hour to find a ripe, pesticide-free tomato. So he decided to plant a vegetable garden in the space between the sidewalk and street outside of his home, located in the working-class neighborhood where he grew up, surrounded by fast food restaurants, liquor stores and other not-so-healthy options. This tactic is spreading, and fast.

A community effort to produce food is the first major step to reducing state dependency. A community coming together to grow their own food generates the opposite incentive that the current welfare system creates. Instead of stoking dependency, people are empowered. Tending to a productive garden has been shown to increase the sense of wellbeing, confidence, and overall health; not to mention that it feeds you too!

So, next time you hear people talking about how the Democrats want this or the Republicans want this, offer a real solution. Grow your own sustenance, and truly give the power back to the people!","2013-11-21 15:33:03","1","19.0","30.0","5.0","1.0","5.0","0.0","54.0","20.0","0.0","169.0","10.0","13.0","15","643","91.36","64.56","24.98","74.93","16.92","23.48","84.76","47.74","8.24","2.64","0.00","0.31","0.93","0.47","0.93","5.60","9.18","15.71","7.00","4.51","4.98","1.56","13.22","5.29","2.95","1.71","2.02","1.87","4.82","3.73","1.09","0.16","0.31","0.31","7.47","0.16","0.16","0.16","0.62","12.13","2.18","2.33","2.02","2.33","1.40","3.42","0.93","0.31","0.31","0.16","1.87","0.00","0.31","0.00","1.56","9.49","1.40","3.42","2.49","2.80","0.47","2.49","9.80","0.78","13.84","2.49","7.62","4.20","6.53","1.09","1.24","1.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.06","4.67","4.20","0.00","0.16","0.78","0.47","1.24","0.47","0.78","0.00","0.31","3033","8.0","17.45945945945946","947","634","38","62.98","11.6","8.6","11.13","10.2","142","6.285714285714286","17.6389905362776","358","16.24","3","0.46","0","15","7","71","0","84","53","5","1","10","119","26","2","34","2","0","18","5","30","1","0","7","25","0","33","7","17","18","14","28","3","4","0","6"
"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/secret-trade-deal-to-kill-internet-freedom-and-place-a-worldwide-ban-on-labeling-gmos/","Secret Trade Deal to Kill Internet Freedom and Place a Worldwide Ban on Labeling GMOs","Have you heard of the secret Trade Deal that is looming in the shadows? A new plan is in the works by the global elite that is being touted as another revolutionary “free trade” agreement. But we can all see that the free trade agreements of the past such as NAFTA and GATT have only served to benefit the global elite, and done everything to stifle actual free trade.

The ‘agreement,’ of which none of us will be given the opportunity to actually agree, is called The Trans Pacific Partnership. The world stands to lose a great deal from this ‘agreement.’ According to Nation of Change, the labeling of foods containing GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) will not be allowed. Japan currently has labeling laws for GMOs in food. Under the TPP Japan would no longer be able to label GMOs. This situation is the same for New Zealand and Australia. In the US we are just beginning to see some progress towards labeling GMOs. Under the TPP GMO labels for US food would not be allowed.



In April 2013, Peru placed a 10-year moratorium on GMO foods and plants. This prohibits the import, production and use of GMOs in foods and GMO plants and is aimed at safeguarding Peru’s agricultural diversity. The hope is to prevent cross-pollination with non-GMO crops and to ban GMO crops like Bt corn. What will become of Peru’s moratorium if the TPP is passed?

The TPP will also implement new levels of internet tyranny, outlawing the “Fair Use” of material and turn your ISP into a government enforcement arm as they will face heavy fines for allowing anything that violates the TPP.

According to NaturalNews.com details of the TPP are so secret that even members of Congress are not allowed to review them or disclose them. What we know about the TPP has only come from leaks, as the full text of the entire agreement is being kept not only from Congress but also the American people. Yet over 600 corporate CEOs — including CEOs of companies that have been repeatedly found guilty of felony crimes in America — have been allowed to influence the details of the TPP agreements. Monsanto, Wal-Mart and Big Pharma corporations are reportedly given top influence positions in this super-secret Obama organization that hands the future of the world over to the most evil corporations of all time.

By Mike Adams

“If You Are Going to Get High, You Better Not Drive,” or some other public service slogan will surely be plastered on billboards all across America as soon as science figures out a way to stick it to the average citizen with the marijuana breathalyzer.

Ever since legalized recreational marijuana was made a reality last year by voters in Colorado and Washington, the powers that be have been brainstorming new ways in which to prosecute the legal marijuana user. Obviously, driving stoned is high on the list of no-nos.

In fact, a team of researchers recently published a document in the medical journal Clinical Chemistry that suggests a breath test — similar to the testing procedures for alcohol intoxication — may be the best way for law enforcement to analyze a motorist’s THC level. Researchers believe that the breath method of testing could eventually phase out the controversial THC-blood test currently being used to prosecute people in courtrooms all over the country.

Researchers say that in a study group consisting of everyday stoners and weekend warrior-style occasional smokers, they were able to detect levels of THC, the principle psychoactive cannabinoid in marijuana that would be most likely to affect the way a person drives, by collecting breath samples.

What they found was that while every breath sample collected tested positive for THC almost immediately following the participant getting high, the only group to maintain a positive test after four hours were the everyday stoners. Interestingly, while 90% of the part-time smokers tested positive for THC within an hour of smoking, none of them tested positive after about 90 minutes.

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/whiskey-tango-foxtrot-fbi-wont-interview-benghazi-suspects/","WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT: FBI Won’t Interview Benghazi Suspects","Just two days after being confirmed, the new leader of the FBI is facing pressure from Congress to get to the bottom of the Benghazi terror attacks.

Eight Republican lawmakers, voicing frustration about the seemingly slow pace of the investigation 10 months after the Sept. 11 attacks, are preparing a letter to James Comey demanding he make the Benghazi probe a priority, Fox News confirms. Comey was confirmed on Monday to replace Robert Mueller at the helm of the FBI.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who started the letter along with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News that the FBI is failing to interview key people connected with the militant group Ansar al-Sharia.

“Our FBI has never talked to these people, and that’s just wholly unacceptable,” Chaffetz said.

“This is a pathetic effort to bring people to justice,” Graham said, in a separate interview with Fox News.

Obama administration officials have tried to assuage lawmakers’ lingering concerns and questions about the Benghazi attack, including over allegations that the administration misled the public about the nature of the assault last September. But lawmakers have also grown increasingly frustrated over the fact that nobody has been brought to justice since four Americans were killed in the attack on two U.S. posts in the eastern Libya city that was a home base for the anti-Qaddafi rebellion.

Clash Daily Contributor

As a life-long Redskins fan I, along with every other member of Redskins nation, was thrilled to see our franchise quarterback, Robert Griffin III, tweet: “Doctors cleared me to practice.” Looking ahead to the new football season will be a lot less stressful knowing we have RGIII back at full strength. Watching my Redskins play is nerve-racking enough even when our best players are healthy.

When I watch a Redskins game I’m on the edge of my seat. I live and die by every play. Even when the Skins are leading I can’t let my guard down because I’ve seen us blow too many leads over the years. Watching our favorite teams play can be an exhausting experience for die hard fans. Things are totally different, however, when we already know the outcome of the game.

I have to work during most games on Sundays so I record them. Sometimes I’m able to make it home without finding out who won but sometimes I’m not. If I found out the Skins lost, I usually skip the game. Why frustrate myself even further? I watch the game when I found out they won, though. It’s a whole different experience when I watch the game knowing my beloved Redskins have already won. When I know the Skins have won, I sit back and enjoy the show. It’s a celebration. I soak in all the big runs, sacks, and touchdowns. I just enjoy it.

Not only do I savor the positive moments when I already know the outcome of the game but I also don’t let the bad stretches bother me at all. When it’s 3rd and goal, we fumble the snap, and the other team recovers the ball, I’m disappointed we couldn’t capitalize on a great opportunity but it’s not that big of a deal because I know we make up for it later.

Now if that happens when I’m watching the game live, I’m freaking out! It’s a big deal and now I’m worried we might have blown the game. My entire experience of watching the game is totally altered when I know the outcome ahead of time.

Life is a lot like that.

We worry about how things are going to turn out. Are we going to have enough money for school clothes and supplies? Can we afford a family vacation this year? Can we even continue to afford this mortgage? What news will the doctor give me at our next appointment? What will our healthcare look like next year? Jesus was right when he said, “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble” (Matthew 6:34 ESV).","2013-07-27 11:23:39","0","32.0","19.0","8.0","0.0","18.0","0.0","80.0","52.0","0.0","131.0","0.0","20.0","10","461","35.78","43.10","90.45","45.70","14.41","18.00","89.15","55.10","16.92","12.15","8.03","3.47","0.00","0.22","0.43","4.77","8.03","10.63","10.41","8.24","6.94","1.74","17.79","5.21","2.17","3.69","0.65","2.39","6.72","3.90","2.82","1.08","0.43","0.43","8.46","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.22","11.93","2.17","2.60","0.65","1.95","1.74","3.69","4.34","2.60","0.22","0.43","1.95","0.43","1.52","0.00","0.00","13.45","6.94","4.12","2.60","1.95","0.65","3.04","14.32","2.39","15.84","1.30","6.07","8.89","2.39","4.34","0.65","0.65","0.22","0.43","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.49","5.42","3.90","0.43","0.00","1.30","0.22","0.43","0.87","3.47","0.43","0.00","1928","6.52","15.387096774193548","593","458","32","82.34","8.3","5.3","7.71","6.5","63","7.5","13.222183406113539","246","14.13","31","0.53","0","10","3","45","0","41","38","1","2","10","61","22","1","20","1","0","55","10","30","1","0","5","8","0","21","10","10","6","40","9","0","3","0","14"
"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/weiner-abedin-and-the-clintons-forget-nyc-the-joke-is-on-all-of-us/","Weiner, Abedin and the Clintons: Forget NYC … the Joke is on All of Us","Anthony Weiner (aka “Carlos Danger”), disgraced Congressman and NYC Democrat mayoral hopeful, refuses to … um … pull out of the race after admissions of additional, gross misconduct. Despite wilting poll numbers due to Danger’s “electile dysfunction,” he’s going to stay in. After all, his success or failure rests with New York City’s residents. If New Yorkers trust the judgment of a guy who would broadcast photos of his nether regions and set up an apartment for a girl, without ever having met her first, who are we to get in the way? But his wife, Huma Abedin, is another matter entirely.

On Thursday, Huma Abedin had been flogged across the airwaves by the MSM as being “intelligent”, “delicate”, “brave” and was lauded for “standing by her man.” The degenerate Weiner had “made a mistake.” Several, actually. Why the deafening cacophony of praise? Because Abedin and the State Department are under Senate investigation. The MSM is trying to deflect damaging public scrutiny of Abedin/Hillary/State Department wrongdoing. If the investigation sinks Abedin, it might also derail a potential presidential run by Hillary Clinton in 2016. Abedin and Hillary are indiscreet in more ways than one.

According to FOX News “Abedin is facing her own troubles — less salacious than her husband’s, but potentially more severe.” Abedin was Hillary Clinton’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department. The title changed, according to Politico, when Abedin took maternity leave during the summer of 2012. Clinton awarded her bosom buddy of 15 years the title of “special government employee.” Abedin’s part-time labors on behalf of the State Department netted her an annual salary of $135,000; $155,000 with benefits. The status change was kept secret. It was unearthed by The Politico in May, 2013.

Being a “special government employee” gave Abedin plenty of time with her new family but it also permitted Abedin to pursue other, more lucrative jobs while on the government payroll. For example, as a consultant for Teneo. Teneo trades stocks and bonds. Abedin’s security clearance and access to insider trading information is at issue here, among other possible infractions. Such as keeping her nose in the government feeding trough at taxpayer expense while rooting for truffles in greener pastures. Abedin’s part-time consulting gig with Teneo harvested an additional $355,000 annually. Bill Clinton is a board member of Teneo. According to a witness, Abedin was also employed, during that time, privately by no less than four entities: Hillary, the State Department, Teneo and the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation. Heckuva gig for a stay-at-home mom.

The Senate investigation, headed by Senator Charles Grassley (R., IA), has, thus far, not received a single document requested from either the State Department or Abedin. Grassley wrote to Abedin: “I am concerned that the ‘special government employee’ designation blurs the line between public and private sector employees, especially when employees receive full-time salaries for what appears to be part-time work …” Abedin responded with a letter denying any wrongdoing. Well, there it is; she says so, so it must be true …right?","2013-07-28 15:09:07","0","29.0","18.0","8.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","82.0","52.0","0.0","132.0","0.0","19.0","9","513","94.69","67.30","7.32","43.53","16.03","28.46","73.29","40.74","5.46","2.92","0.19","0.19","0.00","2.53","0.00","2.53","7.60","15.01","5.65","3.12","5.65","0.58","9.36","6.04","2.73","1.17","2.73","3.12","5.07","2.92","1.95","0.00","0.00","0.19","8.38","0.97","0.39","2.53","1.56","8.77","0.39","1.56","1.17","2.73","1.17","3.31","0.97","0.39","0.39","0.00","0.78","0.19","0.39","0.00","0.19","10.14","1.36","1.75","5.46","1.17","1.17","2.92","4.48","1.17","12.09","2.14","5.46","5.26","8.38","0.39","0.78","2.14","0.00","0.00","0.58","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.39","0.00","24.37","6.63","7.21","0.39","0.39","0.58","0.00","1.17","4.48","1.75","0.78","0.97","2556","8.95","18.607142857142858","816","506","33","55.95","12.1","9.3","12.98","11.3","146","8.5","19.661501976284587","305","17.54","7","0.4","0","15","12","44","0","72","34","3","0","3","92","82","1","22","0","0","9","11","16","2","0","1","12","0","15","18","18","11","8","13","0","3","0","3"
"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/warning-social-justice-leads-to-societal-decline/","Warning! ‘Social Justice’ Leads to Societal Decline","“Social justice cannot be attained by violence. Violence kills what it intends to create.” — Pope John Paul I

What is “social justice,” and what does it mean to demand it?

Wrapped up in the idea of social justice is the notion of “fairness.” Van Jones says social justice means the state creates total equality in all things: income, housing, dress, mobility, i.e., all manner of life outcomes. By this definition, justice is only achieved when everybody is precisely the same.

Aside from the reality it is impossible to achieve social justice, the attempt to achieve it requires conformity on a massive scale. If the state is creating a totality, that can only spell dictatorship, the death of liberty. Therefore, demanding this kind of social justice requires the state demand compliance.

When the state demands compliance, going so far as to confiscate property from one citizen to give to another, the state has assumed total control. That outcome is neither social nor just. Sensing this truth, and resistant to government intrusion, Americans correctly oppose tyrants who seek to impose their will using the power of the state. After all, that spirit of resistance is what inspired the colonists to fight a revolution to throw off the tyranny of King George.

Of course, if a definition of “fairness” undergirds the promotion of social justice, someone will have to define “fairness”, and that someone must be the state insofar as the state is the chief advocate of social justice. Consequently, the definition of fairness will always be controlled by those who fight for power. Only the powerful wind up defining fairness and carrying through the “justice” agenda, which always means the powerless get trampled.

Hence, what Pope John Paul II said is entirely true. We might even take it a step further, asserting that any promotion of a social justice agenda predicated upon human definitions of fairness will always require violence, simply because huge groups of people will object to the prevailing definition of fairness. Those people must be subjugated or eliminated.

Despite these truths, these realities, the Left continues pushing the notion of “social justice”, whenever convenient, doing so with violence in various forms. There is always an aggrieved minority claiming unfair treatment, demanding justice, which usually results in more destruction than any supposed remedy might deliver.","2013-07-13 13:18:33","0","32.0","20.0","8.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","82.0","52.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","20.0","10","384","88.56","68.03","7.84","18.12","18.29","31.25","83.07","45.57","9.11","0.78","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","8.33","8.59","13.54","7.81","3.91","4.17","0.78","12.50","4.17","2.60","3.12","0.26","3.39","4.69","2.08","2.60","0.00","1.04","0.00","7.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","16.93","3.39","4.17","1.30","3.39","4.69","2.08","0.78","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","17.19","3.39","2.86","10.68","1.82","0.26","0.78","7.81","2.08","8.07","1.82","3.65","2.60","2.86","0.00","0.26","0.26","0.78","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.71","5.73","7.81","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","3.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","1950","9.05","20.31578947368421","617","386","22","53.71","12.6","10.1","12.99","12.2","111","5.5","20.50259067357513","219","17.84","2","0.43","0","6","1","49","0","43","26","1","0","10","89","17","1","13","0","0","8","1","18","1","0","4","13","0","21","4","13","7","4","22","3","7","0","3"

He also said that “ever since the end of the Cold War, forces have been unleashed that were tamped down for centuries by dictators.”

“I’m a student of history, and I love to go back and read a particularly great book like [Henry] Kissinger’s book about diplomacy where you think about the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the balance of power and how difficult it was for countries to advance their interests and years and years of wars,” Kerry said to a gathering of State Department employees and their families.

“And we sometimes say to ourselves, boy, aren’t we lucky,” Kerry continued.

“Well, folks,” he said, “ever since the end of the Cold War, forces have been unleashed that were tamped down for centuries by dictators, and that was complicated further by this little thing called the internet and the ability of people everywhere to communicate instantaneously and to have more information coming at them in one day than most people can process in months or a year.

ANSWER: There are no statutes or administrative code that governs neighborhood watch. The only Florida statutes that mention neighborhood watch specifically are:

1. §843.16(2)(b) [ http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/ statutes/2012/0843.16 ] which governs radio equipment use.

2. §30.06 [ http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/ statutes/2012/30.06 ] which provides authorization for the County Sheriff to form neighborhood watch programs within their jurisdiction.

3. §166.0485 [ http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/ statutes/2012/166.0485 ] which provides authorization for municipalities to form neighborhood watch programs within their jurisdiction.

4. §843.20 [ http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/ statutes/2012/843.20 ] which provides for relief if members of a neighborhood watch program are victims of harassment or other criminal acts against them for performing their duties.

Nowhere in the above statutes listed in 1-4 does it mention anything about weapons or firearms and the prohibition of carrying for the purpose of lawful self-defense.

5. §790.06(15) [ http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/ statutes/2012/790.06 ] which governs the statewide preemption of the regulation of concealed weapons and firearms. This is called the class W license or more commonly referred to as the concealed carry license.

6. §790.33 [ http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/ statutes/2012/790.33 ] which governs the statewide preemption on the regulation of firearms and ammunition.

7. §790.06(12)(a) [ http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/ statutes/2012/790.06 ] which governs the EXCLUSIONS to concealed carry.

8. §790.25 [ http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/ statutes/2012/790.25] which governs the EXCEPTIONS to the open carry and conceal carry ban (except concealment on or about your person without a class W license).

Again, nowhere in these statutes that I’ve listed in 5-8 mentions that concealed carry during the duty of a neighborhood crime watch volunteer is prohibited. Furthermore, these statutes specifically state that a neither the county, municipality nor any political subdivision of the state OTHER THAN the state legislature can FURTHER regulate concealed carry, possession and use of firearms! Therefore, as the state’s witness for the Sanford PD (SPD) volunteer coordinator stated on the stand, and I paraphrase, “…When that topic [armed] comes up, which it does a lot, we do not even answer that question because it is not within our area of jurisdiction. We do preach not to confront the subjects or enter a suspicious scene. They [neighborhood watch volunteers] are our eyes and ears. … .”

MYTH #2 – When a non-emergency call taker, 911 operator or dispatch gives an instruction over the phone, you MUST follow that order. ***FALSE***

ANSWER: Having been a 911 Operator for a sheriff’s office here in Florida, this statement is completely false! The state’s witness 911 Operator even said on the stand, and I paraphrase, “…We always say that. … .” There is absolutely no statute or administrative code that stipulates that if an operator says something to you on the phone, you don’t follow it exactly or at all, then you will face criminal proceedings for not carrying out the order or instructions. The only time you have a potential criminal liability is if you do not follow and order or instruction if IN THE PRESENCE OF a law enforcement officer (LEO) directs you to assist him or comply with an order and you countermand said directive. Also, if you are following someone while on the phone with the police, you violate traffic laws and you are witnessed by the police in doing so, you will most likely get a ticket or worse depending upon the severity of the traffic infraction. These are just two examples as there are many more possibly scenarios. The distinction needs to be made that the criminal liability would occur when IN THE PRESENCE of a LEO and not based upon any instructions a police operator would give over the phone.

Now the exact phrase in question was:

Operator: “Are you following him?”

Zimmerman: “Yes.”

Operator: “OK, we don’t need you to do that.”

Zimmerman: “OK.”

And immediately following that exchange, Zimmerman actually had already lost sight of Treyvon Martin and was starting the exchange of information with the operator about where to meet the responding LEO’s. At this time, Zimmerman was behind the two rows of townhomes at the now infamous ‘T’. This is substantiated by both Zimmerman’s interview by SPD and his video reenactment; both of which were proffered by the state.","2013-07-09 09:11:34","0","43.0","27.0","8.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","89.0","52.0","0.0","131.0","0.0","20.0","10","749","82.88","66.07","19.72","10.57","18.73","26.44","73.56","45.93","9.75","4.27","0.40","0.80","2.00","0.40","0.67","5.47","8.68","11.75","5.74","4.01","6.14","2.00","10.15","1.47","1.34","1.87","6.14","1.34","2.00","0.40","1.60","0.13","0.67","0.13","8.68","0.00","1.07","0.00","0.40","10.95","1.20","1.20","1.60","4.14","1.60","4.94","2.80","1.47","1.34","0.00","1.47","0.40","1.07","0.00","0.00","9.08","2.27","0.40","5.74","0.13","0.53","1.60","8.81","0.53","11.35","2.14","6.41","2.27","7.74","0.40","1.07","0.27","0.13","0.00","1.74","0.00","1.20","0.53","0.00","0.00","27.90","7.88","2.94","1.07","0.13","0.13","0.27","0.53","1.74","1.20","2.14","9.88","3449","7.65","20.13888888888889","1061","682","33","50.46","13.2","11.4","14.04","14.3","129","6.857142857142857","17.84598240469208","324","17.72","33","0.46","8","30","62","81","0","86","27","3","0","5","134","47","0","36","0","0","30","7","31","0","0","2","12","0","24","13","10","15","24","26","12","0","0","4"
"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/zimmerman-speech-obama-should-have-given/","Zimmerman Speech Obama Should Have Given","My fellow Americans:

I am your humble servant. You have entrusted me with the tremendous honor and responsibility to serve you as president. I am not president of black America, Hispanic America or white America. I am not president of liberal America or conservative America. I am president of the United States of America.

Regrettably, as a nation, we have become divided. I confess that I have contributed to this division. For this failure in leadership, I ask your forgiveness.

We were each created equal by a God of forgiveness. It is now time that we do as He commands; that we forgive one another as we are forgiven and that we come together, once and for all, as one America.

With this goal in mind, I ask that every American join me in praying for the family of Trayvon Martin. No parent should have to bury a child. I also ask that you join me in prayer for George Zimmerman and his family. This tragedy has taken an unimaginable toll on both families. Finally, I ask that you join me in praying for national calm and racial reconciliation.

Today I will share with you certain truths that may be difficult for some to hear. But truths they remain.

First among these truths: The death of Trayvon Martin was a horrible tragedy.

But not all tragedies are crimes.

This case should never have gone to trial. Probable cause for charges of second-degree murder did not exist. Unfortunately, it has become evident that charges were filed based upon a purely political calculus, rather than upon the legal merits of the case. This is legal malpractice, and those responsible should be held accountable.

Before charges were even filed I publicly and inappropriately said: “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon.”

This was irresponsible of me. It was a politically motivated abuse of the presidential bully pulpit. It presumed Mr. Zimmerman guilty until proven innocent. The implication was racially charged and cynical.

To the extent that I may have contributed to the spurious filing of charges, I apologize to Florida. I also apologize to George Zimmerman, his family and the American people.

Nevertheless, the trial did go forward and, after 20 days in court and 16 hours of thoughtful deliberation, a jury of George Zimmerman’s peers ultimately found him not guilty. Whether or not we agree, this is our criminal justice system and the system worked as designed.

Justice was served.

Although none of us were there – and few can know for sure – the not guilty verdict indicates that the jury found, based upon the weight of the evidence, that this tragic shooting was, in fact, legally justified on self-defense grounds. This is true whether or not George overreacted by following Trayvon in the first place. Florida’s “stand-your-ground” law was never even triggered.

The jury further found, by all accounts, that at some point during their interaction, Mr. Martin turned, pursued and attacked Mr. Zimmerman without legal provocation. This decision ultimately cost him his life.

How does this make sense? How could this have justified the shooting? Although initially unarmed, witness accounts and forensic evidence suggest that Trayvon punched Mr. Zimmerman, jumped on him and began slamming the back of his head into the concrete sidewalk while allegedly proclaiming, “You gonna die tonight, [expletive].” At this point the sidewalk became a deadly weapon. From this, any reasonable person could conclude that George Zimmerman feared for his life and, therefore, took defensive action.","2013-07-23 14:04:52","0","41.0","18.0","8.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","82.0","52.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","20.0","10","585","57.71","62.73","33.60","20.58","13.60","24.96","81.71","51.28","15.21","8.89","3.76","1.54","1.54","1.71","0.34","6.32","5.64","12.48","8.38","3.08","7.01","2.22","14.02","4.27","2.05","0.68","1.37","2.22","6.50","3.08","3.42","0.85","0.85","1.03","10.09","1.03","0.17","0.00","2.05","14.36","4.10","2.39","1.37","1.88","2.74","3.93","1.20","0.51","0.34","0.17","0.68","0.17","0.34","0.00","0.17","9.40","3.59","1.71","3.93","0.51","0.51","4.79","7.35","1.37","9.74","1.54","5.13","3.59","3.42","0.68","0.68","0.68","0.85","0.68","0.34","0.00","0.17","0.17","0.00","0.00","16.92","7.69","5.64","0.51","0.17","0.34","0.00","0.68","1.03","0.51","0.00","0.34","2809","7.64","14.341463414634147","879","583","47","67.35","11.1","6.9","11.12","8.6","125","3.2","15.536329331046312","310","13.51","16","0.48","0","23","4","61","0","81","52","0","0","9","83","41","2","18","0","0","45","11","35","0","0","0","9","0","15","28","6","23","27","11","2","0","0","2"
"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/zimmerman-case-used-by-obama-as-a-reason-for-more-gun-control/","Zimmerman Case Used by Obama As a Reason for More Gun Control","President Barack Obama issued a statement Sunday saying that the Trayvon Martin case should spur action on community “compassion” and “gun violence,” but made no mention of George Zimmerman, who is facing widespread anger and threats following his acquittal by a jury, and offered no reassurances of his safety.

“I know this case has elicited strong passions,” said the president, who stirred those passions last March with an emotional claim in the White House’s Rose Garden that “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon.”

“I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son,” said Obama, who swore to uphold the nation’s laws during his 2009 and 2013 inaugurations.

His short statement began by declaring that “the death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America.”

But he quickly harnessed the controversy to his ongoing effort to curb citizens’ ownership of guns.

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/why-is-george-zimmerman-being-prosecuted-by-race-baiters/","Why Is George Zimmerman Being Prosecuted By Race Baiters?","There is a class of colored people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs-partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.

— (1911) – Booker T. Washington

There is a class of people in this nation that are the problem-profiteering pimps of race baiting who gain nothing from eliminating the source of barriers that block progress for black people. That is why they have nurtured the frenzy of hate against George Zimmerman.

They worked for well over a century, even before 1911, to manufacture a hysteria that could bolster their own economic standing in terms of their bank account, with no account for validity, accuracy or the truth. Their practices have been hewn from the tree of hate, because it is in hate that they rise and it is in falseness that they thrive. Black progress is their adversary and nemesis.

Zimmerman’s innocence is of no matter to race baiters because it is easier to manufacture a lie which they can easily push than a truth which forces the black public to look inside and ask questions about their own true issues. So deflection, cries of denunciation and of racial injustice against Trayvon Martin was the banner they designed and carried against George Zimmerman last year. Even though the prosecutors found no proof and the FBI investigation found no proof indicating profiling … race baiters like Al Sharpton insisted George Zimmerman was guilty and sold this narrative to the public.

Yet there was a truth which was not shared. Yet it is as punishing as it is illuminating. Out of the mouth of the only true witness to the words and the deeds of Trayvon Martin’s last minutes alive, came an alarming insight. Rachel Jeantel seemed to imply on CNN’s Piers Morgan Live. Show early this week, that it was Trayvon Martin who approached the car of George Zimmerman.

According to her, it was Trayvon Martin who profiled George Zimmerman and caused a dangerous down spiraling to ensue because she suggested to Martin that Zimmerman might be a gay man who could be a rapist.

So if the words of the only person who actually was talking to Trayvon Martin are suggesting that Martin did not run away when he could have, but instead approached the car of Zimmerman, where was the “hunting down” of Martin?

When it comes to civil rights, whose civil rights were being violated? This is a question that legitimate fact- finding can arrive at a conclusion on. Consider that the FBI had already done an intensive investigation to determine if Zimmerman’s past conduct demonstrated he had a propensity to racially profile blacks or that he was a rabid racist.

The FBI investigators arrived at the conclusion that there was no evidence as in nada, that Zimmerman was a proven racist who would or could lie in wait for the opportunity to racially profile and murder a black youth for no reason.","2013-07-18 10:51:58","1","35.0","20.0","8.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","82.0","52.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","20.0","10","547","78.77","64.28","6.45","9.87","23.78","21.57","79.52","54.11","11.70","4.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.10","3.29","7.31","9.14","14.08","8.96","4.02","5.85","2.01","14.81","2.56","1.46","2.74","0.37","0.73","6.03","2.38","3.66","0.37","1.28","0.73","8.78","0.00","0.18","0.37","0.91","12.43","2.74","2.56","2.01","2.19","2.01","3.11","1.46","1.28","0.00","0.18","1.10","0.18","0.55","0.37","0.00","4.39","0.37","1.65","0.91","0.91","1.28","5.85","8.04","0.18","9.14","2.38","3.84","3.11","3.29","0.37","0.00","2.01","0.00","0.55","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","9.51","4.02","3.11","0.00","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.55","0.37","0.73","0.37","0.00","2547","7.61","25.045454545454547","779","548","23","64.24","12.2","10.2","10.74","13.0","97","10.4","18.60029197080292","265","21.09","5","0.51","0","17","2","62","0","74","35","1","0","8","69","51","0","29","0","0","23","9","20","0","0","1","18","0","23","34","16","7","14","14","8","7","1","4"

ACORN, which officially folded in 2009 after a string of scandals, rebranded into more than 100 spinoff groups, including Affordable Housing Centers of America — also now defunct — and Mission of Peace, an affordable housing nonprofit.

In February, the Department of Housing and Urban Development transferred $201,222.07 from AHCOA to Mission of Peace “specifically to pay for the activities of former AHCOA affiliates,” according to a memo obtained by Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Posts in Abu Dhabi, Amman, Cairo, Riyadh, Dhahran, Jeddah, Doha, Dubai, Kuwait, Manama, Muscat, Sanaa, Tripoli, Antanarivo, Bujumbura, Djibouti, Khartoum, Kigali and Port Louis have been instructed to close for normal operations from Monday through Saturday, department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

The State Department also said some of those embassies were already going to be closed in accordance with local customs marking the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.

Those authorized to reopen Monday are in Dhaka, Algiers, Nouakchott, Kabul, Herat, Mazar el Sharif, Baghdad, Basrah and Erbil.

Capitol Hill lawmakers, including top-ranking members of intelligence committees, on Sunday described the terror threat that closed 22 U.S. embassies and consulates across the Muslim region as the most serious one since before the 9/11 attacks and related to specific act or plot.

Florida Republican Rep. Tom Rooney, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News that U.S. intelligence agents detected a “very specific” threat and suggested they have known about it for at least several weeks.

He was among several congressional lawmakers Sunday who said the threat was gleaned from so-called “chatter” from phone lines, computer outlets, websites and other communication outlets.

Rooney also said the information is not what intelligence committee members “see on our regular briefings.”

The Obama administration’s decision Friday to close the U.S. outposts Sunday came the same day as the State Department issued a worldwide travel alert.

Rooney suggested Sunday the travel warning will not be lifted soon.

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/08/duh-harvard-study-correlation-gun-control-less-violent-crime/","DUH: Harvard Study, ‘No Correlation Between Gun Control and Less Violent Crime’","A Harvard Study titled “Would Banning Firearms Reduce Murder and Suicide?” looks at figures for “intentional deaths” throughout continental Europe and juxtaposes them with the U.S. to show that more gun control does not necessarily lead to lower death rates or violent crime.

Because the findings so clearly demonstrate that more gun laws may in fact increase death rates, the study says that “the mantra that more guns mean more deaths and that fewer guns, therefore, mean fewer deaths” is wrong.

For example, when the study shows numbers for Eastern European gun ownership and corresponding murder rates, it is readily apparent that less guns to do not mean less death. In Russia, where the rate of gun ownership is 4,000 per 100,000 inhabitants, the murder rate was 20.52 per 100,000 in 2002. That same year in Finland, where the rater of gun ownership is exceedingly higher–39,000 per 100,000–the murder rate was almost nill, at 1.98 per 100,000.

Looking at Western Europe, the study shows that Norway “has far and away Western Europe’s highest household gun ownership rate (32%), but also its lowest murder rate.”

And when the study focuses on intentional deaths by looking at the U.S. vs Continental Europe, the findings are no less revealing. The U.S., which is so often labeled as the most violent nation in the world by gun control proponents, comes in 7th–behind Russia, Estonia, Lativa, Lithuania, Belarus, and the Ukraine–in murders. America also only ranks 22nd in suicides.

The murder rate in Russia, where handguns are banned, is 30.6; the rate in the U.S. is 7.8.

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/well-whaddyaknow-congress-votes-to-continue-surveillance-state/","Well, Whaddyaknow! Congress Votes to Continue Surveillance State","This week, to the dismay of those who still believe that a Republican controlled House of Representatives means that we have divided government, the alliance of RINOs and Democrats in Congress allowed the statist agenda of Obama to continue unabated. The big government forces defeated an amendment to defund Obama’s SS/KGB/ NSA by a vote of 217 to 205. While the media circus kept us all focused on Trayvon, freedom suffered a defeat.

The amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act was sponsored by Rep. Justin Amash (R, MI) and would have defunded the NSA’s bulk collection of phone records of all Americans and limited the collection to the records of people under investigation for international terrorism or foreign intelligence. The majority voted to continue spying on us without specific individual warrants. Big brother is keeping a record of every single call you make or receive and not just calls from or to overseas locations.

Supporting the amendment to stop it, were some of my favorites: Trey Gowdy (R, SC), Louie Gohmert (R, TX), Jim Bridenstine (R, OK), and Jim Sensenbrenner (R, TX). Even my congressman Dave Loebsack (D, IA) voted for the amendment. I think it may be the first time that he has ever voted against Obama and Pelosi. Maybe he’s not a clone or perhaps he had an epiphany.

Voting to continue the SS/KGB surveillance state were the usual RINOs and liberals: John Boehner (R, OH), Eric Cantor (R, VA), Paul Ryan (R, WI), Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Sheila Jackson Lee (D, TX) and Jan Schakowsky (D, IL). A little hint to our RINO “friends”: When you are voting to agree with Obama, Pelosi, Schakowsky and Jackson Lee, you really ought to check yourself as they are all communists.

What is surprising and disappointing is that some “conservatives” even voted against the amendment: Steve King (R, IA), Michelle Bachmann (R, MN) and Pete Sessions (R, TX) voted no. It’s enough to make a conservative political junky like me scratch my head in disbelief. I wonder what happens to these people when they get to D.C. Perhaps some of that NSA spying is paying off for the regime. Maybe they have the “goods” on some of these folks. After all, corruption seems to be a way of life in Washington.

The next day it was reported that Bachmann is being investigated by the House Ethics committee for campaign violations. It reminds me of that Senator in The Godfather who was going to stop the Corleones from moving on Las Vegas. Truth is stranger than fiction. Hollywood is not that original, the stories are torn from the headlines. Power corrupts and I don’t trust any of them.

The next day, the talking heads were on Fox News claiming that the amendment would have ended all NSA intelligence gathering, putting us all in danger of terrorism. Mike Rogers, Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said on Twitter that he was proud the House “rejected (in bipartisan way) a reckless plan 2 defund impt NSA program” and “stood up 4 America’s security.”

Being one who delves into the details of a story, I decided to discover what the amendment actually said. (Why is it that the media never trusts us with the details?) According to Congressman Amash, the sponsor, “The amendment limits the government’s collection of records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act to those records that pertain to a person who is subject to an investigation under that provision.” To my thinking, that would be in compliance with the 4th Amendment to the Constitution that protects us from unreasonable search and seizure.

Bachmann actually went on the Glenn Beck show and attempted to explain that the intelligence gathering was akin to the government recording the name and address on a letter without spying on the contents. Beck wasn’t buying it and neither am I. You have no damned business keeping records of whom I communicate with, Mr. Gestapo Obama!","2013-07-29 11:08:22","0","33.0","22.0","8.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","87.0","52.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","20.0","10","662","91.41","64.73","9.53","33.59","20.06","24.92","72.36","46.07","10.27","4.83","1.81","1.06","0.76","0.60","0.60","5.44","9.06","14.05","6.34","2.42","3.78","1.66","10.88","2.11","0.76","1.66","1.21","2.27","4.08","2.27","1.81","0.30","0.30","0.45","8.16","0.45","0.15","0.15","1.06","8.76","1.36","1.06","0.60","2.42","1.66","2.57","0.91","0.30","0.45","0.15","0.60","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.00","8.61","2.27","1.06","4.23","0.15","1.21","3.47","6.04","0.45","8.61","0.76","4.68","3.32","2.87","0.30","0.60","0.91","0.00","0.00","2.42","0.15","1.81","0.30","0.15","0.00","20.69","4.98","6.19","0.60","0.00","0.15","0.15","0.00","1.81","1.21","5.14","0.45","3067","8.08","23.103448275862068","970","659","33","59.64","11.9","9.9","11.08","11.6","144","8.9","18.74051593323217","351","20.62","49","0.45","0","21","6","82","0","75","31","1","0","5","81","132","3","28","0","0","35","5","15","0","0","1","27","0","18","26","18","10","15","21","3","8","0","3"

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/why-now-new-doj-report-states-miami-cops-use-excessive-force-against-blacks/","Why Now? New DOJ Report States Miami Cops Use Excessive Force Against Blacks","Could the release of this report at this time have anything to do with the Zimmerman trial?

MIAMI —The U.S. Department of Justice has concluded that the Miami Police Department engaged in a pattern of excessive use of force in the fatal shootings of seven black suspects over an eight-month period.

The Department of Civil Rights Division has been investigating Miami’s Police Department since November of 2011.

Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez released the findings in a letter to Mayor Tomas Regalado and Chief Manuel Orosa.

Below is a small portion of the DOJ’s findings:

We find that MPD engages in a pattern or practice of excessive force with respect to firearms discharges, in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14141. In 2006, we closed our first investigation confident that MPD had adopted and implemented the reforms necessary to ensure constitutional policing, as well as a system of accountability to ensure that those reforms would endure. Unfortunately, many of the systemic problems we believed were fixed have reoccurred, evidenced by a steady rise in officer-involved shootings.2 As detailed further below, MPD itself recently found three of these shootings unjustified, and we found that a number of additional shootings were questionable at best. Many arose as a result of tactical and/or operational deficiencies, and opportunities to learn from these deficiencies were squandered by inadequate and untimely investigations. While the significant decrease in the number of shootings in 2012 while under increased public scrutiny indicates that MPD may be capable of addressing this problem,3 it also underscores that the previous spike in officer-involved shootings may have been avoidable, and that continued, court-enforceable oversight is necessary to ensure lasting reforms.

The shootings from July 2010 to February 2011 took place during the tenure of former Chief Miguel Exposito, who was fired in 2011 during outcry from black community leaders about the shootings.

The department also found deficiencies in tactics and supervision and delays in deadly force investigations.

Orosa made changes in police tactics in high-crime areas that sharply reduced confrontations and police shootings.

State prosecutors have so far not ruled any of the shootings as unjustified.

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/zimmerman-trial-update-if-trayvon-grabbed-it-you-must-acquit/","ZIMMERMAN TRIAL UPDATE: IF TRAYVON GRABBED IT, YOU MUST ACQUIT","There’s a new Johnny Cochran in town. But this time he’s a good guy, and he’s white. His name is Mark O’Mara.

O’Mara’s cross-examination of two police witnesses who took the stand for the prosecution in the George Zimmerman trial today is being praised as masterful and devastatingly effective by even the dubious talking heads on CNN.

Both investigators who testified today, Doris Singleton and Chris Serino, were excellent, credible witnesses–for the side that didn’t call them!

The only thing I can say negatively about Singleton’s testimony is that–reminiscent of Rachel Jeantel from last week–she had a very hard time reading, to the court, Zimmerman’s reasonably legible cursive from his hand-written statement made on the night of the incident.

The prosecution, as they did all last week, again put up witnesses who ostensibly were to there help put George Zimmerman away for murder, but instead wound up giving defense counsel O’Mara and Don West everything they needed to even further drive the stake through the corrupt, dark heart of a malicious miscarriage of justice–the state’s racially-driven railroading of an innocent neighborhood watchman.

Neither police witness supported the idea that Zimmerman acted with the state of mind nor any specific elements of conduct required to consider anything he did that night a crime. When repeatedly asked if they found Zimmerman’s story unreliable or dishonest in the slightest, both cops stated firmly that there was nothing beyond insignificant discrepancies in anything Zimmerman said.

There simply was no probable cause to arrest and charge Zimmerman. There never was, and still isn’t.

Back in February of 2012, Zimmerman had given his account of the evening’s unfolding events multiple times to each detective, together and separately, without a lawyer, immediately following the shooting of Trayvon Martin and recorded on all kinds of tape, devices, and even his own handwriting. He even went with a third investigator back to the scene of the crime the day after the shooting, and was recorded on video describing and re-enacting the words & movements as they took place.

Zimmerman took a huge legal risk immediately after the shooting by discussing the incident so freely and openly without counsel, but the jury today saw the real George Zimmerman in those videos and on audiotape–rather meek, mild-mannered, much slimmer by about 120 lbs., sincere, candid, and determined to help detectives get to the bottom of what happened.

The problem for the prosecution, as I’ve said all along, is that they don’t have a case at all. We all know the score by now, why this case came to the fore; propelled by rabid race-hustlers and easily-duped liberals on Change.org, and fueled by the words of a former acolyte of Rev. Jeremiah Wright and of professor Derrick Bell who occupied the White House in an election year and put his thumb on the scales.

State’s attorney Angela Corey, by the way, who brought the bogus charge of second-degree murder against Zimmerman on behalf of the prosecution, was re-elected unopposed 5 days after she filed the preposterous, hollow charging affidavit.

The jury today heard Zimmerman in his own words firmly and repeatedly describe the logistical timeline and circumstances that led to his leaving his vehicle to better position himself to try to observe the suspiciously-acting Martin and to obtain an exact address for police, then being abruptly accosted & attacked by the re-appearing Trayvon Martin, and then how he desperately struggled underneath Martin’s vicious onslaught and screamed for help.

Zimmerman’s gestures and voice at the scene of the videotaped re-enactment the following day are those of an earnest, convincing neighbor who was alone, being beaten savagely by a strapping, towering thug, and begging for help from someone nearby who refused to come to his aid, instead saying he’d just call police as he stood outside his unit’s rear sliding glass door and watched, yelling at Trayvon to stop his attack.","2013-07-01 20:49:39","0","37.0","18.0","8.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","82.0","52.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","20.0","10","666","91.59","68.98","19.16","13.56","33.30","26.28","75.08","46.10","8.11","4.50","0.30","0.15","0.00","3.15","0.90","3.60","9.16","15.02","4.50","4.80","6.31","1.65","10.81","3.15","1.95","1.65","0.90","1.65","4.20","1.65","2.55","0.60","1.20","0.30","9.31","0.00","0.45","0.30","3.00","8.41","1.65","1.50","0.60","1.50","1.50","2.55","3.00","1.35","1.35","0.30","0.75","0.45","0.30","0.00","0.00","6.91","1.20","1.20","3.75","1.20","0.60","5.26","3.90","0.30","15.02","2.55","6.46","6.31","2.25","0.45","0.75","0.60","0.00","0.30","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.86","3.15","6.16","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.15","1.80","0.00","3.15","0.00","0.30","3264","8.96","34.2","1001","645","22","41.74","15.4","14.7","13.82","18.0","158","8.0","23.518449612403103","377","29.9","6","0.46","0","31","4","74","0","83","49","1","3","1","129","57","0","28","1","0","19","11","42","1","0","2","18","0","21","44","18","14","6","10","2","8","0","3"

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/zimmerman-trial-american-historys-lesson-on-a-fair-trial/","Zimmerman Trial: American History’s Lesson on A Fair Trial","With the media hoopla surrounding the Zimmerman trial, a casual observer might be excused for thinking that this was the most contentious murder trial in American history. Even more so when you consider the underlying threats of retribution and riots if the “wrong” verdict is handed down.

But let’s step back a minute. You are, after all, Americans, and there is a shining example your proud history that ought to elevate this debate above the petty race-baiting so prevalent today.

History provides a far more emotionally charged example of clashing us-or-them groups, and an example in particular wherein not one, but several, people lay dead with the defendants claiming self-defense.

It was Boston. Tensions between the locals and the Redcoats were high, having something to do with Tea and a Harbor not long before that. On the 5th of March, 1770, a mob of locals jeered at, taunted, and attacked the British Sentries.

Shots were fired, and several Bostonians died. Naturally, the locals were outraged, and no local lawyers were willing to defend the Redcoats. Except, that is, for one John Adams, who insisted they get a fair trial.

Adams — no fan of the Crown — defended them, and saw many acquitted.

Adams — later President Adams — wrote in his diary:

“The part I took in defense of captain Preston and the soldiers, procured me anxiety, and obloquy enough. It was, however, one of the most gallant, generous, manly and disinterested actions of my whole life, and one of the best pieces of service I ever rendered my country. Judgment of death against those soldiers would have been as foul a stain upon this country as the executions of the Quakers or witches, anciently.”

The American public would do well to consider the importance their founders placed on the presumption of innocence, and a fair trial, before presuming the guilt of the current defendant.

Unless, of course, as a nation, you are abandoning the principles that made you great in the first place.","2013-07-15 11:10:55","0","34.0","18.0","8.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","84.0","52.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","20.0","10","335","89.44","65.11","26.95","2.35","19.71","25.67","81.49","50.15","8.96","5.07","1.49","0.60","1.49","0.30","1.19","3.88","11.34","13.43","6.57","2.99","8.06","1.19","11.04","6.27","3.88","0.60","1.79","3.58","8.66","2.69","5.37","1.19","1.49","0.30","7.76","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.60","7.76","1.49","0.30","1.19","2.09","0.60","3.28","0.60","0.60","0.00","0.00","0.60","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.30","8.96","0.90","1.49","3.58","1.49","2.39","4.18","5.07","0.30","12.54","0.60","7.46","4.48","1.79","0.60","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.49","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","17.61","5.07","9.55","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.19","1.19","0.30","0.00","0.00","1578","8.62","21.0","492","335","17","59.94","12.3","9.8","11.43","11.7","85","8.4","20.029253731343285","213","18.88","2","0.47","0","18","6","46","0","40","29","0","1","4","45","19","3","19","0","0","14","5","15","3","2","1","4","0","10","17","10","9","6","4","3","1","0","1"

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/08/enough-go-ahead-call-racist/","Enough! Go Ahead and Call Me a Racist","Chris Matthews has always been a shinning example of a liberal suffering from a huge case of white guilt. What is white guilt? It’s simple really, Matthews and those like him experience a feeling or a thought that tells them that just by their heritage and ethnicity alone they are guilty of racial bigotry and must apologize for it.

Matthews was on his network, MSNLSD, and was asking when the white conservative will accept Barack Obama. Well Chris, it’s like this. I have no racial issue with Barack Obama. I think he by all accounts is a good father and a model citizen, except for his far left socialist views and his ready acceptance of gay marriage and infanticide, of course. I will never agree with Obama no matter how much you call me a racist and insinuate that the only reason I disagree with the President is because he is black.

Matthews then went on to say that white conservatives never wanted a black man in office. Hey Chris, just for the record I would vote for Allen West, Clarence Thomas and Tim Scott tomorrow. Since we are talking about Tim Scott, how in the world did the ethnically sensitive left forget to invite Tim Scott, the only black senator, to the King rally?

After watching quite a bit of the King March yesterday I found myself being quite disgusted at where we are at as a country. I reject this assertion that somehow we haven’t come far enough on the issue of civil rights. I heard this mantra all day yesterday, “We have made progress, but we still have a long way to go.” What the hell does that even mean?

Before I listened to Chris Matthews trumpet his moronic statements I heard Martin Luther King III give a short speech. The speech itself wasn’t so bad except for the fact that, not once but twice, the man talks about how much farther we have to go in the fight for civil rights.

My question is simple. Where is the finish line? Seriously, it takes some serious balls to stand next to the first black President of the United States and pretend that all things are not equal. In fact, in the age of Affirmative Action and the EEOC many have claimed that the scale is tipping the other way all together. In this time when you get college scholarships based off nothing but the color of your skin, I ask where is the finish line?

To paraphrase from the late, great Booker T. Washington, there was and still is a class of “Negroes” who are seeking to profit and get rich off the struggles of the black community. I venture to say that in this time in America the problems in the black community are their own. No longer is it the evil bigoted white man that terrorizes their communities, it is their own children. Just this past week, MLK III wrote a column in which he elaborated on how the dream hasn’t been realized. In this column he mention two issues that I want to hit on to close out my column this week. The first is Trayvon Martin and the second is voter ID laws.

In his column MLK III likened Martin to the infamous Emmett Till. He is not the first to use this ridiculous analogy, but hopefully he will be the last. I quite frankly am sick of hearing about Trayvon and his racial injustice. There was none, just accept it. The FBI went looking for a race angle and never found it.

You know where there is a race angle, though? How about the murder of Chris Lane? Lane was a white college student from Australia who was targeted by black teenagers, one of whom professed to hate whites. He was shot in the back and left to bleed out like an animal on the side of the road.

Another victim by the name of Delbert “Shorty” Belton, was killed this past week as well. Belton was an eighty-eight year old World War Two veteran who was beaten to death by two black teenagers with flashlights.

Finally, just the other day, I saw another story of a hotdog vendor being savagely beaten in the head with a hammer by four black males in front of a Home Depot. All white victims and all black suspects; doesn’t that qualify as racial violence? Why didn’t MLK III mention them in his column about how far we need to go? Until we are ready to have a truly open and honest discussion about the collapse of the black family structure and how it is causing deaths of all races, I’m done hearing about Trayvon Martin.

Last but not least, MLK III talks about voter ID laws and how they are targeting the black community. Well, in short, this is nothing more than a straw man argument. If that is the case are cigarette and beer sales also targeting the black community or how about banks when they go to cash a check? Your ID is used for just that, IDENTIFICATION. If I have to show an ID to exercise my second amendment rights then I have no problem with you having to show an ID to exercise your voting rights.

These laws are not racist, anymore than I am racist for challenging the statements of a race-monger who is content to make money off of “civil rights.” You know what Dr. King really wanted? He wanted a world where everyman was judged by his character and his actions. Instead, these people who invoke his name judge everyman by his race and justify his character by the very same measure. If you want to see where we have a long way to go, you can start by examining those who claim to be the closest to the late Dr. King.

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/08/demint-on-defunding-obamacare-people-must-speak-up/","DeMint On Defunding Obamacare: People Must Speak Up","South Carolina Republican Sen. Jim DeMint unexpectedly quit Congress this winter, saying essentially that he could better advance the conservative cause as president of the Heritage Foundation think tank than in Congress.

Roughly eight months later, DeMint has no doubt pressed Congress, and House Republicans in particular, to take a conservative stance on such issues as the Farm Bill and President Obama’s health care law.

Heritage and DeMint won at least a partial victory on the recent Farm Bill vote, getting the House to split funding for food stamps from the rest of the bill but saying more reform is needed on the billions being spent on crop subsidies and other programs. And votes of sequestration, the debt limit and immigration are also on the near horizon.

But DeMint’s biggest challenges to date appears to lie in the weeks ahead when Congress returns in two weeks to vote on a temporary spending bill, which DeMint hopes will not include money for ObamaCare.

“We know that ObamaCare is unfair,” DeMint has said repeatedly over the past few months, as dismantling the law has emerged as a primary focus. “It’s unaffordable, unworkable and very unpopular. And this might be our last chance to stop it. … This is an urgent matter.”

DeMint is trying to put the specter of a shutdown on Obama, saying the president will be to blame should he insist on keeping his “flawed law” on the negotiating table.

Others in the Tea Party movement such as Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul have said the GOP — by controlling one-third of government with the House majority – has an obligation to challenge the bill, then hope for a House-Senate compromise.

However, the Democrat-controlled Senate will likely never agree to the so-called “defunding” of ObamaCare, nor would the president sign such an agreement, which would give DeMint little more than a symbolic victory.

“It’s an uphill battle unless the people in the country speak up,” DeMint acknowledged to Fox News on Friday, at about the midway point of Heritage Action for American’s nine-city Defund ObamaCare Town Hall Tour.

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/07/zimmerman-trial-update-defenses-forensic-pathologist-schools-everyone/","ZIMMERMAN TRIAL UPDATE: DEFENSE’S FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST SCHOOLS EVERYONE","Dr. Vincent Di Maio took the stand for most of today’s testimony, commanding the entire room with his august yet easy confidence and candor, and reducing the prosecution’s interference to only sparse, feebly-muttered objections for the entire lengthy phase of the defense attorney Don West’s initial question-and-answer.

In his thoughtful answers, Di Maio curtly supported George Zimmerman’s version of the incident in question–specifically, how Zimmerman received his injuries, and how Trayvon Martin died–by mere virtue of his unimpeachable assertions about everything in evidence being consistent with Zimmerman’s story of what happened.

Having graduated medical school in 1965, Di Maio has been practicing forensic pathology for 48 years. His testimony today seemed to go on for about the same length of time. But he certainly isn’t a boring guy to listen to; he’s been boning up on broken bones, broken skin, behavior of bullets when fired, and everything having to do with injuries to, and deaths of, human beings for so long that when he answered questions about it all, it was in such a knowledgeable, conversational tone (with just enough gallows-directness) that you couldn’t help but be somewhat amused at some of his revelations.

For example, when discussing different kinds and causes of head injuries, Di Maio would first spend some time precisely, clinically clarifying the exact nature of the event, then would bluntly blurt out the bottom line: “We’ve seen people who have this particular type of brain trauma under the surface, which isn’t apparent at all from the exterior, and you’re walking around with no problem–but then a few days later you suddenly drop dead.”

Another highlight was when Di Maio explained about how a person suffering a gunshot wound straight into the heart can continue to live, talk, and move for at least 10-15 seconds afterward, and up to as much as 1-3 minutes, if enough oxygen is still available to the brain. He gave the case example of a man who had taken a point-blank shotgun blast which had completely shredded his heart; the man was still able to run 65 feet, rounding the corner of a building before dropping.

Most importantly, Di Maio debunked multiple previously existing prosecution myths, which had been enabled in part by incompetent testimony from his comparatively incompetent medical inferiors put on the stand by the state, regarding the circumstances and implications of both Zimmerman’s injuries and Martin’s expiration.

Instead of speaking in haltingly broken English, like so many other physicians we find on witness stands and in our society nowadays (this trial included), Di Maio’s words flowed comfortably, and without any confusion about pronunciation or meaning at all. And like detective Chris Serino of the Sanford police department, who projected the prototypical “NYPD Blue” flatfoot, Di Maio came across like a character right out of central casting–the classic worldly, case-cracking, old-school Sherlock in a lab coat who could just as easily have filled the lead in the TV show “Quincy, M.E.” as did actor Jack Klugman (speaking of Klugman, same also played the role of one of the jurors in the brilliant, original cinematic version of “12 Angry Men”–a fitting minor happenstance here, because of the parallel courthouse suspense and painstaking jury deliberation drama which exonerates an falsely-accused man in that classic film).

Enlightening also was the way Dr. Di Maio brought lessons for those who might have thought some of the other state witnesses even knew what they were talking about or doing in their jobs. For instance, when going into minute detail about Zimmerman’s injuries, Di Maio made it clear that emergency room doctors and nurses (as well as paramedics and EMTs in the field) often fail to adequately document a patient’s wounds accurately, to the point where he just doesn’t consider their work in general reliable in that respect–“They screw it up all the time.”

When mildly challenged on that by the prosecution, he frankly explained again and again how such medical professionals are really mainly oriented to treating patients, but not especially interested in or geared toward meticulously documenting, in fine detail, their patients’ injuries. Given that the exact location on the body, and the precise, miniscule aspects of injuries, are what wind up being vetted in an alleged murder case such as this, Di Maio not only made clear the supreme value to the court of his diligent expertise, he then proved his point on the spot: He turned to one of the images of George Zimmerman’s battered and lacerated head projected onto the courtroom wall screen, and convincingly pointed out how the physician assistant Lindzee Folgate (who saw and treated Zimmerman the day after the incident, and who had testified in court last week) had failed to actually document Zimmerman’s injuries exactly and completely.","2013-07-10 09:37:38","0","33.0","19.0","8.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","82.0","52.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","20.0","10","807","88.46","68.10","29.22","41.45","50.44","26.89","77.45","46.10","7.81","3.59","0.00","0.37","0.37","2.23","0.62","4.21","7.43","16.11","4.96","6.20","7.31","0.99","9.29","4.58","2.73","3.22","1.36","2.60","4.09","2.48","1.61","0.00","0.37","0.37","7.81","0.00","0.12","0.00","2.85","12.02","2.73","1.49","0.74","2.48","3.10","2.73","1.49","0.99","0.37","0.12","3.84","2.23","2.48","0.12","0.00","4.46","0.62","1.73","2.48","0.37","0.50","4.58","3.59","0.62","15.24","1.73","8.18","5.45","2.11","0.99","0.25","0.12","0.00","0.50","0.25","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.12","0.00","15.61","2.35","6.57","0.25","0.25","0.00","0.00","1.24","1.24","2.48","1.24","0.00","3995","10.26","63.53846153846154","1239","790","17","24.28","18.4","21.4","14.0","26.5","216","16.5","31.536708860759497","458","51.92","4","0.45","0","32","10","77","0","110","71","0","3","5","142","59","0","45","1","0","19","14","59","0","0","6","16","0","19","41","25","22","14","10","4","10","0","12"

"https://clashdaily.com/2013/08/enemy-at-the-gate-the-playbook-of-the-powers-and-principalities/","Enemy at the Gate: The Playbook of the Powers and Principalities","Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn once remarked, “There is an irreconcilable difference between good and evil.” This has become a very unpopular perspective. We are conditioned to believe that anything is reconcilable and that both Good and Evil are user-defined and therefore open to interpretation. We are supposed to remain skeptical that Evil even exists and that Good is even possible, apart from the indulgence of our whims and appetites, which is always seen as Good and beyond reproach. After all, as highly-developed animals, we are entitled to the spoils of the evolutionary struggle, no??

Solzhenitsyn’s assessment has been turned upside down and worked over like a side of beef which lives in Rocky’s neighborhood. The postmodern ethos has informed us that distinctions between Good and Evil are meaningless; mere holdovers from the age of dead-white-guy paternalistic imperialism. We are supposed to believe that Evil doesn’t exist and never did, that anything can be good but nothing is Good. It is a brilliant strategy, conceived by a brilliant being, to wage war against the God of the Bible and His word.

As Baudelaire wrote, “The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world that he did not exist.” If Satan could convince the world that his existence was a myth, then it would be a simple thing to next suggest that God and His morality is similarly mythical; a surprisingly self-effacing ploy for a being whose hubris is central to the story of his existence.

As effective as this tactic has proven to be, it will never convince everyone. There are still pockets of fuddy-duddyism all over the world. Places where absolute morality still holds sway and relativism is dismissed as illogical and untenable, so new methods are needed. It is becoming clear that the strategy being used by the “powers and principalities” in our day is two-fold. The first prong of the attack is to flood the foundational institutions of Western civilization in the hopes of diluting the power and protection these institutions offer. So the institution of marriage isn’t forbidden, it is flooded to include anyone and anything which wants to call itself “marriage”. In doing so, the pungency of the institution and its preservative power in our society is diminished and obscured.

Thus it has gone with the Family, too. By encouraging all shapes and sizes of family, instead of the biblical model of familial stability through a monogamous, marital relationship, we see shows like The New Normal, Modern Family, and Family Guy resonating with audiences who view dysfunction as normal, desirable, and healthy, and familial harmony as fake, perverse, and unattainable.

With each institution given to us by God for our protection, the Enemy has made the same assault: enervation by dilution. The massive expansion and infiltration of Government into our lives has obscured the real purpose of Government as God intended it: to promote and administer justice in the place of God Himself. Nations were created in order to protect us against tyrannical rulers, giving us another civilization to flee to if the fit hits the shan. Instead of retaining this separation, we seek the input and governance from other nations over our own sovereignty via the UN and other organizations which promote a return to the time of Nimrod under a One World government.","2013-08-01 10:03:12","0","30.0","18.0","8.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","83.0","52.0","0.0","132.0","0.0","19.0","9","556","79.09","76.41","11.10","38.57","23.17","26.08","84.71","53.24","10.97","3.96","0.00","2.88","0.00","1.08","0.00","7.01","8.63","14.93","8.99","3.60","7.91","1.26","13.31","6.12","2.88","1.26","0.72","1.08","6.29","3.42","2.70","0.18","0.90","0.00","8.27","1.08","0.54","0.00","1.44","11.69","2.88","1.44","1.44","2.34","2.52","2.70","1.62","1.08","0.36","0.00","0.90","0.00","0.36","0.18","0.36","13.31","4.68","1.44","5.04","1.80","0.72","3.60","8.27","0.54","10.61","0.72","6.47","3.24","3.06","0.90","0.90","0.18","1.98","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.85","4.14","5.22","0.36","0.36","0.36","0.00","1.26","1.44","0.72","0.00","0.00","2727","8.83","25.454545454545453","870","549","24","48.23","14.4","12.2","12.77","14.2","141","7.5","21.43322404371585","315","22.23","1","0.49","0","29","2","60","0","76","54","0","1","4","92","34","2","21","0","0","19","11","26","0","0","0","18","0","17","11","12","23","13","26","4","1","1","1"

The alleged fraud occurred in the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under the nose of former administrator Gina McCarthy, who now heads up the entire agency.

“There appears to be corruption to the umpteenth degree,” said Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter. “I think it’s appalling that Administrator McCarthy and former acting Administrator Bob Perciasepe could claim that sequester is depriving the agency of important resources when in fact their own employees are stealing from the government.”

EPA employee John Beale, who worked in the air office, stole $886,186 from the agency between 2000 and 2013. According to the criminal filing, Beale had stolen agency funds through salary, benefits, and certain bonuses that Beale “had not earned by providing employment services to the EPA.”

Clash Daily Contributors

When in the process of building a society, it would seem very strange for one to suggest that the state mandate one size of pants in which to squeeze every American. No one would try to design one television show to entertain all Americans: yet the public education system in America feigns to create one system to adequately educate every child in America. This form of reasoning can only be bred in a monopoly, a monopoly that forbids competition and has no incentive to please its customers.

The data collected about the public education system in America is haunting. In Nevada alone, the graduation rate for high school students from 2006 to 2009 lies at a nauseating fifty-six percent, consistently ranking it amongst the lowest in the country. In the back yard of the Capitol of the United States and the heart of American government, public schools follow a close second, averaging a graduation rate of fifty-seven percent. These numbers are not token examples. Among developing countries, America ranks 20th in graduation rates.

Not only are students failing to complete their education up to their senior year, they are barely competent in the most rudimentary of skills. According to the Department of Education, seventy-nine percent of 8th graders in Chicago Public Schools are not proficient in reading, and eighty percent are not proficient in math.

The way people light their cigarettes has made an unrecognizable change from its nineteenth century counterpart, and yet the education of the young, perhaps one of societies most important issues, has not been held up to this evolutionary scrutiny. When people in the twenty-first century are cramming their children into archaic molds, it is no wonder how the education system ended up this way, just as if how society fed children with a nineteenth century diet they would not meet modern life expectancy nor growth averages.

One-size-fits-all education simply does not work. Humans are an almost unimaginably eclectic bunch, and the thought of taking ostensibly every child in America and putting them into one form of education is egalitarian to a fault. Every student, regardless of abilities, interests, mental capacity, and personality is all crammed into one classroom and is taught the same things, in the same way, by the same people, at the same pace. The only thing students in public schools share in common is age, and this seems to be a very poor criterion to determine how a student should be educated.

Not only are students expected to learn in a system that may be a malfit for them, but they are forced to attend them for eleven years. Truancy laws keep students who are not satisfied with their education to rot in a mindless purgatory. A student who may greatly benefit from learning a skill or getting a job is literally forced into their desk by the threat of legal sanctions against both the student and their parents for missing class. This being said, the public school system is not benignly inefficient, it is a vicious perdition that keeps students intellectually flaccid, hobbled, and left to decay until the day they turn eighteen. While students are free to leave during their last year, it is a very sick consolation to those unfortunate souls who have had their minds forcefully bound for eleven years.","2013-08-15 08:46:59","0","31.0","19.0","8.0","0.0","18.0","0.0","80.0","52.0","0.0","131.0","0.0","20.0","10","565","92.66","58.40","20.73","17.99","26.90","25.66","84.96","47.08","7.08","2.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.83","4.25","8.67","15.58","7.08","3.72","4.07","2.48","11.68","3.54","1.42","1.59","4.60","2.65","4.60","1.95","2.48","0.18","0.53","0.71","7.26","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.73","1.42","1.77","1.42","2.30","1.42","2.65","0.71","0.35","0.18","0.18","1.24","0.18","0.88","0.00","0.53","11.68","0.53","2.83","8.14","0.53","0.53","1.59","8.32","0.71","13.45","1.24","7.79","4.42","8.85","0.71","0.18","0.88","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.44","3.72","5.31","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2725","8.49","26.904761904761905","873","558","21","44.48","14.6","13.7","12.07","15.5","125","12.375","21.60057347670251","298","23.67","1","0.46","0","14","16","64","1","67","52","0","1","7","92","21","3","40","0","0","12","11","32","0","2","2","21","0","23","3","15","15","19","20","4","3","0","5"
"https://clashdaily.com/2013/08/faustian-fisticuffs-progressives-vs-fascists/","Faustian Fisticuffs: Progressives vs. Fascists","Things are getting a little aggro on the Left these days. Far from the utopian paradise which was advertised, it appears the Beatles were lying. It turns out that love is not in fact all you need. John and Paul forgot to mention that you also need a boatload of cash to pay for the political prostitution which accompanies all that love. All across the nation, progressives and leftists are scrapping like feral dogs in the charred husk of a once-prosperous Detroit neighborhood. They’ve stumbled upon a carcass and now every bitch and cur wants a mouthful; the carcass, of course, being the desiccated remains of this once-great nation.

Now that the so-called Republican Party has waved the white underpants on a stick to signal their surrender to the Progressive agenda, the fascists and socialists are beginning to turn on each other. Cracks in the Berlin Dam are starting to appear and it remains to be seen if the GOP will do any more than hold the trowel while Alinski’s disciples mix up more spackle.

In Illinois, Democratic super-majorities in both houses of the legislature are having a hard time working with their fellow socialist in the governor’s mansion, Pat Quinn. The useful idiots of Illinois helpfully gave the Democratic Party a foolproof lock on the state’s political machinery during the 2012 election. The result? Much the same as when the Democrats received possession of the federal steering wheel after the 2008 election: complete ineptitude. The butcher’s bill for decades of their deficit spending and political back-scratching in Illinois has arrived in the form of mandatory pension-funding contributions and gaping state budget deficits as far as the eye can see.

The problem is that when you obliterate the party who at least pretends to be fiscally-responsible, someone else is forced into that role. It is simply an economic reality which the Democrat normally never has to face, thanks to the nearby presence of some Republican patsy who willingly takes the blame. Unfortunately for the Democrats, there are no Illinois Republicans with any power in Springfield on whom to stick the blame this time.

In this instance, the reckoning comes in the form of progressives having to go toe-to-toe with Big Labor, who got them elected in the first place. It is an unenviable position, but utterly avoidable. If the progressives in Illinois hadn’t made their Faustian bargain with Mike Phistopholes, Local 4 President, and promised fiscally-unsustainable benefits to state and local employees in exchange for votes, they would not be faced with having to legislate in ways detrimental for their voting bloc.

If Illinois political history holds true, what will happen is the Democratic Party will locate a willing, progressive Republican whose pockets are of more importance to him than his principles. They will work to get this milksop elected as governor or will promote him to a position of prominence in the State Senate in order to have a whipping boy again. This volunteer-scapegoat will make a half-hearted effort at fiscal sanity and give progressives and fascists a common enemy to target, providing them a loophole by which to raise taxes and pay for their mistakes without disturbing the slumber of Illinois voters: by blaming the scary RINO.

These lovers’ spats extend beyond the rotunda in Springfield, however. Strife and contention is cropping up in the most unlikely places these days. Unions are on the offensive across the country fighting Obamacare, the very law they helped bring to fruition. They don’t like Obamacare’s punishment of “Cadillac” insurance plans, which their fat-cat union leaders enjoy at the expense of the union members, and so they are fighting back against Obamacare’s implementation, attempting to intimidate the very leftists they exhorted to pass the monstrosity in the first place. As this column has suggested previously, Leftism is a mental disorder and the schizophrenic aspects of it are on display as never before today.","2013-08-29 11:10:05","0","31.0","19.0","8.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","83.0","52.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","20.0","10","664","95.12","70.11","14.91","28.28","24.59","26.66","77.11","48.34","8.58","3.31","0.00","0.00","0.45","0.45","2.41","5.27","10.84","16.11","6.63","2.71","5.12","1.20","11.75","4.97","2.56","1.96","1.20","2.26","5.72","2.86","2.71","0.45","1.81","0.00","8.43","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.75","6.63","0.15","0.60","1.51","1.81","1.51","2.11","1.51","1.05","0.00","0.30","1.96","0.90","0.30","0.30","0.45","8.13","1.96","1.51","3.31","1.20","0.45","2.26","7.68","1.20","14.46","1.36","8.89","4.37","3.46","0.60","0.30","2.11","0.15","0.00","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.20","3.92","3.77","0.30","0.15","0.15","0.00","1.96","0.30","1.66","0.00","0.00","3265","9.07","24.925925925925927","998","651","26","54.56","13.5","11.9","12.94","15.4","173","7.833333333333334","22.62980030721966","379","22.19","2","0.49","0","18","3","92","0","88","52","3","1","8","109","44","3","40","1","0","20","8","28","0","1","2","24","0","31","12","18","9","22","22","5","5","1","2"
"https://clashdaily.com/2013/08/finally-planned-parenthood-will-be-investig-by-gao-for-use-of-tax-payers-money/","Finally: Planned Parenthood Will Be Investigated By GAO For Use Of Tax Payers’ Money","WASHINGTON – The non-partisan Government Accountability Office confirmed Thursday it is launching an investigation into how the country’s largest abortion provider spent millions of taxpayer dollars.

Planned Parenthood received more than a half billion dollars in federal funding last year. The GAO’s investigation is in response to a request made by more than 50 members of Congress in February who asked for a detailed report on how money is being used by Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers across the country.

Specifically, lawmakers want to know what procedures and services they provided and the number of people who were served and how much it cost.

The GAO’s investigation comes on the heels of a settlement involving a Texas affiliate of the organization, which paid $4.3 million in July to settle allegations of fraud in billing to a health program for the poor. The settlement was $3 million more than what had been announced earlier by the Texas Attorney General.

However, when finalizing the settlement, which included state and federal recovery money, Planned Parenthood strongly refuted claims it has frequently over-billed the system.

Al Sharpton Signs A Book Deal Via Cash Money Records!","Just weeks after signing socialite Paris Hilton Newsday LI reports that Rev. Al Sharpton is working on a book to be co-released this October 8th by the publishing arm of Cash Money Records, home to Lil Wayne, with whom Sharpton has feuded over some of the rapper’s lyrics.

Sharpton‘s “The Rejected Stone” will be published by Cash Money Content and Massenburg Media.

The book will cover Sharpton’s “personal evolution” from New York street activist to political candidate and civil rights spokesman.

Sharpton told The Associated Press on Thursday that the book would include his thoughts on Lil Wayne and other rappers and that he was anxious to have a positive dialogue.

He added: “Just because we disagree doesn’t mean we have to be disagreeable.”

"http://mrnewswatch.com/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/","NRA President Jim Porter: “It’s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again”","It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.

“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”

When asked to clarify Porter said,

“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”

Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”

It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.

READ STORY HERE: Lil Wayne Says “I F**ked Chris Bosh’s Wife [VIDEO]

The wife of the NBA baller took the high road via twitter today after the Young Money CEO said he “f*cked Chris Bosh wife.”

She started it off with a series of retweets which read:

“Truth prevails. Today stand in your truth and ignore the chatter around and about you. #myhighestself #TodayICan #chakrawisdom. Some people create hate for profit, and some people create love for free. Pay no mind to the haters, embrace the love. #TodayICan ignore those who live in hate for their own ego, and keep my eyes on pure love. They will never bring me down.

Mrs. Bosh then continued to kill him with kindness by telling Wayne ‘what goes around comes around.’ She even tweeted a picture to let Weezy know karma is real.

What do you think about the way Adrienne Bosh handled today’s rumors?

"http://mrnewswatch.com/meek-miilz-is-suing-the-philadelphia-police-department/","Meek Millz Is Suing The Philadelphia Police Department","Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill is suing the Philadelphia Police Department, after being jailed for nine hours without cause, stemming from an October 31 traffic stop.

Robert Williams aka Meek Mill, filed the lawsuit against police officers Andre Boyer and Michael Vargas, in Federal Court in Philadelphia on Monday (January 14).

Court documents state that “on October 31, 2012, at approximately 7:30 p.m., plaintiff was driving a Range Rover SUV when Philadelphia Police Officers Andre Boyer and Michael Vargas, without cause or justification, conducted a motor vehicle stop in the area of 11th Street and Girard Avenue in Philadelphia.”

“Following the vehicle stop, police officers Boyer and Vargas handcuffed plaintiff at the scene, transported him in custody to the 22nd Police District, took photographs of plaintiff which the officers posted and published, or caused to be posted and published, on Instagram and other social media websites, depicting plaintiff in police custody, held plaintiff in custody against his will in a jail cell for approximately nine (9) hours, after which time plaintiff was released on November 1, 2012, at 4:30 a.m., without being charged with any criminal activity and having caused plaintiff to miss a scheduled promotional appearance in Atlanta, Georgia.”

Meek says that the arrest’s timing caused him to refund “his deposit for the private jet that was booked to fly plaintiff in the evening of October 31, 2012 to a promotional appearance in Atlanta,” and cost him “the loss of numerous sponsorships and endorsements.

Meek is also suing for “anxiety and embarrassment associated with plaintiff being placed in a false light; and the anxiety and embarrassment of being seized, detained, confined and imprisoned against plaintiff’s will.”

Meek is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for civil rights violations, false imprisonment, invasion of privacy and civil conspiracy.

In the lawsuit, Meek’s attorney makes it clear that this has been a practice of the Philadelphia Police Department and that the stops have been racial in nature, much like the “stop and frisks” in New York City.

“Prior to October 31, 2012, the defendant City of Philadelphia, through the high command of the Philadelphia Police Department, implemented and enforced a policy and practice of stops, frisks, searches and detentions of persons, including plaintiff, without probable cause or reasonable suspicion as required by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1 section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution”

“The stops, frisks, searches and detentions by Philadelphia Police

Department officers are often based on constitutionally impermissible considerations of race and/or national origin in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The victims of such racial and/or national origin profiling are principally African-American and Latino.”

"http://mrnewswatch.com/sarah-palin-believes-that-global-warming-will-bring-back-the-dinosaurs/","Sarah Palin Believes That Global Warming Will ‘Bring Back the Dinosaurs’","Sarah Palin said today that concern over global warming is overblown because returning the climate to its state millions of years ago will allow dinosaurs to make a comeback.

In an interview with Fox News, the former Alaska governor admitted that climate change will hurt some plants and animals but argued that it will also provide an opportunity for ancient, warm-weather species to thrive.

“I’ve been hearing all this hootin’ and hollarin’ from the liberals about how CO 2 is going up to levels we haven’t seen in 5 million years,” Palin told Fox and Friends‘ host Gretchen Carlson. “But the truth is, life was pretty good millions of years ago.

“There were plenty of plants and animals back then, and they did just fine in the heat. And as Earth starts to warm up, all our old friends will start coming back. The polar bears might die off, but think of all the dinosaurs we’re gonna get!

“But you don’t hear the liberal, lamestream media talk about that do you? All you hear is doom and gloom, the sky is falling. Personally, I can’t wait to see what a triceratops looks like in real life.”

Page Right Out of History

The overwhelming majority of scientists believe that the Earth’s climate is warming due to emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases created by industrial activity.

If left unchecked, this process could increase temperatures significantly by the end of the century and lead to increased drought, severe weather and mass extinctions across the globe.

According to Palin, however, these negative effects are outweighed by the positive, which apparently includes the dubious idea that restoring a Pliocene climate will bring Cretaceous species back to life.

“Just to be clear,” Carlson interrupted, “you’re saying that if some animals go extinct because it’s too hot, they’ll be replaced by heat-loving animals that went extinct millions of years ago?”

“Well, yes exactly,” Palin responded. “That’s what I call logic, Gretchen. Something the Looney Left in this country doesn’t understand. They’re so Debbie Downer about this whole thing, they can’t see the bright side.”

“I don’t think you can actually bring back the dinosaurs,” interjected co-host Steve Doocy. “Once something is extinct it’s gone forever. Also, dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago, so your dates are a bit off as well. “

“Really?” a surprised Palin inquired. “But they did it in Jurassic Park. Are you telling me that movie wasn’t based on a true story?”

Stunned by Palin’s ignorance of basic scientific concepts, the Fox and Friends team turned the conversation to the ongoing Benghazi scandal.

Palin served as Alaska’s governor from 2006-2009 and was the Republican nominee for vice president in 2008. She is currently an author and Fox News contributor.

His latest stop was to the Sway In the Morning Show.

He talks about the Rick Ross shooting, saying he thought it was just a rumor until his engineer confirmed it.

The Virginia rapper also addresses rumors that have followed Kanye West and Jay-Z for years, that they are somehow part of the Illuminati and devil worshipers. The rumors now include Pusha himself.

“I never asked [Kanye] about the Illuminati, but just in conversation I hear him be like ‘man people saying I’m part of the Illuminati, people are crazy.’ It’s bled over to everybody,” Pusha said. “I was just saying that my mother asked me the other day ‘I heard you part of something called the Illuminessence.’ And I’m like mom what are you talking about? She’s like ‘you part of something called the Illuminessence. The people in church told me you are part of something called the Illuminessence!’ Come to find out she’s talking about the Illuminati. And I’m talking about I was so hot because y’all all in church telling my mom this kind of stuff.”

Push said there isn’t any devil worshiping going on with Kanye either.

The former wife of a man reported to have treated K Michelle like a common whore is speaking out!

That’s before we’re told K Michelle was sent on her way, dropped off at a Chicago train station.

The source says the incident went down about seven-years ago, just before K Michelle first landed a ticket into the studio with R Kelly – who our source says was close to the couple.

While it’s now confirmed that Clive is too far gone to be called bi-curious, what we’re curious about is who among his crew were most likely to be covering up for Clive.

Scroll Down for the most likely suspects…

Diddy

Diddy is pretty famous for his freaky ways and it’s long been implied that he’s batted for both teams. Clive’s coming out only sheds more suspicion on the Bad Boy because it’s public knowledge that Diddy borrowed millions from Clive when the label was in trouble and at one point Clive’s Arista label actually owned a 50% stake of Bad Boy. Coincidence? We think not.

Christina Aguilera

Xtina has always been known for letting her freak flag fly freely, and no wonder she’s felt so comfortable, with Clive playing a large role in her career, even to this day.

Andre Harrell

How many execs do you know take such a STRONG interest in their unpaid INTERN that they bring them on as an A&R? Not many. But it’s not just his shady relationship with Diddy that puts Harrell under the microscope. It also doesn’t help that he may be the only man on this list with a private life more private than Clive’s.

Joe Budden Confronts Consequence At Hot 97 About Cons Slick Talk Towards Him In Interviews [Video]

Things got extremely awkward recently when Joe Budden crossed paths with Consequence in between their interviews at Hot 97.

The tension between the two “Love & Hip Hop New York” co-stars has been bubbling ever since Cons said some negative things about Joe in interviews with The Breakfast Club and Vlad TV.

While at Hot 97 yesterday Joe confronted Cons to see what all the talk was about. Joe said he wasn’t used to seeing people on a show one day then giving a negative interview about him the next.

Cons placed the blame on Raqi Thunda, saying she had instigated things with disparaging remarks about Joe. Cons also said he was gassed up in the interviews by the hosts which led to him saying slick sh*t about Joe.

Check out the confrontation below. Who backs down in your opinion?

Before Brown punched him, Ocean admitted to excusing Brown of taking his parking spot and not being willing to shake his hand to reconcile.

After taking a blow to the face, the “Novacane” singer told police he found himself in a corner with Brown‘s homies attempting to kick him.

Frank is unsure who made the f*ggot comment, but he did report that Chris threaten to shoot him by saying, “We can bust on you too!”

Overall, Ocean remembers the fight lasting two to three minutes. He endured minor injuries.

On Frank‘s blog he said he has no plans to press charges, however, he did tell the police he wants to see Breezy in jail. Hmmm.

When Meek Mill dropped his Cassidy diss “Repo,” he mentions former Larsiny Family member AR-AB. Meek claimed in the song that Cass never let AR eat, even after he caught a body for him.

In a new video blog, AR backs up Meek’s claims.

While maintaining that he is still cool with Cass, AR says that The Hustla has been lying about his 2005 murder case. AR claims he actually killed Desmond Hawkins, while Cass ran into his house and locked him outside.

“Claim your rape, don’t claim my homicide,” AR says.

When AR returned home from prison he claims Cass only gave him $200 and made him sleep on his couch. AR says he starved the entire time he was with Larsiny Family.



AR further claims that Cass was scared to fight Jim Jones and Gillie Da Kid when they stepped to him.

That’s what Gunplay had to say during a recent interview, refraining from confirming any knowledge of the former the “Bawse” retaining 24-hour security protection.

Here’s what Gunplay had to say:

“He good, he good. Rozay is good, man. He’s unfuckwitable, man. It’s the untouchable Maybach, man. You don’t understand. It’s for real, for real, though.”

Is it possible for someone firing an AK-47 chopper to miss a massive moving target like Rick Ross in a Rolls Royce? I guess so because he’s already winning so why pull a staged drive by it makes no sense.

"http://mrnewswatch.com/here-are-5-arguments-against-for-the-existence-of-god/","Here Are 5 Arguments Against & For The Existence Of God","Religious topics abound on here and they are frequently the most commented upon. It has been some time since the last one so it seems like the time is ripe for another – and this one is a great one for discussion. Here we present five arguments in favor of the existence of God, and the counterargument for it. Feel free to comment on the veracity (or your opinion of) each but remember to keep calm and argue reasonably. After all, it is our ability to be reasonable (rationality) which separates us from the other animals! Note: These all deal with the Judeo-Christian God.

5 Ontological Argument

First formulated by St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, then taken up by Alvin Plantinga. “God exists, provided that it is logically possible for him to exist.”

This argument is quite brazen in its simplicity, requiring not only a belief in God, but a belief in the necessity of God. If you believe he is necessary, then you must believe he exists.

The Counterargument:

Criticism typically deals with the Ontological Argument committing a “bare assertion fallacy,” which means it asserts qualities inherent solely to an unproven statement, without any support for those qualities. It is also criticized as a circular argument, revolving from a premise to a conclusion which relies on the premise, which relies on the conclusion.

4 Moral Argument

This argument is very old, and states that God must exist for the following reason: 1. An aspect of morality is observed. 2. Belief in God is a better explanation for this morality than any alternative. 3. Belief in God is thus preferable to disbelief in God.

The Counterargument:

This argument is technically valid, provided that the three constituents are accepted, and most critics refuse to accept the first. Morality, they argue, is not universal. Murder was perfectly fine for the soldiers of the First Crusade, who slaughtered every man, woman, and child in Jerusalem in 1099. Thomas Hobbes argued that morality is based on the society around it, and is thus not objective.

3 Argument from Degree

This is one of St. Thomas Aquinas’s “Five Proofs of God,” and still causes debate among the two sides. Here is Aquinas’s statement of it, which I have translated from Latin, for a sense of thoroughness:

The fourth proof originates from the degrees discovered in things. For there is discovered greater and lesser degrees of goodness, truth, nobility, and others. But “more” or “less” are terms spoken concerning various things that approach in diverse manners toward something that is the “greatest,” just as in the case of “hotter” approaching nearer the “greatest” heat. There exists, therefore, something “truest,” and “best,” and “noblest,” which, in consequence, is the “greatest” being. For those things which are the greatest truths are the greatest beings, as is stated in Metaphysics Bk. II. 2. Furthermore, that which is the greatest in its way, is, in another way, the cause of all things belonging to it; thus fire, which is the greatest heat, is the cause of all heat, as is said in the same book (cf. Plato and Aristotle). Therefore, there exists something that is the cause of the existence of all things, and of goodness, and of every perfection whatever. We call this “God.”

The Counterargument:

The most prevalent criticism of this argument considers that we do not have to believe in an object of a greater degree in order to believe in an object of a lesser degree. Richard Dawkins, the most famous, or infamous, Atheist around these days, argues that just because we come across a “smelly” object, does not require that we believe that we believe in a “preeminently peerless stinker,” in his words.

2

Argument from Reason

One of my favorites, with very intricate abstraction. C. S. Lewis (who wrote “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe”) came up with this. It begins as an argument from design, and then continues into something new. Very basically, it argues that God must exist, because, in Lewis’s words:

“Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It’s like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can’t trust my own thinking, of course I can’t trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.”

The Counterargument:

It sounds powerful, and the final judgment on it is still out there. But its primary weak point is that, in the strictest sense, it is not a proof of God’s existence because it requires the assumption that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim, and it requires that human minds can be convinced by argumentation.

But in order to reject the assumption that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim, a human mind must assume that this claim is true or false, which immediately proves that human minds can assess the truth or falsehood of a claim.

But none of this has anything to do with God’s existence. Thus, the argument is better treated as a disproof of naturalistic materialism. However, given that most Atheists use naturalistic materialism as the foundation of Atheism, is is a very viable argument.

1 Cosmological Argument

Thomas Aquinas’s most famous proof of God refuses to go away. You’ve probably already heard of it in some form. It was around before Aquinas, at least as early as Plato and Aristotle, and in basic terms, it goes like this:

1. Every finite and contingent being has a cause.

2. Nothing finite and contingent can cause itself.

3. A causal chain cannot be of infinite length.

4. Therefore, a First Cause (or something that is not an effect) must exist.

This is especially impressive in that it was theorized by the Ancient Greeks, at a time when the Universe was not known to have had an origin. Today, we call this “the Big Bang,” and the argument has changed to this form:

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.

2. The Universe began to exist.

3. Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

The Counterargument:

Sequentially speaking, these three points are true. But the second point requires the Universe to have had a cause, and we still aren’t sure it did. “The Big Bang” is the most prevalent astrophysical theory today, but it has its detractors, most arguing that because the mathematics that leads back to a big bang do not function at the point immediately prior to the big bang, those mathematics were invalid to begin with.

Better than this, however, is the argument that this proof of God commits the logical fallacy called “infinite regression.” If the Universe had a first cause, what caused that first cause? Criticism declares that it is unfair to argue for every thing’s cause, and then argue for the sole exception of a “First Cause,” which did not have a cause.

"http://mrnewswatch.com/wesley-snipes-released-from-prison/","Wesley Snipes Released From Prison!","Wesley Snipes Out Of Prison!

Actor Wesley Snipes has reportedly been released from prison since April 2nd…..just in time for tax season!

He will be on house arrest until April 19th.

Story Below:

Wesley Snipes is a free man… mostly. TMZ is reporting that the 50-year-old film actor has been released from prison. According to the popular site, Snipes was released on April 2 and transferred to the New York Community Corrections Office. He will be on house arrest thereafter until July 19.

If my math is correct, that means that Snipes served 845 days (remember 2012 was a leap year) of his three-year sentence. He was originally slated to be released on July 19, 2013, which means he served nearly 90% of his sentence (I’m going to assume some credit for time served and good behavior).

The Wesley Snipes saga began in 2006 when he was accused of tax fraud. He was originally indicted on charges of attempting to claim nearly $12 million in fraudulent tax refunds and not filing any tax returns for several years. Snipes’ first attorney, Billy Martin, said in a statement at the time, “We believe the evidence in the case will show he has been the victim of unscrupulous tax advice. And this trial will help vindicate him.”

The matter did go to trial in 2008. Despite a lengthy list of potential witnesses, and claims that the defense to the trial could take up to a month, the Snipes defense team rested – after less than an hour – without offering any witnesses. The defense felt pretty confident that the government had not proved its burden, saying: “We could have put on a big show, but we don’t do that. We’re not going to waste the jury’s time.” In contrast, the week before, IRS agent Steward Stich testified that Snipes earned almost $40 million in the years 1999 through 2004 and failed to file tax returns or pay any taxes on that income. He also alleged that Snipes also tried to have almost $12 million in taxes paid in prior years 1996 and 1997 refunded to him.

Snipes pleaded not guilty on all counts. He was eventually acquitted of felony federal tax fraud and conspiracy charges. Snipes was, however, convicted of failing to file tax returns from 1999 to 2004, which were misdemeanor charges. He faced up to three years in prison for the failure to file and he received the maximum sentence.

Snipes’ co-defendants and financial/tax “advisors”, Eddie Ray Kahn and Douglas P. Rosile, were convicted by the same jury of tax fraud and conspiracy. Kahn, a former CPA who is no longer allowed to practice in Florida and Ohio, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and Rosile was sentenced to four and half years in prison.

After his conviction, Snipes immediately promised an appeal, which he delivered (more than once) claiming, among other pleadings and filings that his sentence was unreasonable, that his defense was lacking and that he was not able to get a fair trial in “racist” Ocala, Florida, which Snipes had previously referred to as a “hotbed of KKK activity.” He was originally slated to report to prison on June 3, 2008, but that was delayed, pending the outcome of the appeal. His request for a new trial was denied on November 19, 2010, and he subsequently reported to prison on December 9, 2010, at McKean Federal Correctional Institution, in northwest Pennsylvania.

That wasn’t the last of Snipes’ arguments, however. While serving time, Snipes appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 6, 2011, Snipes’ petition for certiorari was denied, which means that the Supreme Court declined to hear the matter. With that, the appeals officially came to an end. Snipes remained in custody until this week.

It’s worth noting that, at the time of the initial allegations, Snipes was filming a movie, “Gallowwalkers” in Namibia. The film, summarized as “[a] cursed gunman (Snipes) whose victims come back from the dead recruits a young warrior to help in the fight against a gang of zombies” was released in the U.K. in 2012 and is scheduled to be released in the U.S. in 2013. No actual release date has been noted (IMDB just says “2013″) and the website for the film remains a blank screen. Likewise, the link to the trailer now says “this video does not exist.” A movie poster was released just last month (you can see it here). Speculation had been building that the release of the film might just coincide with Snipes’ release. I guess now we’ll see.

Keef, real name, Keith Cozart, was accused of moving to Northbrook, Illinois without telling authorities. He was also accused of not checking in with his probation officer since the December 18 release of his debut album, Finally Rich. Prosecutors sought to have the 17-year old locked up pending a full hearing later this month.

Keef’s attorney argued that he had been spending time at the Northbrook home of his manager recording music at the studio there.

After hearing testimony from Keef’s probation officer, Juvenile Court Judge Carl Anthony Walker ruled that there was no “credible evidence” that the rapper had moved to Northbrook according to the Chicago Tribune.

Keef is on on probation after a juvenile conviction for pointing a gun at a police office. He still faces a hearing on on January 28, 2013 for another alleged probation violation for holding a gun during a 2012 interview with Pitchfork at a gun range in New York.

Pitchfork has since taken the video down, but have been ordered by a judge to turn over the footage, as it will be used to determine if Keef should be sent back to juvenile detention for firing weapons.","2013-01-04 00:00:00","0","32.0","26.0","3.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","64.0","41.0","0.0","167.0","7.0","24.0","6","209","97.95","63.11","29.12","5.42","23.22","27.75","72.73","45.93","5.74","2.87","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.87","0.00","2.87","8.61","19.14","7.66","2.87","1.91","1.44","11.96","3.35","1.91","0.00","2.39","0.48","2.87","0.48","2.39","0.48","1.91","0.00","6.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.87","5.26","1.44","1.44","0.96","0.48","0.00","1.91","2.87","0.96","1.91","0.00","0.48","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.09","0.00","0.48","8.13","0.48","0.48","5.74","4.31","0.48","18.18","1.91","8.61","8.13","2.87","1.44","0.96","0.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.00","4.31","4.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.96","0.96","0.00","0.00","993","8.27","23.444444444444443","315","208","9","56.49","13.4","11.1","11.61","13.3","46","7.25","20.08615384615385","136","21.22","0","0.43","0","1","5","21","0","34","6","0","0","2","42","31","0","2","0","0","4","3","5","1","0","3","7","0","5","10","11","11","1","5","0","0","0","0"

See, what happened – supposedly – is Rick Ross used some of the symbols and and logos of the GDs and didn’t pay the required “fees.” When Ross was in Fort Lauderdale, they opened fire with the AK-47!!!!

There’s another theory of a boss out there that wants Rick Ross’ head on a platter but I’m gonna leave that along.

Frank Ocean is expected to move forward with pressing assault charges against Chris Brown — after the recent brawl between the pair(Click Here) broke out at Westlake Recording Studios, Sunday. While Breezy continues to maintain a story of being ambushed, Frank Ocean says Chris threw the first punch.

Now, LAPD is reported to be looking to question Breezy over the incident.

Sources say the tension may have all been sparked over…get this, a parking spot! After the incident, Frank Ocean – who, unlike Chris – remained on scene to speak with responding cops – took to Twitter to talk about the fight.

Here’s what Frank Ocean had to say, wishing his Bernese Mountain Dog “Everest” were there to protect him:

“got jumped by chris and a couple guys. lol. i only wish everest was there.”

Here’s what’s being reported:

“Last night, tensions between Frank Ocean and Chris Brown mounted after the two engaged in a skirmish at a studio in Los Angeles, California. According to NY Post, the Odd Future crooner is looking to press charges against Brown for “punching him and starting an all-out brawl” outside of Westlake Studios. Police claim that Ocean is “desirous of prosecution” and that they’re looking to question Brown, who is on probation until August 2014, stemming from his beating Rihanna in 2009.

Was Frank Ocean advised by higher-ups in the entertainment industry to press charges? Of course. Don’t believe me.. Ask Jay Z.","2013-01-29 00:00:00","0","36.0","20.0","3.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","63.0","41.0","0.0","167.0","7.0","24.0","6","246","97.11","72.89","17.73","25.77","15.38","25.61","75.61","43.50","5.69","2.44","0.81","0.00","0.00","1.63","0.00","3.25","6.50","19.11","7.32","3.25","2.44","0.81","15.85","4.07","2.03","1.63","1.63","1.22","4.07","2.03","2.03","0.81","0.81","0.41","8.94","0.00","0.41","0.00","2.03","6.10","1.22","0.41","2.03","1.22","0.81","1.22","6.50","2.85","2.03","1.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.50","0.41","0.41","3.66","1.63","0.41","4.07","9.35","2.03","15.85","1.63","7.32","7.32","3.66","1.22","1.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.22","0.00","0.81","0.41","0.00","0.00","20.33","6.10","4.88","0.81","0.00","0.41","0.81","0.81","3.66","2.03","0.81","0.00","1160","7.85","16.733333333333334","332","246","14","78.99","9.0","6.6","11.42","10.9","52","7.0","17.49528455284553","162","15.93","3","0.44","0","4","3","21","0","36","8","1","0","1","30","53","0","7","0","0","4","2","8","0","0","1","13","0","13","9","13","9","3","8","0","4","0","0"

If he did, what would have been a routine car accident with no injuries would now be considered a hit-and-run.

Brown and girlfriend Karrueche Tran were riding in Los Angeles on Tuesday May 21st, when Brown rear ended another vehicle. According to TMZ, the singer gave the other driver false insurance information and refused to give her his driver’s license number.



Chris is on probation for assaulting Rihanna in 2009. If the police find that he broke the law by leaving the scene of an accident without fully disclosing all of the information required by law, his probation could be violated. As a result Chris could be sentenced to up to four years in prison.

"http://mrnewswatch.com/dayummmm-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-faces-1-billion-dollar-tax-bill/","DAYUMMMM! Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Faces $1 Billion Dollar Tax Bill","Facebook’s stock market debut left founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg with a paper fortune currently valued at $13 billion — and a 2012 tax bill of around $1.1 billion.

Zuckerberg’s whopping tax hit stems from his move last May to increase his stake in Facebook. On the day of Facebook’s initial public offering, Zuckerberg exercised a stock option and purchased 60 million Facebook shares at a “strike price” of 6 cents each.

Even if those shares are never sold, the IRS treats them as ordinary income at the time the options are exercised. The rationale is that such options are a form of compensation, just like regular wages.

For Zuckerberg, that means reporting income last year of nearly $2.3 billion from his stock options alone. Add together the top 2012 federal tax rate of 35% and the top California rate of 13.3% — the highest in the nation — and you get a total tax rate of 48.3%.

That’s before factoring in some deductions and any other income Zuckerberg collected last year. Only Uncle Sam and California’s tax agency know exactly what’s in Zuckerberg’s return, but three California CPAs that CNNMoney consulted ran the numbers and believe Zuckerberg’s bill for the year will probably exceed $1 billion.

That’s really unusual … even for billionaires.

“With numbers that large, it’s usually capital gains, not ordinary income,” said Toby Johnston, a partner at tax firm Moss Adams LLP‘s Silicon Valley office who works with wealthy clients. Investors profiting off their gains paid a significantly lower tax rate last year than Facebook’s founder will. The highest federal capital gains rate in 2012 was 15%. It goes up to 23.8% (including a Medicare surtax) this year.

The Internal Revenue Service doesn’t comment on the returns of individual taxpayers, but each year it releases aggregate data on the 400 U.S. tax filers with the largest reported incomes. Theaverage top earner had income of $202 million and a federal income tax bill of $41 million for 2009, the most recent data available.

A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on Zuckerberg’s taxes.

To cover the giant bill he knew was coming, Zuckerberg dipped into his trove of Facebook stock. He sold 30.2 million shares during Facebook’s IPO, taking in $1.135 billion. At the time, Facebook said in a regulatory filing that Zuckerberg planned to use the “substantial majority” of those proceeds to cover the taxes on his stock-option purchase.

And Zuckerberg has another big tax hit looming: He is still sitting on 60 million unexercised options that expire in late 2015. At Facebook’s (FB) current share price, those options would generate taxable income of $1.6 billion if he cashed them in. If he cashed then in today at current tax rates, that would amount to a $826 million bill.

The U.S. Treasury will benefit from Zuckerberg’s taxes. So will California, which is getting awindfall as thousands of Facebook employees cash in on stock grants and options. California expects to collect roughly $1.5 billion in tax revenue tied to Facebook’s IPO, according to the latest estimate from the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office.

So how do you pay a tax bill that’s bigger than some nations’ entire annual GDP? (We’re looking at you, Grenada.)

California requires an electronic payment for all tax bills larger than $80,000, but the IRS will take a paper check for any amount.

Watching a sum that big vanish from your bank account sounds scary, right? The flip side is that at least you can afford it.

“Most people are thrilled, to tell you the truth,” said Stan Pollock, a San Francisco area accountant who specializes in handling tax issues for tech workers. “I have had very few clients that get these huge windfalls who have resented paying the tax. They know they got lucky.”","2013-03-29 00:00:00","0","41.0","34.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","70.0","41.0","0.0","166.0","7.0","24.0","6","629","93.57","74.80","16.94","49.44","18.50","25.44","77.90","38.47","8.27","3.66","0.16","0.16","0.95","1.59","0.79","4.61","7.31","13.35","4.93","2.54","3.66","0.48","10.33","4.93","3.34","0.95","6.84","2.86","2.54","1.91","0.64","0.16","0.16","0.32","8.11","0.16","0.16","0.00","1.75","8.27","1.27","0.79","1.11","3.50","0.95","1.91","1.11","0.32","0.79","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","8.11","2.23","1.75","3.18","2.07","0.00","2.38","6.52","1.59","14.63","0.79","8.90","4.93","9.54","1.27","0.00","10.17","0.00","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.24","5.88","3.97","0.16","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.16","1.75","3.50","0.95","2.54","2992","7.76","19.441176470588236","916","630","41","64.3","10.3","8.1","11.19","9.9","134","8.6","16.66793650793651","344","18.09","14","0.39","0","14","50","59","0","77","52","3","6","8","111","70","0","40","0","0","20","7","22","0","1","1","11","0","15","23","15","9","17","16","9","4","0","1"

Plans To Fight Louisiana Charges","Lil Flip is vowing to fight recent drug and gun charges. As we previously reported, the 31-year old Houston rapper was pulled over in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana on December 25, for speeding.

During a search of his 2010 Dodge Challenger, deputies reportedly found weed and a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle. Flip was arrested and booked on charges of third-offense possession of marijuana, possession of a firearm in the presence of a controlled dangerous substance, and speeding

During a new interview with TMZ, Flip said he has a license to carry the weapon, which he claims is not automatic firing and there was no weed in the car. He said police found “Black and Mild” wine flavored cigars and clove cigarettes

Flip, real name Wesley Eric Weston, says he is “not one of those rappers who would carry drugs on me. I know better.”

The rapper also presented TMZ wirh a copy of his concealed handgun license, which he says is also valid in 22 other states, including Louisiana. He said he has been shot before and as an entertainer needs a gun for protection.

“I know they don’t mess around in Louisiana and I wouldn’t do anything to make me go to the big house. Especially on Christmas night,” he told TMZ.

Flip plans on pleading not guilty to all charges.","2013-01-02 00:00:00","0","13.0","17.0","3.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","36.0","30.0","0.0","86.0","5.0","0.0","1","224","85.31","63.97","14.80","6.15","20.36","20.09","74.11","45.54","10.27","7.59","2.23","0.45","0.00","4.46","0.45","2.68","6.70","14.73","6.25","2.23","5.80","2.68","13.39","4.46","2.23","1.34","3.12","0.45","4.46","1.34","3.12","0.45","1.79","0.00","9.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.46","7.14","1.79","0.89","1.34","0.45","0.89","1.79","3.57","0.89","2.23","0.00","2.23","0.00","1.79","0.00","1.34","5.80","0.45","1.34","3.12","0.45","0.89","4.91","7.59","0.45","14.73","2.23","6.70","5.80","3.12","1.79","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.62","4.91","5.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.34","2.68","0.89","0.00","0.00","998","7.78","22.6","309","221","11","67.99","11.6","8.8","10.15","10.9","44","12.75","18.00380090497738","144","20.5","7","0.43","0","9","6","18","0","25","16","0","0","1","33","27","0","9","0","0","15","2","9","0","0","1","5","0","6","12","4","7","6","11","2","1","0","0"

He may be a singer who launched his music career from riding Drake’s coattails, but that doesn’t mean he and Drake remain cool. That’s because this Canuck has proven himself to be a pitiful turncoat. Don’t believe me.. Ask Hyghly Alleyne & Lamar Taylor, who our blind item pretty much left for dead — after refusing to sign with Drake.

Now that he’s left without his boys, surrounded by yes men, it seems that no one has the balls to check our mystery man on his nasty lack of hygiene. Insiders say a string of groupies have filed serious complaints — disappointed with the small size of his penis, and disgusted by his repugnant body odor.

We’re told the Canadian singer seems to have made a uniform out of a pair of black pants and dirty-ass black jacket, sporting the outfit for an entire week!

Here’s what a source had to say about it:

“I saw him perform in Miami December 8, we kicked it. Eight days days later, I saw him in L.A. — and dude stunk, he was wearing the same fucking clothes!”

Sources say his lack of personal hygiene may stem from our blind item’s secret practices of Lebanese black magic. Know why? Because cleanliness is next to Godliness. Don’t believe me.. Ask Ahmad “Swine Belly” Balshe.

His reported fear of the press is what’s said to often lead our mystery man to dodge media members. But that fear could be nothing more than drug-fueled paranoia, with our 22-year-old blind item said to be powdering his nose with cocaine daily.

Now, can you guess who We talking about?

Now, sources say Joe Budden’s ongoing battle with drug addiction could be to blame for his risky choices.

According to New York penal code, anyone age 21 or older who has sexual intercourse with someone under age 17 is committing third degree rape. We’re told Joe Budden and Kaylin Garcia met when his fellow Love & Hip Hop cast member was just 17-years-old, placing her right at the legal limit. Sources say a 13-year age difference remains between the 31-year-old rapper and his now 18-year-old youngster girlfriend. Don’t believe me.. Ask Tahiry.

"http://mrnewswatch.com/states-outlaw-videotaping-of-animal-cruelty/","States Outlaw Videotaping of Animal Cruelty","What kind of society passes laws like these? Well about 12 states in the US, for a start. Richard A. Oppel, Jr. reports for the New York Times:

On one covert video, farm workers illegally burn the ankles of Tennessee walking horses with chemicals. Another captures workers in Wyoming punching and kicking pigs and flinging piglets into the air. And at one of the country’s largest egg suppliers, a video shows hens caged alongside rotting bird corpses, while workers burn and snap off the beaks of young chicks.

Each video — all shot in the last two years by undercover animal rights activists — drew a swift response: Federal prosecutors in Tennessee charged the horse trainer and other workers, who have pleaded guilty, with violating the Horse Protection Act. Local authorities in Wyoming charged nine farm employees with cruelty to animals. And the egg supplier, which operates in Iowa and other states, lost one of its biggest customers, McDonald’s, which said the video played a part in its decision.

But a dozen or so state legislatures have had a different reaction: They proposed or enacted bills that would make it illegal to covertly videotape livestock farms, or apply for a job at one without disclosing ties to animal rights groups. They have also drafted measures to require such videos to be given to the authorities almost immediately, which activists say would thwart any meaningful undercover investigation of large factory farms.

Critics call them “Ag-Gag” bills.

Some of the legislation appears inspired by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a business advocacy group with hundreds of state representatives from farm states as members. The group creates model bills, drafted by lobbyists and lawmakers, that in the past have included such things as “stand your ground” gun laws and tighter voter identification rules.

One of the group’s model bills, “The Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act,” prohibits filming or taking pictures on livestock farms to “defame the facility or its owner.” Violators would be placed on a “terrorist registry.”…","2013-04-08 00:00:00","0","33.0","27.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","64.0","41.0","0.0","166.0","4.0","24.0","6","333","96.10","61.82","11.56","13.56","19.59","29.73","72.07","39.04","6.31","1.50","0.00","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.90","4.80","8.71","13.81","3.00","2.40","6.31","0.30","7.21","3.00","2.10","1.50","3.00","3.00","3.30","1.20","2.10","0.90","0.90","0.30","5.71","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","8.71","1.50","1.50","0.90","3.00","0.30","3.00","4.20","2.70","0.60","0.90","1.20","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.60","8.41","1.80","2.40","5.41","0.30","0.30","2.40","3.30","0.00","10.21","0.60","6.91","2.70","5.11","2.40","0.00","2.40","0.00","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","15.92","5.11","5.41","0.90","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.30","3.00","0.90","0.00","0.00","1681","8.98","24.071428571428573","517","335","15","57.3","13.5","10.8","13.29","14.3","90","7.333333333333334","21.666268656716422","217","22.36","2","0.37","0","16","8","34","0","41","17","1","2","3","50","30","1","53","0","0","4","4","7","0","0","0","7","0","9","12","7","8","10","6","5","2","0","0"

You may remember that he Love & Hip Hop cast member is charged with performing various sexual acts with a 15-year-old girl and inappropriately touching her at his former home in Lodi, New Jersey. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.

Bergen County prosecutors allege that Harris asked for and received oral sex from the girl and fondled her on various occasions between September 2009 and April 2010. He was arrested later that year and charged with aggravated sexual assault, criminal sexual contact and child endangerment.

This news comes one day after sources say Mendeecees Harris Turned Himself In in over outstanding drug charges. Though details surrounding that case remain sketchy, Circuit Court Of Maryland records prove there’s an ongoing case involving Harris and two other charged male suspects.

Mendeecees Harris does have a criminal history in Maryland, dating back to 2001. That’s when the Love & Hip Hop cast member was sentenced to four-years in prison and three-months probation – after being found guilty of distributing cocaine. We can’t confirm if Harris completed that sentence – as those court records appear to be sealed. Sources allege Harris was working with federal authorities.","2013-01-29 00:00:00","0","29.0","18.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","64.0","41.0","0.0","166.0","7.0","24.0","6","210","83.85","84.14","26.00","13.00","19.09","26.67","72.38","37.62","9.05","4.76","0.00","0.48","0.48","3.81","0.00","4.29","3.33","13.33","5.71","1.90","6.19","0.48","9.52","4.76","3.33","0.48","4.29","0.95","2.86","0.95","1.90","0.48","0.95","0.00","11.90","0.00","0.48","2.38","3.33","7.62","1.90","1.43","1.43","1.90","0.95","2.38","1.43","0.48","0.48","0.48","4.76","1.43","0.48","1.90","0.00","8.57","2.86","0.95","5.24","0.00","0.00","4.29","5.24","0.48","18.10","2.38","6.67","10.00","0.95","0.00","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.38","5.24","2.86","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.90","0.00","1.43","0.00","0.95","1065","8.29","19.363636363636363","321","208","11","60.75","12.4","9.5","13.34","12.9","49","8.4","18.983076923076922","152","18.82","0","0.37","0","8","9","10","0","29","18","0","0","2","27","29","0","15","0","0","8","1","5","0","0","0","4","0","6","12","8","8","7","5","1","0","0","1"

Did Chris Brown do the dastardly deed!?

The word on the street is that Christ Brown proposed to Rihanna on New Years. I really don’t know that he did for sure, but it was trending on twitter. Seems that there was a report debunking this rumor, but some said something happened! The pair were apparently all snuggled up in Africa, shining like a pair of blood diamonds. SMH! Anyway, the official world right now is that they are just friends, but I don’t believe that BS and sources maintain that something significant happened as the new year rang in.

Chris’ Ex And Teyanna Taylor Were Seen Kissing!

On the flip side, Chris’ ex and his rumored jump off were reportedly out there kissing and making out on new years! YEP! Teyanna Taylor and…freaking Karrueche. Had to google Karrueche’s name just to know how to spell it. Anyway, there are a couple instagram pics floating. Here are some.

"http://mrnewswatch.com/what-pat-robertson-says-ugly-looking-women-are-to-blame-for-marital-problems/","WHAT?! Pat Robertson Says ‘Ugly-Looking’ Women Are To Blame For Marital Problems","Pat Robertson said that “awful-looking” women are to blame for a romance-deficient marriages.

It all started when a 17-year-old boy wrote to Maxim magazine asking for advice on how to get his videogame-loving dad to pay more attention to his mom. Robertson decided to offer the teen some advice of his own during a recent episode of the Christian Broadcasting Network’s “700 Club.”

“It may be your mom isn’t as sweet as you think she is,” said the 82-year-old. “She may be kind of hard-nosed.”

Robertson then went on to to say that “awful-looking” women can be to blame for certain marital problems:

A woman came to a preacher that I know, and she was awful looking. I mean, her hair was all torn up and she was overweight and looked terrible, clothes bad and everything. And she said, ‘Oh, Reverend, what can I do? My husband has started to drink.’ And the preacher looked at her and said, ‘Madam, if I was married to you I’d start to drink too.’ We need to cultivate romance, darling! … You always have to keep that spark of love alive. It just isn’t something to just lie there, ‘Well, I’m married to him so he’s got to take me slatternly looking.’ You’ve got to fix yourself up, look pretty.

This is not the first time Robertson has blamed women’s appearances for marital problems.

As Think Progress notes, during a 2010 episode of “The 700 Club,” a caller asked Robertson how to get her husband to stop flirting with other women.

“First thing is you need to make yourself as attractive as possible and don’t hassle him about it,” the Christian televangelist said. “And why is he doing this? Well, he’s doing it because he wants affirmation that he is still a man, that he is attractive — and he gets an affirmation of himself … But you need to not drive him away or start hassling and hounding on him, but make yourself as beautiful as you can, as fun as you can, and say let’s go out here, let’s go there, let’s go to the other thing.”

He has also joked about wife-beating as a means of gaining respect, the New York Daily News notes.

Robertson has been married to his wife, Adelia “Dede,” since 1954.

It was only two days ago that Carney kept questioning “if” reports of the IRS targeting conservatives were true — despite the IRS itself having admitted it. And just last week TV viewers and the press watched Carney turn red while repeating a long-debunked lie about Benghazi that received four Pinocchios from the Washington Post.

So is today the best day for Carney to start spouting “FACT”?

Maybe he’ll ask acting commissioner Steven Miller to stay on and give him a bonus. And forget about abolishing the IRS — it just needs more money and attention.

The New York Times has decided to have a look at that Cincinnati office where those rogue “low-level employees” were targeting Tea Party groups for harassment and apparently was given the grand tour. (It’s a shame that no one could find a key to let USA Today’s reporter into the public reading room at IRS headquarters.) So what’s going on in there?

NYT on IRS Cincinnati office. Understaffed outpost alienated from broader #IRS culture & given little direction. http://t.co/trkER6iThc — Jim Roberts (@nycjim) May 18, 2013

Wow, an “understaffed outpost alienated from broader IRS culture and given little direction”? It sounds like Siberia, not Ohio, which “many in the IRS consider a backwater.” Oh, and not only was the office understaffed: “Few if any of the employees were experts on tax law, contributing to waves of questionnaires about groups’ political activity and donors that top officials acknowledge were improper.” Morton Blackwell wasn’t far off when he compared the IRS to Kermit Gosnell’s clinic.

The article goes on and on, and we confess we didn’t get to the part where we’re supposed to feel bad for anyone other than the groups that were targeted. We’re told, though, that the Washington Post also did a profile of that Ohio backwater, and its take is even “grittier.”

In fact, let’s just add “umbrella” to the Big Book of Racial Code Words. It was bad enough when rank-and-file right wingers (like Howard Kurtz) noted the unbelievably bad optics of President Obama summoning a pair of Marines to hold umbrellas over him and the Turkish prime minister. “They’re gonna look good next to us,” he improvised.

We know that conservatives don’t understand metaphor, but even Sarah Palin couldn’t overlook the timing of the president calling in the Marines for shelter following a week of scandals, including testimony from Benghazi whistleblowers who testified to being abandoned while under attack. Wrote Palin, “glad you finally called in the Marines … shame it was just to hold your umbrella.” Did Palin know her criticism was necessarily driven by racism? Because there’s no other explanation.

Instead, he announced the resignation of the acting commissioner, who was already headed for the exit. As much as he’d like that largely symbolic move to settle the matter, the idea of getting rid of the IRS altogether is picking up steam.

Rupert Murdoch pitched in by calling for the elimination of all deductions, but as others pointed out, that really would do nothing to address the current scandal.

So if anyone wants to know what difference does it make, anyone wants to ask what difference does it make, it always matters whether or not you can trust your government.

What difference does it make, Hillary? It makes all the difference in the world.

We already pointed out one false claim made by the @BarackObama Twitter account about the SSA analysis.

Now we can add another. Yesterday, @BarackObama asserted that SSA “says #ImmigrationReform will add 3.2 million jobs.”

As Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute notes, however, this claim is untrue:

[T]he actuaries do no modeling of the economy or the job market. They simply assume that new immigrants will find jobs and pay taxes; if the immigration reform brought in twice as many immigrants, SSA would assume they find jobs, too. Their memo doesn’t say that immigration reform creates new jobs and certainly doesn’t say that immigration reform will create new jobs for native-born Americans. The extra jobs assumed by the actuaries all belong to immigrants.

As for the claim that amnesty will increase GDP, Biggs addresses that too:","2013-05-14 05:04:55","0","22.0","5.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","60.0","19.0","0.0","131.0","0.0","12.0","8","162","83.63","68.92","10.82","81.41","18.00","27.16","74.69","40.74","8.64","3.70","0.00","1.23","0.00","0.62","1.85","4.94","8.64","10.49","6.17","4.32","4.94","1.85","11.73","4.32","1.85","0.00","2.47","3.70","3.09","3.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.62","10.49","4.94","2.47","1.23","3.09","1.23","1.85","1.85","0.00","1.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.02","3.70","1.23","0.62","1.23","1.23","3.09","8.02","2.47","8.64","1.23","1.85","5.56","11.11","0.62","0.00","3.70","0.00","0.00","0.62","0.00","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.28","4.94","4.32","1.23","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.62","1.23","1.23","0.00","3.09","815","8.77","20.625","259","160","10","55.24","13.0","9.5","13.4","11.7","44","6.285714285714286","19.400000000000002","107","17.62","5","0.39","0","3","4","18","0","22","12","0","0","6","23","21","1","15","0","0","5","0","8","0","0","1","1","0","7","3","0","3","6","6","0","0","0","0"

Michael Moore found something he liked about today’s dedication ceremony at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, and it’s no surprise it was Jimmy Carter’s flashback to an alternative future where Al Gore still had a chance to become president. Note Moore’s insistence on putting the word “library” in quotation marks — they probably don’t even have a single copy of “Dude, Where’s My Country” to check out. Besides, Bush can’t even read; right, Albert Brooks?

The hoaxes are still hoaxes, and the school will continue to treat them as real:

These actions were real. The fear and disruption they caused in our community were real. While Oberlin College takes great pride in its historic and ongoing commitment to diversity, inclusion, and respectful discussion of ideas, we draw the line at threats and harassment of any kind.

That statement, issued by the school’s communications staff, was inspired by speculation on the web that “the perpetrators engaged in these actions merely to provoke a reaction from our community.” In other words, yes, it was a hoax, and it was disruptive: the school canceled classes and convened a “day of solidarity” in response to “a report of a person in a costume meant to evoke the Ku Klux Klan.” That was revealed later to have been a student wrapped in a blanket — but the blanket was real.

The answer is yes. “Oberlin was aware that the main perpetrator stated he was doing this only to get a reaction from campus,” writes William A. Jacobson, citing police reports. “Everything in that perpetrator’s background would have supported that he was not racist. He led a high school group supporting Obama’s election, a fact he almost certainly put on his Oberlin application, and had run a sign up table for the Obama campaign.”","2013-08-24 18:31:34","0","44.0","11.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","83.0","22.0","0.0","138.0","0.0","20.0","9","434","89.12","71.00","6.66","51.65","20.67","26.73","69.35","41.94","9.22","3.69","0.23","0.69","0.23","2.07","0.46","5.53","8.76","11.29","6.68","2.07","4.38","0.92","10.37","2.53","0.92","1.15","2.30","0.92","5.53","3.46","2.07","0.69","1.15","0.00","7.14","0.00","0.23","0.69","1.61","8.76","3.23","2.07","0.46","0.69","1.38","1.15","1.15","0.92","0.00","0.23","0.92","0.69","0.46","0.00","0.00","5.76","2.07","0.23","3.00","0.69","0.23","6.22","4.15","0.46","9.91","1.15","4.15","4.61","4.84","0.23","0.23","0.23","0.00","0.00","1.15","0.23","0.46","0.46","0.00","0.00","24.65","4.61","5.07","0.92","0.00","0.46","0.46","0.46","4.15","1.84","2.30","4.38","2094","8.45","27.0","658","428","21","59.23","12.7","10.1","12.88","13.3","103","8.9","19.786168224299065","265","23.62","6","0.42","2","13","10","42","1","44","36","0","0","3","84","55","1","26","0","0","16","5","10","0","0","3","10","0","12","27","5","13","5","5","1","3","0","2"

And while others like Sally Kohn spun Gosnell’s conviction as a sign that abortion could now get back on track as safe and affordable, Sen. Ted Cruz issued a statement clarifying that more abortions is not the solution to preventing more Gosnells.

No court can ever provide proper relief for the unimaginable pain that Kermit Gosnell inflicted on women and their children. His atrocities shed light on the truly gruesome acts of late-term abortion. We need to keep working to prevent such crimes against humanity — deliberate infanticide — from happening again. May we all remember this heart-breaking case as a vivid example of the urgent need to protect innocent human life at all stages.

Senator @MarcoRubio Statement On The First Degree Murder Conviction Of Kermit Gosnell: http://t.co/zEM7xrgBzy — Senator Rubio Press (@SenRubioPress) May 13, 2013

The first degree murder conviction of Kermit Gosnell brings some closure to this horrific case, but we must act to address the broader problems highlighted by this tragedy. Congress should conduct a thorough investigation into the practices of late-term abortions in America with the goal of ensuring that these atrocities are never repeated in the future. My wife, Jeanette, and I hold the victims of Mr. Gosnell’s violent abuses in our prayers. While the lives lost and ruined because of a monster like Kermit Gosnell can never be recovered, we must strive to ensure that women and unborn children don’t fall prey in the future to greedy and overzealous abortion doctors. Life is precious at every stage, and America’s policies must reflect this fact at every turn.

Qadri has been active in Pakistan since the 1980s but has lived in Canada for about a decade and has become a naturalized Canadian citizen. He returned to Pakistan in December to demand that the government step down and the military appoint an interim leader to implement reforms.

Also today, the Pakistani Supreme Court ordered the arrest of Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf on corruption charges, so things look to be moving very quickly in that part of the world.

Obama’s team thought US might win Iran’s support against Syria","Why, you might ask, would Iran abandon its ally Syria and side with the United States against Bashar al-Assad? As U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power told the liberal Center for American Progress, “we thought perhaps a shared evidentiary base could convince Russia or Iran — itself a victim of Saddam Hussein’s monstrous chemical weapons attacks in 1987-1988 — to cast loose a regime that was gassing its people.”

In other words, Iran didn’t like it when they were being gassed, so of course they wouldn’t want Syrians being gassed either.

Surprising absolutely no one except Power and her U.N. team, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei sternly warned the U.S. against launching an attack. “The Americans try to play with words and pretend that they’ve become involved in this case for humanitarian aims,” he said. “The Americans are making mistakes in Syria and they have felt the impact and will certainly suffer loss.”

Sadly, it seems that Kelly is still clinging to the debunked myth that “violent rhetoric” from Sarah Palin’s political action committee was responsible for the shooting of his wife, Gabrielle Giffords. This, specifically:

The connection between Sarah Palin and Jared Loughner was a fiction propagated by talking heads like Keith Olbermann and eventually picked up by President Obama himself, who insisted it is “important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds.” This is the same president who would later note that “voting is the best revenge” and urged Latinos to “punish our enemies.”

So, does Kelly only pop up when Palin speaks?

Allison Kilkenny wrote a piece commemorating the anniversary for The Nation, concluding that Occupy has thrived because the same conditions that inspired the movement are still with us today: the “rich are richer, the corrupt live without fear of going to jail, and everyone knows institutions aren’t coming to save us.” Conservatives, at least, have known for a long time not to wait around for the government to save us.

One other thing hasn’t changed either is the pure entertainment value of Occupy. Kilkenny today headed to New York’s Zuccotti Park, the epicenter of the movement, to capture the occasion in photos. The “Fight for 15” crowd, a new arrival in the last two years, occupied the sidewalk in front of McDonald’s with “A livable job is a right” signs.

"https://twitchy.com/jessem-34/2013/05/02/pope-francis-implies-that-capitalism-causes-unemployment/","Pope Francis implies that capitalism causes unemployment","In a not-so-veiled attack on capitalism, Pope Francis tweeted this morning that his thoughts were with “all who are unemployed, often as a result of a self-centred mindset bent on profit at any cost.”

Some conservatives said that the Pope’s remarks were probably directed at Bangladesh factories that pay very low wages and provide dangerous working conditions.

Take a deep breath. The Pope was probably referring to slave labor, like he condemned yesterday. http://t.co/2rwsIb58IL — RBe (@RBPundit) May 2, 2013

@keder Did you even read the context? http://t.co/od9Nu0L1VA Just stop. — Allie Lee (@AllieLeela) May 2, 2013

Seriously. STFU people. Understand the CONTEXT before you insist on making the Pope a Marxist. — Mary Chastain (@mchastain81) May 2, 2013

Other conservatives disagreed with that assessment:

Given the 140 character limit, the Pope should be given the benefit of the doubt. But his tweet can easily be read as Marxist claptrap. — Kevin (@keder) May 2, 2013

Capitalism has been under assault the world over for quite some time now. It's due for a robust defense, in my humble estimation. — Kevin (@keder) May 2, 2013

Speaking as a Catholic who left the church over the far-left social justice teachings in the United States, I'm with @keder on this one. — LMR (@LilMissRightie) May 2, 2013

We are too. The plain language of the tweet indicates the Pope was talking about unemployed people, not employed factory workers in Bangladesh.

The Pope made similar remarks yesterday on the radio, after he finished talking about poor working conditions in Bangladesh. Near the bottom of this article, Agence France Presse said he was apparently talking about unemployment in Europe:

He spoke of “labour market difficulties in various countries” — an apparent reference to the unemployment crisis afflicting Europe. Unemployment is often caused by “an economic conception of society based on selfish profit outside the bounds of social justice,” he said. [Emphasis added.]

If he was talking about European unemployment yesterday, it stands to reason that’s what his tweet (nearly identical to what he said yesterday) was about today.

More context:

The liberal National Catholic Reporter says that “Bergoglio has supported the social justice ethos of Latin American Catholicism, including a robust defense of the poor…” and approvingly quotes him as saying, “We live in the most unequal part of the world, which has grown the most yet reduced misery the least. The unjust distribution of goods persists, creating a situation of social sin that cries out to Heaven and limits the possibilities of a fuller life for so many of our brothers.” … [T]he age old answer to the question, “Is the Pope Catholic?” is, “Yes.” But the answer to the question, “Is the Pope capitalist?” is, “Probably not.”

Here’s someone who thinks the Pope got it exactly right:

+1 RT @Pontifex: My thoughts turn to all who are unemployed, often as a result of a self-centred mindset bent on profit at any cost. — Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) May 2, 2013

Alas, high unemployment in Europe is caused not by ruthless capitalism but by government regulations that strangle capitalism. Like Bill Gates says, nations grow rich if they embrace capitalism.

Don’t be like that! It’s gonna be great — like the bureau of motor vehicles, but you get to go when you’re sick. And plenty of people are already getting to enjoy saying goodbye to their insurance agents, as their insurance companies are dropping their policies because of Obamacare.

Harry Reid tells GOP to ‘grow up,’ swallow Obamacare and move on","“It’s time for Republicans to mature,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says in a new tweet. For good measure, the graphic his office has put together even spells out “Grow Up” in building blocks. It’s a cute idea, but we have to take issue with Reid’s idea that “it’s time to move on” is the message to take from what Americans are saying loudly and clearly.

An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released just this week, for example, shows that one-third of Americans who already have health insurance believe they’ll be worse off under Obamacare, while among the uninsured, 76 percent said they don’t understand the law and how it affects them.

But if polls aren’t Harry Reid’s thing, the American people did speak loudly and clearly on Obamacare on Sept. 12, 2009, and it looked like this.

All these unprecedented military exercises in our urban areas, are they even legal?*

Someone like you and me, a concerned (sovereign) citizen of the USA, took the bull by the horns to collect and collate the published accounts of them.

They are so pervasive that it looks less and less like training exercises for the purpose of letting our military become familiar with operating in urban areas overseas. It has begun, by the signature of the behaviors themselves, to seem more and more like exercises for the following purposes.

To:

Make actual military operations within the United States seem more “normal” to our own, patriotically motivated military personnel. Record the names of those in military or police services, or in other government positions, who question this behavior, or who are noted to have qualms, or object vs. those who are gung-ho for it. Perform profiling and psychographic studies, based upon this information. Familiarize our military of the ins and outs of operations specific to each “urban zone” city in our nation. Condition American citizens of all kinds to the “new normal” of our military operating for the sake of authoritarian government, against our people (especially patriot activists) who may be labeled “suspected terrorists” – by fiat, without our 4th and 14th Amendment rights, of protection against unreasonable search and seizure, of habeas corpus, and due process overall (see NDAA 2012 and 2013 and these reports in Gulag Bound: A, which includes a report of Obama administration indoctrination of the traits of a suspected terrorist, plus B and C, and in one of numerous examples, in NetworkWorld, Eric Holder’s FBI brochure propagating their traits of a suspected terrorist: D). Prepare for massive firearm confiscations and the resultant resistance from the patriotic Americans, ready, willing, and able to obey the mandate of the Declaration of Independence and the purpose of the 2nd Amendment: to if necessary, “throw off” government which has become “despotism,” by means of free, “well regulated militias.” Provoke our freely armed patriots who heed the stern mandate of our Declaration and Constitution as referred in #5, to be engaged in free, well-regulated militias (and/or, whatever few kooks are really out there) into taking action which could become, in turn, actionable by national or nationalized, anti-American forces (see Waco, Ruby Ridge, etc.). Could this be, too? To do #6 as a pretext for further false-flag attacks, which would give Obamunist/NWO led forces pretext for martial law. (We have written about false-flag ploys, hypothetically, here.) Test for repercussions and blow-back in general, right down to this article (see #2).

And to confirm just how it looks, those military exercises are, in at least some cases, being made jointly with police forces. It would be silly to think that even the Obamunist DHS would try to send our police overseas. They (our government) do purport something of a reason for some of this. They say it is for disaster preparation, nuclear war, for example – even as they target as “suspected terrorists” those “preppers” who prepare for disasters. “Go figure.”

So now, We the People have to do just that: go to the information and figure out what it means, together.

Here is the list in Facebook, compiled by my new friend, Nanette White, who publishes Michigan’s News & Views. Below it, we re-publish the Gary Franchi interview with Dr. Jim Garrow, of January 23rd, which attests to key military officers being asked whether or not they will fire on U.S. Citizens who refuse to give up their firearms.

Nanette also listed this:

I found this on [Pittsburgh] PA, but it looks to be more normal to me.. no blackhawks, etc.

And I will add a related, goose-bumping item that just bubbled up, as I have been preparing this article:

“Exposed: Obama’s Ploy to Disarm Veterans Obama’s Deputized Doctors to Label Veterans Mentally Unfit to Own a Gun,” January 31, at gopthedailydose.com

The world has become one monstrous economic bubble bath right now. At any moment the super-corrupt, global central banking system has any number of means of setting off a bubble-breaking chain reaction that would potentially throw the United States of America and much of the world into chaos. It is labeled “mutually assured economic destruction,” by the intelligentsia of the elite.

History in the 20th Century and at least as far back as the Illuminist-seminal French Revolution has shown us that Marxists/fascists (including the likes of front man, George Soros) need massive “disruption,” as Frances Fox Piven calls it, in order to foment their revolutions. Marxism is not called “conflict theory” in vain and the hungrier, more desperate, and more embittered their manipulated revolutionary “proletariat,” the better. And to borrow a phrase from Hillary Clinton, “what difference [would] it make,” whether the ensuing martial law is feigned to be on the side of the rioters, as it is in a classic Marxist revolution, or those seeking security from them, as it might be seen in a more fascistic revolution? Either way, the end result is the same: the iron-fisted grip of collectivist authoritarianism.

The reader may need to take a deep breath for more reasons than one. A long question is coming, next.

Without this being quite a complete “big picture” list…

…it all points in what direction, from where we have been for 237 years?

State control is the goal and as is demonstrated in China and Russia, the statist corporatism which was the heart of the 20th Century’s fascism is now the neo in neo-Marxism. Whether one calls it Marxofascism, or globalist crony capitalism, or the “New World Order” as communist collaborator, John Kerry did in his Secretary of State confirmation hearings, or as Barack Obama referred in his second inaugural, a bridge from the Declaration principle (of popular sovereignty and subservient government) into collectivism… there is only one direction to go, from freedom.

And now, what direction does Nanette’s list indicate?

Are we asking our members of Congress this question? – and our local sheriffs?

And any family and friends in our military and law enforcement services – are we asking them if they are Oath Keepers?

The same with veterans, are we asking them if they know about Veteran Defenders of America, for instance?

And are we informing our neighbors, individually, or organizationally?

And how about that Second Amendment and its first six words?

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

More about that, soon.

One last thought before the video – is this part of the reason for the out-of-the-blue announcement of women now being readied for combat situations? Are the Obamunists preparing to prop up America’s own young ladies to be among those facing or aggressing upon our very citizens? Just think of the ramifications, there. Consider the warped mentality of this regime.

TONIGHT 09/12 09:00PM CDT “Special Guest, Arlen Williams”

TONIGHT, we are glad to announce our special guest Arlen Williams who has held strong during the patriot movement.

Arlen states: “In addition to publishing and editing Gulag Bound: I have over twenty years in information technology sales and marketing, along with significant work in electoral organizing and some campaign management, for the sake of candidates who respect America’s core principles of Natural Rights and Natural Law.

I am in process of establishing Sovereignty Unbound and its Sovereignty Campaign, in order to teach these principles and evaluate politicians and candidates based on their support of popular sovereignty under God, with state and national sovereignty to guard it.” He continues, “The aim of this is not to supplant any organization, but to better inform them and individuals about this essential matter, so that we can reset America upon its core principles, reflected in our Declaration of Independence, which must always be regarded as the inextricable basis for the United States Constitution.” In which, we here at the, “The End Within” say Amen and are pleased to welcome Arlen to the show.","2013-09-12 20:42:40","1","18.0","6.0","15.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","120.0","95.0","0.0","83.0","0.0","6.0","0","192","90.57","81.20","20.92","97.42","38.40","29.69","77.08","45.31","10.94","5.21","1.04","2.60","0.00","0.52","1.04","5.73","4.17","18.23","4.69","1.56","6.77","0.52","7.29","6.25","1.04","2.08","2.08","1.04","5.21","5.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.85","0.00","1.04","0.00","0.52","7.81","2.08","1.56","0.52","1.56","1.56","1.04","1.04","0.52","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.02","3.12","1.04","8.33","0.52","0.52","0.52","6.77","1.04","13.02","0.52","7.29","4.17","5.21","0.52","0.00","1.04","1.04","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.15","2.60","6.77","1.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.17","0.52","0.00","0.52","982","9.68","64.33333333333333","301","190","5","32.91","17.8","18.1","14.46","22.9","50","16.333333333333332","27.726315789473684","136","52.33","6","0.45","0","11","5","13","0","27","11","1","0","2","29","28","1","11","0","0","8","5","4","0","0","0","8","0","9","0","2","5","6","3","2","2","0","0"

The Duck Commander, Phil Robertson of Duck Dynasty, isn’t backing down and he is standing by his statements, while standing strong in his faith. Perhaps the Leftists could borrow his spine for a bit and maybe actually get in touch with what little soul they have left to experience what being a brave Christian actually feels like. Nope – too much to ask of a craven and cowardly Marxist. You see, Robertson can’t be brought into line. He doesn’t give a crap about the money, the fame, the trappings of Hollywood. His family won’t betray him, neither will his church nor will his hometown of Monroe. I believe he knew exactly what he was doing and that he planned the delivery of a message to Christians – grow a set and put on the armor of your faith and fight for it. Love thine enemy, while defeating them in the culture war.

I would like to know what is so very controversial about standing by your religious beliefs? The Left is hot to defend Islam. Hell, they’ll defend Satanists, Atheists, Wiccans and Druids, but Christians they would prefer to burn at the stake. The Christian faith has room for all and preaches love thy neighbor. It teaches tolerance, kindness and forgiveness. But it also states what is and what is not a sin. In the Bible, homosexuality is a sin. Phil Robertson is a lover, not a hater and has stated he will leave the judgment of others up to God. Which is more than Islam does — last time I looked they hanged, stoned and generally just murdered Gays. Seems to me that the Left attacks Christians so often and so much because they are threatened by them. Christians remind them that there is evil vs. good in the world and that there is wrong and right. That does not mesh with their world view, their agenda and their goals of Marxism and control. Go figure.

Robertson stated an opinion in a GQ interview with an A&E representative present. It was not on air and under the Constitution he has a right to say what he believes. Contractually, A&E can do what they are allowed and want to do. That is their right. And it would seem they have reconsidered. I love the smell of grovelling in the morning:

After the Robertson family announced publicly that it would be unthinkable for them to continue with the top rated show without their patriarch Phil Robertson, the suits at A&E and Disney, who owns them seem to have had a change of heart…especially after feeling the heat from their viewers, ( a ‘boycott A&E’ Facebook page received over 1.5 million likes in a matter of a couple of days) and very likely after consulting with their lawyers about what their violation of Robertson’s civil and First Amendment rights was likely to cost them in court.

Next up, Cracker Barrel:

Dear Cracker Barrel Customer: When we made the decision to remove and evaluate certain Duck Dynasty items, we offended many of our loyal customers. Our intent was to avoid offending, but that’s just what we’ve done. You told us we made a mistake. And, you weren’t shy about it. You wrote, you called and you took to social media to express your thoughts and feelings. You flat out told us we were wrong. We listened. Today, we are putting all our Duck Dynasty products back in our stores. And, we apologize for offending you. We respect all individuals right to express their beliefs. We certainly did not mean to have anyone think different. We sincerely hope you will continue to be part of our Cracker Barrel family.

Too late, we all saw you with your politically correct knickers around your ankles guys. Both A&E and Cracker Barrel evidently will follow the rainbow when it benefits them and revert to flyover country and the riffraff when it hurts their wallets. When you follow the applause and not your conscience, you wind up alone, broke and empty like the broken vessels you are. When you embrace political correctness, evil and tyranny, there is always a price to pay. Always.

Phil Robertson has a Master’s degree in Education. His family now is worth over 400 million. This is a man that has seen it all and changed his life. He is a Godly man and a good man. In short, he is everything the Left hates. Today, he spoke out in a defiant prayer at the end of his Bible study class: ‘I will not give or back off from my path because you conquered death, Father, so we are not worried about all the repercussions.’

Does that strike you as someone who gives a rip about what the Left thinks of him? He has no use for the elitists and for those who wish to control others. He answers to only one – God Himself. Let me share some of what Phil had to say today when speaking to his church (wearing camo I might add):

‘I have been immoral, drunk, high. I ran with the wicked people for 28 years and I have run with the Jesus people since and the contrast is astounding. ‘I tell people, “You are a sinner, we all are, do you want to hear my story before I give you the bottom line on your story?” ‘We murder each other and we steal from one another, sex and immorality goes ballistic. All the diseases that just so happen to follow sexual mischief… boy there are some microbes running around now. ‘Sexual sins are numerous and many, I have a few myself. So what is your safest course of action? If you’re a man, find yourself a woman, marry them and keep your sex right there. ‘You can have fun, but one thing is for sure, as long as you are both healthy in the first place, you are not going to catch some debilitating illness, there is safety there. ‘Commonsense says we are not going to procreate the human race unless we have a man and a woman. From the beginning Jesus said, “It is a man and a woman.” Adam was made and Eve was made for this reason. They left their fathers and mothers and be united to become one flesh, that’s what marriage is all about. ‘But we looked at it and said it was an outdated stereotype. When you look back at the human race, the sins have always been the same, we get high, we get drunk, we get laid, we steal and kill. ‘Has this changed at all from the time God burnt up whole cities because their every thought was evil?’ […] ‘The acts of the sinful nature are obvious. Sexual immorality, is number one on the list. How many ways can we sin sexually? My goodness. You open up that can of worms and people will be mad at you over it. ‘I am just reading what was written over 2000 years ago. Those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom. All I did was quote from the scriptures, but they just didn’t know it. Whether I said it, or they read it, what’s the difference? The sins are the same, humans haven’t changed. ‘If you give them the bad news, they’ll start kicking and screaming. But you love them more than you fear them, so you tell them. ‘A lot of times they don’t even wait for you to finish and say, ‘But there’s a way out, do you want to hear the rest of the story or what? ‘Jesus will take sins away, if you’re a homosexual he’ll take it away, if you’re an adulterer, if you’re a liar, what’s the difference? If you break one sin you may as well break them all. ‘If we lose our morality, we will lose our country. It will happen. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could all walk around without stealing from each other and killing each other. ‘Why don’t we just love each other enough that we wouldn’t want to do these things to each other?’ […] ‘We are a bunch of rednecks from Louisiana, but I am not uneducated, I have a degree from Louisiana Tech. ‘But this week I have been called an ignoramus. This week I have been asked, “Is this the first time you have brought up sin?” I said, “Are you kidding? I have been traveling to and fro spreading this message.” ‘Then he said, “Well do you invite yourself to go and get your Bible and tell people what you are now sharing with us.” I said, “No they are inviting me.” ‘I have made hundreds and hundreds of speeches and you can pick them apart and the centre has always been Jesus Christ. ‘Do many people get up and walk out? Yeah, all the time, do I hold it against them? No. Anybody can get up and stop listening. We are all just humans on this planet.’ ‘Jesus Christ was the most perfect being to ever walk this planet and he was persecuted and nailed to the cross, so please don’t be surprised when we get a little static.’

It’s not just Phil… his whole family are Christians. In fact, the majority of Americans are Christians and those that are not weak-kneed are applauding Phil. We can feel a great awakening taking place and a resurgence among the faithful. The Left might do well to remember, that being a Christian does not equate with being weak. Just the opposite as history has proven over and over again.

Phil’s eldest son, Pastor Alan, spoke to the over 1,000 gathered in the church and he made reference to the nationwide attention the family has been under: ‘Well we’ve had a quite a quiet week, shot some ducks, done some shopping, ignited a national controversy,’ he said. I, for one, think the clash of culture is long overdue.

Phil with Wife Kay Robertson

My friend, Larry Correia, had this to say in an epic post on the subject:

Notice, no where in the article did Robertson urge persecution of gays in any way, shape, or form. He gave his honest answer about his personal religious belief. Disapproval of a particular behavior or choice should not be any skin off your nose. (you want to see real disapproval, be me and start talking about how Barack Obama has done a crappy job at a publishing industry dinner party in Manhattan. Good times.) Of course, if you just listen to the internet and don’t read the article, you’d think the guy was in a white hood telling everybody to burn gay folks at the stake, but instead you get stuff like this: “We’re Bible-thumpers who just happened to end up on television,” he tells me. “You put in your article that the Robertson family really believes strongly that if the human race loved each other and they loved God, we would just be better off. We ought to just be repentant, turn to God, and let’s get on with it, and everything will turn around.” Or here is another quote from this vile hate monger. “However, I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all humanity. We would be better off if we loved God and loved each other.” Feel the hate. How it burns. Won’t somebody stand up to this madman and his cismale gendernormative fascism! I’m willing to bet that Phil Robertson is nicer and more tolerant of homosexuals than the caring liberals who keep sending me death threats because I’m an outspoken conservative are. Yet I still realize that the vast majority of liberals are normal people who aren’t having screaming freak outs even if they disagree with my choices, so you guys need to realize that the vast majority of Christians are normal people who aren’t having screaming freak out even if they disagree with your choices. Everybody is a victim of someone’s disapproval, so grow the f**k up.

Agreed. These guys really need to get a life and stop being so emo.

The show had already taped the fourth season with Phil in it. A&E now says that Phil will be back for the fifth season. Then, I believe, their contract is up. I can hear TheBlaze calling… I would wager another network is in the future for the Duck Commander and family. One that embraces Constitutional rights, religious beliefs and true tolerance.

One thing can be said to A&E and Cracker Barrel though: verily, it is a clusterduck.","2013-12-22 20:29:22","1","6.0","3.0","0.0","0.0","10.0","0.0","102.0","95.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","0.0","1","2139","43.69","90.77","20.84","20.14","15.84","15.57","88.55","56.38","17.11","11.41","2.15","2.38","3.04","1.73","2.10","5.70","7.25","11.45","10.57","4.63","7.15","1.96","18.23","3.60","1.64","1.96","1.40","2.76","6.45","2.99","3.37","0.28","1.17","0.28","16.22","0.75","0.37","0.23","2.48","11.87","2.29","1.40","1.78","2.34","1.92","3.97","2.62","0.56","1.31","0.61","2.06","0.42","0.33","0.61","0.23","9.16","4.11","0.70","2.76","1.45","0.65","4.07","12.11","1.36","11.22","1.68","6.03","3.60","1.12","1.08","0.47","0.61","2.99","0.37","0.79","0.28","0.23","0.09","0.19","0.00","17.53","5.98","5.28","0.37","0.00","0.65","0.05","0.09","2.01","2.20","0.23","0.65","9047","6.79","17.860655737704917","2810","2131","131","80.31","9.2","6.1","8.18","7.6","317","7.666666666666666","14.470258094791177","815","15.81","49","0.55","0","99","24","208","0","210","121","4","2","38","268","154","11","79","3","0","215","50","117","1","1","13","54","0","116","65","45","44","119","68","8","25","0","12"

One can read about it succinctly in The Nation (where the Cloward-Piven plan of devastating America for Marxism was also articulated). “The spirit of neighborliness” became Franklin Roosevelt’s pretext in Christmastime chats, for government racketeering, a plague that robs us of our means to be neighborly.

The extortion of money, that is, from those with resources, to build the power of those who use their gains to live in their own self-indulgence, their personal security nestled in the mechanisms of overlording government’s feudalistic systems, while redistributing just some of what they rob, to those in need. Those in need in turn become those increasingly dependent upon this governing class, their power sustaining votes thus perpetually bought, election after election.

That is not authentic America, where any systems of supply to the situationally disabled beyond voluntary originated locally and if possible were only temporarily administered. Rather, it is something much older, against which America is termed “exceptional.” It is feudalism of a Pharisaical kind in our time. I suggest reading about it in “Pharisees, Sadducees, and the Sanhedrin.” And what is that? What does it offer?

To the rich, coercion: we will take your money by our excessive taxation, one way or the other, and you will cooperate or be punished by law and force.

To the poor, slavery: we will sap away your means of gaining the life of your choosing and the building of your own wealth in a truly free market, and instead compel you to subsist on our universal, paternalist’s plantation.

And of course, measures to disassemble this system of control and kleptocracy become slandered as villainous “austerity.” And all the while, our very currency is issued with usury and debauched with fictitiously added dollars and the inflation of costs. All the while, the central banks’ overlords take their loan-sharks’ cut. These are the very same overlords who give advantageous financing to cartelizers, to despotically capture markets and “fundamentally transform” economic freedom into corporatist, state capitalism.

Let the morally iniquitous, thus fundamentally illicit wealth of these 1% of 1% of 1% ease the “austerity” pain of a return to personal sovereignty under God, with government restricted to serving in guardianship of our true freedom, as our founders dedicated it before His throne. Let those funds be recovered, from our cartel collective overlords, in America and any nation, in a one-time Jubilee. That would be social justice, and a merry Christmas gift for generations that could begin.

The collectivists’ article congratulating Roosevelt for his slight-of-tongue is brief; rather than excerpting it is linked: “FDR’s ‘Christmas Carol’ is the Antidote to Lump-of-Coal Austerity.”

The Christ of Christmas, the same God who instituted a fiftieth-year jubilee for old Israel, has condemned such sinful manipulation, deceitful hypocrisy, and extortion, such robbery of our wealth, freedom, and our Godly gift of popular sovereignty. He did so in a curse which might be hung on the walls of citizens’ homes and school rooms throughout the nation, to train us to governmental and fiscal morality, Matthew 23:25.

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.

(King James Version)

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence.

Ahhh… Raising money through paranoia. The DNC is a master at it. But is it really paranoia when they are truly after you? Impeachment is a real and growing possibility for the Marxist-in-Chief and many of us relish the coming clarifying event of historic proportions. I would pay everything I have for a front row seat and popcorn. I will record the proceedings and pass them on to my children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. I will play them at family gatherings and events. This Presidency and all his followers are THE most corrupt in history. When their bottomless nefarious deeds are dragged, screaming and bleeding into the light of day, you won’t need sitcoms or reality TV – it will be a blockbuster to remember, trust me.

Last night, the DNC sent out a panicky, beseeching email blegging for money because the big, bad Republicans are going to impeach Dear Leader. Let me clarify that… the ones with a spine are coming after him and there are very few of them. But what they lack in numbers, they make up for in courage and ethics. The Daily Caller made my evening – literally:

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) sent out a paranoid email Saturday evening urging supporters to vote for Democrats so that Republicans can’t impeach President Obama. The email, subject line “Impeachment,” was sent to Obama for America supporters, imploring them to contribute to the DNC’s 2014 efforts. “What do these people all have in common?,” the email asked, featuring quotes from Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Rep. Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan, and Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas discussing the possibility of impeaching Obama for one of his numerous instances of presidential misconduct. The DNC email discussed the “I-Word” and said that “Republicans are actually excited about the idea.” “Show these Republicans that they are way, way off-base, and give President Obama a Congress that has his back,” according to the DNC email, noting that Democrats need to win 17 GOP House seats to reclaim a majority.

The beasts under our beds are here folks and they wear Armani suits and Prada heels. They covet power and wealth and tell us that only they know what is best for the American riffraff, who only cling to their Bibles and guns. They are Communists and they despise you and America. I say impeach Obama with prejudice and prosecute the lot of them. Long jail terms all around and we should no longer fear the term “treason.” Oran’s Dictionary of the Law (1983) defines treason as “…[a]…citizen’s actions to help a foreign government overthrow, make war against, or seriously injure the [parent nation].” The US Constitution defines treason in Article 3, section 3 thusly: “Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.” Witnesses are lining up as we speak. Obama has done this over and over… enabling Islamic countries such as Iran against us, handing the keys to the kingdom to Russia and China and breaking America financially and militarily to serve us up to other countries on a treasonous platter. The devil has been celebrating the demise of the last hope for the free world – but the devil can go down to Hades and stuff it.

Justin Amash got it right when he said that Obama’s expansion of executive branch authority is “setting the stage for something very dangerous in the future.” Obama has basically made the executive branch the controlling body, making the judicial and legislative branches merely parrots of his policies. They have been compromised and neutered. Obama does not bother with Constitutional practices, but instead uses diktats to further his agenda. Treating the American people as the Proletariat, Obama has seriously underestimated us. We do not bargain for security, hiding behind diplomacy and forked tongues. Slaves are made in such ways.

Any other president in history would have been brought down and impeached for any one of these scandals:

The NSA Debacle

IRS Persecution of Conservatives and Tea Party Groups

Obamacare

Amnesty

Fast and Furious

Benghazi

The Silencing of Journalists and Bloggers and the Use of the Lapdog Media as a Propaganda Tool Worthy of Goebbels

Printing Money and The National Debt

Consorting with Known Terrorists and Enabling Terrorist Activities

Bringing Foreign Entities into Our Intelligence and Scientific Agencies

Union Collaboration

Enabling and Promoting Marxist/Communist Entities

Election Fraud

Inciting Racial Unrest

Presidential Excess – Vacations, Parties, etc.

Violating Every Aspect of the US Constitution

Responsibility to Protect

The Gutting and Marginalizing of Our Military

The Mistreatment of Allies, Especially Israel

The Redistribution of Wealth

The Gutting and Marginalizing of Our Intelligence Agencies

Religious Persecution of Christians

Unconstitutional Laws Against the 2nd Amendment

Unconstitutional Search and Seizures

Taxation Without Representation

Committing Unauthorized Acts of War

Manipulation of the Financial Markets

And that is only a very partial list. The greatest hits list goes on and on and on. It’s a disgrace we have let this go on this long and it is due to Progressives on both sides of the aisle putting money and power ahead of their constituents. A silent coup is taking place with enemies within and without in our government and Obama is leading the charge.

Impeachment… hell, yeah! In fact, both the DNC and the RNC should be very, very afraid. The RNC is coming after the Tea Party and we’re coming after all of you:

Even though Karl Rove’s American Crossroads brand has been damaged after the group declared war against conservative candidates, the group will reportedly try to influence the 2014 midterm elections by bullying campaigns and creating groups that, on the surface, do not seem to be affiliated with them.

We will not let our Republic fall and Karl Rove and the rest of the Progressive RINOs can go know themselves and pound sand:

The battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party has begun. On one side is the Tea Party. On the other side stand Karl Rove and his establishment team, posing as tacticians while quietly undermining conservatism.

Progressives see impeachment for Obama on the Marxist horizon and Americans see the reinstatement of the Republic. The halls of power need a good scrubbing and cleaning out and the Tea Party is up to the task. Aim small, miss small, boys.","2013-12-29 08:15:18","1","32.0","11.0","15.0","0.0","24.0","0.0","166.0","126.0","0.0","94.0","0.0","6.0","1","1109","88.86","77.56","13.66","22.96","20.92","25.97","75.83","47.25","8.84","5.77","0.90","1.71","0.36","0.72","2.07","3.07","8.66","14.07","6.13","2.80","7.48","0.90","11.00","2.80","1.53","0.63","1.44","1.71","5.41","2.61","2.80","0.72","1.17","0.09","10.01","0.45","0.18","0.00","0.81","7.94","1.08","1.62","0.81","1.44","0.90","2.61","1.35","0.45","0.72","0.09","1.26","0.72","0.27","0.00","0.45","10.91","3.97","1.44","5.14","0.72","0.63","1.71","7.21","1.44","11.36","1.89","6.85","2.71","3.07","1.53","0.27","1.35","0.81","0.45","0.54","0.09","0.36","0.09","0.09","0.00","13.71","5.23","4.06","0.45","0.00","0.18","0.09","0.36","1.62","0.81","0.36","0.54","5439","8.46","25.40909090909091","1690","1106","55","59.53","13.0","9.9","12.47","12.8","268","5.0","19.73258589511754","583","21.82","23","0.45","0","70","17","109","1","129","55","0","1","14","123","202","13","60","1","0","51","18","34","1","2","9","25","0","44","14","34","17","38","26","2","4","0","3"

We warned you in 2008 not to vote for this man unless and until you had vetted him. You did not listen, you refused to vet him and voted for the honey-laced lies that dripped from his lips.

For over five years, we have warned you about the increasing loss of liberty via illegal Executive Orders that are now treated as laws (even by a thoroughly cowed and supplicant Congress) and the removal of the ability to provide for yourselves (including the federal government’s abject theft of the little you had left) that the totalitarian-terrorist ObamaGov was installing in your cities and demanding you accept.

It has happened and is now happening in the light of day, can be fully perceived by all with even moderately functional eyes, ears, brains and their attendant minds that we have become–almost overnight–a fully functioning dictatorship.

Note: I hear over and over again the question “How can Obama get away with ignoring the Constitution and our other laws?” As I’ve continued to write since the beginnings of Obama’s Reign of Terror “if no one stops him, he can do anything he wants.” In the last couple of years, even the top talk show host in the nation has also started saying it.

Military leaders who support the US Constitution and have indicated they will not fire on their fellow citizens in the event of manufactured False-Flag events in order to instill and install Martial Law have been fired and more firings are on the way. Obama demands a military that is fully-subordinate to him and will follow any order he gives them…including those that dismiss the US Constitution and recognize him as Supreme Leader. He is doing it and getting away with it.

ObamaCare gives the dictator-in-chief not only control over your body but, over your assets, your activities and what you think via what you say. It is an all-encompassing document of increasing horror for those who refused to pay attention to it in the past and are now being destroyed by it. It calls upon everyone else to pay for those who have been on welfare for generations (aka “those who refuse to work at a real job”) and is the culmination of the Marxist-Democrat plans that have been in place for many decades.

The National ID Law takes effect in 2014 and will be enforced by the Obama-controlled DHS, TSA (which has had its police power expanded almost exponentially by Obama) and any other agency the dictator deems. It may soon no longer be acceptable to use State-issued drivers’ licenses as identification. The ObamaGov is summarily taking over every aspect of States’ authority and replacing it with his own.

Congress holds one after another hearings on the illegal goings-on within the Obama syndicate, while Obama’s lackeys testify with open and documented lies or simply refuse to answer questions at all by falling back on the hated-by-them US Constitution’s Fifth Amendment when it benefits them. US AG Eric Holder still (illegally) refuses to give Congress the information it has subpoenaed and “leaders” in Congress throw up their hands and say “What can we do? They won’t cooperate!”

Indeed, what can we do when a criminal and terrorist organization takes over the USA? With the exception of a military coup (which seems less and less likely with the removal of top brass committed to the continuation of our dying-due-to-murder Republic), there are at least two remedies. The first would be arrest(s) of those named on charges of treason. That would occur only if a prosecutor in a US State’s county summons the Grand Jury for that county and recommends the indictments be issued. Although, multiple (deemed “meritorious”) charges of treason have already been filed in multiple States there is–thus far–no prosecutor in the USA courageous enough to take this on.

The one last chance we appear to have is that the Republican Party take back both Houses of Congress and it needs a super-majority in the Senate. In that way, we can at least begin to undo a great deal of the severe damage Obama has done to us and our country. I have been and am no fan of the “establishment-wing” of the GOP. To me, they are merely Democrat plants. However, our choice is now down to–literally–life and death. The Obama Police State is growing exponentially while we worry about Duck Dynasty and people are now having their homes broken into by police for possession of “legal guns” if said Police State believes they have too many, they need to be “registered” (a wonderful suppressive trick pulled by both Hitler and Stalin) or some other recently ‘made-up’ law. Note: There are now so many of these that I won’t include them but, can be found by entering key words police arrests legal guns.

During the last election, it was estimated that between 3-4 million American conservatives stayed home and didn’t vote because Romney wasn’t whom they had wanted as a candidate. Hmmm. We see where that has gotten us…don’t we? If we will have and exhibit the courage to take back our government we will have the chance to take the GOP back to its root principles. This truly is our last viable chance. If we do not take back our country in 2014…it really will be gone forever.

“Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.”

–Isaiah 41:10 “I can do all things through him who strengthens me.”

–Philippians 4:13

Maggie’s Notebook

Remember the faux Obama outrage when the Lois Lerner, IRS targeting scandal broke? He stood at his privileged podium, said he knew nothing about it, said it was “outrageous,” and “if in fact IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that’s outrageous and there’s no place for it…I have no patience for it and will not tolerate it,” said The Won. As we’ve seen in the past, he has now doubled down and new “clarifying rules” are actually new restrictions on conservatives while giving unions and other Liberal organizations even sweeter breaks.

In the media blackout of Thanksgiving week, the Treasury Department dumped a new proposal to govern the political activity of 501(c)(4) groups. The administration claims this rule is needed to clarify confusing tax laws. Hardly. The rule is the IRS’s new targeting program—only this time systematic, more effective, and with the force of law. That this rule was meant to crack down on the White House’s political opponents was never in doubt. What is new is the growing concern by House Ways and Means Committee investigators that the regulation was reverse-engineered—designed to isolate and shut down the same tea party groups victimized in the first targeting round. Treasury appears to have combed through those tea party applications, compiled all the groups’ main activities, and then restricted those activities in the new rule… Here’s how it works. To get or keep tax-exempt status, 501(c)(4) organizations must devote a majority of their work to their “primary” social-welfare purpose. Most tea party groups were set up with a primary purpose of educating Americans on pressing problems—the size of government, the erosion of the Constitution—and did so mainly via nonpartisan voter guides, speakers forums, pamphlets or voter-registration drives. What the proposed Treasury/IRS regulation would do is to re-categorize all these efforts as “political activity”—thereby making it all but impossible for tea party groups to qualify for 501(c)(4) status. Say an outfit’s primary purpose is educating voters on our unsustainable debt, which it does mainly with a guide explaining the problem and politicians’ voting records. Under the new rule, that guide is now “political activity” (rather than “social welfare”), which likely loses the group tax-exempt status. Source: Kim Strassel, WSJ

Please read Strassel’s article linked above to understand how the great advantage has been given to unions and other Liberal, Progressive, Obama proponents which are doing the same thing TEA parties do.

We are reaching a point of no return, or perhaps have already reached it. Obama was “outraged” enough to call-out another pack of dogs against his opponents. Alinsky would be proud. I’m betting Bill Clinton’s jaw is on the floor a good part of every day as he watches Obama operate in unthinkable ways. He can’t wait to get Hillary in the Oval Office because Bill and Hill have been schooled. They know the possibilities are limitless. He surely sees another presidency for himself in the future. With the IRS on the side of Liberalism, Progressives are unstoppable.","2013-12-16 10:00:02","1","23.0","10.0","15.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","144.0","97.0","0.0","89.0","0.0","6.0","0","545","83.96","63.64","8.24","49.69","22.71","25.50","78.72","44.22","8.62","3.12","0.37","0.55","0.00","1.65","0.55","5.50","7.52","12.48","8.07","3.12","5.50","1.28","14.13","4.77","1.65","1.47","2.57","3.30","6.06","3.67","2.39","0.37","0.73","0.55","6.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.65","11.56","2.39","2.02","1.65","2.94","1.65","2.39","2.39","1.10","0.92","0.37","1.47","0.18","0.18","0.00","1.10","13.21","3.49","2.39","5.69","1.28","0.92","4.77","8.62","0.73","10.83","0.55","6.06","4.22","6.24","1.47","0.18","2.75","0.00","0.00","0.55","0.00","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.08","4.59","4.40","0.18","0.00","0.18","0.00","1.28","2.94","2.57","2.57","0.37","2652","8.7","23.25","826","526","23","48.23","14.1","12.2","13.58","14.8","131","16.166666666666668","21.121977186311785","317","21.17","9","0.44","0","18","12","54","0","58","45","0","0","5","78","55","1","39","2","0","21","5","23","1","0","4","13","0","21","20","17","19","15","22","4","2","0","3"

WatchDog Wire

With an assist from Michigan Republicans.

The breakneck speed of the runaway Progressive Express has been revved-up yet again by the Michigan Progressive Republican team of Huizenga-Walberg-Rogers-Miller-Camp-Upton-Benishek with their ‘Yes’ votes for the Ryan-Murray Spending Increase Budget.

Collectively, they are fueling the out-of-control federal government which, like a runaway locomotive, is thundering down the track of debt and lost liberty.

House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) has taken the occasion of the latest budget vote to bash conservatives (e.g. Michigan House representatives Amash & Bentivolio, conservatives groups like Heritage Action, and the conservative grassroots throughout our state), leading Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) to characterize Boehner’s attacks as “a breath of fresh air.”

Conservatives and libertarians in Michigan are well aware of the animosity that the GOP establishment has for them. The $648,500 raised in the third quarter for David Trott to defeat the incumbent Kerry Bentivolio, who has a Heritage Action voting record of 83%, is a testament to the GOP’s fear of the Tea Party and liberty groups within the state.

Many grassroots conservatives in Michigan will be urging their state representatives to join legislatures from 33 other states to use the U.S. Constitution to call for a Convention of States to carefully fortify the Constitution so that it can stop the runaway Progressive Express “stone-cold-dead” in its track.

Why trust something this critical to Washington, D.C. and its big-government “gravy-train drivers” on both sides of the aisle?

Dick Manasseri, a resident of Rochester Hills, is a big fan of the US Constitution, doing whatever he can to preserve and protect it for his children and grandchildren.","2013-12-16 12:00:33","1","23.0","8.0","15.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","150.0","95.0","0.0","83.0","0.0","6.0","0","306","98.32","75.38","1.89","31.34","30.60","26.80","64.71","40.85","6.54","2.61","0.00","0.65","0.00","0.65","1.31","3.92","9.80","15.69","4.90","1.63","2.94","0.00","6.21","1.96","1.31","1.31","3.92","1.96","3.59","1.96","1.63","0.33","0.65","0.33","7.19","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.65","2.61","0.65","1.31","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.33","0.65","0.00","0.33","0.33","1.96","0.98","0.00","0.65","0.98","8.82","2.29","1.96","4.58","0.33","1.31","0.98","4.90","0.33","8.17","1.31","4.90","1.96","1.96","2.29","0.98","1.31","0.33","0.33","2.94","0.65","1.31","0.33","0.65","0.00","21.24","4.58","4.25","0.33","0.00","0.33","0.00","5.23","2.29","0.98","1.96","1.31","1536","8.94","34.44444444444444","471","288","12","47.12","14.7","12.7","15.73","17.1","75","13.75","22.01666666666667","198","30.78","11","0.39","0","7","10","32","0","38","17","0","1","3","41","77","3","17","0","0","5","6","5","0","0","2","10","0","11","2","5","4","3","8","1","1","0","1"

Marxist-Leninist revolution is a subtle and often slow process.

While most people focus on the often spectacular and bloody finale, they fail to see the years, or even decades, of disciplined subversion that has gone before.

Real communists understand they are part of history. They see their mission as long term, stretching well beyond their own life time.

They understand that to move humanity “forward,” it will often be necessary to work with and manipulate unfriendly or even opposing social forces to achieve some incremental change towards their ultimate goal.

Here, senior Ohio Communist Party USA leader Rick Nagin explains that Nelson Mandela never abandoned communism, but was a disciplined revolutionary who used business and other social forces to move South Africa towards socialism.

He makes the point that US communists need to be equally subtle and disciplined – to work even with segments of business and of course their “friend” Barack Obama and the Democrats to bring about a socialist America.

This is the point that fools most modern observers. They see countries like South Africa, Brazil, China or Vietnam – ruled by communists, but open to working with and even encouraging capitalism. They see this as evidence that the leaders are communists in name only.

They think that capitalists are using the communists.

In fact, the opposite is occurring – as time will eventually tell. The communist movement has abandoned the adventurism and impatience of its early days. Now the modus operandi is to build up wealth, or cooperate with capitalism when it suits them.

Only when the West is taken down and the United States is disarmed or destroyed, will gullible capitalists all over the world feel the Leninist lash. Only then will the old style communism reemerge. When opposition is futile.

That day is much closer than most Westerners think.

From the People’s World:

The world celebrates the life of Nelson Mandela and reveres him for one thing more than any other – his determination in the face of every provocation to establish a democratic “rainbow nation” where all people, white and black, were equal citizens… But how did Mandela achieve this, how did he overcome the temptation and strong pressure to exact revenge? The answer is given in a remarkable article in the Dec. 8 New York Times by the highly respected journalist, Bill Keller. Entitled “Nelson Mandela, Communist,” it analyzes the long and close alliance of the African National Congress with the South African Communist Party… The article also points out that after the overthrow of apartheid, when the ANC held a parliamentary majority, it was the SACP that “was the most ardent advocate of sharing power with the white regime” and resisted those who demanded immediate nationalization of the mines and other industries and other measures of retribution contained in the South African Freedom Charter. Quoting British historian Stephen Ellis, the article states,” Today, the ANC officially claims still to be at the first stage … of a two-stage revolution. This is a theory obtained directly from Soviet thinking.” The official line in the our mass media is that while the U.S. sided with the apartheid regime for Cold War reasons, Mandela is now acceptable and can be honored because he allegedly changed while in prison and moved away from revolutionary forces in the ANC. The truth is the exact opposite. When the apartheid regime offered to release him if he would renounce violence and break ties with the SACP, Mandela, recognizing that this would shatter the ANC, displayed extraordinary moral courage and refused. As Mandela himself insisted, he never stopped being a revolutionary. It’s just that revolutionary theory is far more subtle and sophisticated than the media is willing to recognize. When it comes to communism, the media prefers crude stereotypes. All revolutions go through stages, including the revolution that established capitalism in our country. The first anti-colonial stage was led by George Washington, but the completion, the second stage, required elimination of slavery, and was led by Abraham Lincoln. Many of the northern leaders of the first stage, including Franklin, Paine and John Adams, opposed slavery, but the necessary political coalition – broadly based and black and white – to abolish slavery would not materialize for another 70 years. Today we in the U.S. face the challenge of defeating right-wing extremism. There are some who would like to skip this stage and put attacking President Obama and the Democrats on an equal footing. This tactic is both divisive and counter-productive. If labor and its allies do not yet have the strength to defeat the extremist section of corporate power how can they hope to defeat corporate power altogether? The extremists are growing more isolated and the progressive forces are gaining strength but the support of the Democratic parts of the ruling class is still very much needed. The newly formed Wall Street-based “Third Way” group could be an effort to split the Obama coalition. To prevent this and win at this stage we need to emulate the steadfastness and political maturity shown by Mandela and the South African Communist Party.

If you want to really understand the unfolding American revolution, please read and re-read comrade Nagin’s essay.

He gets it just right.","2013-12-17 09:56:30","1","37.0","23.0","15.0","0.0","24.0","0.0","143.0","95.0","0.0","81.0","0.0","6.0","0","887","85.58","69.40","23.60","35.62","21.12","26.72","79.37","44.98","8.00","3.27","0.00","0.56","0.11","1.13","1.47","4.74","9.36","11.39","5.98","4.28","7.67","0.45","10.94","4.62","2.37","1.47","1.69","3.04","4.96","2.71","2.14","0.23","0.68","0.45","8.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","1.13","11.27","2.03","2.25","1.58","2.37","1.58","3.04","1.47","1.13","0.11","0.23","0.56","0.34","0.23","0.00","0.00","12.29","3.61","2.82","6.31","1.13","0.34","2.25","7.55","0.79","14.32","1.80","6.99","5.75","3.38","0.79","0.00","0.45","0.11","0.11","0.56","0.11","0.34","0.00","0.11","0.00","12.97","5.30","4.51","0.11","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.79","1.58","0.34","0.00","0.11","4427","8.39","22.3","1350","887","44","59.43","13.0","10.0","12.71","13.0","211","10.1","19.5952198421646","465","19.77","12","0.44","0","46","10","105","0","82","82","2","2","11","128","93","3","41","0","0","28","9","42","2","2","3","24","0","43","23","17","19","25","32","4","3","0","10"

As America disarms, war with Russia and their Chinese, Iranian, communist and Islamic allies gets closer by the day.

From MSNNZ:

Poland and three Baltic states have voiced their alarm over plans by Russia to move nuclear-capable missiles close to their borders.

“Plans to deploy Iskander-M missiles in the Kaliningrad district are disturbing and Poland has said so many times,” its foreign ministry said in a statement.

Warsaw said it had received no official word from Moscow about the deployment, which a Russian defence ministry spokesman confirmed on Monday.

“This is a matter for NATO and we can expect possible consultations and action (…) at the NATO and EU level,” it added.

Relations with Russia have been frosty since Poland shed communism in 1989 and went on to join NATO a decade later.

Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have also had difficult ties with Moscow since they broke free from the Soviet Union in 1990-91 and joined the EU and NATO in 2004.

“It is clear that it is alarming news as it is one of the arguments changing balance of powers in our region,” Latvia’s Defence Minister Artis Pabriks said Monday, quoted by the Baltic News Service (BNS).

“It does not change the balance of power between NATO and Russia, but it changes balance of power in the region. It threatens several Baltic cities,” he added.

He was echoed by Estonia and Lithuania whose defence ministers termed the move both “alarming” and “cause for concern”.

The Russian deployment comes in response to the planned US-led deployment of a disputed air defence shield.

The advanced version of the Russian missile has a range of 500km and could potentially be used to take out ground-based radar and interceptors of the new NATO shield.

The Kremlin warned in 2011 that it could station the short- and medium-range ballistic missiles along the European Union’s eastern frontier in response to NATO’s missile defence programme.","2013-12-17 10:30:05","1","30.0","17.0","15.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","139.0","95.0","0.0","83.0","0.0","6.0","1","328","93.95","70.85","14.43","1.00","23.43","23.78","72.26","42.38","7.32","2.74","0.00","0.91","0.00","0.61","1.22","4.57","7.62","14.94","5.79","0.91","6.71","0.61","10.37","3.35","1.22","0.61","2.13","1.52","4.88","0.30","4.57","1.52","0.91","0.30","6.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.61","7.01","0.61","3.35","0.91","0.91","0.30","0.91","2.13","0.30","1.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.98","3.35","1.83","2.74","1.52","2.13","4.88","5.79","1.22","14.63","3.35","8.23","3.35","0.91","0.00","0.00","0.30","1.52","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.16","4.57","3.35","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.13","3.66","0.91","1.22","0.00","1557","8.45","23.642857142857142","455","323","14","64.95","11.2","9.9","12.42","14.0","75","8.6","20.52792569659443","196","21.5","13","0.41","0","18","8","27","0","42","21","1","0","3","45","56","1","16","0","0","13","5","6","1","0","1","7","0","8","20","4","9","5","12","1","0","1","0"

While Obama guts the American military… as we disarm and as we dismantle our nuclear capabilities, Russia is upping the ante. The ‘flexibility’ that Obama was whispering to Russia not long ago, was a reassurance that he would neuter us militarily. Russia busily began strengthening their nuclear arsenals.

Russia is preparing to dance with Europe:

Poland and three Baltic states have voiced their alarm over plans by Russia to move nuclear-capable missiles close to their borders. “Plans to deploy Iskander-M missiles in the Kaliningrad district are disturbing and Poland has said so many times,” its foreign ministry said in a statement. Warsaw said it had received no official word from Moscow about the deployment, which a Russian defence ministry spokesman confirmed on Monday. “This is a matter for NATO and we can expect possible consultations and action (…) at the NATO and EU level,” it added. Relations with Russia have been frosty since Poland shed communism in 1989 and went on to join NATO a decade later.

The Kremlin warned in 2011 that it could station the short- and medium-range ballistic missiles along the European Union’s eastern frontier in response to NATO’s missile defence programme.

War is not coming, it is here. The Cold War shifted and our enemies infiltrated us. The Russians, Chinese and Islamists are within our own walls and we have handed them the keys to the American kingdom. As Sun Tzu says: “All war is deception.” We’ve been had. Either the coup from within will be complete, exposing our soft national underbelly to our enemies, or due to military weakness, our enemies will decide now is the time that America can be attacked. She is at her weakest militarily, financially and morally. Our enemy’s odds of victory grow by the day due to our Progressive leadership. It is not incompetence… it is a contrived malignant evil intention that has been painstakingly planned and executed behind the scenes. Our rulers tell us that our enemies are our friends and our friends are our enemies. We are down the communist rabbit hole with no way out, except to return to the Reagan Doctrine of (1) peace through strength; (2) trust but verify; and (3) beware of evil in the modern world.

The Russians have no use for the faux US nuclear treaties with them. They were never meant to restrict Russia, just America:

MOSCOW (Reuters) – Russia will begin deploying a new type of long-range missile in 2018 to replace a Cold War standby known in the West as “Satan”, a military commander said on Tuesday in a signal to the United States that Moscow is improving its nuclear arsenal. A new Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) called the Sarmat is being developed to supplant the RS-20B Voyevoda, the Interfax news agency quoted the commander of Russia’s Strategic Rocket Forces, General Sergei Karakayev, as saying. “We are counting on being armed with this qualitatively new missile system … by 2018-2020,” he was quoted as saying. The Voyevoda, whose NATO name is the SS-18 Satan, was developed in the 1970s and the missiles are approaching the end of their service life. Karakayev said some of the ICBMs would remain in service until 2022. The commander spoke on the anniversary of the creation in 1959 of the Strategic Rocket Forces, the military branch in charge of the ICBMs that were the stuff of nightmares in the United States during the superpower standoff of the Soviet era. Russia and the United States signed the latest of a series of treaties restricting the numbers of ICBMs in 2010, but Moscow has indicated it will not go further in the near future, citing what it says are potential threats from U.S. weapons systems.



President Vladimir Putin has emphasized that Russia must maintain a strong nuclear deterrent, in part because of an anti-missile shield the United States is building in Europe and which Moscow says could undermine its security. A pro-Kremlin newspaper reported on Monday that Moscow has deployed missiles with a range of hundreds of miles in its western exclave of Kaliningrad, alarming the governments of neighboring Poland and the Baltic states. It was unclear whether the Sarmat was a missile that Russia tested in May 2012 and said should improve Russia’s ability to foil missile defense systems. The Defense Ministry did not reveal the name of that missile.

I might add that I would not believe the timelines. I believe that Russia is beefing up their nukes now, if they have not already done so. The Chinese have as well. Both are supplying Iran and North Korea. Do the math as the nuclear countdown clock strikes midnight. Russia is making nuclear moves, yet the press seems to care not at all. China challenges us in International waters and the media yawns. Americans better pay attention or do we feel lucky? Well, do we?

I will leave you with a fantastic quote from Allen West:

Welcome to the inept foreign policy world of President Obama. We pivot from the Middle East, destabilizing it and promoting the rise of Islamic totalitarians. Then we negotiate with the Iranians while they march forward to a nuclear capability. When we “pivot” to the Pacific, China threatens one of our ships. We hit the reset button with Russia, and it’s stuck on stupid.

We ascertain that Obamacare itself is maliciously destructive sabotage in process, really on a war crimes level as Rep. Jan Schakowsky and other treasonous Democrats laid out — and as her check kiting husband designed from prison.

And just as I begin to be convinced their own ludicrously fouled up Web site, still with data security missing, has to be a part of the intentional sabotage, something like this comes out. (Sorry, no pun intended.) What’s a man to think?

Stand Up America



Clearly America has lost confidence and no longer trusts those in power at a most critical time in our history. It is true that not all who ply the halls of power fit under that broad brush, but most of them are guilty of many egregious acts and we say it is time to hold a vote of no confidence, it’s time for a ‘recall’.

We are only surviving now, not thriving, and it is clear that the country is demanding new leadership; not the ones the media and the entrenched political machines force upon us.

America is seeking proven leaders, those who are experienced, trustworthy, and loyal; people like our retired military officers. These are the only ones unsullied by political debt or tainted by monied obligations. At this crucial moment, these are the only people who can do the job.

It is time to recall the reprobates and reclaim the power of the people. We need to start with the White House and all of Obama’s appointees, especially Eric Holder.

Then on to Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi – the architects who shoved ObamaCare down our throats. We also cannot forget John Boehner and company who openly castigate the Tea Party caucus which are only doing that which they campaigned upon.

Power likes to stay in power; we need to remove that power. The party in power under Obama has synchronized itself to one party rule, no other voice is permitted. It has also synchronized to a ‘single payer system.’

It is also time we reminded the Republican establishment that if not for the Tea Party, Nancy Pelosi would still be wielding the gavel in the House and Obama would be unrestrained beyond our wildest fears.

It has been just over one year since Obama was re-elected; do you think he would win if he had to face another election today with what we know now? Of course not! In less than a few months it is all unraveling and America has lost confidence in him.

Many who once supported him are now running for the hills. We were defrauded, America, and people are finally noticing and understanding what we have been telling you for five years.

Promise after promise, fraud after fraud, lie after lie, deception after deception, and then there are all those hidden items and the complete joke about being the most transparent administration ever. Even photographic journalists are now mad at how little access they get. Then there is the complete lack of accountability and stark ineptitude, home and abroad.

Let’s look at some of these examples

Excerpted from Obama’s Long List of Broken Promises. By Peter Wehner at Commentary Magazine.

(This is obviously not all of the examples, but certainly it is a good sampling of the more outrageous ones. Some items were shortened for space.)

His promise not to allow lobbyists to work in his administration. (They have.)

His commitment to slash earmarks. (He didn’t.)

To be the most transparent presidency in history. (It’s not.)

To put an end to “phony accounting.” (It started almost on day one and continues.)

And to restore trust in government. (Trust in government is at near-historic lows.)

His pledge to seek public financing in the general election. (He didn’t.)

To treat super-PACs as a “threat to democracy.” (He embraced them.)

His pledge to keep unemployment from rising above 8 percent. (It remained above 8 percent for the longest stretch since the Great Depression.)

To create five million new energy jobs alone. (The total number of jobs created in Obama’s first term was roughly one-tenth that figure.)

To identify all those “shovel-ready” jobs. (Mr. Obama later chuckled that his much-hyped “shovel-ready projects” were “not as shovel-ready as we expected.”)

To lift two million Americans from poverty. (A record 46 million Americans are living in poverty during the Obama era.)

His promise to bring down health care premiums by $2,500 for the typical family (they went up) … allow Americans to keep the health care coverage they currently have (many can’t) … refuse to fund abortion via the Affordable Care Act (it did) … to respect religious liberties (he has violated them) … and the insistence that a mandate to buy insurance, enforced by financial penalties, was not a tax (it is).

Obama’s pledge to stop the rise of the oceans. (It hasn’t.)

To “remake the world” and to “heal the planet.” (Hardly.)

To usher in a “new beginning” based on “mutual respect” with the Arab and Islamic world and “help answer the call for a new dawn in the Middle East.” (Come again?)

To punish Syria if it crossed the “red line” of using chemical weapons. (The “red line” was crossed earlier this year–and nothing of consequence happened.)

That as president “I don’t bluff.” (See the previous sentence on Syria.)

And of course the much-ballyhooed Russian reset. (Tensions between Russia and the United States are increasing and examples of Russia undermining U.S. interests are multiplying.)

And of course the much-ballyhooed Russian reset. (Tensions between Russia and the United States are increasing and examples of Russia undermining U.S. interests are multiplying.) And let’s not forget Mr. Obama’s promise to bring us together. (He is the most polarizing president in the history of Gallup polling.)

Or his assurance to us that he would put an end to the type of politics that “breeds division and conflict and cynicism.” (All three have increased during the Obama presidency.)

And his counsel to us to “resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.” (Remind me again whose campaign allies accused Mitt Romney of being responsible for the cancer death of a steelworker’s wife.)

In his latest treatise on these subjects, Impeachment Lessons, Andy C. McCarthy tells us:

“Just as there is no mystery in Obama’s disregard for the Constitution, there is no secret about the Constitution’s answer to executive imperialism. The Framers recognized that presidential abuse of power carried the greatest potential to wreck the republic. Adamant that the presidency they were creating must not become a monarchy, they carried on debates over the Constitution that were consumed with precluding this very real possibility. In the end, the Framers armed Congress with two responsive weapons: the power of the purse and the power of impeachment.

As we have seen through the years, the power of the purse is not a practical check on Obama. In the main, this is because the Framers, notwithstanding their prescient alarm over the problem of factions, did not anticipate the modern Left.”

Andy further states:

While Democrats quite intentionally defy the Framers’ design, Republicans frustrate it by aggressive passivity. The Constitution divides power by subject matter, not percentage of governmental control. Nevertheless, Republicans incessantly tell supporters that, since they control only the House (just one-half of one-third of the government,” as the tired refrain goes), they are impotent to rein in Obama’s excesses. Republican leadership turns on those conservatives with a ferocity rarely evident in their dealings with the president. Two things, however, are certain. Absent the political will to remove the president, he will remain president no matter how many high crimes and misdemeanors he stacks up. …and absent the removal of the president, the United States will be fundamentally transformed. (Read the whole column here.)

This “ferocity” was never more revealing than in a statement John Boehner made yesterday (excerpt from Fox News):

Ahead of the vote, Boehner sparred with the right flank of his party over the bill, produced out of weeks-long bipartisan negotiations. He specifically criticized conservative advocacy groups trying to pressure the rank-and-file to block the budget. “Frankly, I think they’re misleading their followers,”… “I think they’re pushing our members into places where they don’t want to be. And frankly, I just think that they’ve lost all credibility.”



To which Matt Kibbe at Freedom Works responded:

“Speaker Boehner may not care about what fiscally conservative groups do, but grassroots Americans still care about what he’s doing in Washington… When it comes to ‘credibility,’ actions speak louder than words. And right now, it looks like the Speaker is leading the charge for spending increases and recruiting Democrat votes in the House to help get it done.”

Time for a vote of “NO CONFIDENCE,” time to “RECALL” such faux leadership

A prominent Washington, D.C. insider with whom Stand Up America is coordinating — and who prefers to remain under the radar for the moment while conferring with potential House co-sponsors on both the basic rationale and the detailed content of such a House Resolution of NO CONFIDENCE — offers the following justification for this novel course of action:

First, in most of the world’s so-called “democracies” – actually, multi-party constitutional republics – a formal vote of “No Confidence” by the Lower House suspends or greatly limits the governing authority of the Party in power and, in a “Recall” of sorts, mandates new elections within 30-60 days. Although we have no such instrument in our Constitution or in existing law, there is nothing to prevent its use as a comprehensive de facto indictment and conviction for Contempt of Congress, violations of Oath of Office and of the Constitution itself – for all of the reasons stated in such a Resolution. Second, while most of the “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” cited in pending Resolutions of Impeachment (and perhaps in new resolutions seeking Judicial Relief) would also be included in this Resolution, many lesser and largely “non-impeachable” reasons for disappointment, doubt, distress, distrust and detestation would be entirely appropriate – and would not require the high levels of legal proofs for a formal Impeachment by the House or for a formal Trial and Conviction by the Senate. In effect, it would be much easier to cosponsor, to report to the House, to be formally adopted by the House and to achieve what might be called Obama’s “Conviction without Eviction” – in which wholesale repudiation by the House, loss of control of the Senate and a substantial diminution of power and influence during his remaining time in office would be the penalties. Third, the “no confidence” targets of the Resolution will be so numerous as to require a dozen or more categories – within each of which several particular offenses will be briefly described and become what lawyers call the “Bill of Particulars” – which might number an incredible 60-75 items in all. The credibility of our current leadership is gone, and now we listen to their excuses, finger-pointing, lies, and all manner of chicanery. We know there is no ‘legal standing’ in a vote of “No Confidence” that would come of this act, but at least one thing will certainly occur; we take back the power of discourse.

We strangle those in power with our words loudly drowning out the tortured logic of their rhetoric and seize the day now. This includes the media.

What else is our nation to do now that the ‘rule-of-law’ has effectively been thrown out the window by the Obama Administration?

How are we to trust our government anymore, now that lying and fraud are acceptable practices?

What are we to do now that Senator Harry Reid, D-NV, has abolished the filibuster through the use of the ‘nuclear option’, effectively allowing yet another power grab by the executive branch?

These are but a few points to ponder as our nation races headlong into tyrannical centralized rule if we do not act now.

Our nation is being kidnapped and we effectively have only a few ways to stop it. But these ways have many road blocks, and they take way too long to affect change. The founders never envisioned career politicians running any government, let alone a complicit media openly favoring one ideology.

They also did not anticipate technological advancements that created a 24-hour news cycle and such ease of communication. Therefore they did not give the people enough ‘teeth’ in the Constitution. This effectively allows groups to monopolize the discourse and apply tactics to further weaken the people.

The current administration and the Democrat Party know this and manipulate the system to prevent the people from gaining recourse for grievances. Republicans, although less nefarious by orders of magnitude, engage in some of these tactics, but they do not have the will to fight, especially against such entrenched enemies of the state.

This prevents the people from ultimately recouping their power so eroded these past 100 years, and specifically these past five despite the success of 2010 that gave the House back to Republican control.

Though the actual voting booth is less than a year away, does anyone have any confidence that this time, their vote will actually matter? Even if the Republicans retake the Senate, Obama is still the President, and his cabinet and appointees still remain in power.

A veto proof majority is very likely not in the cards as well, so who knows what the Republicans would be able to do, let alone ridding America of the destruction the ObamaCare has wrought upon us. Obama vowed that it would never be overturned while he remains in the Oval Office.

Obama will just continue to subvert the Constitution he took an oath to faithfully protect. His track record shows us that no matter what the make-up of Congress is, he will twist his way around it with a pen and secure even more power reminiscent of a dictator.

Where that does not work, he will manipulate the courts and law enforcement will be run by fiat, choosing winners and losers.

He will also further escalate the placement of his ideological kin into permanent positions within government, each able then to permanently run their operations ideologically as has been done in the IRS, DHS, DOJ, and more.

There are ways to rid America of these types but short of the vote we speak of, would they work?

On Tuesday, December 3rd, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the president’s duty to uphold the law. Why? Well the committee’s chairman, Bob Goodlatte, R-VA, said:

“President Obama has blatantly disregarded the Constitution’s mandate to faithfully execute the laws… He has changed key provisions in Obamacare without congressional approval, failed to enforce our immigration and drug laws, and ignored his constitutional duties for the sake of politics.”

In that hearing, four witnesses testified and one in particular has spurred much talk of the word that shall not be spoken, the “I-word,” or impeachment. He was none other than Georgetown Law Professor, Nicholas Rosenkranz. He said:

“The ultimate check on presidential lawlessness is elections and, in extreme cases, impeachment.”

In his well crafted piece in the National Review Online, Jonathan Strong added the following:

George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, a frequent guest of Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow during the Bush years, described the situation in severe terms. “I really have great trepidation over where we are headed,” Turley said. “We are creating a new system here…The center of gravity is shifting, and that makes it unstable. Within that system you have a rise of an uber-presidency. There could be no greater danger for individual liberty. And I really think that the Framers would be horrified by that shift.” The situation, Turley later said, is the “most serious constitutional crisis, I believe, in my lifetime.”

Impeachment however is not an option. Why, because Harry Reid still controls the Senate, so like in Clinton’s days, forget about a finding of guilt. Incidentally, if Obama was found guilty and removed from office, Joe Biden would step in, Valerie Jarrett still wields all the power, and likely we get more of the same. What else is available?

Some call for a set of Constitutional amendments, a process that can take place without Congress as the Cato Institute’s Michael Cannon tells us:

“There is a procedure in the Constitution that allows the people to amend the Constitution without going through Congress. That is another method where the people can try to restrain the executive.”

Once again however, what confidence can we have in securing that device for use to correct Obama’s misdeeds and lies? Besides, it would take a very long time; a luxury we just do not have if we are going to save our Republic.

That brings us to the other word no one wants to utter, revolution. In our opinion, this is the least palatable option.

This is an option we abhor and do not support in the least. Others talk about the military taking over as we saw in Egypt; again, we do not support this route. So what do we do? We conduct a national “Vote of No Confidence.”

Like the parliamentary procedure that Great Britain uses, a vote of no confidence means a new election must take place there.

The Prime Minister is powerless after such a vote, and though our vote would not have that full effect, it would at least tell those who live behind the “Iron Curtain” that is the DC Beltway that ‘we are not pleased,’ as the Queen would say.

It would also tell the world that we recognize the mess this administration has wrought upon the world and we do not support his actions. Despite what supporters of Obama say about our standing in the world, the world is laughing at us. We are not pleased!

Join us at Stand Up America US, it is time for a vote of “No Confidence!” ____________________

Hat Tip: BB

I did not start viewing Duck Dynasty until a few months ago. It has since become our favorite show and we can’t get enough of it. Christian values, real people, guns and hunting – what’s not to love? But it would seem that being a Christian and espousing your beliefs in America is now becoming ever more dangerous. As RedState pointed out, ultimately you will care and you will have to take a stand and take sides.

Phil Robertson, the patriarch of Duck Dynasty, just did a GQ interview where he stated his Christian beliefs, which included those concerning Gays. This whole blowup is not so much about the Gay issue, but far more about the Constitution and the First Amendment. In the interview, Phil was asked if he thought homosexuality was sinful:

“Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,” he told GQ, before paraphrasing the Bible in Corinthians. “Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers — they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.”

For telling the truth and stating what he personally believed, A&E put him on indefinite hiatus. They fired him. I would be very surprised if the family did not tell A&E to stuff it. They managed to take THE most popular rated show ever and scuttle it. Phil had told A&E earlier that if they insisted he remove God or guns from his show, they were through:

On May 9, Greensboro, NC country station 93.1 The Wolf reported that after receiving complaints over prayers to God and the frequent use of guns on air, Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson said, “God and guns are part of our everyday lives [and] to remove either of them from the show is unacceptable.”

Sarah Palin came to Phil’s defense with the following quote:

Free speech is an endangered species. Those “intolerants” hatin’ and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.

She’s right and this will backfire on A&E and all the others out there that are anti-Christian. Phil Robertson just became a warrior for God and the Constitution and I am sure he is up to the task. An attack on one Christian, is an attack on all of us. Time to draw our line in the Marxist sand.

Drudge headlined this whole shameful turn of events on his site this morning with: “Roasted ‘Duck’ – Leader Fired After Gay Rant. The title is misleading as I don’t consider Phil’s statement as a rant, but a confirmation of his beliefs and faith. He has a right according to the First Amendment to state his views. And while A&E has a right to run their channel as they see fit, they obviously care more about the rights of Gays than they do of Christians and they fear the backlash from the LGBT community and their supporters. They don’t give a crap about Constitutional rights and evidently they are willing to throw away millions in revenue to placate a certain segment of society. That pretty much says it all, doesn’t it? A&E chose sides with GLAAD, took a stand and walked off a cliff. It’s okay for militant Gays to attack Christians and hunt them down, but when a Christian stands up and says what he believes… well, that’s hate don’t ya know.

From Gateway Pundit:

A&E has placed Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson on indefinite hiatus following anti-gay remarks he made in a recent profile in GQ. “We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson’s comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty,” A&E said in a statement. “His personal views in no way reflect those of A+E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community. The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely.” The news comes after Robertson compared homosexuality to bestiality in an interview with the magazine. He’ll likely appear in season four, which bows Jan. 15, since production is largely wrapped.

I’m not a boycotter, but in this case, I’m definitely willing to make an exception. I’ll do my shopping at the Duck Commander site, thank you very much.

A&E and Phil Robertson both put their beliefs ahead of profits. One for God, the other for political correctness. Through tolerance, evil progresses. Many Christians are afraid to state what they believe because of a politically correct, 1984 environment imposed on America by our Marxist leaders.

Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act. Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy

Christians should remember that quote, because you must take a stand, just as Phil Robertson and his family have done.

The dishonest and criminal faction of GLAAD is now on a Christian hunt for Duck Dynasty. GLAAD called Phil’s comments vile and stereotypically outdated – so Christianity is passe according to GLAAD? Color me not surprised. GLAAD has no idea what a true Christian believes. Red State has this to say:

The secular left believes otherwise. GLAAD spokesman Wilson Cruz, in a laughably ridiculous statement, responded to Robertson by saying, “Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil’s lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe.” Actually, Robertson said precisely what true Christians believe and anyone, including A & E, letting GLAAD be an arbiter of true Christian thought is pretty quickly destined for hell fire. A & E has now joined much of mass market culture in the Western World in picking sides in a fight — tolerance for gay rights, but not for Christians expressing honest answers to questions asked of their faith. The only surprise is that the Christians of Duck Dynasty could last there as long as they did. A&E has as much right to do this as you have to turn the channel. But they have clearly aligned themselves against us in the culture wars. The world is at war with Christ and those who put their faith in Christ. The silver lining of this act is that many Christians who decided they could sit on the sidelines and not have to care will have a wake up call — particularly millennial Christians. The Church, however, must show it will stand with those who stand with Christ and not shy away from this fight lest too many weak and new Christians go wobbly and silent.

You will be made to care. You will not be given the option of silence or sitting on the sidelines.

Rhymes With Right also made an astute observation that A&E just violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act by suspending Phil Robertson from Duck Dynasty:

It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer – to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;

I wouldn’t hold your breath that Obama and the DOJ will do anything on this though. They are quietly cheering on the sidelines as this happens. They are just about as anti-Christian as they come – you will find the Obama Administration in support of Islam, but not Christianity… period.

Phil Robertson has released his own retort:

“I myself am a product of the 60s; I centered my life around sex, drugs and rock and roll until I hit rock bottom and accepted Jesus as my Savior,” he said. “My mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the Bible teaches, and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together. “However, I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.”

Let me tell you something… I have walked with God all my life. That doesn’t mean I didn’t stray – a lot. I have a colorful history to say the least. But I am a Christian now and forever and I share Phil’s views. There should be room out there for everyone to have their own views and lead their own lives. Whatever choices one makes is between them and God. It is not for our leaders and politicians to decide for us what is right and what is wrong. A&E made a horrific, knee jerk reaction which will cost them dearly.

I believe that GQ is complicit in all this. I think they set Phil up and he knew it and did not care. He’s a man of faith and principle. Traits so foreign to the Left as to be alien in thier strangeness to them. But if they were rocked by Duck Dynasty, they better hold on to their hats. Things are about to get interesting.

Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Ann Coulter and possibly Rush Limbaugh, are teaming up. That’s right folks. They are talking, working together and appearing together. Despite the attempts of the Left and many on the Right to keep them apart, an alliance has formed and Progressives should be very, very concerned.

I also would have to believe that Glenn Beck would find a home for Duck Dynasty with TheBlaze. That would be funny and ironic. I certainly hope that happens. Glenn Beck believes in the Constitution and religious freedom as does the Duck Dynasty family. It’s a match made in, well you know… The silencing of the ducks has just turned into the resurgence of Christianity.

Cross-Posted at Right Side News

A scandal that spans three presidencies and more is coming to light. In a non-defined conflict against terrorism, we have lost over 6,750 U.S. service members who have died in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. American blood spilled in wars that do not attack those who attacked us on 9-11. To put this in perspective, fewer died in Pearl Harbor and we nuked the Japanese. We were told after 9-11, that it was al Qaeda, with no other state sponsors. If the allegations prove accurate, 9-11 was nothing less than an act of war by Saudi Arabia.

“It’s classified because if it were released, the people would demand war against Saudi Arabia, and the entire US policy of having the Sunni Arabs price their oil in US dollars in exchange for supporting their dictatorships would fall apart.”

– Comment left at Hot Air (Hat Tip: The Radio Patriot)

According to the New York Post, Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch and Republican Rep. Walter Jones have come forward with solid accusations claiming that 28 pages from the 2002 report on 9-11, were not only redacted, they were blank except for an on-going ellipsis. The 28 pages were purportedly removed by President Bush when the report was released, but are now leaking out 12 years later:

President Bush inexplicably censored 28 full pages of the 800-page report. Text isn’t just blacked-out here and there in this critical-yet-missing middle section. The pages are completely blank, except for dotted lines where an estimated 7,200 words once stood (this story by comparison is about 1,000 words). A pair of lawmakers who recently read the redacted portion say they are “absolutely shocked” at the level of foreign state involvement in the attacks. Reps. Walter Jones (R-NC) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) can’t reveal the nation identified by it without violating federal law. So they’ve proposed Congress pass a resolution asking President Obama to declassify the entire 2002 report, “Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001.” Some information already has leaked from the classified section, which is based on both CIA and FBI documents, and it points back to Saudi Arabia, a presumed ally. The Saudis deny any role in 9/11, but the CIA in one memo reportedly found “incontrovertible evidence” that Saudi government officials — not just wealthy Saudi hardliners, but high-level diplomats and intelligence officers employed by the kingdom — helped the hijackers both financially and logistically. The intelligence files cited in the report directly implicate the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles in the attacks, making 9/11 not just an act of terrorism, but an act of war.

As Ed Morrissey of Hot Air points out, the intel Sperry cites will eventually be discredited or the executive branch will be implicated in the interference with one or both reports.

Three Strikes And You Are Out

Buck Sexton at TheBlaze last night said that he thought that the redaction was either to cover embarrassment for incompetency on the part of our intelligence agencies (the fact that no one was minding the store), or that our government was complicit in aiding and abetting the Saudis. Here are some facts for you:

1. Clinton and his intelligence agencies knew full well what bin Laden intended. Bin Laden stated it in 1998 and carried it out in 2001. I see no way that our agencies didn’t know it was a grave possibility.

2. Bush put the Saudis on a plane right after 9-11 and sent them home. No questions asked, right after the murder of 3,000 Americans and the largest terrorist attack on US soil ever.

3. At least one Saudi was involved in the Boston bombing. He was hurt and hospitalized. Michelle Obama visited him in the hospital. He was given safe passage back to Saudi Arabia and he visited the White House afterwards.

Three strikes and you are out.

I believed in President Bush when 9-11 happened. He seemed a hero for his actions right after the attack. Now those actions are clouded and it would seem that those branded conspiracy nuts on both sides of the aisle, were in part right. I still don’t buy the wackier conspiracy theories that you will find out there and I will never be a Truther. But, I have for a long time pointed out the involvement of Saudi Arabia and Iran as well in the attacks. Now there seems to be strong evidence against Saudi Arabia who has denied their involvement since the beginning. Denials that were suspect to begin with since 15 of the 19 bombers were from Saudi Arabia.

The New York Post has laid out the now expanding evidence that Saudi agents, officials and operatives in several states, including Virginia, Florida, California and DC, gave funding and/or intelligence to the hijackers in 2001. If true, explain to me how that is not an act of war?

Karl Denninger put it better than I can and got right to the heart of the matter:

It’s obvious given what happened, the logistical and funding requirements and where the hijackers came from along with inexplicable actions immediately following the attacks – unless our government explicitly let certain people flee. Yet we went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan while helping the Saudis — the very people who attacked us. And Obama, to this day, kisses the Saudi King. […] It makes a very convincing case that the Saudi Government was involved in an act of war against the United States. Not simply terrorism — remember, the Pentagon, a military target, was one of the locations hit. The other intended target for the plane that went down in PA was the Capitol. You awake yet America? You damn well should be. It’s about damn time that the mainstream media started talking about this — you’re only a decade late, *******s. And no, people like myself who have been saying this all along are not nuts. We’re right.

And American blood flows, while we protect those who kill us. Sheer insanity. Obama literally bows to the Saudi King and it would appear that Bush and Clinton did as well. I can’t get the image out of my head of Bush holding hands with the King of Saudi Arabia. That blood is as black as oil. No one has ever solved or revealed who made the killing in the stock market by shorting airline stocks during all this. That needs to be answered.

Eight Trillion has been spent on security since 9-11 and we are less secure now than we were then. Does anyone really believe this is not on purpose? Incompetency only goes so far; evil intent is forever. We have been lied to over and over and over again. We see it going on every day and feel helpless to stop it. We must put a stop to this. These elite Progressives are getting wealthy off the deaths of our people and are redistributing every last dime America has. By design, they are bringing us to our knees and forcing us into a dictatorship. They have no reverence for the Constitution, for our laws or our branches of government. Do you trust our government anymore? I don’t – not on either side of the political spectrum.

Inside The Saudi 9/11 Coverup

Read the New York Post’s investigative piece in its entirety: Inside the Saudi 9/11 coverup. I would very much like to know what is in those 28 pages. I want to know if this is another contrived attempt to smear Bush and Republicans, or if they were complicit in aiding the Saudis. I want the truth:

Democrat Bob Graham, the former Florida senator who chaired the Joint Inquiry, has asked the FBI for the Sarasota case files, but can’t get a single, even heavily redacted, page released. He says it’s a “coverup.” Is the federal government protecting the Saudis? Case agents tell me they were repeatedly called off pursuing 9/11 leads back to the Saudi Embassy, which had curious sway over White House and FBI responses to the attacks. Just days after Bush met with the Saudi ambassador in the White House, the FBI evacuated from the United States dozens of Saudi officials, as well as Osama bin Laden family members. Bandar made the request for escorts directly to FBI headquarters on Sept. 13, 2001 — just hours after he met with the president. The two old family friends shared cigars on the Truman Balcony while discussing the attacks. Bill Doyle, who lost his son in the World Trade Center attacks and heads the Coalition of 9/11 Families, calls the suppression of Saudi evidence a “coverup beyond belief.” Last week, he sent out an e-mail to relatives urging them to phone their representatives in Congress to support the resolution and read for themselves the censored 28 pages. Astonishing as that sounds, few lawmakers in fact have bothered to read the classified section of arguably the most important investigation in US history. Granted, it’s not easy to do. It took a monthlong letter-writing campaign by Jones and Lynch to convince the House intelligence panel to give them access to the material. But it’s critical they take the time to read it and pressure the White House to let all Americans read it. This isn’t water under the bridge. The information is still relevant ­today. Pursuing leads further, getting to the bottom of the foreign support, could help head off another 9/11. As the frustrated Joint Inquiry authors warned, in an overlooked addendum to their heavily redacted 2002 report, “State-sponsored terrorism substantially increases the likelihood of successful and more ­lethal attacks within the United States.” Their findings must be released, even if they forever change US-Saudi relations. If an oil-rich foreign power was capable of orchestrating simultaneous bulls-eye hits on our centers of commerce and defense a dozen years ago, it may be able to pull off similarly devastating attacks today. Members of Congress reluctant to read the full report ought to remember that the 9/11 assault missed its fourth target: them.

If any of this is true, America will never be the same. Our leaders should be forewarned that the public will not be pleased – the woodshed will have a long line on this one and tar and feathers will be handed out judiciously. We always knew that Saudi Arabia was involved, but this takes it to a new level. When a country’s government sanctions and helps with a terrorist attack of another country, ally or not, it is an act of war. Thanks to Obama, we are too weak after gutting our military to go to war. But if Saudi Arabia’s government was involved, then America needs to clean out our government now, beef up our military and go on a road trip to the land of oil and do a smack down of epic proportions.

The enemies within and without seem to have been shrouding an act of war and Americans need to wrest control of our Republic back into the hands of patriots. As Judson Phillips says, we should remember there are certain crimes that have no statute of limitations.","2013-12-19 12:34:10","1","63.0","16.0","15.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","170.0","99.0","0.0","94.0","0.0","6.0","1","1912","86.23","69.40","35.53","10.56","18.04","21.23","78.35","47.80","9.88","4.92","0.78","2.04","0.42","0.63","1.05","4.97","8.42","13.86","6.96","3.35","5.60","1.73","13.18","3.87","2.30","1.10","4.39","1.99","5.60","2.20","3.40","0.52","2.09","0.42","8.47","0.31","0.16","0.00","0.89","9.99","2.46","1.15","1.36","1.73","1.88","3.24","1.67","0.68","0.47","0.31","1.15","0.58","0.37","0.10","0.16","10.15","3.03","0.78","5.60","0.58","0.68","4.50","6.69","0.78","14.28","1.94","7.95","4.60","3.56","0.42","0.52","1.05","0.10","1.10","0.63","0.10","0.21","0.05","0.26","0.00","14.64","5.49","3.97","0.37","0.05","0.26","0.00","1.20","0.73","1.05","0.52","0.99","8722","7.57","20.145833333333332","2749","1887","103","61.36","11.6","9.2","10.56","10.3","362","6.071428571428571","16.993555908850027","811","18.34","32","0.46","0","75","73","204","0","226","97","4","2","25","217","239","8","107","1","0","90","26","107","2","1","13","49","0","66","81","38","55","53","47","9","12","0","6"

And speak out about the potential and strategic ""sense"" of the Obama/NWO's DHS carrying out false flag missions of violence, blaming it on American patriots, perhaps upon our militia movements.

Here is an internet graphic I highly recommend, not to be used in any vindictive way, but to make it personal with fellow citizens. Let’s take it as a big cue.

People say “elections have consequences” and the calamity we are just beginning to see brought to us, through Obamacare, the police and surveillance state, generational debt slavery and citizenship debauchery, and through government’s promoting and subsidizing mass immorality — it makes that all too clear.

But when we talk, we talk to people. Let’s boil that down further. When you talk, you talk to a person. Our message does not nebulously issue to a generality. Don’t assume the lie of collectivism. Adopting the reality of individual responsibility, let’s pass it along and convey truth directly, to each person to whom we communicate.

Instead of “elections have consequences”:

Your vote had consequences. Are you sorry for voting for lying despots, who intentionally bring us plagues like the false “welfare” of destructive collectivism, extreme government spending with taxes that become extortion, government dependency that saps personal initiative, rampant racist and sexist murder through abortion, and slavery to the paternalism of the government plantation?* Or, do you think popular sovereignty is choosing between tyrants that rob us of the freedom required to lift ourselves up? I want to make sure we don’t vote for tyrants that are here to bilk us through the unchecked powers of huge, transnational corporations, either. (Obama and his fellow “public-private partnership” stooges of the cartel collective do it to us on both sides.) Are you going to make sure you don’t get duped like that and vote for another one of these destroyers again?

What was done decades ago, to patriots such as Senator Joseph McCarthy (whom it took the release of KGB papers to vindicate) by propagandists like Frankfurt School Marxist, Edward R. Murrow, and then later, to Judge Robert Bork, by the likes of the deathly irresponsible Senator Ted Kennedy — that was “the politics of personal destruction.” In the Twenty-first Century, despots bring us each the personal politics of national destruction.

This is all very personal. Perpetrators on every level deserve the respect of our treating it personally with them. Sin is personal and it should be confronted in the here and now, and dealt with, so it doesn’t continue to hurt oneself and others — so it isn’t carried to judgment, the earthly kind or later. And if such sinful foolishness as throwing away personal sovereignty and freedom is repented from personally, by one, then our whole society begins to have one more blessing of true hope.

And turning to our actual reason for government is what I and others are attempting to bring about, through the Sovereignty Campaign.

Karl Pierson (via Karl Pierson’s facebook profile)

The young gunman responsible for the shooting on Friday at Arapahoe High School in Colorado is described in a variety of ways by his classmates: Socialist, Communist… See a trend? Sadly, my daughter came to us today and said that students don’t hold political views, so that cannot be true. Except it is and it is straight from the students themselves. Oddly enough, his family attended Bible study meetings according to the neighbors. It would appear that the son did not share the family’s religious beliefs.

Real Clear Politics:

“He was friendly enough. Very proud of being a socialist. He was very outspoken on his political views,” student Angie Mock said. “To him, it just meant economic — more economic equality.”

Eighteen-year-old Karl Halverson Pierson walked into his Denver, CO high school with a shotgun, looking for a specific teacher – Tracy Murphy. His classmates say that he was not a loner; he was outspoken, intelligent and had Communist views. This is the Left – a prima facie Progressive. He critically wounded one student and wounded another before offing himself. It was all over 20 minutes after the shooting was reported and Pierson lay dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Some say it was because he was kicked off the Speech and Debate Team by the school librarian. Two Molotov cocktails were also found in the school. One went off, but didn’t hurt anyone.

From TheBlaze:

Senior Chris Davis, 18, told CNN that Pierson was “a self-proclaimed communist, just wears Soviet shirts all the time.” The Wall Street Journal noted that Davis said Pierson once wore a shirt emblazoned with the letters U.S.S.R. and described himself as a communist. An ABC News report noted that students said Pierson held communist views and liked to discuss current events and issues and pose his own solutions. None told ABC News that Pierson was bullied for his beliefs.

This is what our kids are learning in our government controlled schools. We are losing them mind, body and soul to the collective.

Since the media lapdogs are Marxists/Socialists/Communists/Progressives themselves, they seem to be all in on covering up the facts when these violent individuals are exposed for their ideology. The Denver Post this time got caught by TheBlaze:

The Associated Press noted that classmates of Karl Pierson, the 18-year-old who walked into his suburban Denver high school with a shotgun Friday, held communist views. There’s now word that in a Denver Post profile of Pierson, a classmate calls the shooter “a very opinionated Socialist.” But when the story was apparently updated, the classmate describes Pierson as just “very opinionated.” What happened to the “Socialist” adjective is anybody’s guess.

Pierson was also a “Keynesian” – color me not surprised:

In one Facebook post, Pierson attacks the philosophies of economist Adam Smith, who through his invisible-hand theory pushed the notion that the free market was self-regulating. In another post, he describes himself as “Keynesian.” “I was wondering to all the neoclassicals and neoliberals, why isn’t the market correcting itself?” he wrote. “If the invisible hand is so strong, shouldn’t it be able to overpower regulations?” Pierson also appears to mock Republicans on another Facebook post, writing “you republicans are so cute” and posting an image that reads: “The Republican Party: Health Care: Let ‘em Die, Climate Change: Let ‘em Die, Gun Violence: Let ‘em Die, Women’s Rights: Let ‘em Die, More War: Let ‘em Die. Is this really the side you want to be on?”

Other media outlets such as news.com.au, seemed to focus on the ironic fact that Pierson was anti-gun and got bullied a lot. Well, I guess that makes violence a-okay. Just another normal Communist/Socialist, from another normal Progressive family. What is it with Socialists and violence anyway?

Maggie’s Notebook

If you read conservative blogs, you know Jim Hoft at Gateway Pundit. If you are far Left, Progressive and/or voted for Barack Obama, you know Jim’s work and find it necessary to take large doses of chalky tablets to cure your indigestion. Jim has had a tragic three months, been close to death and by virtue of ObamaCare has lost his health insurance and perhaps the doctors who recently saved his life. He is facing more surgeries in the coming months. A few days after Jim asked his readers for prayer and quoted Psalm 143: 1, 2, and 8 he received the message below the photo via email (language alert, there’s no way I can add a few asterisks to spare you):

“I get this notification that I’m going to lose my insurance,” he said. “This insurance that I bought, that I purchased, and I was paying a good premium, (and) covered most everything.” Hoft, who is still in a wheelchair, said he has a number of “major surgeries” in the near future and was “very pleased” with his insurance of choice. “So to get this news on top of my recovery, on top of trying to make a living, has been obviously a very difficult thing to take on at this time,” he said, the emotion clear in his voice. Hoft has written about Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius’ assertion that people who have lost their insurance are “thrilled” with the options they have available to them, and on Friday he repeated his message that she can “go to hell” because that is “absolutely not true.” Read more here.

Jim thought he had a cold. Three days later he learned it was a strep bacteria that had eaten a hole in his heart the size of a dime, caused five strokes on both sides of his brain, and stole the vision in his left eye. St. Louis doctors saved his life. He had a prosthetic knee which had to be removed. He is still in a wheelchair. Now ObamaCare (Affordable Care ACT) has stolen his health care.

Continued at The Blaze TV with Dana Loesch hosting:

“I don’t have the options I had,” Hoft told Loesch. “I pray to God that I get the same doctors, who saved my life three months ago. I pray that I’ll be able to see them.” Thankfully, Hoft said, there are already “laws on the books” ensuring that someone in his condition doesn’t “get kicked off” their health insurance mid-treatment, but his health complications are not short-term.

Lord, hear my prayer,

listen to my cry for mercy;

in your faithfulness and righteousness

come to my relief.

Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love,

for I have put my trust in you.

Psalm 143 – Verses 1,2,8

By now, must if not all of us have heard the news that Republican House of Representatives Steve Stockman from Texas has decided to run against incumbent Republican John Cornyn for his Senate seat in 2014.

Mr. Stockman, a Tea Party favorite, cited the reason for his decision to run against Mr. Cornyn as being because Cornyn tried to “undermine” Ted Cruz in his bid to stop Obamacare.

Will there be any “skeletons” in Stockman’s closet that will have the progressive Democrats scrambling to air them on the “state run media?” I uncovered several possible areas of interest to the Democrats while researching Mr. Stockman’s experience and background. The Republicans, however, may not view this information in the same way and instead, may deem him a champion of their causes.

Stephen Ernest Stockman was born in Bloomfield, Michigan on November 14, 1956. He graduated from the University of Houston-Clear Lake in 1990. Soon after, he found himself unemployed and homeless. He lived on the streets and was once arrested on a drug charge. Later he became a born-again Christian and changed his life for the better.

He first ran for the House of Representatives in 1990 but was defeated. He ran again in 1992 but was once again defeated. In 1994, he ran again and was successful in defeating a 42 year incumbent. Stockman represented the 9th District of Texas from 1995-1997. He lost another Congressional election in Texas in 2006. He assumed office in January 2013 for the 36th District of Texas, after a successful run. Perhaps his tenacity will serve him well in his 2014 bid against the newly elected incumbent, Mr. Cornyn.

The left has not viewed his time in Congress favorably. Wikipedia cites a Houston Chronicle article that indicates that Stockman’s first two years in Congress were “marked by weirdness” when he claimed that the Clinton Administration had raided the Branch Davidian compound to justify a ban on assault weapons. Perhaps a claim that today some would argue as a possibility based on the current Administration’s dealings involving the IRS, NSA, and anti-NRA stance.

Another incident of “weirdness” occurred on the day of the Oklahoma bombing. It involved a fax that Stockman and several other Congress members received from a Texas Republican Chairwoman with ties to the Michigan militia. Finally, Stockman purportedly antagonized then House Speaker Newt Gingrich during his first two years, by opposing the U.S. bailout of the Mexican peso.

More recently, Stockman has openly called for an investigation into Benghazi. Stockman, you may recall, issued a petition to force a vote in the House to investigate the killings of four Americans in Benghazi.

He was also the Congressman who invited the Rodeo Clown to Texas after the clown was banned for life in Missouri for “inciting violence against the President.” Rep. Stockman reportedly said that “liberals want to bronco bust dissent” and his remarks weren’t well received by some on the left.

Stockman is also outspoken against Common Core in schools. He further spearheaded impeachment possibilities in November of this year against President Obama by handing out a book to his House colleagues calling for his impeachment.

He also took to twitter to criticize Obamacare and was accused of making a “transphobic” joke while speaking about Obamacare on The Steve Deace Show.

Finally, Stockman accused Obama of “acting like an emperor” on issues of Health Care and the Defense of Marriage Act during that same interview.

Most of his votes as a Congressman have been rendered as expected. For example, he co-sponsored and voted for a bill that would allow Americans to keep their health plans, voted for a bill to give supplemental nutrition to women, children and infants, and filed a bill to repeal the deadly gun ban on military bases.

It should be noted that Stockman was also given a 100% by American Conservative Union (ACU), the oldest membership-based Conservative organization in the United States that rates politicians on how they vote on issues. The ACU’s most well-known event is the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).

Whether Rep. Stockman will prove to be a worthy opponent to Sep. Cornyn in 2014 will ultimately be decided by you, the voter. Prepare yourself for the liberal propaganda machine and then get out and vote.

TheBlaze: Close to 100 legislators from 32 states met in Mount Vernon, Va., Saturday to discuss the possibility of adding amendments to the U.S. Constitution through a convention of the states.

Such a convention, as outlined in article five of the Constitution, would allow state legislatures to vote on amendments to add.

No constitutional amendment has been added this way, but some say the Constitution specifically allows for states to use the convention as a means to push back against the federal government.

Two-thirds of the state legislatures, or 34, must approve an application for a convention to occur, according to the Constitution’s article five. State legislatures would then send delegates to the convention, each state getting one vote on proposed amendments. For an amendment to pass and become a part of the Constitution, it would have to be approved by three-fourths, or 38, of the state legislature

Nearly 100 Lawmakers Descend on Mount Vernon to Talk Convention of States@RapertSenate Sen. Jason Rapert

Lawmakers on Saturday discussed term limits on U.S. lawmakers and certain limits on federal taxation and spending as possible amendments, Red Millennial noted.

State legislators stressed Saturday the bipartisan nature of support for the discussed amendments, citing a recent poll that shows 74 percent of Americans support a balanced budget amendment while another 75 percent support congressional term limits.

Saturday’s Mount Vernon meeting was organized by Indiana state Sen. David Long and Wisconsin Rep. Chris Kapenga.

There has been growing support for the idea of a convention, but there is also healthy skepticism.

Still, regardless of whether one thinks it’s a realistic idea, Virginia and South Carolina have both pre-filed applications for a convention, meaning some are taking the idea very seriously.

Saturday’s meeting represents the most recent attempt by legislators to discuss seriously the possibility of adding amendments to the Constitution through a convention.

Here is a response from Florida State Senator Alan Hays regarding last Saturday’s Mount Vernon Assembly.

“We discussed the process of bringing the Article V convention into reality and agreed to meet next year at a time yet to be determined due to the need to meet when state legislatures are adjourned or in recess. That will assure more participation. We also discussed a possible resolution to go to each state requesting their legislatures establish a selection process for delegates to be attending an Article V. Convention.”

“We recognized the need for wide communication to the public of our work. I feel it was a very good first step toward success.”

Alan Hays

Folks, this Article V movement is off the ground!

From ConventionofStates.com:

Are you nervous about calling your state legislators? Here’s what you do:

1. Find their contact number. Most state legislatures have a website where you’ll find all the contact information you need. Just do an internet search: “[My State] State Legislature.”;

2. Call them. Try to use a landline, as this will give you the clearest signal. You don’t want to drop this call!

3. Introduce yourself and thank them for their service: “Hi, my name is [Your Name]. I live in your district, and I appreciate your service in our state legislature.”;

4. Explain why you’ve called: “I’m calling because I’d like to talk to you about an opportunity the states have to take back power from the federal government.”

5. Explain the problem: “Almost everyone knows our federal government is on a dangerous course. The unsustainable debt combined with crushing regulations on states and businesses is a recipe for disaster.”

6. Explain the solution: “Fortunately, the Founders gave state legislatures the power to make changes to the federal structure when Washington, D.C., starts to abuse its authority. Article V of the Constitution authorizes the state legislatures to call a convention for the limited purpose of proposing amendments to the Constitution.”

7. Explain the COS Project: “The Convention of States Project was launched to call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments that impose fiscal restraints and limit the power of the federal government.”

8. Voice your support: “I support this approach. I want [name of your State] to be one of the necessary 34 states that passes a resolution calling for a Convention of the States. You can find a copy of the draft resolution and a legislator’s handbook (which briefly explains the process and answers many questions) at www.conventionofstates.com.”

9. Give them an action step: “I ask you to support the Convention of States Project and become either the lead sponsor or co-sponsor of a resolution in the next legislative session.”

10. Thank them again and give them some contact info: “Thanks so much for your service to the people of our district. You can reach the COS Project at info@conventionofstates.com or call them at 540-441-7227.”

When you finish your conversation, let us know what your state representative thinks! We need a legislator to sponsor our application in every state, and we’d love to talk to a state congressman from your area. That’s it! Of course, it’s always best to use your own words and explain it however you feel most comfortable. We’ve provided this outline as a guide. Good luck! – The COS Project Team","2013-12-11 06:55:26","1","9.0","4.0","0.0","0.0","10.0","0.0","105.0","95.0","0.0","42.0","0.0","0.0","0","932","94.70","89.52","14.27","64.42","15.53","28.76","73.71","43.24","8.58","6.12","1.18","1.29","2.68","0.00","0.97","2.47","9.76","14.27","5.15","3.43","4.51","0.21","11.91","2.79","1.50","0.97","4.29","2.47","4.29","3.11","1.07","0.21","0.32","0.00","11.16","0.11","0.32","0.00","0.00","10.73","3.97","1.93","1.29","2.36","0.97","1.18","0.75","0.32","0.21","0.21","0.54","0.00","0.11","0.32","0.00","8.48","2.25","2.36","2.79","1.72","0.32","1.39","9.66","0.43","9.55","2.15","4.08","3.65","4.08","0.54","0.00","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.43","0.00","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.21","6.97","3.11","1.39","0.21","0.32","0.54","0.64","2.36","1.82","0.21","1.61","4610","7.61","20.148936170212767","1421","917","54","62.68","12.7","8.7","13.16","12.0","182","10.9","16.73893129770992","433","18.11","22","0.42","1","24","39","105","0","93","44","1","1","8","151","125","6","47","1","0","42","21","24","0","2","1","43","0","49","19","18","12","34","23","5","2","0","5"

Here is my characterization of just a little bit of a recurring argument (wait, recurring bad dream, no, argument, darn) that I’ve had with a fellow Christian, who enjoys tuning into MSNBC like one of the Borg hive stepping into his regeneration chamber.

XX: My politics are from the Bible. We’re supposed to take care of the poor.

AW: Care for the poor is one reason government is supposed to protect our freedom and avoid redistributive destruction of our wealth, so that poor people can pull out of poverty in a functional market economy and so the rest of us can “freely give” to those in need, instead of government extorting our property, preventing us from adequately doing so.

XX: You want to take from the poor and give to the rich.

AW: The Bible condemns excessive and extortive taxation, where certain elites intervene between God and the individual, rob people of their livelihoods and property, then redistribute it while taking a cut (Amos 2:6-8, Matthew 23:25) as Judas Iscariot did (John 12:1-7) though Jesus warned we would always have the poor (hence poverty can’t be prevented by government).

XX: You’re reading into the Bible.

AW: I’m telling you what it says! You say your political philosophy is from the Bible, show me where? Where does it say we’re supposed to escalate the tax rates of those with more than a little bit of property, to set up a bureaucracy, to redistribute enough to the poor to make them continually government dependent, while funneling the rest to members of the “public-private partnership” patronage system (which inevitably corrupts and controls people, as well as extorting them, which is what Jesus condemned in Matthew 23)?

XX: (Chosen distracting comment here, usually an attack.)

So sayeth Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The battlefield has morphed into something akin to herding terrorist cats, with about as much risk of a catastrophic oopsie moment. Our military leaders are beginning to see that one of the myriad uses of the Internet is to launch a vast array of terrorist attacks. With a keyboard and a connection, anyone can reach out and wreak havoc all over the globe. Since the Internet was originally invented for the military, you would have thought that they would have considered this eventuality. But not so much:

“Information technology is the stone in the sling,” wrote Richard Lourie of the Moscow Times, “the cheap weapon that can bring down a Goliath.” Indeed, the top dog in the U.S. military, Gen. Martin Dempsey — known above all as a very keen and sober strategist — has acknowledged that no longer can war be effectively waged away from American shores. Breaking Defense reporter Sydney Freedberg posted the quote: “The homeland is no longer a sanctuary,” Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said. “Some strategic seminars we ran about a year ago [showed that] if we’re engaged in a conflict virtually anywhere in the globe there is likely to be some effect in the homeland, whether it’s potentially ballistic missiles or cyber.”

It seems as though instead of pulling back to protect America at an increased time of threat, we are splattering ourselves even more across the planet. Too many fingers in too many pies. Too many enemies in too many venues. Our enemies know we are weak and spread too thin as well. We are trying to cover our bases with China, Russia, Iran and North Korea and their global terrorist sycophants are ready and willing to do their evil bidding. Thank you Progressives. You have basically neutered the US, the last real protector of true freedom on the planet.

The Pentagon is looking to downsize by 20%, while expanding their cyber warfare teams. They fear an imminent attack from the Internet, but they should also fear an EMP. Iran is now getting ready to conduct another ballistic missile launch. Originally, Obama said that would be a deal breaker on negotiations with them… but it seems he was only joshing. Fire away! We’ll just chase some other political squirrel here in the US, while the radical Islamists get ready to nuke Israel and the US. Ain’t no explosives here, no sir.

With logic that I can’t begin to wrap my head around, the military didn’t seem to think countries like Iran and North Korea were a cyber threat till now. All of the sudden, a professor or two says, “Hey! What if they got the ability to do that?” Well, duh. What do you think the Axis of Evil has been diligently working on for years? Their golf swing?

Meanwhile, while we play ‘what if,’ America is indeed no longer a sanctuary. We are not protected by oceans any more. Cyber attacks are a click away from anywhere on the planet, EPMs can be launched at us and not show up on radar (because we aren’t looking by the way). We’ve allowed terrorists over our borders with G-d knows what and what does our fearless, Marxist leader do? He takes a selfie at a terrorist Communist’s funeral, shakes hands with Raul Castro, hugs dictators and flirts with the Danish Prime Minister. That pretty much says it all.","2013-12-12 09:42:15","1","24.0","9.0","15.0","1.0","22.0","0.0","148.0","95.0","0.0","81.0","0.0","6.0","1","598","80.36","76.40","26.46","9.37","15.74","20.07","80.60","51.00","10.03","6.19","0.33","3.34","0.67","0.33","1.51","3.85","9.20","13.55","7.86","5.69","5.69","2.01","13.04","3.34","1.84","1.00","1.51","3.01","6.86","2.68","4.01","1.84","1.84","0.00","8.70","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.50","11.20","2.68","1.51","1.17","3.68","1.17","3.18","2.34","1.00","0.84","0.50","0.84","0.50","0.17","0.00","0.17","13.55","4.01","1.84","6.52","1.00","1.17","2.51","9.70","0.50","12.54","1.51","7.69","3.51","2.68","1.17","0.00","0.17","0.33","0.50","1.67","0.00","0.67","0.50","0.33","0.00","17.22","6.02","5.18","0.33","0.00","0.67","0.33","0.17","1.84","1.67","0.33","0.67","2702","7.53","19.0","827","598","38","72.46","10.3","7.1","9.8","8.7","118","5.642857142857143","16.172976588628764","349","17.16","8","0.48","0","17","9","70","1","72","47","2","0","9","64","76","1","27","0","0","28","9","43","3","0","3","13","0","30","10","13","13","21","20","1","5","0","0"

New Zeal

The Western world is facing a serious security issue.

Incredible as it may seem, the planet’s most important financial center, is about to come under communist control.

New York City, under Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, is about to lose much of its dynamism, tourist appeal and security, as hard core Marxists get ready to colonize all the City’s main organs of power.

This disastrous change in direction was signaled at a recent meeting in the Communist Party USA‘s Henry Winston Auditorium.

The Friends of the People’s World hosted its yearly fundraiser on Dec. 8, 2013 at the Better World Awards:

This year was an exceptional one; the Friends of the People’s World hosted the event for an overflow audience at the Henry Winston Auditorium. Our Honorees were exceptional ­­– as they always are — but being a participant at Sunday’s event was truly special, special because one could envision a world without racism. The diversity of the participants, black, brown and white of various ages, was absolutely wonderful; not only did it show the power of the movement that is changing the politics and economics of America but it showed too the idea that socialism is on the minds of many ordinary citizens.

Estevan Bassett-Nembhard, New York City organizer for the Communist Party, opened the event with the message, “Let it be said that, in the 2013 elections, voters in the five boroughs put the 1 percent on notice. Reaching consensus on jobs not jails, schools not corporate tax breaks. The voters of the city voted to move our city in a new direction.” The audience broke out into chants of “Yes we can.”

Connecticut activist Joelle Fishman, host of the event and chair of CPUSA’s Political Action Commission, introduced the honorees. “I am very honored and excited to be here today at the Better World Awards to share your celebration of the great election victory in New York that has captured the attention of the entire country,” said Fishman. “This election is a victory over racism. It is a victory over stop and frisk. It is a victory over 20 years of direct Wall St. rule. But it is only a beginning. To realize the possibilities, everyone here has an important part to play going forward.”

She then proceeded to introduce and deliver the awards to Raglan George, Zakiyah Ansari and Lethy Lirianoand; the lifetime achievement award to Vinie Burrows and Ellen Perlo.

Ellen Perlo’s son, Art Perlo, spoke in loving admiration of his mother’s life’s work; a lifetime member of the Communist Party USA, working for a more just and peaceful world. While nourishing her passion for justice and equality, she assisted her husband Victor Perlo — “world-renowned economist and author” — in researching and editing his work. At 98, she continues to produce art and participates in the work of the Party. Art Perlo didn’t mention that his father, Victor Perlo, was once a member of the famous Ware Group Soviet spy ring in 1940’s Washington DC.

From “humble beginnings, to Advocacy Director with the New York State Alliance for Quality Education, to member of the new Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio’s transition team,” Zakiyah Ansari, BWA honoree, told “an extraordinary story of awareness and accomplishment”:

Zakiyah was one of two New York City Coalition for Educational Justice parent leaders appointed to the City Council Task Force on Middle Schools. The Task Force led to recommendations adopted by the NYC Department of Education and the Campaign for Middle School Success. As a result, more than $30 million has gone to some of the lowest-performing middle grade schools to support school improvement efforts.

Zakiyah Ansari has a history of People’s World interviews. Often an indication of Party membership.

Executive Vice Chair of the CPUSA, Jarvis Tyner, introduced the keynote speaker, Raglan George, Jr., Executive Director of District Council 1707. Rags, as he is known, was born and raised in new York City and has been active in the labor movement for over 40 years:

His union represents childcare workers; those who are expected to give the very young their first or pre-school exposure to a well-rounded education.

Raglan quoted former South African Communist Party Central Committee member Nelson Mandela: “There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.”

“We live in New York City.” George said. “Millions of our children are being mis-educated and hundreds of thousands of our children have been unlawfully stopped and frisked and have been made sub-human by the authorities. New York City has one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation for young people of color. Under the Bloomberg Administration the homeless rate has risen 13 percent.”

He continued: “We applaud the election of Bill Di Blasio, Tish James and Scott Stringer. Di Blasio’s nearly fifty point vote over Republican Joe Lhota gives us a mandate that New Yorkers want safe, affordable and quality child care for our children. And we must do everything in our power to insure that the coming administration succeeds against the naysayers who continually want to diminish the public service sector. Di Blasio will be under tremendous pressure from capital, the right and the commercial press to mitigate his goals, but we must stay focused and support him.”

Letitia James sent a tribute to the 2011 Better World dinner and was a founder of the far left New York City Council Progressive Caucus.

Scott Stringer was close to the recently deceased Estelle Katz, a member of both the Communist Party USA and the Chelsea Reform Democratic Club.","2013-12-12 11:00:09","1","37.0","13.0","15.0","0.0","24.0","0.0","154.0","95.0","0.0","84.0","0.0","6.0","0","955","96.67","82.97","21.33","92.55","21.70","25.34","77.07","40.52","5.86","3.04","0.10","1.26","0.10","1.36","0.21","2.83","9.74","13.61","5.55","1.78","4.29","0.63","9.01","5.97","2.41","0.31","3.25","1.57","5.24","4.71","0.52","0.10","0.00","0.31","10.26","0.52","0.21","0.63","1.15","5.34","0.94","1.05","0.63","0.84","0.94","1.36","1.47","0.63","0.63","0.21","0.31","0.00","0.10","0.10","0.10","13.40","4.61","3.77","5.76","2.09","0.63","3.35","5.45","0.63","15.81","1.78","9.32","5.13","6.39","1.78","0.00","0.84","0.10","0.10","0.63","0.00","0.31","0.21","0.10","0.00","15.81","4.71","5.03","0.52","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.84","2.41","1.57","0.00","0.21","4563","8.62","27.685714285714287","1430","949","44","58.01","12.6","10.5","11.84","13.0","235","9.0","20.545163329820866","514","24.2","9","0.41","0","34","25","99","1","108","66","3","2","7","147","208","1","41","1","1","23","17","24","0","1","1","25","0","24","38","12","18","11","24","4","2","0","0"

The Communist Party USA is very happy about the Barack Obama/Raul Castro handshake at he funeral of a third communist leader Nelson Mandela.

The communists see this as a symbolic event on the way to a long term revolutionary goal – the “normalization” of US-Cuba relations.

From the People’s World:

A handshake that shook the world

In the spirit of Nelson Mandela, President Obama stopped and shook the hand of Cuban President Raul Castro at the memorial to Mandela in South Africa.

Instantly and predictably, the U.S. far-right Republicans and their mouthpieces went crazy. Now, nobody in their right mind could argue with following the example Mandela set of talking, negotiating and finally reconciling with one’s enemies, especially when history has moved to a new stage. But nobody said the tea party types are in their right mind.

More important, the idea that Cuba is the “enemy” of the United States is a relic of the last century’s Cold War and needs to be finally thrown on the ash heap of history. Not just the idea, but also the numerous anti-Cuba policies, starting with the U.S. embargo and travel ban. History has indeed moved to a new stage and it is time for our policy to reflect that. It is heartening to see the Obama administration ease the most extreme Bush-era sanctions against our neighbor. Much more needs to be done.

U.S. anti-Cuba policies have hurt our own economy and isolated our country from the rest of the world, in particular the countries of North, Central and South America and the Caribbean. The United States stands out like a sore thumb, the only country in the hemisphere that does not have normal relations with the socialist island 90 miles from Florida’s shores.

It was a handshake that shook the world, fittingly done at Mandela’s memorial. Yes, Mr. President, let us all honor Mandela’s legacy – a man whom you rightfully described as understanding “the ties that bind the human spirit” – and finally establish neighborly ties to Cuba.","2013-12-12 11:28:40","1","30.0","16.0","15.0","0.0","24.0","0.0","151.0","100.0","0.0","102.0","0.0","6.0","0","343","95.85","80.91","44.15","10.89","22.87","21.57","78.72","45.48","7.00","3.21","0.00","1.75","0.29","0.29","0.87","3.79","12.83","12.83","5.25","3.50","4.96","1.17","10.50","4.96","2.04","0.58","0.58","1.46","4.66","1.75","2.92","0.87","1.17","0.58","9.33","0.00","0.58","0.00","0.58","5.54","2.04","0.00","0.87","0.29","0.87","1.46","1.75","0.58","0.29","0.87","1.17","0.58","0.29","0.00","0.29","9.62","5.54","0.87","3.50","0.29","0.29","3.50","5.54","0.29","17.78","2.62","9.33","5.83","3.21","0.87","0.58","0.29","0.58","1.17","0.58","0.00","0.00","0.58","0.00","0.00","16.03","6.41","4.08","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.46","1.75","1.75","0.00","0.29","1593","8.25","23.466666666666665","509","340","17","59.64","13.2","9.9","11.2","11.7","78","7.0","19.176470588235293","200","21.2","9","0.44","0","13","2","45","0","36","26","0","0","1","57","56","3","14","0","0","6","7","17","2","1","1","9","0","8","11","6","6","7","12","4","1","0","1"

By: Sara Noble

Independent Sentinel

‘We are at war’, David Horowitz told me in a phone interview today, at war with the leftists – Marxist radicals – who, under Barack Obama, are destroying the economy, the healthcare system, the education system, and our standing in the world.

Horowitz is writing an encyclopedic series of books on communism to inform conservatives about the dangerous enemies now seated at the precipice of unfettered power in this country. His books will give us the tools to fight them. His first book is now available and it is a book people need to read. I read it yesterday and it clarified who and what Barack Obama is for me. I will no longer say he is incompetent. He is probably the most competent president we have had. He is succeeding in destroying traditional America.

David Horowitz has published the first book in a series of ten which are aimed at educating conservatives about progressivism and the forces of evil that have been poisoning our culture, our schools, and our government for the last forty years.

The Black Book of the American Left, Volume I, My Life and Times is a compilation of selected essays that take the reader through Mr. Horowitz’ conversion from communist activist to one of the bravest fighters for conservative ideals we have today. It is much more than a collection, it is a ‘collective portrait of the left.’ It will ‘help Conservatives understand how we got to the point of electing a man who wants to take down our country.’

Mr. Horowitz’ conversion came when he discovered his ‘friends’ in the Black Panther Party had murdered a friend he sent to help them with their bookkeeping. The torture and murder of Betty Van Patter was so traumatic that it took him ten years to come out of it. He came out as a conservative fighting a lonely and courageous battle.

One of those who is believed responsible for Betty Van Patter’s murder, according to Mr. Horowitz, is a vicious ex-Panther named Elaine Brown. She now lives in Atlanta and has become a public speaker. She is still the same person and the fact that she is free is a paradox of American justice.

Horowitz quotes Elaine Brown: Faith was all there was, if I did not believe in the ultimate rightness of our goals and our party then what we did, what Huey was doing, what he was, what I was, was horrible.

Quite a remarkable statement. The end justifies the means is implicit in what she clearly thinks is a type of religion that allows monstrous acts for the cause as they see it.

Horowitz’ departure from the communist party also led to his alienation, at age 35, from lifelong friends and a complete shunning by some in the media who were once his most ardent supporters, before his change of heart. He came to the conclusion that the ideology of the left must always end in totalitarianism.

He decried the hypocrisy of leftists who would claim they are fighting for peace in Vietnam but ignored the massacres that followed.

In an interview I conducted with Mr. Horowitz today, he said that conservatives need to understand what progressivism is about and the Republican Party needs to speak out.

I asked him what the difference was between communism and progressivism and he said ‘they are the same thing.’

One of the things that has clouded peoples’ understanding of what is going on is the fact that we are being led to believe that the worst we are facing is European socialism. I asked Mr. Horowitz about that and he said, ‘it’s much worse than that, it’s communism.’

Mr. Horowitz is an intellectual who grew up as a ‘red-diaper’ baby steeped in communism. His conversion is nothing less than remarkable. His knowledge of what communism is and how it has become a dominant force in our society is something every conservative needs to know but will conservatives read the books? The future of the Republic depends on conservatives knowing what they are dealing with. We can’t fight what we don’t understand.

Mr. Horowitz said ‘we are at war.’ People must understand that and they must be ready to fight.

Reading the series of books will be enlightening if the first volume is an example of what is to follow. The first volume explains how social justice has become the means by which they sell their leftist ideology. Mr. Horowitz said ‘its phony, it’s not real.’

The leftists, which Mr. Horowitz calls the left, the ‘neo-communists’ (neo-coms). They hate America and what America stands for. They want to tear it down and install their utopia. Mr. Horowitz’ book clearly explains why.

When I asked Mr. Horowitz about Obamacare, he said Obama is ‘destroying the finest healthcare system in the world.’ ‘Obamacare is communism,’ he added.

‘Obama is a communist,’ he affirmed.

Horowitz sees education as the place where leftism gained its foothold into society, beginning with the Catholic colleges and universities. He spoke out against the unions during our interview and said that K-12 schools should be on a voucher system with parents getting the money, not the schools.

He briefly addressed common core which he has not studied. He is against any centralized education – it’s more statism.

Horowitz told me that ‘conservatives are classical liberals’ because they want two sides of the story told. Leftists only want one side of the story and they are ‘not liberal.’ There is nothing liberal about them. People, especially need to stop calling them liberals and playing into the deception.

The Sentinel has previously complained that calling the forces taking root in America by their rightful names – communism or socialism – is not-PC, even in conservative circles, so let’s simply describe what they are doing, which is what communists do.

Nelson Mandela is dead at 95. He is an iconic figure of the Left, and was the most highly recognized leader of a movement that dismantled South Africa’s Apartheid government. Mandela was no doubt a tough man, having survived twenty seven years in South African prisons. But make no mistake, he was a communist who loudly proclaimed the virtues of other murderous communists like Fidel Castro and Yasser Arafat.

While a lot of his activities were whitewashed following his election as South Africa’s first post-Apartheid president, and creation of a “coalition” government in South Africa, he actually followed Robert Mugabe’s leadership model in Zimbabwe. That is, having established themselves in power, the communists waited until the international media spotlight moved elsewhere to begin dismantling the highly successful capitalist economy that had existed before.

During its Apartheid years, South Africa was the migratory destination for Africans all over the continent because even under Apartheid, blacks in South Africa lived better than they did in countries ruled by communist black leaders. Apartheid, like all artificial economic barriers, was also collapsing under its own weight, as economic prosperity chipped away at its restrictive policies. Allowing it to die on its own would have enabled South Africa to preserve what was good, i.e. their vibrant economy, while slowly transitioning to a majority ruled government.

Today South Africa is rapidly sliding toward Zimbabwe, where government rape, theft and murder of blacks and whites alike is the norm. While the leadership lives like parasitic kings on the dying host of their nation, the country itself is headed into the sewer. Despite his charisma and charm, Mandela has to be recognized as the father of the malevolent forces now at work throughout Africa, turning that continent into a wasteland of misery and poverty.","2013-12-06 11:53:00","1","18.0","4.0","15.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","138.0","95.0","0.0","81.0","0.0","6.0","0","313","93.43","69.54","32.11","25.77","26.08","29.07","74.12","42.49","7.35","3.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.92","1.28","4.15","7.35","15.02","6.71","1.60","5.43","0.64","10.22","3.19","3.51","0.96","3.19","1.60","4.15","1.92","1.92","0.64","0.96","0.32","7.35","0.32","0.00","0.00","2.88","7.35","1.60","1.92","0.64","0.96","0.64","1.60","0.96","0.32","0.32","0.32","1.28","0.00","0.64","0.32","0.32","10.54","1.28","3.51","6.39","0.96","0.32","4.47","5.11","0.32","17.57","2.24","10.86","4.47","5.11","0.96","0.00","1.60","0.00","1.60","1.28","0.00","0.96","0.32","0.00","0.00","13.10","4.79","6.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.64","0.96","0.00","0.32","1625","8.95","24.384615384615383","489","311","14","48.94","13.5","11.9","14.04","15.1","83","7.083333333333334","21.55524115755627","200","22.08","0","0.41","0","8","8","28","0","45","24","2","0","1","46","41","1","17","0","0","7","9","13","0","1","0","5","0","5","19","10","11","3","8","2","2","0","1"

After decades of denials by both Mandela and the Party, the South African Communist Party has at last admitted Nelson Mandela‘s leading role in their organization.

Mandela wasn’t just a member of the Moscow-controlled party. He was a secret leader of the SACP’s Central Committee.

From the SACP’s Umsebenzi Online:

Last night the millions of the people of South Africa, majority of whom the working class and poor, and the billions of the rest of the people the world over, lost a true revolutionary, President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, Tata Madiba.

The South African Communist Party (SACP) joins the people of South Africa and the world in expressing its most sincere condolences to Ms Graca Machel and the entire Mandela family on the loss of what President Zuma correctly described as South Africa’s greatest son, Comrade Mandela. We also wish to use this opportunity to express our solidarity with the African National Congress, an organisation that produced him and that he also served with distinction, as well as all his colleagues and comrades in our broader liberation movement. As Tata Madiba said: “It is not the kings and generals that make history but the masses of the people, the workers, the peasants…”

The passing away of Cde Mandela marks an end to the life of one of the greatest revolutionaries of the 20th century, who fought for freedom and against all forms of oppression in both their countries and globally. As part of the masses that make history, Cde Mandela’s contribution in the struggle for freedom was located and steeled in the collective membership and leadership of our revolutionary national liberation movement as led by the ANC – for he was not an island. In Cde Mandela we had a brave and courageous soldier, patriot and internationalist who, to borrow from Che Guevara, was a true revolutionary guided by great feelings of love for his people, an outstanding feature of all genuine people’s revolutionaries.

At his arrest in August 1962, Nelson Mandela was not only a member of the then underground South African Communist Party, but was also a member of our Party’s Central Committee. To us as South African communists, Cde Mandela shall forever symbolise the monumental contribution of the SACP in our liberation struggle. The contribution of communists in the struggle to achieve the South African freedom has very few parallels in the history of our country. After his release from prison in 1990, Cde Madiba became a great and close friend of the communists till his last days….

In honour of this gallant fighter the SACP will intensify the struggle against all forms of inequality, including intensifying the struggle for socialism, as the only political and economic solution to the problems facing humanity.","2013-12-07 09:33:21","1","24.0","11.0","15.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","139.0","95.0","0.0","83.0","0.0","6.0","0","458","98.64","90.48","15.25","70.93","32.71","28.60","81.66","46.29","6.99","4.37","0.00","1.97","0.00","1.97","0.44","2.62","12.23","17.69","2.84","1.75","6.77","0.87","5.46","5.90","3.06","0.87","1.09","2.62","7.21","4.80","2.40","1.09","0.44","0.44","14.19","0.44","0.87","0.22","2.40","7.86","1.31","1.75","0.66","0.22","2.18","2.18","0.44","0.00","0.22","0.22","0.87","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.44","15.28","6.99","2.40","6.33","0.87","0.44","3.06","1.31","0.87","13.97","1.09","8.95","3.93","3.71","3.06","0.22","0.66","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","11.79","3.49","5.02","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.66","1.53","0.44","0.00","2253","9.12","33.214285714285715","715","457","14","38.39","15.5","16.0","12.83","18.9","112","9.0","24.843063457330416","221","27.86","6","0.47","0","18","3","64","0","70","36","2","3","2","65","73","0","31","0","0","8","14","16","0","0","0","8","0","6","16","7","5","3","8","3","4","0","0"
