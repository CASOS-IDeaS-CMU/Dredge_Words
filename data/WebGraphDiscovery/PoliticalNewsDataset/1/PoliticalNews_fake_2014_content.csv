Eight years after they sued Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Cargill and Nestlé for allegedly forcing them to work as child labor on a Côte d’Ivoire cocoa plantation, three young men from Mali have won a small victory – the ability to be heard in a California court.

The lawsuit was first filed as a class action to represent thousands of former plantation workers in July 2005 by the Washington-based International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF) and Global Exchange, which is based in San Francisco. The non-profit organizations recorded videotape testimony from the three specific individuals who stated that they had been lured across the border between 1994 and 2000 with the promise of easy work and good wages.

“Plaintiffs, aged 12 to 14 when first forced to work as child slaves, had to work 12 to 14 hour days with no pay. They often worked with guns pointed at them, and were given only the bare minimum of food scraps,” write their lawyers in the complaint. “Plaintiffs were locked in small rooms at night with other child slaves so they could not escape the plantations. They were whipped and beaten by the guards and overseers when the guards felt they were not working quickly or adequately.”

“I tried to run away but I was caught … as punishment they cut my feet and I had to work for weeks while my wounds healed,” one of the three boys is heard saying on video tape. All three are now adults living in the city of Sikasso, Mali, after escaping slave-like conditions on plantations in Abobogou and Region de Man in Cote d’Ivoire.

The lawsuit has its origins in a 1997 report by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) that estimated that some 200,000 children are smuggled across borders in West African countries like Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Togo. A later U.S. State department report estimated that some 15,000 children between the ages of 9 and 12 were forced to work as on cocoa, coffee, and cotton farms in northern Cote d’Ivoire.

After media reports documented such cases in 2001, Nestlé and other major chocolate producers signed a six point agreement with the International Labor Organization in 2001 that they would ensure that their products to be made without slave labor by July 1, 2005.

In 2005 Global Exchange and ILRF’s investigations found that the companies had failed to fulfill their promises.

“Nestlé crossed a very bright line and proceeded in bad faith,” Terrence Collingsworth, executive director of ILRF told Forbes magazine. “It’s clear the only way they are going to change is if they get smacked.”

An amended complaint was filed on July 22, 2009, accusing the three companies of being complicit in the slave trade: Cargill from Minneapolis which buys cocoa beans and operates a cocoa processing plant in Côte d’Ivoire; ADM of Decatur, Illinois, which imports cocoa and manufactures chocolate-based products in factories in California; and Nestlé from Switzerland, which markets chocolate products in the U.S.

The plaintiffs argued that the case could not be heard in Côte d’Ivoire because courts there are “notoriously corrupt” or Mali because it lacked basic laws.

The lawsuit hit a roadblock in 2010 when U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson dismissed the case saying that U.S. laws did not allow corporations to be sued in for abuses abroad.

However, in April last year, when the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a case against Royal Dutch Petroleum for human rights abuses in Nigeria, the court ruled that lawsuits against corporations for abuses overseas could be brought in U.S. courts in specific circumstances.

Based on that ruling, Dorothy Nelson and Kim Wardlaw, two appeals court judges, ruled on December 19 that the plaintiffs should be allowed to show that the defendants fulfilled the “actus reus” standard for aiding and abetting a crime.

"http://realfarmacy.com/why-did-deputy-eric-vaughan-assault-this-woman-for-taking-tylenol/","Why Did Deputy Eric Vaughan Assault This Woman For Taking Tylenol?","OHIO Shocking surveillance footage from a court waiting room has been released which shows Summit County Sheriff’s Deputies assaulting and injuring a woman for taking Tylenol. The mother of three, Siobhan Householder, 35, was waiting at the courthouse around 2:35 pm when Deputy Eric Vaughan wrestled her to floor to pull her hair and pry open her mouth.

According to Ohio.com:

[quote style=”boxed”]“He said, ‘What are you taking?’ and I said, Tylenol,” she recalled. “And he said, ‘Spit it out’ and I said, ‘I can’t.’ I meant to say I can’t spit it out because I had already swallowed the other pills. “But I didn’t even get that part out before he just yanked me up and threw me down on the ground and was trying to dig these pills out of mouth. “And there was one [pill] in there and I couldn’t even get it out because he kept shoving his hand in my mouth and squeezing my face and pulling my hair at the same time.”[/quote]

The deputies caused a bloody mouth, a bruised chin, bruised legs, and pulled out quite a bit of hair. They confiscated her Tylenol that she was taking for a tooth infection, 26 ibuprofen tablets, and charged her with resisting arrest as well as obstructing official business.

A court spokeswoman claims that Householder was in custody and therefore did not have the right to take her Tylenol although court records reflect that she was “remote booked and released on a domestic relations case.”","2014-05-19 08:42:49","0","57.0","32.0","76.0","0.0","66.0","0.0","73.0","41.0","0.0","168.0","0.0","42.0","2","255","59.15","48.43","24.51","19.89","25.50","20.00","81.18","51.76","15.69","11.37","5.10","0.00","0.39","5.49","0.39","4.31","5.88","12.55","5.49","3.92","8.63","1.96","14.51","1.57","1.57","1.18","2.35","0.78","1.18","0.39","0.78","0.00","0.39","0.00","9.41","0.39","0.00","4.31","1.96","7.06","1.57","1.57","0.39","0.78","0.00","2.75","3.53","0.39","2.35","0.78","8.63","4.71","3.92","0.00","1.57","5.10","0.39","0.39","1.96","2.35","0.00","7.45","3.92","0.00","13.33","1.96","9.02","2.35","0.78","0.39","1.57","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.78","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.00","21.96","4.31","5.10","0.78","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.00","5.10","3.14","0.00","3.14","1117","7.32","32.5","314","250","12","75.74","9.3","7.9","10.1","11.2","42","5.857142857142857","17.040000000000003","159","27.88","10","0.5","0","16","6","15","0","29","10","0","0","2","40","18","0","7","0","0","25","7","11","0","0","4","6","0","12","20","13","6","5","3","1","1","0","1"

"https://realfarmacy.com/people-who-grow-their-own-food-labeled-extremist-by-dept-of-defense/","People who grow their own food labeled 'extremist' by Dept. of Defense","If the founding fathers were reincarnated today, they’d probably start another revolution, this time to break away from an American government that has become far too imperial for its own good.

And as such, they’d be labeled “extremists” by those who mean to rule us.

In fact, the nation’s founders are considered extremists by the Pentagon, according to a new “training manual” that explicitly labels the framers as such.

Discovered by legal watchdog Judicial Watch via a Freedom of Information Act request, the manual was part of 133 documents provided by the Air Force. The January 2013 Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute “student guide” is entitled “Extremism.” The document says that it is “for training purposes only” and “do not use on the job.”

Believe in freedom? You’re an extremist…

The manual defines an “extremist” as “a person who advocates the use of force or violence; advocates supremacist causes based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or national origin; or otherwise engages to illegally deprive individuals or groups of their civil rights.”

In addition, it says, “Nowadays, instead of dressing in sheets or publicly espousing hate messages, many extremists will talk of individual liberties, states’ rights, and how to make the world a better place.”

So, if ye love liberty and freedom more than ye love a big, powerful central government that has grown well beyond its constitutional boundaries, you’re an extremist. If ye dare to take care of yourself, to be an individual who grows his own food (weren’t there a number of farmers and plantation owners in the group of founding fathers?) ye are an enemy of the state.

Under the section, “Extremist Ideologies,” the manual states, “In U.S. history, there are many examples of extremist ideologies and movements. The colonists who sought to free themselves from British rule and the Confederate states who sought to secede from the Northern states are just two examples.”

Though the document released today by Judicial Watch was obtained from the Air Force, it originated in a DOD office and is, therefore, thought to likely be used in other agency components, said Judicial Watch.

“The Obama administration has a nasty habit of equating basic conservative values with terrorism. And now, in a document full of claptrap, its Defense Department suggests that the Founding Fathers, and many conservative Americans, would not be welcome in today’s military,” long-serving JW president Tom Fitton said.

“And it is striking that some [of] the language in this new document echoes the IRS targeting language of conservative and Tea Party investigations. After reviewing this document, one can’t help but worry for the future and morale of our nation’s armed forces,” he added.

This isn’t the first time the federal government, one of its agencies or some other “official” source has equated freedom-loving Americans who have an originalist view of the Constitution and its meaning with extremists.

Irreconcilable violence ahead?

Per InfoWars:

In 2009, Infowars obtained the “law enforcement sensitive” contents of a Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC) report entitled “The Modern Militia Movement” which listed supporters of presidential candidates Ron Paul, Chuck Baldwin, and Bob Barr as potential “militia” influenced terrorists.

Also, in July 2012 Infowars blew the lid on a Department of Homeland Security-funded study, produced by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland, that characterized Americans who are “suspicious of centralized federal authority,” and “reverent of individual liberty” as “extreme right-wing” terrorists.

In the past couple of decades it became clear that the federal government has become increasingly hostile towards anyone or any political movement that seeks to curb its power. Constitutionalists are portrayed as kooks and psychos, while the ruling class is portrayed as righteous, forthright and proper.

This is dangerous, for not only has it made dialogue next to impossible, but it has also created a climate of irreconcilability that could someday lead to violence.

The State of Michigan is ordering that Detroit man Carnell Alexander pay approximately $30,000 in back child support or go to jail, despite the fact that a DNA test proved that he is not the father of the child in question.

In child support cases, courts sometimes force people to pay back the government’s welfare contributions to a child, even in scenarios when the person being ordered to pay support is not actually the child’s parent. According to WXYZ-TV ABC 7 Detroit, Detroit man Carnell Alexander is facing that exact situation after an ex-girlfriend of his listed him as the father of her child on an application for welfare benefits. Despite the facts that a DNA test proved that he is not the father and his ex-girlfriend agrees that he should not have to pay support, the State of Michigan is ordering him to either pay back the nearly $30,000 worth of welfare contributions it paid to the child’s mother or go to jail.

In 1991, Alexander was informed during a routine traffic stop that there was a warrant out for his arrest due to his failure to pay support for a child that he had allegedly fathered back in 1978. However, Alexander had no children. In a court hearing, the state claimed that he was listed as a child’s father on a welfare benefits application and that too much time had passed for him to request a DNA test to contest its paternity claim. The court argues that he knowingly ignored a court order requiring him to pay support and that he should have raised the issue when that order was given to him. In the late ’80s, a process server signed a document alleging that the court order was delivered to Alexander at his father’s house and that he refused to sign it. However, WXYZ-TV ABC 7 Detroit made contact with the Michigan Department of Corrections and confirmed that Alexander was incarcerated at the time of the delivery of the court order, meaning it was impossible for him to have seen the order and refused to sign. Alexander maintains that he never saw the order and knew nothing of the alleged paternity dispute until he was pulled over and informed many years later.

At one point, Alexander scraped together money for an attorney, despite being underemployed, but legal help did not produce results. However, he has yet to attempt to have an attorney contest the validity of the aforementioned process server’s form alleging that Alexander saw the court order. Based on his alibi placing him in jail at the time that the order was served, it appears that the document claiming that he saw the order might have been fraudulently or erroneously filed.

Alexander subsequently tracked down the mother alleging paternity and obtained a DNA test which proved that he is not the father. The mother told WXYZ-TV ABC 7 Detroit, “I had to turn to welfare to get assistance… and I had to put him down as the father. That was the only way I could get assistance… He shouldn’t have to pay it at all. I want everything to go away for him so he can go on with his life.” After she asked the court to waive the paternity claim, a judge assigned to Alexander’s case waived the portion of the child support judgment that would have been given to the child’s mother, but kept alive the order requiring him to pay back the government’s welfare contributions made on his behalf.

“I feel like I’m standing in front of a brick wall with nowhere to go,” said Alexander.

In the 2007 Florida Supreme Court case Parker v Parker, a Florida man’s $216,000 child support judgment was upheld even after DNA evidence proved that the child in question was not his. At the time, state law required that paternity be contested within one year of a divorce, and, due to the fact that he at that time believed his ex-wife’s claim that the child was his, he did not attempt to challenge paternity. Publicity about the case eventually led Florida politicians to change the law requiring such claims to be filed within one year.

"http://realfarmacy.com/the-u-s-moves-to-legalize-hemp-production/","The U.S. Moves To Legalize Hemp Production","Hemp literally has hundreds of uses, including being able to replace plastic, oil, and conventional building materials. Hemp has also been cultivated for over 12,000 years, and was even also used as a legal tender up until the early 1800s. Its wonderfully diverse list of uses makes many wonder if hemp is, along with cannabis, kept illegal to prevent competition.

The hemp market in California alone, is currently estimated to be valued at $500 million (annually), and the state houses more than 50% of the nation’s hemp production companies. The movement to legalize and regulate industrial hemp is growing, and the market offers an opportunity for farmers who seek sustainable agriculture.

Multiple attempts to legalize hemp have moved through Congress, each attempt only seeking to allow the states to regulate industrial hemp cultivation. It would also allow colleges and universities to grow hemp for research in states where hemp production is allowed. The first bill currently on the table is the Farm Bill, cosponsored by representatives Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Thomas Massie (R-KY), and Jared Polis (D-CO), passed the House on a vote of 225-200 in July and now goes to a joint House-Senate conference committee. The second, an Industrial hemp Farming Act (House Resolution 525 and Senate Bill 359), is also pending.

Governor of California Jerry Brown, has now signed legislation which allows farmers in California to grow industrial hemp. Titled ‘Senate Bill 566′, authored by Senator Mark Leno and co-authored by Allan Monsoor, it would permit farmers to grow hemp for sale of seed, oil, and fiber, to numerous manufacturers and businesses who currently rely on international imports of raw hemp products. The California Industrial Hemp Farming Act sailed through the State legislature without any issue. It also made it through the Senate with zero ‘no’ votes, and the Assembly with only 4 against in the final vote.

“In the past year, the conversation to legalize the cultivation of hemp has gained momentum at the federal level, and it is only a matter of time before a farmer’s right to grow hemp is restored. Hemp, which is already found in hundreds of consumer products manufactured in our state, is a perfect crop for California. It has great potential to revitalize family farms, create new jobs and stimulate the economy.” – Sen. Leno D-San Fransisco

Currently, there are several states with legislation in place for the regulation of industrial hemp, and others are following suit. After receiving notice that the Department of Justice was going to ease off of smaller non-violent “drug crimes” in a sense. The newly passed hemp farming act in California will help to create new jobs and other economic opportunities for farmers and manufactures, as well as to inspire new entrepreneurship. However, don’t start growing without worry just yet: the bill does not go into effect until it is authorized by federal law.

“We feel confident that California will finally have an industrial hemp law later this year ensuring that California farmers are ready and able to cultivate hemp upon federal approval.” – Patrick Goggin, California legal counsel for the industry group Vote Hemp.

After the Justice Department made the announcement that they were going to allocate less attention and resources to marijuana crimes, more states have moved to eliminate the barriers which prevent them from growing industrial hemp. Hemp really is amazing, with so many different uses. Its low ecological cost means there are so many benefits from using it in everything from construction, to clothing, to food. This opens up many more opportunities for American citizens to prosper and provide for themselves.

If so, then in nine states you can be jailed and your driver’s license suspended for “DUI” even if you were not in the least bit high. THC is the chemical compound in marijuana that makes you high, but there are others as well that have no such effect. These latter chemicals can remain in your bloodstream for a month or so after smoking a single joint. Nine states now have laws that if such chemicals are detected by the police, then you can be jailed and fined and have your driver’s license suspended, even if you are not accused of driving “under the influence” of alcohol or any other substance. Call it revenge of the drug warriors over the inevitable national legalization of pot, combined with local government obsession to rob us of as much loot as they can get away with. (Look for Mayor Bloomberg to begin testing NYC drivers for traces of sugary soft drinks in their blood and imposing a “fat tax” on them for the “crime.”).

"http://realfarmacy.com/monsanto-ordered-to-pay-93-million-for-poisoning-citizens/","Monsanto Ordered to Pay $93 Million for Poisoning Citizens","by CHRISTINA SARICH

Big wins can happen in small places. The West Virginia State Supreme Court finalized a big blow to the biotech giant Monsanto this month, finishing a settlement causing Monsanto to pay $93 million to the tiny town of Nitro, West Virginia for poisoning citizens with Agent Orange chemicals.

The settlement was approved last year, but details were worked out only weeks ago as to how the funds were to be spent.

The settlement will require Monsanto to do the following:

-$9 million will be spent to clean dioxin contaminated dust from 4500 homes.

-$21 million will be spent to test to see if people have been poisoned with dioxin.

-Citizens will be monitored for such poisoning for 30 years, not just a few months.

-An additional $63 million is to be allotted if additional tests for dioxin contamination testing is necessary.

-Anyone who lived in the Nitro area between Jan. 1, 1948, and Sept. 3, 2010 will be tested for dioxin. Although they must show proof they lived in the area, they will be eligible for testing even if they no longer live in Nitro.

-Former or present employees of Monsanto are not eligible for any of these benefits.

-An office will be set up to organize testing for Nitro citizens. The registration of participants is to be overlooked by Charleston attorney Thomas Flaherty, who was appointed by the court.

-Residents have a right to file individual suits against Monsanto if medical tests show they suffered physical harm due to dioxin exposure.

Monsanto Produced Toxic Chemicals in Nitro

Just how were Nitro citizens exposed to dioxin? Monsanto was producing the toxic herbicide Agent Orange in Nitro, and dioxin is a chemical byproduct of the substance. It is known to cause serious health conditions. The factory which produced Agent Orange was opened in Nitro in 1948 and remained in operation until 2004, even though usage of this herbicide in the past (in Vietnam and other Asian countries) was fatal to millions of citizens and the war veterans who were exposed to it.

“There is no doubt that during and after the war, many Vietnamese absorbed this very toxic material [dioxin]. It is our belief from toxicological research and epidemiologicalstudies from many countries that this dioxin probably resulted in significant health effects in Vietnam.” – Arnold Schecter and John Constable

“It’s been a real long haul,” attorney Stuart Calwell told The Charleston Gazette. Calwell represented Nitro area residents in a class action suit that prompted Monsanto to make the settlement.

“The politics of dioxin has been bitterly debated since the Vietnam War, but … we know that there is a health issue there and hopefully people will get their houses cleaned and the risk will come to an end and those exposed in the past will have the benefit of keeping an eye on their health.”

The people of Nitro still need to fill out a register to receive the benefits outlined in the settlement. Due to the pivotal nature of this landmark settlement, Nitro citizens need to participate as fully as possible to set a precedent for other class action suits that farmers and consumers of GMO foods around the world might wage against Monsanto in the future to finally take them down. If enough of us do it at once, then even their bloated coffers will finally be depleted, and we can enjoy a world without being poisoned to death.

While this case did not involve glyphosate, another deadly toxin used in Monsanto herbicides such as RoundUp, its time will come soon.","2014-07-27 06:25:49","0","82.0","43.0","76.0","0.0","66.0","0.0","79.0","41.0","0.0","182.0","0.0","45.0","2","593","89.37","58.01","20.33","12.39","21.18","25.13","77.91","48.06","6.75","2.19","0.00","0.67","0.00","0.00","1.52","4.55","7.59","15.85","9.44","3.88","5.40","1.01","14.00","3.88","1.18","1.01","3.04","0.84","3.71","1.35","2.36","0.34","1.35","0.17","5.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.59","0.67","2.02","1.52","2.19","0.51","3.04","1.52","1.35","0.00","0.00","3.88","0.17","3.20","0.34","0.17","4.55","0.67","0.51","2.36","1.01","0.34","4.89","6.91","2.87","13.83","1.01","7.93","5.06","5.56","0.00","0.67","1.18","0.17","0.84","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.14","4.72","3.20","0.17","0.00","0.17","0.00","1.35","1.01","0.17","0.34","1.01","2830","7.9","24.75","892","595","28","58.32","13.0","10.4","11.37","12.5","121","8.2","18.654453781512604","308","22.0","3","0.45","0","16","16","56","0","75","36","0","0","16","79","63","1","41","0","0","14","5","24","1","0","4","27","0","35","22","9","26","9","10","2","3","0","2"
"http://realfarmacy.com/women-sterilized-in-california-prisons-to-cut-welfare-costs/","Women Sterilized in California Prisons to Cut Welfare Costs","by AMANDA FROELICH

Yes, this is a real thing going on – in California of all places. In order to cut welfare costs of possible children being had in the future, doctors have sterilized over 150 women.

These procedures cost California taxpayers $147,460 between 1997 and 2010, but the physicians at the prison argue it is money well-spent.

“Over a ten year period, that isn’t a huge amount of money compared to what you save in welfare paying for these unwanted children,” stated Dr. James Heinrich, OB-GYN at Valley State Prison for Women.

Such a procedure may seem harsh, but it is not illegal. It was in 1927 that the Supreme Court allowed forcible sterilization of women in jail during Buck vs Bell. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. spoke for the majority saying, “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”

He wrote, “We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the state for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence.”

In the California prison, women are not being forced to be sterilized, but they claim doctors are pressuring them to make such that decision. One inmate commented, “I figured that’s just what happens in prison – that’s the best kind of doctor you’re going to get.”

A regulation in the state does require an approval for each sterilization procedure, but the doctors were easily able to get around that. The prison medical manager admitted she signed off on the sterilizations since Heinrich listed them as a “medical emergency.”

What are readers’ thoughts on this? Are these sterilizations wrong? Or is it right for a small group of people to decide for the masses something this serious, like the prevention of (expensive) generations of children who may be exposed to drug and crime-filled lives?

"http://realfarmacy.com/how-does-your-state-measure-up-in-the-local-food-movement/","How Does Your State Measure Up in the Local Food Movement?","The number of farmers markets in the U.S. has more than doubled in the past ten years. This reflects a growing interest in locally produced food and a growing awareness of the dangers that centralized, industrialized food production poses to our health and the environment.

But not all areas of the country share the same enthusiasm. Using several parameters related to local food production and consumption, Strolling of the Heifers (SOTH) compiled a report known as the “Locavore Index.”

Locavorism, as described by SOTH, is based on several data sources related to farmers markets, community supported agriculture (CSA), and food hubs in a per-capita comparison of consumers’ interest in eating locally-sourced foods.

It’s not a surprise to learn that Vermont ranks first, with 16 farmer’s markets or CSA programs per 100,000 residents. Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Hawaii, Rhode Island, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Montana, and Iowa make up the top 10 states with the most locavorism. Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire kept their respective first, second, and third place spots from 2013.

Little enthusiasm is evident across the southernmost part of the country, as Nevada, Arizona, Louisiana, and Texas rank worst in terms of local food availability per capita. Even though Texas has a good total number of farmers markets and CSAs, it is not proportionate to a population of over 26 million. Florida is on the rise taking 41st place, a large leap from 50th place in 2013.

Vermont is a leader in local and sustainable food. Besides the high demand among its residents and the state’s agricultural heritage, Vermont has implemented economic strategies to boost local food and agriculture. Secretary of Agriculture Chuck Ross said:

“A strong local food system creates economic opportunities, preserves the working landscape, serves the nutritional needs of a region, and provides a point of connection for the community.”

Let’s continue to support locavorism in our own cities and towns. Support local farmers and advocates working to bring our food system into a realm of sustainability, good health, and sound local economies.

Mainstream medicine has been claiming for decades that aspirin lowers our risk of heart attack, stroke and even reduces the risk of cancer. All of these assumptions, which were never conclusively proven in any study have been subjected to the scrutiny and criticism of hundreds of health experts. Now, the most comprehensive review ever undertaken by Warwick Medical School for the NHS National Institute for Health Research has concluded that people should avoid aspirin altogether.

The review, conducted by the research arm of the NHS, said the dangers of bleeding in the brain and stomach caused by aspirin exceed any benefit of the long-standing recommendation by millions of physicians worldwide.

The conclusion by researchers was to avoid taking the drug until there was more evidence. Prof Aileen Clarke, who led the research, said: “The risks are finely balanced and for now there is not the evidence to advise people to take it.”

Aspirin is so inexpensive that some doctors in recent years have recommended a daily dose of about 100 mg for anyone to prevent heart disease. But the very large, European-based Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis (AAA) study, among others, suggested it was very irresponsible and very risky for doctors to make the claim.

By taking aspirin, people seriously increase the risk of a hemorrhagic stroke or internal bleeding with absolutely no benefit to compensate for the risk.

Highly controversial and poorly designed studies have even suggested aspirin cuts the risk of some cancers, something even oncologists regard as very unlikely adding more doubt to the thousands of scientific publications biased towards pharmaceuticals.

Aspirin is also associated with up to 25% of asthma-related hospitalizations. Aspirin has been found to be responsible for conditions that involve multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal congestion. Such patients who have been hospitalized in such cases have also been diagnosed with polyps (small benign growths) in the nasal passages.

“Lots of people believe that these medications are completely safe because they’re available over the counter,” says Dr. Gary C. Curhan, an epidemiologist at Harvard School of Public Health. “But we know that (they) can have multiple other effects. This would be one more thing that people should consider if they use these medications on a regular basis.”

Amy Thompson, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, added: “The jury is still out as the risks are likely to outweigh the benefits.”

According to a study by the University of East Anglia, people who take aspirin regularly for a year or more are also increased their risk of developing Crohn’s disease.

Daily aspirin therapy can have a rebound effect that may increase your risk of heart attack. Many who decide to suddenly stop daily aspirin therapy have been found to trigger blood clots due to the dependency on the drug. Gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions, tinnitus and even stroke are all complications related to taking aspirin.

Several studies related to routine low-dose aspirin therapy found that any benefit was offset by gastric bleeding in men and women. On top of that, both sexes have been found to suffer bleeding in the brain while consuming aspirin.

"http://realfarmacy.com/this-is-how-doctors-are-conning-millions-into-taking-blood-pressure-meds/","This Is How Doctors Are Conning Millions Into Taking Blood Pressure Meds","by DAVE MIHALOVIC

There are millions of people who are currently being misclassified as having high blood pressure, when in fact findings show that these people are not actually more likely to die prematurely than those with ‘normal’ blood pressure. In addition, what used to be classified as normal or high-normal blood pressure (a systolic pressure of 120-139 mm Hg and diastolic pressure of 80-89 mm Hg) is now categorized as prehypertension.

It’s a little strange. All of a sudden, the experts are telling millions of people who thought they were healthy that they now have this condition called prehypertension.

Under the influence of Pharamaceutical directives, Clinical Medicine has encouraged lowering the norms for high blood pressure to ultimately sell more hypertensive medications which are no better than natural remedies at reducing the mercury. Professor Giuseppe Mancia, Director of Clinical Medicine at Milan-Bicocca University announced that there should be new recommended threshold values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and that the standard 140/90 mmHg should be lowered to 130/85 mmHg.

Hypertension expert, J. M. Wright, MD, PhD said this prevailing medical belief is found to be baseless and perhaps even harmful. Whether they have heart disease or not, people with high blood pressure are usually put on multiple drug therapy to reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke. A Cochrane review identified the seven trials that had tested this ideal and found that it didn’t hold up to scientific scrutiny. Using drugs to reduce blood pressure lower than the standard target, 140/90 mmHg, did not prolong survival or reduce stroke, heart attack, heart failure or kidney failure.

Other health experts including reputable physicians and medical researchers agree. Many insist that any decrease in the established blood pressure norms are not based on mortality figures and merely a ploy to increase the market for hypertensive drugs and statins. “Normal blood pressure should statistically be in the range of 110/70 mmHg to 130/85 mmHg for the majority of the population,” said Clinical Physician Dr. Raj Amarthi.

Taylor and colleagues’ article in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, shows that in those under 50, diastolic blood pressure (lowest pressure within the bloodstream, occurring between heart beats i.e. when the heart relaxes) is the more important predictor of mortality, whereas in those over 50, systolic blood pressure (the highest pressure within the bloodstream, occurring during each heart beat i.e. when the heart contracts) is the stronger predictor. The authors argue it is time to consider a new definition of ‘normal’ blood pressure.

Taylor and colleagues examined the independent contribution of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) on mortality, as well as how these relationships might affect the number of Americans currently labeled as having abnormal blood pressure.

The authors looked at data for 13,792 people from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which enrolled participants in 1971-76 and followed them up for two decades — they studied DBP, SBP and long-term survival data specifically. In order to assess the underlying distribution of untreated blood pressure in American adults by age, Taylor and team also looked at data for 6,672 adults from the first National Health Examination Survey carried out between 1959 and 1962.

They found that in people aged over 50, those with SBPs above 140, independent of DBP, were significantly more likely to die prematurely. In those aged 50 or less, DBPs above 100 were linked to significant increases in premature death. The authors’ analysis offers alternative cut-off points for the definition of ‘normal’.

Dr. Taylor concludes: “Our findings highlight that the choice of approach used to define normal blood pressure will impact literally millions of Americans. If we cannot reliably see an effect on mortality in a large group of individuals followed for nearly 20 years, should we define the condition as abnormal? We believe considering this kind of approach represents a critical step in ensuring that diagnoses are given only to those with a meaningful elevation in risk, and targeted towards individuals most likely to benefit.”

"http://realfarmacy.com/grow-endless-supply-lemons-indoors/","How to Grow an Endless Supply of Lemons Indoors","Growing a lemon tree from seed is surprisingly easy. Generally, lemon trees flourish outdoors year-round in hot areas, but they can also grow indoors as edible houseplants. They can be easily grown from seed and are a nice looking plant. It requires very little equipment and a few seeds from an organic lemon.

How To Grow A Lemon Tree From Seed

Summary

Step 1

Slice the lemon in half and pick out the seeds. Rinse the seeds with warm water. Rub off the as much flesh as possible off the seeds to prevent rot. It is important that you plant the seeds right after you take them from the lemon fruit. They will not tolerate drying.

Step 2

Plant the seeds approximately one-half inch deep in the potting soil, moisten the soil slightly, cover the top of the pot with plastic wrap to keep the soil and seed moist. Check the moisture in the soil daily.

Step 3

Put the plant in the sunlight. It will take time for the plant to outgrow the cup. You should see a sprout in a month to two months.

Step 4

Move to a bigger pot as the lemon tree grows.

When life gives you lemons, grow trees!

If you’ve ever seen a flowering lemon tree, you’ll understand why. For those of you who haven’t, allow me explain. Their lush, dark green, oval leaves have a glossy texture that shimmers in sunlight. Their delicate white flowers bloom with a citrus fragrance and are soft to the touch. Their exotic nature provides an alluring quality. And, finally, they bear the exciting possibility of fruit!

Typically, lemon trees flourish outdoors year-round in hot, sunny regions, but they can also thrive indoors as edible houseplants in cold-season climates. At the organic food store where I work we have a healthy lemon cutting producing massive fruit in a garage setting all year. It makes for an impressive sight during the dead of a Canadian winter!

And while rooting cuttings is a sensible option for fast fruit, lemon tree cuttings are not readily available in many parts of the world. But lemons are another story. And although it may take anywhere from 3-6 years for your tree to be capable of producing fruit, there is something extra rewarding about starting from seed. I currently have six strong little seedlings on the go, all of which were germinated in the middle of winter with very little effort. Watching them grow has been an exciting and fascinating experience and I know the best is yet to come.

Here is a step-by-step guide to growing your very own lemon tree from seed:

Things you’ll need:

1. A lemon. Make sure you purchase an organic lemon since some non-organic lemon seeds may be “duds”, incapable of germinating. Any organic lemon will do, but if you have climate or space restrictions, you may want to try looking for a specific variety called a “Meyer” lemon. Meyer lemons are a smaller type of lemon, often grown for ornamental purposes, and are thus better suited for indoor containers. I chose Meyer seeds for these reasons, but you can use any seed that makes sense for your situation.

2. Potting soil. I would guess that any potting soil will do, but I suggest using one with a blend of peat, perlite, vermiculite, and organic fertilizer. Every single one of the seeds I planted in this type of certified organic potting mix have sprouted beautifully, so I think it’s fair to say that it works.

3. Container/pot. A container (with drainage holes) that is 5-6” deep and a few inches in diameter will be sufficient for sprouting; however, the seedling will need to be re-potted into a much larger container. Mature lemon trees prefer a container that is wider rather than deeper, so I suggest planting your seedling in a pot that is 10-16” deep and 12-18” in diameter. Your baby tree will happily make itself at home in this larger container for the next few years, at which time you may want to upgrade again.

4. A grow light or lots of sun. Lemon trees need a lot of light, especially when they are sprouting and require 10-14 hours of it each day. If you don’t have a consistently sunny window (like me), get a grow light. They don’t cost much and will prove their worth in healthy green foliage.

Method for sprouting the lemon seed:

1. Pre-moisten your potting soil. Put some soil into a bucket and mix in some water until the soil is damp all the way through.

2. Fill your container with the pre-moistened soil. Leave about an inch of space below the rim of your container.

3. Slice open your lemon and choose a seed that looks completely full of life. Pop it into your mouth and suck on it until all the flesh is removed and the lemon flavour is gone. Do not allow the seed to dry out at any time. It needs to stay moist in order to germinate. I suggest keeping it in your mouth until you’re ready to plant.

4. Plant your seed! While it’s moist, plant your seed about 1/2″ below the soil level. Cover it completely with soil and water well with a squirt bottle or gentle watering can.

5. Cover your container with breathable plastic to keep your seeds warm and moist. I used a piece of clear garbage bag with holes poked into it and a rubber band to securely hold it in place.

6. Place the container in a warm location and observe for the next few days. Keep in mind: your seed needs warmth and moisture in order to germinate. Don’t allow the potting soil to dry out completely. Also take caution that you don’t cook your seed in its little greenhouse. Too much heat and moisture could lead to a rotten seed! You’re aiming to achieve a nice balance, so if you feel like the soil is warm enough without the plastic then it’s probably safest to remove it.

7. In about two weeks you may notice a sprout emerging from the soil. Once it appears, remove the plastic (if it’s still on) and place the little guy in a warm location with plenty of direct sunlight. Supplement sun with your grow light if needed.

8. Care for your new baby and watch it grow! Provide it with:

-Water. Ensure that the soil is damp at all times, especially when your lemon tree is young. Do not allow it to sit in a puddle of stagnant water though; those drainage holes are there for good reason.

-Sunlight. Place it in a warm sunny window where it will receive eight hours of direct sunlight each day, or supplement some sun for a grow light. Since Toronto rarely seems to get any sun in the winter, my sprouts reside in a well-lit window under the warm rays of a grow light for 12 hours each day.

-Food. In order to keep your lemon tree healthy and growing the soil will eventually need to be replenished with nutrients. I suggest feeding it an organic fertilizer, such as compost or vermicompost, once it has developed a nice little set of leaves. Dig a little trench around the base of your tree, fill it with compost and water it well. Or, serve it up as compost tea. Try feeding it twice a year or as needed, but do not overfeed! When it comes to fertilizing, less it best; so if in doubt, put it off a bit longer. (Another option is to start your seed in potting soil with vermicompost or worm castings mixed into it).

-Love. Spend some time looking at your new citrus friend. Pay attention to its growth. Feel it, talk to it, sing to it, but don’t try to dance with it. Get into the habit of watching for browning leaves and checking the underside of leaves for pests. Just like us, our plants can fall victim to bugs and disease and may sometimes require some extra love and affection.

It’s not a total ban, but it’s at least a victorious battle against the evil empire of Monsanto and the sociopathic biotech industry. After many months of grassroots demonstrating, blocking bulldozers and construction of a Monsanto seed factory in Argentina, a three-person court ruled two to one that construction of a Monsanto GMO seed plant must be halted until an environmental impact study is completed.

Of course, Monsanto is taking this decision to a higher court with claims that they did their own environmental study and the paperwork for construction on that site was approved by Argentine construction bureaucracies. They played the typical corporate rights card, which tends to appeal to individual rights philosophies even among libertarians, unfortunately.

The pesticide human health issue

The motivating force behind expanding anti-Monsanto demonstrations, including life-threatening demonstrations on the seed plant construction site, was the growing health problems near soy fields sprayed with Roundup. Farmers who sign up for Roundup Ready seeds are forced into using Roundup as part of Monsanto’s contract.

Monsanto’s end product is Roundup. It is primarily a chemical company. The birth deformities and spontaneous abortions that many farmers in the USA have reported in their GMO soy- and corn-fed livestock have plagued Argentine humans living near GMO soy fields.

The fields were often sprayed from the air. And mysterious illnesses were occurring among adults and children near those fields during the 12 years that Argentina had bought into GMO soy production to boost its economy.

"http://realfarmacy.com/vermont-passes-landmark-gmo-labeling-law/","Victory In Vermont! Senate Passes GMO Labeling Law","Today, by a vote of 28-2, the Vermont state Senate passed H.112, a bill to require mandatory labeling of foods sold in Vermont that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The bill also makes it illegal to call any food product containing GMOs “natural” or “all natural.” Unlike bills passed last year in Maine and Connecticut, which require four or five other states to pass GMO labeling laws before they can be enacted, Vermont’s law contains no “trigger” clauses, making it the first “clean” GMO labeling law in the country.

The bill now goes back to the House which is expected to agree to the Senate’s amendments, then to Gov. Peter Shumlin who is expected to sign it.

Ronnie Cummins, national director of the Organic Consumers Association (OCA), issued the following statement:

Today’s victory in Vermont has been 20 years in the making. Ever since genetically modified crops and foods entered the U.S. food supply in the early 1990s, without adequate independent pre-market safety testing and without labels, U.S. consumers have fought to require the labeling of foods containing GMOs.

Consumer demand for mandatory labeling of GMOs spawned a national grassroots movement that has persevered despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent by the biotech and food industries to lobby state lawmakers in Vermont, and to fund anti-labeling campaigns in California (2012) and Washington State (2013).

Today, consumers and a number of principled legislators in Vermont made it clear to Monsanto, Coca-Cola and other opponents of consumers’ right to know: We will not back down. This movement is here to stay.

We expect that Monsanto will sue the state of Vermont in order to prevent enactment of H.112. We also expect that Monsanto will lose, and the law will go into effect on schedule, on July 1, 2016.

We expect that the Grocery Manufacturers Association, a multi-billion lobbying group representing more than 300 food, pesticide and drug makers, will try to pass their “Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2014,” introduced last week by Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), intended to strip Vermont, and all other states, of their right to pass GMO labeling laws. And we expect that Congress will not pass this law, dubbed the DARK (Deny Americans the Right to Know) Act, which seeks to deny consumers the right to know if their food has been genetically engineered, and deny states the right to enact laws designed to protect public health.

Vermont’s landmark victory today will force food companies to either label GMOs in all states, or reformulate their products to be GMO-free in order to avoid stating “this product was produced using genetic engineering” on their packaging. When Oregon passes a citizens’ ballot initiative to label GMOs in November, as we believe it will, the biotech and food industries will have lost, beyond the shadow of a doubt, their battle to keep consumers in the dark.

The OCA has worked closely over the past several years with the pro-labeling grassroots movement in Vermont. Today we congratulate Vermont activists for their passionate pursuit of this law, Vermont lawmakers for having the courage to pass the law, and Vermont citizens for being the first in the country to have the benefit of GMO labels on their food. And we reaffirm our commitment to work with Oregon and other states to pass similar laws, and to fight any and all attempts by industry and/or Congress to overturn these laws.

There is no plant on Earth more condemned than marijuana. We’re talking about a living organism which governments have taken upon themselves to designate as an illegal substance. Despite no existing evidence of anyone ever dying of a marijuana overdose, possession of this plant is still illegal in many parts. Marijuana has been found to suppress cancer, reduce blood pressure, treat glaucoma, alleviate pain and even inhibit HIV. It is an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective. Can you understand more now why it’s illegal?

No Independent Study Has Ever Linked Marijuana To Psychosocial Problems

Cannabis is one of the most powerful healing plants on the planet. Dozens of studies have made pseudoscientific attempts to indicate that young people who use cannabis tend to experience psychological, social problems and mental decline. However, there is no evidence that marijuana use is directly linked with such problems, according to the results of a study published in The Lancet.

“Currently, there is no strong evidence that use of cannabis of itself causes psychological or social problems,” such as mental illness or school failure, lead study author Dr. John Macleod of the University of Birmingham in the UK told Reuters Health.

“There is a great deal of evidence that cannabis use is associated with these things, but this association could have several explanations,” he said, citing factors such as adversity in early life, which may itself be associated with cannabis use and psychosocial problems.

Macleod and his team reviewed 48 long-term studies, 16 of which provided the highest quality information about the association between illicit drug use reported by people 25 years old or younger and later psychological or social problems. Most of the drug-specific results involved cannabis use.

Cannabis use was not consistently associated with violent or antisocial behavior, or with psychological problems.

In another study, Scientists from King’s College, London, found occasional pot use could actually improve concentration levels.

The study, carried in the American Journal of Epidemiology, tested the mental function and memory of nearly 9,000 Britons at age 50 and found that those who had used illegal drugs as recently as in their 40s did just as well, or slightly better, on the tests than peers who had never used drugs.

‘Overall, at the population level, the results seem to suggest that past or even current illicit drug use is not necessarily associated with impaired cognitive functioning in early middle age,’ said lead researcher Dr Alex Dregan.

Dr Dregan’s team used data on 8,992 42-year-olds participating in a UK national health study, who were asked if they had ever used any of 12 illegal drugs. Then, at the age of 50, they took standard tests of memory, attention and other cognitive abilities.

Overall, the study found, there was no evidence that current or past drug users had poorer mental performance. In fact, when current and past users were lumped together, their test scores tended to be higher.



The Age of Deception is Ending

In 2003, the U.S. Government as represented by the Department of Health and Human Services filed for, and was awarded a patent on cannabinoids. The reason? Because research into cannabinoids allowed pharmaceutical companies to acquire practical knowledge on one of the most powerful antioxidants and neuroprotectants known to the natural world.

The U.S. Patent 6630507 was specifically initiated when researchers found that cannabinoids had specific antioxidant properties making them useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and HIV dementia. Nonpsychoactive cannabinoids, such as cannabidoil, are particularly advantageous to use because they avoid toxicity that is encountered with psychoactive cannabinoids at high doses useful in the method of the present invention.

In a historic and significant moment in American history, last November, Colorado became the first US state to legalize marijuana for recreational use. The impact of the decision could ripple across the entire country with vast opportunities to educate millions on the top health benefits of marijuana.

With the passage of I-502 in the 2012 Washington State election, marijuana also became legal in Washington–not just for medical use, but also for recreational use. Weed is still illegal as far as the United States government is concerned, but Washington and Colorado both have yet to figure out how that will work. It’s certain that this issue will continue to evolve and smooth out as time goes by, but the remaining states will eventually follow suit or be left behind with outdated laws.

Top Health Benefits

It’s no surprise that the United States has decreed that marijuana has no accepted medical use use and should remain classified as a highly dangerous drug like heroin. Accepting and promoting the powerful health benefits of marijuana would instantly cut huge profits geared towards cancer treatment and the U.S. would have to admit it imprisons the population for no cause. Nearly half of all drug arrests in the United States are for marijuana.

According to MarijuanaNews.com editor Richard Cowan, the answer is because it is a threat to cannabis prohibition “…there really is massive proof that the suppression of medical cannabis represents the greatest failure of the institutions of a free society, medicine, journalism, science, and our fundamental values,” Cowan notes.

Besides the top 10 health benefits below, findings published in the journal PLoS ONE, researchers have now have now discovered that marijuana-like chemicals trigger receptors on human immune cells that can directly inhibit a type of human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) found in late-stage AIDS.

Recent studies have even shown it to be an effective atypical anti-psychotic in treating schizophrenia, a disease many other studies have inconsistently found it causing.

1. Cancer

Cannabinoids, the active components of marijuana, inhibit tumor growth in laboratory animalsÂ and also kill cancer cells. Western governments have known this for a long time yet they continued to suppress the information so that cannabis prohibition and the profits generated by the drug industry proliferated.

THC that targets cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 is similar in function to endocannabinoids, which are cannabinoids that are naturally produced in the body and activate these receptors. The researchers suggest that THC or other designer agents that activate these receptors might be used in a targeted fashion to treat lung cancer.

2. Tourette’s Syndrome

Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological condition characterized by uncontrollable facial grimaces, tics, and involuntary grunts, snorts and shouts.

Dr. Kirsten Mueller-Vahl of the Hanover Medical College in Germany led a team that investigated the effects of chemicals called cannabinols in 12 adult Tourette’s patients. A single dose of the cannabinol produced a significant reduction in symptoms for several hours compared to placebo, the researchers reported.

3. Seizures

Marijuana is a muscle relaxant and has “antispasmodic” qualities that have proven to be a very effective treatment for seizures. There are actually countless cases of people suffering from seizures that have only been able to function better through the use of marijuana.

4. Migraines

Since medicinal marijuana was legalized in California, doctors have reported that they have been able to treat more than 300,000 cases of migraines that conventional medicine couldn’t through marijuana.

5. Glaucoma

Marijuana’s treatment of glaucoma has been one of the best documented. There isn’t a single valid study that exists that disproves marijuana’s very powerful and popular effects on glaucoma patients.

6. Multiple Sclerosis

Marijuana’s effects on multiple sclerosis patients became better documented when former talk-show host, Montel Williams began to use pot to treat his MS. Marijuana works to stop the neurological effects and muscle spasms that come from the fatal disease.

7. ADD and ADHD

A well documented USC study done about a year ago showed that marijuana is not only a perfect alternative for Ritalin but treats the disorder without any of the negative side effects of the pharmaceutical.

8. IBS and Crohn’s

Marijuana has shown that it can help with symptoms of the chronic diseases as it stops nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

9. Alzheimer’s

Despite what you may have heard about marijuana’s effects on the brain, the Scripps Institute, in 2006, proved that the THC found in marijuana works to prevent Alzheimer’s by blocking the deposits in the brain that cause the disease.

10. Premenstrual Syndrome

Just like marijuana is used to treat IBS, it can be used to treat the cramps and discomfort that causes PMS symptoms. Using marijuana for PMS actually goes all the way back to Queen Victoria.

Mounting Evidence Suggests Raw Cannabis is Best Cannabinoids can prevent cancer, reduce heart attacks by 66% and insulin dependent diabetes by 58%. Cannabis clinician Dr. William Courtney recommends drinking 4 – 8 ounces of raw flower and leaf juice from any Hemp plant, 5 mg of Cannabidiol (CBD) per kg of body weight, a salad of Hemp seed sprouts and 50 mg of THC taken in 5 daily doses.

Why raw? Heat destroys certain enzymes and nutrients in plants. Incorporating raw cannabis allows for a greater availability of those elements. Those who require large amounts of cannabinoids without the psychoactive effects need to look no further than raw cannabis. In this capacity, it can be used at 60 times more tolerance than if it were heated.

Raw cannabis is considered by many experts as a dietary essential. As a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, raw cannabis may be right u there with garlic and tumeric.

Two 9-year-old students in Vancouver, Washington were deeply embarrassed last week after a classroom policy led to them urinating on themselves.

The policy, implemented by a third-grade teacher at Mill Plain Elementary, forces children to pay $50 in Monopoly money in order to use the restroom. Children receive the fake cash for good behavior and can also choose to buy pizza, popcorn and toys.

Jasmine Al-Ayadhi, whose daughter Reem wet herself, says she supports children learning the value of money but argues that the bathroom policy goes too far.

“When it comes to a bathroom issue, when a child has to pay money to use the bathroom, that’s wrong,” Al-Ayadhi told KATU News. “It’s inhumane. That’s a health issue.”

Al-Ayadhi says Reem, who was down to her last $50, desperately wanted to buy popcorn with her friends and attempted to wait until after class to use the bathroom.

“OK, if you want to use the bathroom it’s going to cost you $50, but then you don’t have money to buy popcorn,” Al-Ayadhi said. “What do you think a child’s going to do?”

Reem, who had no choice but to now change into boys’ basketball shorts provided by the school, says she was then picked on by fellow students.

“It didn’t feel so well because I had to wear boy pants and I did get teased,” Reem said.

Despite being told that she would be contacted by the school’s principal on Friday, Al-Ayadhi says she only heard from the school after a second child came forward Monday.

Merchon Ortega, whose daughter Lilliana wet herself that same day, was visibly upset with the policy as well.

“What kind of kid is going to spend money to go to the bathroom? No child should have to pay to use the restroom, Ortega said. “Are you kidding me? That’s absolutely insane.”

Ortega, who had to change into a used pair of clothes also, says she felt humiliated as well.

“It makes me feel kind of horrible in somebody else’s pants and undies,” Lilliana said.

The teacher-in-question was not seen at the school Monday, reportedly on leave while an investigation is underway.

This is a school,” Al-Ayadhi said. “This isn’t a jail. This isn’t a prison. We send our kids to school to learn and to get a good education.”

"http://realfarmacy.com/monsanto-settle-zombie-gmo-wheat-lawsuit/","Monsanto to Settle on Zombie GMO Wheat Lawsuit","News emerged this week about a possible settlement between Monsanto and the farmers whose wheat was allegedly contaminated by unauthorized genetically modified seeds produced by the biotech firm. Lawyers for a contingent of soft-white wheat farmers in Kansas told a Kansas City federal judge that an agreement had been reached in a class-action lawsuit between Monsanto and a group of wheat farmers in Oregon, where “zombie” GMO wheat contaminated fields last year, throwing off wheat exports in the process.

Monsanto acknowledged that an “agreement in principle has been reached, but not finalized,” and that court-ordered mediation with the farmers continues, according to spokesperson Charla Lord. Details of the reported deal are still being kept private.

Some observers see the likely settlement as a “chink in the armor“ of the biotech company.

“Monsanto never settles unless they’re seriously vulnerable, and the farmers and lawyers involved in this case should reject any settlement,” said Dave Murphy, founder of Food Democracy Now. “Contamination of farmers’ crops has been an integral part of Monsanto’s business plan, and these farmers need to gain strong legal protections from future contamination events, which are happening daily in farmers’ fields all over the world.”

The biotech brouhaha started in 2013, when an Oregon farmer noticed wheat growing in a fallow field. When he sprayed the suspicious wheat with the pesticide Roundup and checked back on the plants a while later, he was puzzled that the wheat hadn’t died. Monsanto has for years been developing a Roundup-resistant wheat seed, but it isn’t approved for commercial use. The genetically engineered wheat is one of the only commodity crops not authorized for sale or human consumption, though Monsanto has publicly stated its plans to continue researching ways to introduce G.E. wheat to the U.S. market.

Meanwhile, the “zombie wheat” case in Oregon spooked export markets, and GMO-wary Japan and South Korea halted U.S. wheat imports, causing a temporary price drop for farmers.

But even a temporary lull in the commodity market can devastate individual farmers. So last June the Oregon farmer, along with a farmer in Kansas, filed suits against Monsanto for negligence that resulted in loss of business. Several anti-GMO groups, including the Center for Food Safety, joined the suit.

“Monsanto has put our farmers’ wheat export market at grave risk. Billions of dollars, and our food supply, is at risk because of Monsanto’s negligence. They must be held accountable,” Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety, said last summer.

Monsanto contended that the case was an “isolated incident,” and a bullish Monsanto executive, Robert Fraley, responded to the suit in a particularly strange way: by alleging that the unauthorized wheat appeared as the result of sabotage.

According to Dr. David B Allen, a retired Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgeon, and medical director at Cannabis Sativa Inc, we may be able to protect ourselves from the Ebola virus using cannabis. While claims like this come forward, others suggest we may not be hearing the full story when it comes to Ebola.

Can Cannabinoids Work?

Cannabinoids may be one of the best disease fighting treatments out there. Cannabinoids refer to any of a group of related compounds that include cannabinol and the active constituents of cannabis. They activate cannabinoid receptors in the body. The body itself produces compounds called endocannabinoids and they play a role in many processes within the body that help to create a healthy environment.

This fact has led a couple of doctors to suggest that in turn cannabinoids can provide sufficient protection from viral infections.

According to Dr. David B Allen:

“There is good scientific evidence that cannabinoids, and in particular Cannabidiol (CBD), may offer control of the immune system and in turn provide protection from viral infections (4). Cannabis has already been recognized to inhibit fungus and bacteria and can be considered a new class of antimicrobial because of the different mechanism of action from other antimicrobials.

Ebola is a complex RNA viral organism that causes the cell to engulf it by pinocytosis, and then the virus hijacks the cell to replicate itself. This replication can involve many mutations in the RNA code that make it difficult to impossible to create an effective vaccine. There are U.S. Patents showing evidence that Cannabinoids have significant anti-viral activity. ” (source)

How It May Work

He states how the Ebola virus causes the cell to produce proteins that hide the virus from the immune system, which allows the RNA virus to hide the infected cell by shielding it from view from the immune system.

He adds that the cause of death by this virus is the body’s own immune response to the actual viral infection itself by triggering the immune killer cells to release the cytokines they hold, which is termed a “Cytokine Storm.”

A cytokine storm forces the body into a toxic shock state, and causes small blood clots to form in all arterioles, which is called Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC).

Since cannabinoids have been shown to prevent Toxic Shock as well as DIC, they could be a viable solution. Of course more testing and research would need to be done on this. Luckily something like cannabis, especially when eaten raw, does not have dangerous side effects and therefore could help in areas where Ebola is actually spreading.

Ebola Info Flooding The Internet

The recent Ebola scare seems to be going viral on the internet. Anything from theories behind how to stop it to theories about it being a bio-weapon. What’s interesting is that (apparently) there are even citizens in West Africa making various claims suggesting that the only ones who’ve fallen ill are the ones who’ve received treatment.

Beyond these claims, the internet has become flooded with potential natural cures and various ways to boost ones immune system, one of them being cannabis.

Is The Recent Ebola Uprising Being Overstated?

This is difficult to say. There is a lot of information going around that claim hoaxes and what not, the truth is it’s tough to tell and the pieces are certainly not all put together. We’re better off exploring this as if it’s factual as opposed to just assuming it’s a lie. But this doesn’t mean jumping straight to the vaccine.

It seems claims coming from outside of the western media state that what is actually happening in areas where Ebola is more common is not quite what is being reported in the media. A man named Nana Kwame from Ghana has stated:

“People in the Western World need to know what’s happening here in West Africa. THEY ARE LYING!!!…. The Red Cross has brought a disease to 4 specific countries for 4 specific reasons and it is only contracted by those who receive treatments and injections from the Red Cross. That is why Liberians and Nigerians have begun kicking the Red Cross out of their countries and reporting in the news the truth.” (source)

What’s also seems to be causing much confusing is the fact that the United States government patented the Ebola virus a few years ago. You can view that here. This is done so that governments or corporations can profit from it, like the vaccine that will be issued in a few months, for example.

I personally believe if there was anything to worry about, it may be the vaccine itself. Remember what happened with the H1N1 vaccine? It was rushed to market and injured a lot of people. In terms of all of the Ebola info, I haven’t found enough information on the topic to make further comments about it.

This does demonstrate one thing though, more and more people are loosing complete trust in corporate media, and it’s becoming harder and harder to find real truthful information.

"http://realfarmacy.com/new-toxic-breed-gmos-gain-approval/","New, More Toxic Breed of GMOs Gain Approval","Two major categories of genetically engineered (GE) seeds currently account for 99 percent of all acreage dedicated to GE crops in the US:

1. Those engineered to withstand high amounts of herbicide, such as Monsanto’s Roundup-Ready varieties

2. Those engineered to produce their own internal insecticide (so-called Bt crops)

The widespread use of these GE crops has led to chemical resistance among weeds and insects alike, despite initial assurances from the chemical technology industry that such an outcome was highly unlikely.

Well, the results are now too evident to ignore—weed resistance has been documented on 60 million acres on farms across the US, and Bt resistant rootworm is being reported in the US and Brazil.

As GE seeds became the norm, chemical resistance rapidly emerged. As a result, farmers have been applying increasingly higher amounts of pesticides in an effort to keep up with rising resistance.

The United States now uses about 1.1 billion pounds of pesticides each year, and mounting research has linked pesticides to an array of serious health problems. What we need is not a new breed of chemical-resistant crops, but that’s exactly what we’re getting…

Even More Toxic GE Crops and Herbicide Receive Approval

Instead of taking a proactive approach to save the environment and human life, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently decided to deregulate Dow Chemical’s next-generation GE crops.

These crops are not only resistant to glyphosate, but also carry resistance to toxins like 2,4-D, a component of Agent Orange, and Dicamba, which has been linked to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The chemical 2,4-D and other herbicides of this class have also been linked to:

-Immune system cancers

-Parkinson’s disease

-Endocrine disruption

-Reproductive problems

Then, on October 15, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its final decision to register Enlist Duo—a new herbicide manufactured by Dow Chemical, to be used on corn and soybeans genetically engineered to tolerate both 2,4-D and glyphosate.

This was the final barrier standing between this new generation of GE crops and their widespread commercialization. According to the EPA:

“The agency’s decision reflects a large body of science and an understanding of the risk of pesticides to human health and the environment… EPA scientists used highly conservative and protective assumptions to evaluate human health and ecological risks for the new uses of 2,4-D in Enlist Duo.

The assessments confirm that these uses meet the safety standards for pesticide registration and, as approved, will be protective of the public, agricultural workers, and non-target species, including endangered species.

The agency evaluated the risks to all age groups, from infants to the elderly, and took into account exposures through food, water, pesticide drift, and as a result of use around homes. The decision meets the rigorous Food Quality Protection Act standard of ‘reasonable certainty of no harm’ to human health.”

EPA Thinks a Few Restrictions Will Safeguard Against Resistance…

To “ensure that weeds will not become resistant to 2,4-D,” the approval of Enlist Duo comes with certain restrictions. For example, Dow is required to search for resistant weeds and report any occurrences of resistance to the EPA.

Farmer education and remediation plans are also part of these additional requirements that must be met. To prevent drift, farmers will not be permitted to spray Enlist Duo from the air, or apply it when the wind speed exceeds 15 miles per hour.

Farmers must also leave a 30-foot “no spray buffer zone” around treated crops. The registration is set to expire in six years, at which time the EPA will evaluate the emergence of resistance.

I do not believe in these assurances of safety. Nor do I think adding a different set of toxins to the growers’ mix will ameliorate resistance. Instead, what we’ll end up with is simply an increasingly toxic food supply and further environmental destruction. As noted by Pesticide Action Network:

“USDA predicts 2,4-D use in corn and soybean production to increase between 500 percent and 1,400 percent over the course of nine years, depending on farmers’ practices and changes in Dow’s share of corn and soybean seed markets.

In making this decision, EPA officials failed to consider several important health and safety factors.

By ignoring the potential synergistic effects of 2,4-D and glyphosate, not addressing the cumulative impacts of the expected increase in 2,4-D use, and failing to implement an appropriate 10-fold safety factor to limit exposures — as required under the Food Quality Protection Act — EPA has given Enlist Duo an unjustified approval, based on a flawed and inadequate review of the chemical’s harms.

In addition, neither USDA nor EPA have looked at the economic impact that Enlist Duo drift will have on surrounding farms and communities.” [Emphasis mine]

Center for Food Safety also cites a 2012 study published in the journal Bioscience, which concluded that this new generation of GE crops “will trigger still more intractable weeds resistant to both glyphosate and 2,4-D.”

We Need a New Direction, Not More Toxins

A lot of harm can be done in six years, and we simply don’t have the time to sit back and wait to see how bad it can get. Just how bad does it have to get before our government starts taking these problems seriously?

What we need is a whole new direction for our agricultural system. We need a system that is NOT reliant on chemicals—one that is not only sustainable, but also regenerative.

Toxic chemicals form the very basis of GE agriculture. Chemicals are added into the soil, on the seed, on the plant, and on some crops herbicides are also added right at harvest, to increase seed release. This technique is called desiccating.

For example, desiccating non-organic wheat crops with glyphosate just before harvest came in vogue about 15 years ago, and Dr. Stephanie Seneff suspects this practice may be the reason why we’ve seen such a dramatic increase in celiac disease since then… It’s important to realize that agriculture today is not driven by true agricultural companies. Patented seeds are actually a creation of the pesticide industry. While they try to portray themselves as “biotechnology” companies, they’re really chemical technology companies, and they have no financial incentive whatsoever to discontinue or even reduce the use of chemicals.

Research Bias Is a Direct Threat to Human Health

As for the “large body of science” the EPA claims to base its foolhardy decision on, it’s worth noting that the vast majority of this research has major conflicts of interest as it is done by the company selling the chemicals. This fact was directly addressed in a January 2014 report on 2,4-D, jointly published by Testbiotech, GeneWatch UK and Pesticides Action Network Europe:

“Many of the publications are authored by the manufacturers’ scientists or are sponsored by the manufacturers of 2,4-D. This leads to large confusion, because on the one hand these papers are scientific, peer reviewed papers, but on the other hand, it can be assumed that the financial interest leads to a bias towards studies showing no negative effects. A recent study by Diels et al. (2011) has shown that in studies with genetically engineered crops, there is a strong relation between funding and outcome.

Some industry financed publications leave out important information, for example Ross et al. (2005), who do not mention results which show a high dermal uptake of 2,4-D… Basically, the industry funded/authored studies lead to a ‘dilution’ of information—a tactic also applied by the tobacco industry. The parallels between the tobacco industry and the pesticide industry are manifold, not only in their argumentation and strategy, but also in the final results – despite the evidence – cancer causing agents are not prohibited.”

All Available Legal Options Will Be Pursued to Stop These Dangerous Crops

Marcia Ishii-Eiteman, PhD, senior scientist with Pesticide Action Network, has called the lack of protection from the EPA and USDA “shocking,” saying: “It’s time for real reform in these agencies. We need a new system of government oversight that is powerful enough to say ‘No’ to Dow and Monsanto when their products will harm the health and livelihoods of our farmers and rural communities.”

In response to the USDA’s and EPA’s complete failure to protect the American public against the growing threat of a toxic food supply and devastating pest resistance that could decimate our natural resources, the Center for Food Safety has announced it will “pursue all available legal options to stop the commercialization of these dangerous crops.” Sixty members of Congress have signed a letter opposing the approval and release of 2,4-D tolerant corn and soybeans. On June 30, 35 prominent doctors, scientists, and researchers also issued a letter of opposition to the EPA. According to Representative Peter DeFazio (D-OR):

“For years, the scientific community has been sounding the alarm about the increased use of herbicides and the link to a multitude of health problems. It’s shocking that EPA thinks it’s a good idea to allow the widespread use of a toxic chemical once found in Agent Orange on this nation’s farm fields. EPA should be working to reverse the trend of chemicals that poison our food supply, water and soil. It will be just a matter of time before weeds develop a resistance to 2,4-D, and the chemical industry comes up with an even more dangerous and potent product.”

Indeed, there’s already a lineup of new GE crops with built-in resistance to a variety of toxic chemicals awaiting federal approval (below). In addition to 2,4-D and Dicamba, each and every one of these will eventually cause resistance. And more than likely, we’ll end up seeing multi-chemical resistance, just as we now have antibiotic-resistant bacteria with multiple-drug resistance:

-ALS-tolerant crops (Pioneer Hi-Bred)

-Bromoxynil-tolerant crops (Calgene)

-Imidazolinone-tolerant crops (BASF)

-Isoxaflutole-tolerant crops (Bayer)

-Sulfonylurea-tolerant crops (DuPont)

The Way Out of This Nightmare Starts at Home

The way off this out-of-control chemical treadmill will decimate profits for the chemical technology industry, and THAT is why they do not want you to know which foods contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). If Americans started making dramatically different food choices, it could quickly revolutionize the US agricultural system because farmers will grow that which sells. If people want uncontaminated organic foods, that’s what farmers will grow—and there’s already evidence that biodynamic farming can be done even on the large scale. In fact, using biodynamic principles, you can grow a lot more food on fewer acres.

Real solutions are available. What’s lacking is the political will to stand up to the chemical technology industry and break its iron grip on our food supply. But we can still get it done, by making conscious choices each and every time we shop for food. Remember, your money either goes to support the chemical-based system that threatens the survival of the earth and your descendants, or it supports a system that can regenerate and revitalize the soil and the environment so that healthy food and healthy people can thrive. To make conscious choices, we need information, and that is why GMO labeling is so crucial.

I recently named the GMA “the most evil corporation on the planet,” considering the fact that it consists primarily of pesticide producers and junk food manufacturers who are going to great lengths to violate some of your most basic rights—just to ensure that subsidized, genetically engineered and chemical-dependent, highly processed junk food remains the status quo.

The insanity has gone far enough. It’s time to unite and fight back, which is why I encourage you to boycott every single product owned by members of the GMA, including natural and organic brands. To learn more about this boycott, and the traitor brands that are included, please visit TheBoycottList.org. I also encourage you to donate to the Organic Consumers Fund. Your donation will help fight the GMA lawsuit in Vermont, and also help win the GMO labeling ballot initiative in Oregon in November.

Voting with your pocketbook, at every meal, matters. It makes a huge difference. By boycotting GMA Member Traitor Brands, you can help level the playing field, and help take back control of our food supply. And as always, continue educating yourself about genetically engineered foods, and share what you’ve learned with family and friends.

What if everything you’ve been taught about the origins of civilization is wrong? Be it that certain pieces of our history have been intentionally hidden, or that we have yet to discover and realize the true story of our past, new archaeological and geological discoveries are revealing that sophisticated civilizations have likely existed in prehistoric times.

Until recently, the archaeological community has spread the view that the beginnings of human civilization started after the last Ice Age, which ended around 9,600 BC. All human ancestors prior to this time were recognized as primitive, uncivilized hunter-gatherers who were incapable of communal organization and architectural design. It was only after the Ice Age, when huge 2-mile deep ice caps that covered much of Europe and North America melted, that our human ancestors started to develop and perfect agriculture, forming more-complex economic and social structures around 4000 BC. Archaeologists believed that first cities started around 3500 BC in Mesopotamia and, shortly after, in Egypt. On the European continent, the oldest megalithic sites are dated around 3,000 BC, and the popular Stonehenge is dated between 2,400 BC and 1,800 BC.

This is the established chronology being taught in schools and believed by modern society. Prehistoric societies such as Atlantis have been declared myth.

Until now. New research now reveals that civilized humans were settled on Earth during the prehistoric era.

“Everything we’ve been taught about the origins of civilization may be wrong. Old stories about Atlantis and other great lost civilizations of prehistory, long dismissed as myths by archaeologists, look set to be proved true.” ~ Danny Natawidjaja, PhD, senior geologist with the Research Centre for Geotechnology at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (Source)

Since 2011, Dr. Natawidjaja and his team have worked on a geological survey site in Indonesia about 100 miles from the city of Bandung. The significance of the site was first recognized in 1914 when megalithic structures made from blocks of columnar basalt were found around a summit of a large hill. When the hill’s summit was cleared of trees, it was realized that the blocks formed five terraces. These were believed to be used for meditation and retreat. The site was deemed sacred by locals and dubbed Gunung Padang, meaning “Mountain of Light” or “Mountain of Enlightenment”. The age of the terrace structures was estimated around 1,500 BC to 2,500 BC.

What Natawidjaja discovered at Gunung Padang was astounding. The hill was actually not a natural hill but a 300-ft high step-pyramid. And what’s even more controversial is that the structure was much older than anyone imagined. Natawidjaja radiocarbon dated the terrace structures at around 500 to 1,500 BC, similar to previous estimates. He also used tubular drills to bring up cores of earth and stone from various depths underneath the surface megaliths. As the drills dug deeper, Natawidjaja continued to discover that the columnar basalt structures extended far beneath the surface and yielded much older dates. At depths of 90 feet and more, the material was found to be 20,000 BC to 22,000 BC years old. Using radiocarbon dating, Natawidjaja and his team proved that man-made megalithic structures and hence a prehistoric human civilization existed well into the Ice Age.

“At 7,000 or more years older than Stonehenge the megaliths of Gobekli Tepe, like the deeply buried megaliths of Gunung Padang mean that the timeline of history taught in our schools and universities for the best part of the last hundred years can no longer stand. It is beginning to look as though civilization, as I argued in my controversial 1995 bestseller Fingerprints of the Gods, is indeed much older and much more mysterious than we thought.” ~ Graham Hancock (Source) “Gunung Padang is not a natural hill but a man-made pyramid and the origins of construction here go back long before the end of the last Ice Age. Since the work is massive even at the deepest levels, and bears witness to the kinds of sophisticated construction skills that were deployed to build the pyramids of Egypt or the largest megalithic sites of Europe, I can only conclude that we’re looking at the work of a lost civilization and a fairly advanced one. ” ~ Dr. Danny Natawidjaja (Source)

The Greek philosopher Plato was also a believer that high civilization existed well into the last Ice Age. His recorded dialogs with other scholars of his time date Atlantis and its submergence by floods and earthquakes at around 9,000 BC, which is, coincidentally, in agreement with modern scientific knowledge about the rapidly rising sea levels towards the end of the Ice Age at 9,600 BC.

The question now arises: What happened to prehistoric civilizations? Why did they not survive the “Younger Dryas” period, which dates from 10,900 BC to 9,600BC? It is known that the Younger Dryas was a truly cataclysmic period on Earth, with immense climate instability and terrifying global conditions. Scientists have long debated the mystery behind this and the reasons for the massive extinction of North American megafauna such as short-faced bears and saber-toothed cats dated around 11,000 BC. Was the same mystery responsible for a massive human population decline and disappearance of advanced prehistoric societies?

New research conducted by geologists around the world, including James Kennett, professor emeritus in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California Santa Barbara, has linked the Younger Dryas period to a cosmic-impact event, possibly a comet collision with Earth. The international research team from 21 universities and 6 countries has identified a distribution of nanodiamonds of extraterrestrial nature at 32 sites in 11 countries, spanning an area of 50 million square kilometers across the Northern Hemisphere. Kennett comments:

“We conclusively have identified a thin layer over three continents, particularly in North America and Western Europe, that contain a rich assemblage of nanodiamonds, the production of which can be explained only by cosmic impact. We have also found YDB glassy and metallic materials formed at temperatures in excess of 2200 degrees Celsius, which could not have resulted from wildfires, volcanism or meteoritic flux, but only from cosmic impact.” (Source)

It’s known that during the Younger Dryas, the Earth experienced great global instability, with a sharp decline in temperatures even colder than during the peak of the Ice Age. A return to a warmer climate around 9,600 BC caused a sudden melting of the remaining ice caps, resulting in a quick rising of the ocean levels.

Kennett and his colleagues believe that the beginning of the Younger Dryas and the sharp temperature decline were caused by a cosmic event, similar to the event responsible for the mass extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. The scientists have called the moment in time illustrated by the nanodiamond datum as an isochron. Was this isochron responsible for creating the mystery of lost civilizations? Kennett believes so:

“It’s not surprising that many large animal species, such as the mammoths, went extinct during this precise time and of course it had huge effects on our ancestors, not just those ‘primitive’ hunter gatherers the archaeologists speak of but also, I believe, a high civilization that was wiped from the historical record by the upheavals of the Younger Dryas.” (Source)

"http://realfarmacy.com/canola-is-the-new-margarine-throw-it-all-out/","Canola is the new margarine - throw it all out","Remember when margarine was the substitute for butter? Hey, I can’t believe it’s not butter! Wow. Margarine is a molecule away from being plastic, and we wonder why so many old folks in America have Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The plastic fat is clogging their brain veins. No oxygen to the brain means expensive 24/7 nursing care, lots of pharmaceutical medications and hundreds of thousands of dollars for sick care. Do you see where this is leading?

America loves their canola! Who would really eat it if they knew that it was made with hexane vapor — a gasoline constituent? Even organic canola that’s “expeller-pressed” comes from something we’re not even supposed to eat in the first place — rapeseed. Canola is not a plant, or at least not until some mad scientists got a hold of rapeseed and altered it. Yes, I know, this is harsh for most people to address. Their canola oil food bar will be dead to them. Forget all those salads — the potato salad, the chicken salad, the tuna salad and the egg salad. Forget the macaroni salad and the pasta salad, all creamy with chunks of other (GMO) food stuff.

(http://www.naturalnews.com)

Canola is like sodium benzoate, as it chokes your cells, ruins your immunity and requires extra “processing” by your body just to filter out the toxic synthetic oil that comes from rapeseed, which Mother Nature never intended as food — that’s why it stinks. You know, when manufacturing and processing companies and corporations make canola, they ALL have to put it through a DEODORIZING PROCESS to remove the stink. Look it up!

(http://www.naturalnews.com)

Canola’s polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) suppress thyroid function

Polyunsaturated fat is a prime source of DNA-disrupting free radicals, thyroid-killing omega-6 fatty acids and metabolism-squashing inflammation. What’s worse for your health than processed white flour, refined sugar and high-fructose corn syrup? Try a distorted ratio of fats, like 16 to 1, where the omega-6s and -9s outweigh the -3s. (http://butterbeliever.com) I really don’t care if organic canola oil is your new margarine, but what I do care about is false advertising, misleading health information and myths that are perpetuated by companies who don’t want to give up their “easy money.”

High in unsaturated fats, canola oil delivers more than a nifty name that was derived from Canadian rapeseed oil. Do expeller presses remove the stink of rapeseed? Erucic acid, the fatty acid in canola, causes heart damage in rats. Are you a rat? Your DNA is 99% the same. Consider this: “Since the year 1995, biotech giant Monsanto has manufactured rapeseeds that are genetically engineered to be resistant to the herbicide RoundUp.

“Today, about 90% of the world’s canola crop is genetically modified.”

So, do you trust the GMO giants of the world to continue serving you “organic” canola? Get smart on oils and do it now. Dr. John Bergman speaks about thyroid adrenal health, oxidation, inflammation and disease reversal. Stop eating canola and all the other processed oils. Learn how to keep a healthy thyroid and adrenals. Check out coconut oil, especially if you cook food with oil, only use real, organic olive oil and keep it raw! (https://www.youtube.com)

"http://realfarmacy.com/the-most-hard-hitting-gmo-report-ever-aired-by-the-mainstream-media/","The Most Hard-Hitting GMO Report Ever Aired By The Mainstream Media","by JOE MARTINO

During what is possibly the most hard-hitting GMO report ever aired by mainstream media, Max Goldberg states: “No long-term studies have ever been done on humans, but when you look at the studies that have been done on animals, it’s pretty appalling. You’re talking about liver damage and kidney damage and when they fed it to hamsters, the third generation of hamsters weren’t able to produce babies, so there’s real safety issues.”

While to alternative news reporters and readers this might not be new information, it is rare that the mainstream media has covered the topic with such openness. The hard-hitting discussion between Carol Alt and Max Goldberg aired on FOX’s ‘A Healthy You’ program. Is this another positive step forward in raising awareness about the dangers of GMOs? Certainly.

Goldberg’s statements refer to a 2007 study published in the journal Archives of Environmental Contamination and Technology that revealed that rats who were fed Monsanto’s MON863 corn for more than 90 days began to show “signs of toxicity” in the liver and kidneys.[1] While it is never certain that what happens in an animal study will happen to humans, rats and humans have a very high number of similarities in biology which is why they are so often used in studies. While it is my opinion that the ethics of such studies are not sound, it is clear to see why they are used.

Another study that reveals the dangers of GMO’s was published in 2010 by Russian biologist Alexey V. Surov. The study tested the effects of Monsanto’s genetically modified soy on hamsters. The study monitored three generations of hamsters over a two year period and found that third generation hamsters not only lost the ability to reproduce, but even began growing hair inside their mouths. [2]

We know for certain that GMO’s have dangerous side effects on animals and we do know that there has not been substantial analysis done on GMO’s to determine their safety for humans. It only seems natural that we would stop the production of GMO’s and instead employ smarter agricultural practices instead of modifying nature in dangerous ways. At the very least, it should be mandatory that every GMO product be labelled so consumers can clearly see what they are buying.

“The real big issue in our country Carol, is that genetically modified food’s are not labeled, so people do not know that they are eating genetically modified foods. Over 60 countries around the world require GMOs to be labeled but the US does not,” Goldberg added. “And why is that? According to the Food & Water Watch, the Ag-Bio tech industry, which owns all these GMOs, has spent $572 million on campaign contributions and lobbying to make sure that they don’t get labeled.”

"http://realfarmacy.com/fact-or-myth-is-stevia-bad-for-you/","Fact or Myth: Is Stevia Bad for You?","by DANICA COLLINS

Since its debut in 2008, Stevia extract has become the darling of sugar substitutes, touted as a calorie-free, “natural” sweetener. In reality, stevia is more of a Frankenstein sugar substitute…a prime example of what happens when food manufacturers turn one of Mother Nature’s creations into a chemical monstrosity.

Stevia as Mother Nature Intended

The Stevia rebaudiana plant is indigenous to South America, and does indeed possess medicinal properties. Paraguay’s indigenous Guaraní have used stevia leaves to treat high blood pressure, obesity, and heartburn for thousands of years. With the rise of artificial sweeteners in the 1970s, alongside the growing awareness of their carcinogenic effects, Japanese researchers began experimenting with the stevia plant. They successfully extracted the sweetest compounds from the leaves (up to 300 times sweeter than sugar). And so began the commercialization of the “holy grail of sweeteners.” American companies such as Coca-cola jumped on board the stevia train with brands such as Truvia and SweetLeaf. These commercialized brands of stevia, however, have evolved far from their “natural” roots.

What You’re Really Pouring into Your Coffee

Stevia extracts go through a refining process that involves approximately 40 steps and the addition of know carcinogenic ingredients, such as acetone, methanol, acetonitrile, and isopropanol. The result is a highly processed, and possibly carcinogenic, sugar substitute that has been linked to liver mutation, fertility problems, and disruptions in energy metabolism.

Let’s take a closer look at some of the added ingredients, many of which are made from GMO corn:

“Natural” Flavors: These sugar alcohols, such as erythritol, maltodextrin, and agave nectar, aren’t easily absorbed by the body and can cause gas, diarrhea, headaches, and other ailments.

Xylitol: This naturally occurring substance is not in itself dangerous, but has been bastardized by the manufacturing process, which pairs it with the heavy metal toxin Raney nickel.

Glycerine: This solvent coats the teeth and interrupts the remineralizing process.

How Stevia Extract Affects Your Health

Our bodies don’t quite know what to do with these calorie-free sugar substitutes. Tricked by the sweet taste, the body activates the insulin response and ushers out glucose from the bloodstream to make room for the incoming sugar load…but no sugar ever enters. To stabilize blood sugar levels, the body then releases the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol, which set to work retrieving stored sugar (in the form of glycogen) from liver and muscle tissue. When this process is continually activated, our adrenal glands burn out, our immune system is weakened, inflammation increases, and thyroid function is disturbed. If your body doesn’t have enough glycogen stored, it can’t convert the inactive thyroid hormone T4 into the active thyroid hormone T3. What happens when your thyroid function is out of whack? Weight gain…hair loss…and fatigue! In fact, numerous studies have shown that rather than contributing to weight loss, artificial sweeteners like stevia actually cause weight gain!

It’s time to replace the unnatural commercialized stevia extracts (and any other artificial sweeteners you use) with a natural sugar source. Raw honey (particularly locally sourced) is a truly all-natural source of balanced fructose and glucose that not only stabilizes blood sugar levels, but also fuels your body with nutrients and enzymes to strengthen overall health and wellness.

"http://realfarmacy.com/fasting-finally-becomes-mainstream-health-recommendation/","Fasting Finally Becomes Mainstream Health Recommendation","by DR MERCOLA

It is nice to see the intermittent fasting approach that I have recommended for some time now is starting to catch on. This is no surprise to me as it is one of the most powerful interventions I know of to move your body into fat burning mode and have your hunger nearly magically disappear. It is a powerful tool to help you keep a healthy weight.

In a new diet book, The Fast Diet: Lose Weight, Stay Healthy, and Live Longer with the Simple Secret of Intermittent Fasting, Dr. Michael Mosley 1 suggests the best way to lose weight is to eat normally for five days a week, and fast for two. On fasting days, he recommends cutting your food down to ¼ of your normal daily calories, or about 600 calories for men and about 500 for women, along with plenty of water and tea.

Dr. Mosley himself claims to have lost 19 pounds in two months by following this recommendation. I lost about seven pounds when I implemented the approach last year, but the most amazing aspect is not the weight loss, it’s the absence of hunger and sugar cravings once you are fat adapted. Your desire to eat unhealthy foods seems to disappear; at least that was my experience.

I prefer to think of intermittent fasting as a lifestyle rather than a diet. It’s a way of living and eating that can help you live a longer, healthier life. I promoted the health benefits of intermittent fasting well before it hit the mainstream, and have been experimenting with different types of scheduled eating in my own life for the past two years. I currently restrict my eating to a 6-7 hour window each day.

In the featured BBC interview, 2 Dr. Mosley also points out the importance of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) — especially in conjunction with fasting — and how sheer inactivity is actually more detrimental to your health than lack of formal exercise. He recommends getting up every 15-20 minutes if you have a desk job, to avoid the health hazards associated with prolonged sitting. For more helpful tips and recommendations, please see my recent article Sitting Less May be Key for Maximum Longevity, in which I discuss this issue.

HIIT, which is a foundational part of my Peak Fitness Program, is another aspect of optimal health that I’ve been trying to drill into my readers since the mid-2000’s, when the science behind it was showing signs of being really solid. Now the mainstream is finally starting to catch up on this as well, and proof that it really does work as advertised is becoming increasingly evident as people are trying it out.

Intermittent Fasting Becoming Mainstream Health Recommendation

In related news, MSNBC 3 recently featured David Zinczenko and Peter Moore, co-authors of yet another book expounding on the health benefits of intermittent fasting:

“Can Americans trim their waistlines by spending less time at the dinner table? In ‘The 8-Hour Diet,’ best-selling authors David Zinczenko and Peter Moore argue that people can lose weight (and combat our 24-hour eating culture) by only consuming food during a set 8-hour time period.”

This is another version of intermittent fasting, in which you simply restrict yourdaily eating to a specific window of time. Zinczenko and Moore recommend an eight hour window, which is doable and convenient for most people, but you can restrict it even further — down to six, four, or even two hours, if you want, but you can still reap many of these rewards by limiting your eating to a window of about 8 hours. This means eating only between the hours of 11am until 7pm, as an example. Essentially, this equates to simply skipping breakfast, and making lunch your first meal of the day instead.

[quote style=”boxed” float=”right”]Remember, you’re NOT supposed to starve yourself. You’re not even required to restrict the amount of food you eat when on this type of daily scheduled eating plan, just chose healthy foods and be careful to minimize carbs and replace them with HEALTHY fats, like coconut oil, olive oil, olives, butter, eggs, avocados, and nuts.[/quote]

It typically takes several weeks to shift to fat burning mode, but once you do, your cravings for unhealthy foods and carbs seems to disappear as you’re now actually able to burn your stored fat and not have to rely on new carbs for fuel.

As discussed in “The 8-Hour Diet”:

“Consider this 2007 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition study: Researchers divided study participants into two groups and had each group eat the same number of calories — enough for them to maintain their weight. The only difference: One group ate all their calories in three meals spread throughout the day, while the other practiced intermittent fasting, eating the same number of calories but in a restricted time frame.

Among the results: Participants who ate in a smaller window of time had a ‘significant modification of body composition, including reductions in fat mass.’

Part of that fat burn comes simply from the body’s searching for energy and finding it in your belly. But part of it is also from a surprising source: According to Panda’s research, restricting the time period during which you eat makes your body burn more calories throughout the day. That’s right: The longer you feed, the lazier your metabolism becomes. But fit your food intake into an 8-hour window and your body steps up to the plate, burning more calories day and night. And new evidence shows that weight loss is just the beginning of intermittent fasting’s range of health benefits.”

Keep in mind that the form of fasting that might be best for you will vary depending on your weight, health, and fitness goals. Is your goal to live a longer, healthier life? Or are you a competitive or elite athlete? It may surprise many to learn that you cannot achieve maximum fitness and maximum longevity and fertility at the same time. Each goal requires a different strategy, and will not provide you with equal end results. For example, elite female athletes typically have a difficult time getting pregnant—their fitness has been maximized at the expense of their fertility, as female hormones depend on sufficient amounts of body fat.

Also, please remember that proper nutrition becomes even MORE important when fasting, so addressing the foods you eat really should be your first step. Common sense will tell you that fasting combined with a denatured, highly processed, toxin-rich diet is likely to do more harm than good, as you’re not giving your body proper fuel to thrive when you DO eat.

How “Scheduled Eating” Can Promote General Health and Longevity

Aside from removing your cravings for sugar and snack foods, melting the pounds of excess fat away, and making it far easier to maintain a healthy body weight, modern science has also confirmed there are many other good reasons to fast intermittently, such as:

-Normalizing your insulin and leptin sensitivity, which is key for optimal health as insulin resistance (which is what you get when your insulin sensitivity plummets) is a primary contributing factor to nearly all chronic disease, from diabetes to heart disease and even cancer

-Normalizing ghrelin levels, also known as “the hunger hormone”

-Promoting human growth hormone (HGH) production, which plays an important part in health, fitness and slowing the aging process

-Lowering triglyceride levels

-Reducing inflammation and lessening free radical damage

There’s also plenty of research showing that fasting has a beneficial impact on longevity in animals. There are a number of mechanisms contributing to this effect. Normalizing insulin sensitivity is a major one, but fasting also inhibits the mTOR pathway, which plays an important part in driving the aging process. The fact that it improves a number of potent disease markers also contributes to fasting’s overall beneficial effects on general health.

Interestingly, one recent study 4 found that fasting increased the participants’ low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL or “bad” cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, the “good” cholesterol) by 14 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Why would fasting raise total cholesterol? Dr. Benjamin D. Horne, PhD, MPH, director of cardiovascular and genetic epidemiology at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, and the study’s lead author, offers the following explanation:

“Fasting causes hunger or stress. In response, the body releases more cholesterol, allowing it to utilize fat as a source of fuel, instead of glucose. This decreases the number of fat cells in the body… This is important because the fewer fat cells a body has, the less likely it will experience insulin resistance, or diabetes.”

Even more remarkable, the study also found that fasting triggered a dramatic rise in human growth hormone (HGH)—1,300 percent in women, and an astounding 2,000 percent in men! The only other thing that can compete in terms of dramatically boosting HGH levels is high-intensity interval training.

HGH, commonly referred to as “the fitness hormone” plays an important role in maintaining health, fitness and longevity, including promotion of muscle growth, and boosting fat loss by revving up your metabolism. The fact that it helps build muscle while simultaneously promoting fat loss explains why HGH helps you lose weight without sacrificing muscle mass, and why even athletes can benefit from the practice (as long as they don’t overtrain and are careful about their nutrition).

Cut Diabetes and Heart Disease Risk Just by Changing WHEN You Eat

In a 2005 study, 5 Danish researchers showed that intermittent fasting quickly increases insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates. Eight healthy men in their mid-20’s fasted 20 hours every other day for 15 days. At the end of the trial, their insulin had become more efficient at managing blood sugar.

According to the authors, this appears to confirm the theory of “thrifty genes,” which is similar to Dr. Richard Johnson’s finding that metabolic syndrome is actually a healthy adaptive condition that animals undergo to store fat to help them survive periods of famine. The problem is that most all of us are always feasting and never undergo fasting… Our bodies have not adapted to this yet and as a result, this beneficial adaptation actually causes damage to contemporary man. According to the Danish researchers: 6

“Insulin resistance is currently a major health problem. This may be because of a marked decrease in daily physical activity during recent decades combined with constant food abundance. This lifestyle collides with our genome, which was most likely selected in the late Paleolithic era (50,000–10,000 BC) by criteria that favored survival in an environment characterized by fluctuations between periods of feast and famine. The theory of thrifty genes states that these fluctuations are required for optimal metabolic function.

…This experiment is the first in humans to show that intermittent fasting increases insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates, and the findings are compatible with the thrifty gene concept.” [Emphasis mine]

So, by mimicking the natural fluctuations in food availability with an intermittent fasting schedule, you naturally optimize your metabolic function without actually changing what or how much you eat when you DO eat (keeping in mind the quality of the nutrients you eat, of course).

Studies have also found compelling links between fasting and reduced risk of heart disease. 7 One of the most recent studies, published in June 2012, 8 found that those who fasted regularly had a 58 percent lower risk of coronary disease compared to those who never fasted (90 percent of the participants were Mormons who are encouraged to fast one day a month). Regular fasting was also found to be associated with lower glucose levels and lower body mass index (BMI) overall.

Intermittent Fasting May Also Boost Your Brain Health

A recent article in the Washington Post 9 highlighted yet another important health benefit associated with intermittent fasting, namely brain health and protection against dementia. Mark Mattson at the National Institute on Aging told the paper:

“We know from animal models that if we start an intermittent fasting diet at what would be the equivalent of middle age in people, we can delay the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.”

A clue to the mechanism behind this benefit is offered in the following paragraph: 10

“A fast is considered to start about 10 to 12 hours after a meal, when you have used up all the available glucose in your blood and start converting glycogen stored in liver and muscle cells into glucose to use for energy. If the fast continues, there is a gradual move toward breaking down stored body fat, and the liver produces ‘ketone bodies,’ short molecules that are byproducts of the breakdown of fatty acids. These can be used by the brain as fuel.”

Mattson’s research suggests that fasting every other day (restricting your meal on fasting days to about 600 calories), tends to boost production of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by anywhere from 50 to 400 percent, depending on the brain region. BDNF activates brain stem cells to convert into new neurons, and triggers numerous other chemicals that promote neural health. This protein also protects your brain cells from changes associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

“In mice engineered to develop Alzheimer’s-like symptoms, alternate-day fasting begun in middle age delayed the onset of memory problems by about six months,” the Washington Post reveals. “‘This is a large effect,’ Mattson says, perhaps equivalent to 20 years in humans.”

Growing evidence indicates that both fasting and exercise trigger genes and growth factors that recycle and rejuvenate your brain and muscle tissues. These growth factors include BDNF, as just mentioned, and muscle regulatory factors, or MRFs. These growth factors signal brain stem cells and muscle satellite cells to convert into new neurons and new muscle cells respectively.

Interestingly enough, BDNF also expresses itself in the neuro-muscular system where it protects neuro-motors from degradation. (The neuromotor is the most critical element in your muscle. Without the neuromotor, your muscle is like an engine without ignition. Neuro-motor degradation is part of the process that explains age-related muscle atrophy.) So BDNF is actively involved in both your muscles and your brain, and this cross-connection, if you will, appears to be a major part of the explanation for why a physical workout can have such a beneficial impact on your brain tissue—and why the combination of intermittent fasting with high intensity exercise appears to be a particularly potent combination.

Give Intermittent Fasting a Try

Consider skipping breakfast eat lunch and dinner and make sure you stop eating three hours before you go to sleep, so you’re eating within an 8-hour time frame every day. In the 6-8 hours that you do eat, you want to have healthy protein, minimize your carbs like pasta and bread and potatoes and exchange them for HEALTHY fats like butter, eggs, avocado, coconut oil, olive oil and nuts. The type of fats the media and “experts” tell you to avoid.

This will help shift you to fat burning mode from carb burning mode. Remember it takes a few weeks, and you have to do it gradually, but once you succeed to switch to fat burning mode, you will be easily able to fast for 18 hours and not feel hungry. Your cravings for sugar will magically disappear and it will be much easier to achieve your ideal weight.

The other “magical” benefit that occurs is that you will radically improve the beneficial bacteria in your gut. Why is this a good thing? Because supporting healthy gut bacteria, which actually outnumber your cells 10 to one—is one of the most important things you can do to improve your immune system so you won’t get sick, or get coughs, colds and flus. You will sleep better, have more energy, have increased mental clarity and concentrate better. Essentially every aspect of your health will improve.

Hopefully these new books and studies, along with my own pleasant experience and positive results with intermittent fasting will encourage you to give it a try. It’s another powerful tool to help you and your family take control of your health.

"http://yournewswire.com/are-ebola-airport-screenings-legal-passenger-screenings-constitutional-experts-say/","Are Ebola Airport Screenings Legal? Passenger Screenings Constitutional, Experts Say","The legality of the Obama administration’s plans to screen certain airline passengers for Ebola has been questioned, but public health experts say the president has the U.S. Constitution on his side. Federal law allows authorities to quarantine people coming into the country who may pose a risk of spreading certain infectious diseases. The list of diseases for which travelers can be quarantined includes cholera, smallpox, plague and viral hemorrhagic fever, which Ebola falls under. Any attempt to fight the airport screenings in court, experts say, would be unsuccessful, the Associated Press reports.

“You are subject to an entrance screening per the laws of the land,” Rebecca Katz, an associate professor of public health policy at George Washington University, told the AP. The 1944 Public Health Service Act gives authority to the federal government to take steps to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases into the U.S. or across state borders. “You can choose not to be screened, but then you don’t get to come into the country,” Katz said.

The ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa has sparked fears of a possible U.S. spread. Thomas Eric Duncan, who was diagnosed with the virus while in the U.S. and died this week at a hospital in Dallas, came to America from Liberia with Ebola before his symptoms occurred. Had Duncan registered a fever at the airport in Liberia, where authorities there have stepped up their own health screenings to weed out travelers who may carry the virus, he probably would have been pulled aside for further testing.

Triaging — separating people who may be ill from those who aren’t — can be tricky, especially since Ebola can incubate in the human body for up to 21 days before symptoms, including fever, occur. Symptoms of Ebola –– vomiting, muscle aches and headache — also look a lot like other viruses, including Typhoid fever and malaria, both of which are endemic to Africa and far more common than Ebola.

The U.S. will begin screening travelers arriving at five of the country’s busiest airports for signs of Ebola infection. Passengers coming from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will have their temperatures taken by agents upon arrival and answer a series of health-related questions, including whether they had any contact with an Ebola patient in West Africa. Screenings could start as early as this weekend for the 150 or so travelers who come from those countries and fly to the U.S. every day. The airports where screenings will take place are Kennedy International in New York, Washington Dulles International in Virginia, O’Hare International in Illinois, Hartsfield-Jackson International in Georgia and Newark Liberty International in New Jersey.","2014-10-12 03:57:20","1","7.0","12.0","4.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","35.0","28.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","5.0","1","440","96.92","66.71","47.88","13.47","27.50","27.27","76.59","43.86","5.23","2.05","0.00","0.00","0.68","0.68","0.68","3.18","8.18","17.27","7.73","1.59","4.55","0.68","12.05","3.18","2.05","2.73","0.91","1.59","2.27","0.68","1.59","0.45","0.45","0.23","6.59","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.68","7.95","1.59","0.45","0.68","2.95","0.91","2.27","1.59","0.45","0.68","0.45","6.36","0.45","5.91","0.23","0.00","5.68","0.23","1.14","3.64","0.91","0.45","2.50","7.50","2.27","18.18","3.86","10.91","3.18","3.86","1.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.45","0.23","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.00","6.36","6.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.45","0.91","1.14","0.00","0.00","2205","8.33","28.125","678","441","19","56.39","13.0","11.2","13.06","14.6","99","8.083333333333334","20.259591836734696","258","25.69","14","0.43","0","13","4","43","0","59","23","1","1","13","56","80","0","36","0","0","5","4","11","0","0","2","14","0","23","10","13","10","10","8","3","6","0","2"

"http://yournewswire.com/jeezy-denies-illuminati-affiliation/","Jeezy Denies Illuminati Affiliation","Yet another celebrity denying any association with The Illuminati, per an article on BET.com: “Jeezy is the latest rapper with a rumored affiliation to the Illuminati, which he denies. The chatter stems from the artwork of his upcoming fifth studio album, Seen It All, featuring a black cover and a crest with an eye embedded in a triangle. The image is similar to the symbol found on U.S. currency.

During an interview with Mina SayWhat for Power 99 Philly, Jeezy explained that the cover art isn’t a show of solidarity with the secret society. He actually just wanted to use a crest, not support the Illuminati. “Let me say this first and foremost, do not get art and creativity confused with ignorance,” Jeezy advised. “I am a hard-working, God-fearing man. I have no idea what an Illuminati is and really don’t give a damn, ’cause It has nothing to do with me.”

The “vision” Jeezy said, was to “do something different” and “bigger” than he’s done before. “It’s kind of a dark album, so I just wanted to have that kind of mystique about it,” he said. “Something you wanted to keep as a collector’s edition. Even when Pac – not to compare – but when Pac did Makavelli and he put himself on the cross, it was just like, that’s how he felt. He felt like it was him against the world, him against all odds. He put himself in that mind state. That’s just how I feel. I feel like I’m bigger than music.”

With the new album, the CTE founder is in a different space. “I feel like I’m a leader,” he continued. “I can do that. I don’t wanna stand in front of a Lamborghini and give you another picture of me [with] five chains on. That’s wack for me. I’m nine years in the game, 10 years in the game, I’m trying to push the envelope a little bit. But I tell you this, the album cover is whatever, but when you open that album and play that album, we ain’t gon’ have this conversation, you feel me? That music is A-1.”

FEMA’s “Clergy Response Team”

By now most of you are aware of the infamous group formed by FEMA and DHS who recruited 28,000 pastors to be part of the Clergy Response Team—a team of pastors who duty it will be in the event of any beck and call from the Government to round up citizens—be it for a catastrophe, an outbreak, or whatever them deem necessary. These pastors have sold not only their congregations out but also left God at the doorstep by doing so.

A Pastor Reveals Devastating Secret FEMA Plans

Recently Pastor Walt Mansfield, one of the first to be recruited by FEMA, boldly shares with Dave Hodges The Common Sense Show, all the devious workings the government is attempting to do through this organization. Everything from rounding up dissidents, to promoting servitude to the government, to forcing people into camps is involved.

"http://yournewswire.com/tel-aviv-demo-decries-israels-war-on-gaza/","Tel Aviv demo decries Israel’s war on Gaza","‘The anti-war demonstration was held in Rabin square late on Saturday, days after a similar rally was banned by the regime.

The event’s organizers put the turnout at around 10,000. Meanwhile, Israeli authorities boosted security in the streets of the coastal city.

The organizers said in a statement that they would not be intimidated by right-wing extremists’ threats and would continue efforts for a diplomatic solution to end the Gaza conflict.

The protesters called on the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down.

“Bibi you failed. You need to hand in the keys and go home. Your failure is so deep because of five years of refusal and national failure; refusal to adopt the Arab peace initiatives, and refusal to recognize the Palestinian Unity government,” said MK Zehava Galon, a rally organizer, to the crowd.’

"http://yournewswire.com/germanys-intel-agency-says-mh17-downed-by-ukraine-militia-report/","Germany’s intel agency says MH17 downed by Ukraine militia – report","German intelligence claims it has proof that flight MH17 was downed by anti government forces and that they have photo and satellite evidence. The BND is said to possess “ample evidence,” though none of it has been made public.

RT reports:- ‘Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency says a local militia shot down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine in July, Der Spiegel reports. The BND is said to possess “ample evidence,” though none of it has been made public.

The statement was made on October 8, when Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) president Gerhard Schindler was holding a secret meeting with members of the parliamentary control committee, the German daily reported on Sunday.

He claimed the militia fired a rocket from a BUK defense missile system which it had captured from a Ukrainian base. It then exploded next to the plane, according to the report.

“Schindler provided ample evidence to back up his case, including satellite images and diverse photo evidence,” the report added.

However, no “evidence” has yet been made public, and the BND has not made any official statements on the matter.

At the same meeting, Schindler reportedly said that certain intelligence on the crash provided by the Ukrainian side was false, adding that “this can be explained in detail.” However, he did not give much credit to Russia’s evidence either.

The German Federal Prosecutor’s Office told the newspaper that an investigation has been launched into unknown perpetrators under the possibility that the downing had been a war crime.

First deputy prime minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Andrey Purgin, refuted claims made by the German intelligence agency. He told Interfax that Kiev forces could have downed the plane, mistaking it for a spy jet.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was heading from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was downed over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 passengers and crew. Nearly two-thirds of the passengers were from the Netherlands.

The ongoing international probe led by the Dutch has not yet established who the perpetrators were. A preliminary report issued in September said only that the plane crashed as a result of structural damage caused by a “large number of high-energy objects” that struck from outside.

Political analyst Aleksandar Pavic told RT that he believes Berlin is trying to influence the Dutch investigation – the results of which are to be released next year.

“Germany has now the obligation to show the evidence to the official investigation,” he said. “This is like during trial: if you release bits and pieces of evidence before while the trial is still ongoing, you are trying to influence the outcome of the trial.”

Russia has been repeatedly denied accusations, mostly from the US, which claim that Moscow was connected to the tragedy in some way or another. The Russian Foreign Ministry has called Washington’s accusations “unsubstantiated innuendos.”

"http://yournewswire.com/border-patrol-agent-says-fema-is-preparing-for-200-million-deaths/","Border Patrol agent says FEMA is preparing for “200 million deaths”","Border Patrol agent says FEMA is preparing for “200 million deaths”:

A retired Border Patrol Agent has made some startling claims, as to what we are not being told about the recent surge in illegal aliens over our Southern border, and its consequences. The agent, Zack Taylor, spent many years as a supervisor working along the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, and as a U.S. Border Patrol Section Chief in Tuscon, Arizona.

During a taped interview, Taylor said that the huge numbers of foreign nationals from Central America and Mexico now arriving on our border, are here because Obama is inviting them here, and the recent surge is actually a coordinated event. “The U.S. government has CIA, FBI, DHS, Army, Navy, and Marines in Central America,” said Taylor.

And, there is some evidence to suggest Taylor is right..

A recently leaked Border Patrol memo stated that the agency expects to see more than 230,000 unaccompanied minors to make the illegal journey to this country by the end of 2015, the Associated Press reported.

Taylor also spoke a great deal about the threat being posed to Americans by communicable diseases being brought into this country by illegal aliens.

“We don’t know when CDC (Centers for Disease Control) takes custody of one of these people from Homeland Security and whisks them off somewhere–we don’t know where–what disease they have been diagnosed with, Taylor said. “We know it’s communicable…We assume it’s serious.”

But, it was what the retired agent said next that will send a chill down your spine…

Taylor said:

They’re anticipating a large national crisis. When you see that FEMA is preparing for two hundred million deaths in the United States, that tells you something. When you see that the government is controlling the supply of ammunition and that basic medical supplies are in short supply in southern Arizona, something’s wrong…They are anticipating something drastic.

Both the Ukrainian monitoring team head and Russia’s representative have given a firm ‘no.’

The chorus of allegations about Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine had President Poroshenko calling for an emergency meeting of the country’s security and defense council, while Prime Minister Yatsenyuk on Thursday called for a Russian asset freeze.

No actual evidence has been given either by either foreign governments or the media, apart from claims that photographs exist that someone had “seen.”

“I have made a decision to cancel my working visit to the Republic of Turkey due to sharp aggravation of the situation in Donetsk region, particularly in Amvrosiivka and Starobeshevo, as Russian troops were brought into Ukraine,” Petro Poroshenko said in a statement on his website.

The Russian representative to the OSCE Andrey Kelin, meanwhile, has given a firm response to the allegations, saying that “we have said that no Russian involvement has been spotted, there are no soldiers or equipment present.”

“Accusations relating to convoys of armored personnel carriers have been heard during the past week and the week before that,” he said. “All of them were proven false back then, and are being proven false again now.”’

Following Scotland’s No vote, the Prime Minister immediately set out plans to ensure that there are “English votes for English laws”. Those plans could result in England having its own first minister and would herald one of the biggest reforms of Britain’s tax system.

But they could prevent Scottish MPs voting on English-only issues in the wake of the independence referendum.

Excluding Scottish MPs from votes concerning only England would represent a disaster for the Labour Party’

"http://yournewswire.com/breaking-first-exit-poll-suggests-scotlands-no-campaign-has-won/","BREAKING: First exit poll suggests Scotland’s ‘No’ campaign has won","BREAKING: From The Western Morning News (link): “

The first exit poll on the vote for Scotland’s independence suggests the ‘No’ campaign has won, meaning more people want the country to remain a part of the United Kingdom.

A poll by YouGov last night predicted that the No campaign won the referendum with 54% of the vote.

The ‘Yes’ to independence campaign held 46% of the vote in the survey and YouGov said it had based the prediction on the responses of 1,828 people after they voted yesterday, together with the votes of 800 people who had already voted by post.

The YouGov survey, which was carried out during the day of the referendum vote, was published shortly after polls closed earlier and suggested “No” was on 54% and “Yes” on 46%.

Campaigners and onlookers across the world are now waiting for official confirmation that the country will remain in the United Kingdom or whether the final count will reveal a different picture.

A Yes vote in the historic ballot would have seen the 307-year-old union between Scotland and the rest of the UK brought to an end.

After a some two-and-a-half years of campaigning, people across Scotland finally had their say yesterday, with many staying up throughout the night as the count took place for the official result.

The result was always expected to go down to the wire, with polls in the last two weeks of the campaign suggesting the result was too close to call, until the first indication of how the final picture might look with the exit poll from YouGov.

The Queen, residing at what is widely considered to be her favourite royal residence, Balmoral, was last said by royal officials to be following the developments of the referendum ‘very closely’, it was reported.

Voting opened at 7am and ended at 10pm last night, with the turnout thought to have been one of the highest on record.

A total of 4,283,392 people were registered to vote, with 16 and 17-year-olds across the country permitted to take part in the vote for the first time.

As soon as Scotland’s 2,608 polling places closed, work began to transport hundreds of ballot boxes to counting centres in each of Scotland’s 32 local authorities.

The number of ballot papers in each box was being counted by a 5,767-strong counting team and the total was due to be reported to the chief counting officer (CCO) who could then authorise the local counting officer to announce the turnout.

The results were being declared in each individual council area, and when all the totals were in, chief counting officer Mary Pitcaithly was set to announce what the nation had decided at the central count centre at Royal Highland Centre outside Edinburgh.","2014-09-19 00:14:57","0","18.0","12.0","4.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","37.0","28.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","5.0","1","472","99.00","63.27","62.32","36.99","33.71","21.19","80.72","46.40","2.54","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.42","1.91","13.35","18.22","6.99","1.91","4.03","0.64","12.50","3.39","2.12","1.69","5.51","2.33","1.06","0.85","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.66","0.00","0.00","0.42","0.00","6.78","1.91","2.12","0.85","0.64","0.85","0.64","1.69","1.06","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.42","0.64","1.91","5.08","0.85","0.00","7.63","3.18","1.69","21.40","1.27","11.44","8.69","1.91","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.85","0.00","0.21","0.64","0.00","0.00","13.98","2.97","4.66","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.69","1.69","1.27","0.64","0.85","2131","8.15","33.857142857142854","645","459","14","55.1","13.3","13.7","11.44","17.8","84","17.166666666666668","22.440261437908497","241","28.79","6","0.46","0","11","23","66","0","68","28","0","1","5","80","33","0","24","1","0","3","2","13","2","0","3","17","0","19","33","13","16","2","3","1","4","0","2"
"http://yournewswire.com/is-the-anti-vaccine-movement-losing-its-steam/","Is the anti-vaccine movement ‘losing its steam’?","An editorial from the LA times is claiming that the anti vaccine movement is finally losing its steam…

From the LA Times: For the first time in years, there has been a slight uptick in the number of kindergartners who started the school year with all their recommended vaccinations, the state reported Tuesday. This is good news for California, where the anti-vaccine movement has thrived over the last decade despite its basis in a thoroughly discredited study and public statements by a few celebrities who are neither scientists nor medical experts.

The increase is significant not because it is big, but because it happened at all. After five years of falling immunization rates, the percentage of fully vaccinated kindergartners rose this year from 90.2% to 90.4%, the state Department of Public Health reported.

Some of the increase may be the result of a law that took effect this year requiring most parents to receive information about vaccination from a health professional before they can exercise a “personal belief exemption,” which allows them to keep their children from being vaccinated simply because they don’t like the inoculations. The law is hardly tough on disbelievers: Parents are still free to exempt their children after they’ve become better informed, and they can avoid even receiving the information if they claim that their religious beliefs run counter to vaccination.","2014-12-27 19:12:58","0","8.0","16.0","4.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","37.0","28.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","5.0","1","226","88.70","71.74","51.59","41.79","37.67","26.99","85.40","50.44","10.18","4.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.42","5.75","10.62","13.72","8.41","3.98","3.54","1.77","10.62","5.31","2.65","1.77","1.77","2.65","3.54","1.77","0.88","0.44","0.00","0.44","10.18","0.88","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.50","3.54","3.10","0.44","2.21","0.88","2.65","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.21","0.00","2.21","0.00","0.00","7.52","0.88","1.33","3.98","1.33","0.88","2.65","7.52","0.44","15.49","3.54","3.98","8.85","5.75","0.88","0.00","0.44","1.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.06","3.10","3.54","0.88","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.88","1.33","0.00","0.88","1149","8.96","38.333333333333336","354","225","8","42.95","14.7","14.2","13.47","17.4","56","18.333333333333332","23.195555555555558","154","33.33","2","0.48","0","4","5","31","0","33","15","1","1","3","35","8","0","19","0","0","8","6","10","0","0","0","5","0","7","6","6","7","6","9","2","2","0","1"

Gerald Celente, Publisher of the Trends Journal (TrendsResearch.com) says, “I would say first would come the economic calamity, but you don’t know what will cause it. For example, when 9/11 happened, they closed down Wall Street. If there is a terrorist strike, either false flag or real, they will blame the economic conditions on these terrorists. . . . They will use it as an excuse. So, you don’t know whether it’s heads or tails, but the coin will be flipped.”

What will the economy look like to the man on the street when the economy finally takes a fall? Celente predicts, “It’s going to be inflation, but it’s going to be currency devaluation rather than commodity inflation.

"http://yournewswire.com/saddam-era-chemical-weapons-now-under-isis-control-reports/","Saddam-Era Chemical Weapons Now Under ISIS Control: Reports","According to a recent report published in the journal Middle East Review of International Affairs, or MERIA, militants of the Islamic State group used chemical weapons, including mustard gas, against Kurdish fighters in the Syrian border town of Kobani during their first attempt to capture the town in July.

The report, which is based on testimonies from eyewitnesses on the ground, said that the chemical weapons had been transferred to the Syrian province of Raqqa from a Saddam Hussein-era chemical weapons facility located near the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. The report has prompted fears that ISIS could have access to vast stockpiles of chemical weapons, including sarin, mustard gas, and VX, a nerve agent.

In June, reports emerged that the Islamic State group had captured a chemical weapons facility in the city of Muthanna, located 45 miles northwest of Baghdad. At the time, the United States government said it did not believe that the complex, which was considered to be one of Saddam Hussein’s most important chemical weapons facility, built during Iraq’s war with Iran in the early 1980s, contained “Chemical Weapons materials of military value.”

However, according to a report published by The New York Times on Tuesday, the U.S. military not only recovered massive stockpiles of chemical weapons in Iraq, including in the complex in Muthanna now controlled by ISIS, it actively attempted to keep the discovery of the munitions a secret. The report, which is based on interviews with several former U.S. army personnel, alleged that between 2004 and 2010, soldiers found thousands of rusty and corroded chemical munitions.

The Times report noted that all of the chemical munitions discovered in Iraq were made before the 1991 Gulf war, and had been “designed in the United States, manufactured in Europe and filled in chemical agent production lines built in Iraq by Western companies.”

The U.S. campaign in Iraq in 2003 was launched on the assumption that Saddam Hussein was hiding and actively enriching a massive stockpile of chemical weapons. However, the Times report alleged, because no such “active weapons of mass destruction program” were reportedly discovered in Iraq, the U.S. government suppressed knowledge of the discovery to avoid further embarrassment.

According to the Times report, though U.N. inspectors reported finding no evidence of weapons of mass destruction as claimed by the U.S. administration at the time, American troops during their occupation of Iraq found stockpiles of chemical weapons, which were identified as having been manufactured before 1991. The aged and rusty shells and rockets, though unfit to be used as originally intended, reportedly still contained deadly chemical agents.

The rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq has rekindled concerns that the militants could now be in control of a huge chunk of the nearly 5,000 chemical warheads discovered in Iraq, and that they could use these weapons, banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997, in their onslaught in Syria and Iraq.

“The probable possession by the Islamic State of a chemical weapons capability is for obvious reasons a matter of the gravest concern, and should be the urgent subject of further attention and investigation,” the MERIA report said, adding that evidence strongly suggested that at least a part of Saddam Hussein’s chemical weapons arsenal is now being used in combat by the Islamic State group.

"http://yournewswire.com/last-district-in-sierra-leone-without-ebola-now-has-ebola/","Last district in Sierra Leone without Ebola, now has Ebola","The only district in Sierra Leone as-yet untouched by Ebola now has two confirmed cases.

Residents in Koinadugu had managed to escape the outbreak for months thanks in part to the efforts of businessman Momoh Konte, who returned to his country of birth from the US to spearhead strict safety precautions being introduced.

The World Health Organisation said the two cases in Koinadugu were among 425 in the country as a whole.

The Ebola outbreak, the world’s worst-ever, has infected more than 9,000 people, killing half of them.

"http://yournewswire.com/breaking-woman-in-portland-oregon-hospitalized-for-ebola-symptoms/","BREAKING: Woman in Portland, Oregon Hospitalized For Ebola Symptoms","Breaking news: according to an article from Portland Live: A Liberian woman who recently arrived in Portland and was monitoring herself for Ebola symptoms under a voluntary program was whisked to the hospital at mid-day Friday with a high temperature.

She was taken to Providence Milwaukie Hospital, where she is in isolation and being tested for the disease, which is highly infectious and has killed thousands of people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

“We had hoped this wouldn’t happen,” said Dave Underriner, regional chief executive for Providence Health & Services. “We’ve done a lot of work to prepare for an Ebola case.”

Although state and county health officers declined to provide details about the patient’s background, a source told The Oregonian she arrived from Liberia on Tuesday evening.

Physicians don’t know whether the woman has the disease or another infection. She could have the flu or even malaria. State and county health officials said she poses no risk to the public and that the system worked like clockwork.

Since arriving in Portland, the woman had been taking her temperature twice a day and reporting to the Multnomah County Health Department. Until Friday, her temperature had been normal, said Dr. Katrina Hedberg, state health officer. But in the morning it spiked.

“It got our attention because it was was over 102 degrees,” said Dr. Paul Lewis, health officer for Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington counties.

The county sent medics to her home, including Dr. Jonathan Jui, Multnomah County’s emergency services medical director. Dressed in full protective gear, from his head to fingertips to toes, he examined her and decided she should be hospitalized.

She was taken to Milwaukie, which had been established by Providence as an Ebola training center and is fully staffed for treating an infected patient. Underriner said she was ushered into the hospital through a “secured” pathway far from other patients.

She is now being treated in isolation by medical personnel who all volunteered for the assignment. The virus is highly infectious but it can only be transmitted through bodily fluids, such as sweat, urine, semen and saliva.

Physicians will draw a blood sample, then triple package it according to biohazard regulations for shipment to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta or another CDC lab. Only selected labs in the United States are equipped to run Ebola tests.

If the test is negative, another will probably be done in three days. Often the virus doesn’t show up until the person has been symptomatic for 72 hours.

It could take a day to get the woman’s blood sample to the CDC, Lewis said. The test results take about four hours.

Gov. John Kitzhaber is staying up-to-date on the situation through reports from state and local health officials, he said in a statement.

“Local health departments, hospitals, health care providers and first responders have been working together to ensure the state is prepared,” the statement said, “and earlier this week, health officials and I outlined protocols for just this type of situation. The protocols are intended to both protect the health and safety of Oregonians and get people the care they need.”

The people with whom the woman was staying with in Portland have agreed to voluntary quarantine in their own home until the results of the blood test are known. The woman who was hospitalized has been free to leave to travel around Portland since she arrived.

“This person’s movement was not restricted because there’s no rationale for it,” Lewis said. “She had no symptoms.”

Based on CDC guidelines, she was considered to be a low risk. “She did not have any known contact with Ebola patients,” Hedberg said.

Besides this woman, one other person in the Portland area is also being monitored for Ebola symptoms.","2014-11-02 17:47:05","0","21.0","12.0","4.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","38.0","28.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","5.0","1","630","85.97","74.25","5.55","28.41","18.00","27.78","80.79","47.62","8.10","4.29","0.16","0.48","0.00","3.33","0.32","3.81","8.10","14.13","10.00","2.38","5.71","1.43","16.67","1.43","0.79","1.27","1.27","1.59","2.06","1.11","0.95","0.32","0.16","0.48","9.52","0.00","0.16","3.97","0.48","6.98","1.59","1.75","1.27","1.43","0.16","1.90","2.06","0.16","1.59","0.16","7.14","1.59","5.56","0.00","0.00","6.35","0.63","0.63","2.70","1.27","1.11","8.10","7.14","0.79","12.38","1.75","7.14","3.81","3.49","0.63","0.32","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.67","6.03","5.40","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","2.86","1.43","0.00","0.16","3099","8.3","20.03125","946","629","37","62.68","12.0","8.7","12.29","11.3","152","12.0","18.466136724960258","324","18.72","5","0.46","0","24","5","64","0","72","32","0","0","6","107","67","6","37","0","0","28","6","18","1","0","2","23","0","17","42","15","33","13","15","2","4","0","1"
"http://yournewswire.com/texas-detention-center-staff-accused-of-sexual-assault/","Texas detention center staff accused of sexual assault","Central American women being held at a Texas detention center claim that multiple female detainees are being sexually assaulted by guards, according to a civil rights group asking for an investigation into the matter.

The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) has told Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to investigate “serious allegations of substantial, ongoing sexual abuse” by private prison contractor employees in a Karnes County, Texas, detention facility. The building is used by the Department of Homeland Security to house women and children immigrant detainees. Many of the women detained at the facility are escaping violence and sexual assault in their home countries in Central America.

“MALDEF has been monitoring the conditions at Karnes, as part of that we have been working with pro-bono lawyers who have been handling immigration papers. Not long after the center opened in August, lawyers started receiving reports about strange things going on,” Marisa Bono, staff attorney at MALDEF, said to RT.

The complaint alleges that numerous women claim harassment and sexual assault has been going at the facility since August 2014. The allegations include: “Karnes Center personnel removing female detainees from their cells late in the evening and during early morning hours for purpose of engaging in sexual acts in various parts of the facility; personnel calling detainees ‘novias’ or ‘girlfriends’ and requesting sexual favors in exchange for money; promising of assistance with their pending immigration cases, and shelter when and if the women are released; and Karnes Center guards kissing, fondling and/or groping female detainees in front of other detainees and children.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not immediately respond to RT’s request for comments.

ICE spokeswoman Adelina Pruneda told Reuters, however, that the agency has a zero tolerance policy for sexual abuse and assault. “Individuals in our custody are housed and treated in a safe, secure and humane manner,” she said.

If the allegations are confirmed, personnel at the Karnes Center will be in violation of the Prison Rape Elimination Act, as well as federal sexual assault and harassment laws.

“We haven’t heard from ICE yet, we’re hopeful we will hear soon what actions are being taken to ensure the safety of the women and children,” Bono told RT. “And also what action is being taken to ensure this doesn’t happen again. Under the federal law the facility is supposed to have a policy for prevention and immediate response to these types of reports and we are concerned whether or not one exists, we haven’t been able to find it, but also whether one exists whether it is being implemented properly.”

Women have already notified supervisors at the center of these alleged crimes – which are said to involve four detainees – but no steps have been taken to stop or prevent the abuse by at least three Karnes Center employees, according to Bono.

Bono said sexual assault and harassment is very common in detention centers, but that is why MALDEF takes the position that families shouldn’t be detained in the first place – and certainly not children.

In response to these accusations, the GEO Group released the following statement to RT:

“GEO strongly refutes these allegations. The Karnes County Residential Center provides a safe, clean, and family friendly environment for mothers and children awaiting required processing by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. The Center provides high quality care, and our company strongly denies any allegations to the contrary.”

“Onsite ICE personnel provide direct oversight to ensure compliance with ICE’s Family Residential Standards. Since its activation, the Karnes County Residential Center has, under direction and guidance from ICE, created an open and transparent policy of allowing visits to the Center by the public, elected local and national officials, federal officials from ICE and other government agencies, as well as nongovernmental organizations.”

The detention center was built and run by a private prison contractor, GEO Group, which has repeatedly been featured in public news reports concerning allegations of abuse and neglect, which led to several contracts in Texas being terminated. In 2011, Change.org reported that a coalition of 15 Texas-based civil and immigrant rights organizations wrote to the former head of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, to end the contract to build the new Karnes County detention center.

"http://yournewswire.com/chemtrails-the-nuclear-connection-and-the-rule-of-seven-generations/","Chemtrails, The Nuclear Connection And The Rule Of Seven Generations","From Earth Heal (source): The complexity of nuclear experimentation is beyond the pale of postmodern human comprehension. It also reveals, although we would like to believe otherwise, our inability or unwillingness to consider the unseen. Whether it is invisible because of ethereal origins or because it is nano-sized poison does not matter; collectively we tend to obfuscate the unseen. Nuclear experimentation also reveals our collective inability to conceptualize time, and to understand just how long nuclear radiation lasts in ourenvironment – and how long our karma lasts.

This short-sightedness was not always the case. Indigenous cultures across Turtle Island, A.K.A. North America, knew they would one day return home to the spirit world, and that their stay here on earth was equivalent to the blink of an eye. So they considered the Rule of Seven Generations when implementing procedures that would alter the planet in any way, beginning with harvesting herbs, to ensure theirsociety’s long term sustainability. In fact, the indigenous people were so considerate of their peoples’ future as to make sure there would be enough herbs left seven generations from the harvest. Understanding their place in the delicate ecosystem, the Turtle Islanders contemplated the unseen and the distant future, always.

Today we have collectively foregone such considerations. And it was no accident that brought us here.

The Seen and the Unseen

In order for institutions to institute a military industrial complex, a prison industrial complex, a pharmacological industrial complex and so on, humanity had to become disconnected from its unseen reality. Whether ethereal or too small to fathom, we have been conditioned over time to disbelieve in the unseen, to trust only 5 of our senses, and to prize rational logic (which cannot itself perceive the unseen) over intuition. Then, with only ‘the seen’ at front of the collective mind, the unseen dangers of nuclear industry experimentation have become whitewashed in public discussion, and radiation monitors disabled bygovernment, while unprecedented levels of radioactivity poisons our only world.

It is an inarguable fact that nuclear radiation and life on our planet cannot co-exist in the same space. It is another inarguable fact that nuclear radiation takes hundreds of thousands of years to break down, creating life-threatening environmental conditions not just today, but for seven thousand generations to come. Yet, despite the industry’s inability to avoid total meltdowns every few years, nuke advocates continue to espouse nuclear as a “safe” energy alternative, employing a program of pseudo-science to confuse the logical minds of humanity, creating the scene for these dangerous yet financially profitable (to some) practices to continue. Many pro-nukers even go so far as to suggest that ‘low dose’ nuclear radiation is somehow good for us! But understand, this theory – known as the “Hormesis Effect” – is deliberate industry quackery, and anyone who tells you radiation is good for you is either an industry stooge, or has been conned by one.

It is well proven through history that the human body (correctly) perceives radiation as a threat to its existence. If you don’t believe this premise, ask the good folks of Chernobyl, Hanford, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima (among myriad others). The external threat of radiation sends the human body’s immune response into overdrive. The short term result of this intense immune activity can be the improvement of other existing ailments, but our immune systems are not designed to run permanently in this state of stress so, over time, health inevitably deteriorates.

Studies have clearly linked radiation exposure to increased rates of cancer, thyroid damage, skin complaints, endocrine disruption, pregnancy issues (such as miscarriage) and emotional trauma, which itself negatively impacts the body.[source] In 2012, “nearly 36 per cent of children in the nuclear disaster-affected Fukushima Prefecture had abnormal thyroid growths.” [source]

“This leak is very serious,” said Dr. Janette Sherman, an Alexandria, Virginia-based physician who specializes in radioactive and toxic exposure. Dr. Sherman, who edited an in-depth study of healtheffects on cleanup workers in the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the former Soviet Union, said she is concerned that the cleanup crew at Fukushima Daiichi may face long-term health risks. She also raised the prospect of the radiation’s as-yet unknown effects on fish and other marine life in the Pacific. [source]

In 1990, Dr. Keith F. Baverstock, Head of the Department for Radiation and Health at the European office of the WHO, visited the Gomel Region of Belarus, an area significantly affected by nuclear fall-out from the Chernobyl disaster. At the time, Dr. Baverstock noted the dramatic increase in disease, especially in very young children. Writes Baverstock:

Children exposed to Chernobyl fallout were experiencing chronic adult diseases of the respiratory and blood systems, gastritis, nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases and other diseases of internal organs. In general, in 1991, the level of serious illness in children was about 6 to 7 times above normal.

In reality, no one on this planet would engage in nuclear experimentation if they valued the unseen, the spiritual and the ethereal. No one would engage in nuclear experimentation if they practiced the Rule of Seven Generations. No one would engage in nuclear experimentation if they valued life on earth over unnecessary toxic energy systems and devices of war.

We digress from our hypothesis, but feel it’s important to note how the following problem was allowed to occur — by the transformation of our collective mind state from a culture rooted in localized permaculture and sustainable practices into a barbarous war culture that knowingly poisons its environment in the name of energy and armory, and then wonders why ill health is so prevalent.

It is also important to point out that nuclear experimentation knows no borders; it negatively impacts all life, and destroys entire sections of our planet’s interconnected ecosystem. Nuclear experimentation is therefore not a means to self-support, or self-defense, but an attack on everything — on life itself.

The Effects of Radiation on Our Health

The Nuclear Fallout

There have been 2,000 atomic and nuclear detonations on every strata of earth since the first experiment in New Mexico, July, 1945 and the two most infamous devices dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki later that summer. That makes 69 years of radiological contamination from nuclear detonation experiments alone, each one inevitably releasing billions of atomic echoes we cannot comprehend entirely. The Manhattan Project scientists actually debated amongst themselves whether or not the detonation would cause a chain reaction igniting the entire atmosphere, but did it anyway. After the blast there was a radiated ‘blast zone’, an area destroyed forever, and also radioactive fallout that fell well beyond the designated blast zone; deadly dust kicked up by, and elements formed in, the detonations.

Fallout defined:

a) Radioactive particles that are carried into the atmosphere after a nuclear explosion and gradually fall back as dust or in precipitation.

b) The adverse results of a situation or action.

What is not realized about this definition is that not all of that nuclear garbage actually ‘falls out’. Some of the dust and radioactive elements are so light that they do not fall out and actually remain in our atmosphere. In fact the airborne radioactive waste from the era of nuclear detonation experiments has only now saturated the atmosphere, and spread out evenly. Meanwhile, the radiation that does fall from the atmosphere does not break down, but accumulates in soil and water, poisoning everything it touches in perpetuity.

Meanwhile, the ongoing Fukushima disaster could further increase the problem of atmospheric contamination by continuing to spew radiation into the sea. When radioactive material hits the minerals in sea water, it creates a chemical reaction. Ultimately these elements may trigger so many reactions that they become nano sized particles, and when this occurs, the elements then mingle with all other elements, upsetting the natural balance of nature.

As we know, the oceans are a primary source of oxygen and other vital atmospheric components. According to a recent EarthSky.org report, “most of Earth’s oxygen comes from tiny ocean plants – called phytoplankton – that live near the water’s surface and drift with the currents.” Now add to thisenvironment at least 300 tons of radioactive waste per day, for over 3 ½ years [source] and the ocean is now itself a source of radioactive elements, poisoning ocean life and reaching back into our breathable atmosphere.

And again, the cycle continues, with some radiation falling out (through precipitation) into soil and water and some remaining in the atmosphere, where it will continue to cycle through our ecosystem for millennia – with disastrous affect.

Alarmingly, Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution analyzed thousands of samples of fish from the Fukushima area in mid-2013, and found that the makeup of the radioactive material leaking from the ailing facility had changed since the initial 2011 disaster. He noted that the initial leak included a high concentration of cesium isotopes — which, like all radionuclides, results in increased risk of cancer [source] — however the pollution now flowing into the North Pacific ocean is proportionally much higher in strontium-90, a substance that is considered one of the more hazardous constituents of nuclear wastes and is absorbed differently by the human body than cesium. Exposure to Sr-90 is linked to bone cancer, cancer of the soft tissue near the bone, and leukemia. [source]

Chemtrails – a Force Multiplier

“Chemtrails” refers to the atmospheric aerosol spraying programs which inject highly toxic chemicals into the Earth’s atmosphere. Although this program is denied by government and military, overwhelming evidence has been gathered by independent researchers the world over, which thoroughly documents the means through which global weather patterns are deliberately being manipulated.

“Contrails” by comparison are the short condensation trail that briefly follows commercial airliners. Contrails are characterized by a noticeable gap between the airline engine and the visible condensation, which forms after leaving the craft.

Unlike contrails, chemtrails leave a thick plume of smoke that is visibly blown from nozzels, not engines, fitted to the wings of commercial airliners. Chemtrail clouds also linger in the atmosphere for long periods of time – hours – something that is not characteristic of water condensation.

So let’s suspend judgment for a moment, disregard the “complacency theories”, and look at what we know…

In 1996, a research paper, dangerously entitled “Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather by 2025” was presented to the United States Air Force “to comply with a directive from the chief of staff of the Air Force”. It explicitly outlines that the government’s motivation to engage in global weather modification practices (quaintly titled “geo-engineering”) is “to remain the dominant air and space force in the future”, built on the premise that if you control weather conditions, you better control the population. The chemtrail program is no more than a military “force multiplier”, developed at our expense and without our consent, by the world’s political/financial (the same thing) elite to further their agenda of control.

But when it comes to weather modification and nuclear programs, that sense of “control” is a dangerous illusion. The untold effects of chemtrail spraying on human and environmental health mirror those of the failing nuclear experiment, while the cumulative damage created by both programs is potentially exponential. Meanwhile, institutional rhetoric and a deliberate public culture of ignorance dominate discussion of this issue (we can already hear the mindless chanting of the old “tin foil hats” chestnut) continues to serve this agenda.

When the public is poorly educated, their minds are easily controlled – through fear and belittlement of the truth. This tactic has been successfully employed for centuries. How much more do you want to be deceived?

Thankfully, the scientific community isn’t just bending over and accepting these dangerous lies.

Scientists Speak Out

Retired USDA soil conservationist and wildlife biologist (and organic gardener) Francis Mangels worked for the U.S. Forest Service for over 35 years. He undertook a program of testing the soil in heavily chem-sprayed Lake Shasta area, and found dangerously high levels of aluminum, barium and strontium in soil samples. None of these metals should be present in our soil. Although Mangels noted that “the normal concentration [of these chemicals] in our rains should be zero”, he notes that “these levels are now 10,000 parts per billions [ppb]” in some soil tests. [source]

“Normal background levels of aluminum oxide in the Mt. Shasta snow is 1/2 unit. (In this case, ug/l). Allowable aluminum in drinking water is 50 units. Government action is required at 1,000 units of detected aluminum. The EPA-tested snow on Mt. Shasta shows aluminum at 61,100 units.” [source] Mangels attributes pH over 10-times the alkalinity of normal soil on huge increases of aluminum oxide.

[Click here to watch the full Shasta County Board of Supervisors Hearing on Chemtrails and Geoengineering, July 15, 2014]

In the fall of 2002, a long-time landscaper for the City of Edmonton (David Dickie) began noticing that carefully tended flowers and trees were showing signs of severe nutrient deficiencies. City specifications call for Electrical Conductivity readings no higher than “1” in local soils, but soil samples tested for EC 4.6 to 7-times higher than this maximum permissible level. Dickie wondered if elevated levels of electricity-conducting metals in the soils could be leading to the plants’ “chlorosis” condition. A $33 lab test of snow samples collected in a sterilized container confirmed elevated levels of aluminum and barium.

Norwest Labs lab report #336566 found:

q aluminum levels: 0.148 milligrams/litre

q barium levels: 0.006 milligrams/litre [source]

So with such damning physical evidence in our skies soil and waterways, why are our governments still denying this practice? If their motivations are indeed benevolent, surely the popularist nature of modern politics suggests that those leaders responsible for such a “beneficial” program would step proudly forward to claim their political victory! But no. Despite a groundswell of pressure, governments refuse to issue formal statements on this matter. This alone should be a red-flag for any conscious and critical thinker.

According to independent scientist Leuren Moret (MA, PhD ABD), former President of the Association for Women Geoscientists and former City of Berkeley Environmental Commissioner:

“Scientific research is always sold to the public with a promise that the benefit will be for the people in order to get them to pay for it. Once the research is finished, the science is always perverted into a weapon used against the people and the environment that benefits the bankers”

This statement was clearly echoed by former government nuclear scientists (and current lecturer for U.C.Davis Department of Chemistry) Dr. Andreas Toupadakis, Ph.D. in a recent Wake Up World article, Quitting the Nuclear Labs – a Scientist’s Plea for World Peace. According to Dr. Toupadakis:

I resigned from a permanent, highly paid, classified position in the Stockpile Stewardship Program at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California. I went to LLNL believing that I would be useful in helping to dismantle nuclear weapons and in disposing of their deadly byproducts. That was my desire. Instead, very soon, I found myself expected to work on the maintenance of nuclear weapons. When I realized that within the Lab, environmental or nonproliferation work was but an illusion, I decided to resign. My conscience simply does not allow me to work for the development or maintenance of nuclear weapons.

Looking back I know now that… purely academic projects are sustained in order to lure young scientists into the national labs. I heard this in plain language one Thanksgiving afternoon, sitting around the table with senior weapons scientists: “We need new blood to carry on our weapons research; we need new post-docs in purely basic research”.

So, with considerable evidence of high-level intent, the next logical question is : Are these programs related? And if so, how?

The Chemtrails Hypothesis

Let’s consider a hypothesis…

We know that “meteorological conditions associated with convection and vertical mixing over the Pacific Ocean promote [the] long-distance transport” of radioactive materials through the atmosphere.[source] In fact, European Commission, Science for Environment Policy News Alert suggest that as much as 12.7% of iodine radionuclides from the Fukushima disaster reached the USA and Canada. [source]

Evidence shows that the chemtrail and nuclear experiments continue to pump into our atmosphere everything from biological material to nano sized metallic particulate, the latter of which become ionized or electrically charged by sunlight. Therefore, the air in our atmosphere is altered into an electrically charged gas, which responds strongly to electromagnetic fields such as those produced by Wifi and HAARPtechnologies, and ever-increasing numbers of cell towers. Barium, found to be a major element in chemtrail spraying, is also known to conduct electromagnetic energy.

When we take into account the increasing amount of radiological contamination in the upper atmosphere, the indefensible continuation of the failing nuclear experiment, the covert chemtrail and HAARP operations we now know are intended as a military “force multiplier”, and the short-term thinking endemic in modern governments, the next reasonable questions are…

When radioactive nano sized particles make contact with the newly injected chemtrail “chemical X” (which is generally metallic) what is the reaction?

Are these radioactive particles adhering, reacting, and then falling out of the atmosphere?

What is the cumulative effect of airborne radioactivity and chemtrail spraying on human and environmental health?

Are the nuclear and chemtrails programs all part of the same high-level agenda?

Are scientific/military operations performing integrated experiments, covertly applying a combination of atmospheric alterations including chemical, radiation and electromagnetic elements?

And what of the biological component of these chemtrails, known as bio-engineering?

Airborne Assault

Ongoing atmospheric studies show that biological test agents including viruses, bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and other biological materials are routinely released as part of this covert spraying operation. According to Prof. James F. Tracy in an article for GlobalResearch.ca “The most well-known manifestation of such nano-biologicals is the oft-misunderstood Morgellons ailment, an especially unusual and disturbing condition marked by painful dermal lesions through which … nano-fibers [from bio-engineering] protrude.”

In November 2013, French/English language newspaper The Connexion reported that “mysterious stringy filaments” we found falling from the sky over Drôme and Ardèche in Southern France, leaving residents and authorities “mystified”. [source]

Reports of the fibres were first raised on Thursday, but no one has yet been able to identify what they are – giving rise to theories that they are the by-product of plane exhausts.

Inexplicably, “the prefecture for the Drôme said it did not know what the fibres were but said it was not worried and would not be sending them for analysis”.

Clifford Carnicorn is staunch campaigner against chemtrails who, as a former federal employee of the United States government, served for 15 years within the Department of Defense, The Bureau of Land Management, and the United States Forest Service, earning himself the Defense Mapping Agency Aerospace Center Employee of the Year and Geodetic Sciences Departmental Award for outstanding technical, managerial, and cost effective performance. Carnicom also oversees the Morgellons Research Group, a body of concerned citizens, health care professionals, scientific researchers and microbiologists who devote their time to investigating this unfolding syndrome.

According to Mr. Carnicom the presence of nanofibers – observable clumps of fibrous strands – “have now been discovered repeatedly across all major body systems and functions, including skin, blood, hair, saliva, dental(gum), digestive, ear and urinary samples”. [source] Says Mr. Carnicorn:

Is there a direct relationship between the alteration of living systems (us) and ecosystems (the environment)? My answer is unequivocally, ‘Yes.’

When we understand the obvious scientific inter-connection between these programs, we can deduce that this is all part of an integrated atmospheric system. Although geoengineering is now touted by government as a benevolent weather modification program, the net effect — uncovered by the scientificcommunity despite years of silence from government — is an airborne electromagnetic assault on humanity. [source]

Amy Worthington, independent researcher and writer, explained in her seminal article: Chemtrails: Aerosol and Electromagnetic Weapons in the Age of Nuclear War:

Both the Pentagon’s aerosol operations and its limited nuclear wars are deeply interconnected. We can trace the beginnings of Operation Cloverleaf right to the Strangelove brain of Dr. Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb and proponent of nuking inhabited coast lines to rearrange them for economic projects.[1] Before he died in 2003, Teller was director emeritus of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where plans for nuclear, biological and directed energy weapons are crafted. In 1997, Teller publicly outlined his proposal to use aircraft to scatter in the stratosphere millions of tons of electrically-conductive metallic materials, ostensibly to reduce global warming.[2]

Shortly after Teller’s presentation, the public began seeing frenetic chemtrailing. In 2000, CBS News admitted that scientists were “looking at drastic solutions for global warming, including manipulating the atmosphere on a massive scale.” CBS confirmed that the plan to load the air with tiny particles would “deflect enough sunlight to trigger global cooling.”[3]

Teller estimated that commercial aircraft could be used to spew these particles at a cost of 33 cents a pound.[4] This gives credence to a report by an airline manager, forced by a compulsory non-disclosure agreement to remain anonymous, that commercial aircraft have been co-opted to assist the military in consummating Project Cloverleaf.[5]

The heavy metals contained in chemtrail spraying include barium, aluminum, arsenic, lead, mercury, copper, manganese, and uranium [source]. In the last 10 years, aluminum levels in rainwater have risen from 7 parts per billion to 3,400 parts per billion — an astounding, nearly 50,000 percent increase. [source]

The effects of heavy metal exposure (in isolation) on human health have been extensively documented:

Data Source: Heavy metals and living systems: An overview – Indian Journal of Pharmacology

Elaborating on this point, research published in the Indian Journal of Pharmacology indicates that heavy metals poisoning associated with heavy metal spraying (and other industrial and environmental exposures) disrupts metabolic functions in two ways:

1. They accumulate and thereby disrupt function in vital organs and glands such as the heart, brain, kidneys, bone, liver, etc.

2. They displace the vital nutritional minerals from their original place, thereby hindering their biological function. It is, however, impossible to live in an environment free of heavy metals. There are many ways by which these toxins can be introduced into the body such as consumption of foods, beverages, skin exposure, and the inhaled air. [source]

Add to this problem the fact that electromagnetic energy, including WIFI, has been shown to interfere with the human body and brain (which itself is electrical) in particular cell growth, neural activity, cardiac function, hormone production and fertility [source] and we have the conditions for a global health crisis of unprecedented proportions.

And that is exactly what we’re experiencing today.

Enter the pharmacological industry to treat the symptoms of these conditions (but never the cause), the corporate-government-media complex to protect these unlawful covert operations and stifle public debate, and the pseudo-scientific (troll) community to vilify those who see through the deception.

But frankly, we’re not buying it.

In the words of prolific environmental researcher, author and activist (and Wake Up World contributor) the late Dr. Ilya Sandra Perlingieri:

When we begin to connect the dots to the thousands of unsafe and often highly toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and hormone disruptors to which we are exposed daily, we then can collectively see that this is not just a one-issue health crisis we face. Rather, with corporations allowed free reign to poison us with impunity… we do not have any way to have any redress of decades of grievances. The ramifications of this are enormous.

Looking Up, Looking Forward

These nuclear, chemical and electromagnetic programs amount to an assault on our very existence. Given that threat it poses, and the questions it raises of those entrusted with our governance, this realization causes many people to go into fear, disbelief, and to shut down. The implications are simply too challenging for many to entertain, much less invest any real time and energy in trying to understand the problem in the level of detail it requires. And so, despite mountains of scientific, environmental and political evidence to the contrary, chemtrails are still written off by many as a “tin foil hat” fantasy.

But let’s get real here… One has only to look up without fear or judgment to see the truth about chemtrails… Or to look at our unprecedented rates of physiological dysfunction and disease, for which the government and medical complex has no viable explanation. These vital elements of the big picture cannot reasonably be dismissed…

"http://yournewswire.com/israeli-intelligence-minister-says-palestinian-un-draft-against-israel-act-of-war/","Israeli Intelligence minister says Palestinian UN draft against Israel act of war","The Israeli intelligence minister describes as an “act of war” a Palestinian draft submitted to the UN Security Council to end Israeli occupation by the end of 2017.

“The Palestinians made sure to remove any mention of Israel’s status as a Jewish state from the draft, which means this is not an act of peace, it’s an act of war,” Israel Radio quoted Yuval Steinitz as saying on Thursday.

The draft was presented to the UN by Jordan, said Palestinian envoy to the UN Riyad Mansour at a press conference on Wednesday.

“We need to consider every move including cutting off economic ties with” the Palestinian Authority, Steinitz said.

“If the PA continues to incite against us, against our existence, against the Jewish nation, if it [continues to] take unilateral action, we need to respond not just in the international sphere but also in the Palestinian sphere and to consider, if there is no other choice, dismantling the [Palestinian] Authority,” he added.

"http://yournewswire.com/britain-ready-to-put-robust-legal-case-used-by-us-for-syria-airstrikes/","Britain ready to put ‘robust legal case’ used by US for Syria airstrikes","UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain is prepared to make a robust legal case for extending airstrikes against Islamic State beyond Iraq into Syria, with the backing of MPs.

Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Friday, Hammond said the government believes there is a strong legal basis for extending UK airstrikes into Syria.

“We would look at the circumstances at the time,” Hammond said. “If we felt we had some capability to contribute that was needed in order to deliver the outcome that we all want to see, which is the defeat of [Islamic State, or ISIS/ISIL] and its poisonous ideology, then we would certainly make the case for doing that if the circumstances were right.”

Hammonds comments came ahead of Friday’s recall of parliament, where MPs debated a Commons motion calling for strikes against IS targets in Iraq. The motion specifically excluded airstrikes in Syria without a further vote.

The foreign secretary confirmed extending airstrikes into Syria would require a second parliamentary vote, but said the legal advice used by the US to underpin its airstrikes in Syria could be used by Britain.

“At the moment, the government of Iraq has asked us to intervene in Iraq,” Hammond said. “It is clear that the US intervening in Syria is also able to do so on a legal basis of collective self-defence because the government of Iraq has identified that there is a present threat to Iraq coming from Syria.

“We haven’t looked at this in terms of our own permissions … because we are not proposing to do it. That is the legal basis that the US is relying on. It looks robust to me.”

Deployment of UK troops for combat operations is ruled out by Friday’s parliamentary motion. However, the motion does permit the deployment of special forces and intelligence personnel, as well as trainers, to help bolster Iraqi and Kurdish forces.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told House Magazine earlier this week that the war against IS would be “a long haul” that may require action against militants in Syria if MPs can be convinced.

The government is not currently proposing any involvement in airstrikes in Syria, where a US-Arab coalition began bombing IS militants on Tuesday. MPs last year rejected airstrikes on Syria to oppose the government of President Bashar Assad.

Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs early in Friday’s debate the situation in Syria is “more complicated” than Iraq because of its “brutal dictator” President Assad and the civil war that has been ongoing for the past three years.

Cameron held out the possibility of extending British air strikes against IS in Syria. He suggested he would be prepared to extend the military campaign without the initial approval of parliament in the event of a humanitarian catastrophe.

“Let me address very directly this issue of Isil in Syria,” said Cameron. “I am very clear: Isil needs to be destroyed in Syria as well as Iraq. We support the action that the US and five Arab states have taken in Syria.”

“I don’t believe there is a legal barrier, because I think the legal advice is clear that – were we to act or others to act – there is a legal basis.”

"http://yournewswire.com/video-tired-all-the-time-are-you-in-energetic-debt-heres-how-to-correct-it/","Video: Tired All The Time? Are You In Energetic Debt? Here’s How To Correct It","A great article from Collective-Evolution: We’ve all been there. We wake up, look at the clock and roll over for five more minutes of sleep. You eyelids feel heavy, your head feels heavy and your body feels like it’s made out of lead. To some people, this is what every morning feels like, a struggle. Some have felt that way for so long that they forget what it’s like to jump out of bed, excited for the day’s events. Feeling like deadweight in the morning becomes the norm.

If you don’t have the energy to wake up in the morning, it often means that the energy you gained while sleeping was spent elsewhere. The Chinese say, “Chi follows Yi.” That means life force (chi) energy flows in the direction that the mind (Yi) takes it. This is an important concept to grasp. Your body is comprised of pure potentiality. That potential energy moves in whatever direction the subconscious or conscious mind takes it.

This means that when you’re focused on thoughts or actions that make you feel good, your body feels good. But when you focus on thoughts and actions that make you feel stressed, the body feels strained, weakened. Chi follows Yi. There is now scientific research that explores the mind-body connection a bit further by examining how exactly stress causes disease in the body.

The Link Between Stress & Disease

In 2012, Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, studied how stress ultimately causes and progresses disease. There has been a known link for many years but this study helped to clarify exactly how one causes the other. They found for the first time that psychological stress interferes with the body’s own ability to regulate inflammation which in turn, promotes the development and progression of disease.

“Inflammation is partly regulated by the hormone cortisol and when cortisol is not allowed to serve this function, inflammation can get out of control,” said Cohen, the Robert E. Doherty Professor of Psychology within CMU’s Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Cohen argued that prolonged stress alters the effectiveness of cortisol to regulate the inflammatory response because it decreases tissue sensitivity to the hormone. Specifically, immune cells become insensitive to cortisol’s regulatory effect. In turn, runaway inflammation is thought to promote the development and progression of many diseases.”

This is incredible information that helps us to connect the mind and the body and to understand its relationship further. This research proves that psychological stress of any kind will drop the body’s ability to control inflammation and ultimately to stay healthy. This places quite a bit of emphasis on the mind. It becomes the starting point of all disease but it is also the starting point of well-being. Keeping the mind in a healthy place, means keeping the body healthy. So do whatever you need to do to keep your mind in a positive space. Visit with friends, eat right, watch funny movies, dance, sing, paint, go for a walk etc. Change your thoughts, change your body, change your reality.

How Will You Use Your Energy?

Look at your energy as something you choose to spend or invest everyday. When you spend, you receive less or no value in return. When you invest, you receive equal or greater value in return. So when you spend your energy on something that is negative, your body feels negative and a negative emotion is produced. When you invest your energy into something positive, you feel great physically and emotionally because you’ve received a great return on your investment. Over time you will eventually produce energy “debt” or “surplus” based on your spending and investing habits. If you are in energy debt (which we all have been in at some point), you feel tired, weak, unhappy and unhealthy. When you’re in energy surplus, your body becomes more powerful (its inflammatory response is healthy), your emotions are mostly positive, and you have more energy.

We can definitely all use this information to keep our bodies and minds in a healthy place. But how could we apply this to physical conditions we are currently experiencing?

Let’s look at how you’re feeling today. What physical condition do you complain about most? Think of one issue that could be improved upon. Now think back to when it first arose. What kind of stress were you experiencing at the time? What life events occurred around the time when you first felt those symptoms? Can you find the mind-body link? Perhaps by changing our perception on those events, like by letting go of anger or forgiving another, we can also let go of pain within the body.

For those that are interested in taking a change in perception a bit further, here is a video on a technique called “EFT” or “Emotional Freedom Technique” that was created to assist people in releasing emotional pain. I have personally found a lot of success using this method and use it frequently in my sessions with clients. Try using it on the physical condition you thought of earlier.

"http://yournewswire.com/you-wont-believe-what-blow-illinois-just-made-to-citizen-journalism/","You Won’t Believe What Blow Illinois Just Made to Citizen Journalism","This is actually pretty sad and angering, yet not at all surprising to many who are just hearing the news: Illinois has made it officially illegal to film police officers. Thousands if not more of citizen journalists globally see this as a “test step” towards greater and greater media lockdown – both on mainstream and independent media, which includes citizen journalism – one of the most impactful, and to many, most important types of journalism of our time.

According to an article in Natural News called “Government’s descent into Hunger Games injustice and tyranny nearly complete” [1], Mike Adams writes:

If you haven’t already seen Hunger Games, Catching Fire I urge you to watch it now. The movie, available for free on Amazon’s PRIME service, depicts a totalitarian centralized government ruling over disarmed, oppressed subjects with outrageous cruelty and injustice.

The movie is a warning to what might happen to us all very soon if we don’t stop the march of tyranny in America. You need to watch the film because America is headed straight for a similar outcome, and this fact was especially driven home today by one of the most outrageous new laws to ever be passed in any state. By a wide margin of support, Illinois just voted to criminalize citizens filming police in public spaces.

“The amendment has stripped away safeguards to free speech rights from the original legislation and instituted a blanket ban on recording officials in public,” writes Steve Watson at InfoWars.com. [1] “It was passed by both the Illinois House and the Senate, with huge majorities, within two days of its introduction.”

“Only a government that lives like cockroaches in the darkness would pass a law criminalizing the act of turning on the light,” writes the Free Thought Project [2], which goes on to point out how the mainstream media is completely silent on this story. (The media censors all stories it doesn’t want you to know about, including the CDC whistleblower story, Fukushima radiation in the USA and the worsening Ebola pandemic.)

You can view the actual text of this Illinois Senate bill amendment at this link (PDF), and there’s a valuable write-up of the law published at the Illinois Policy website.

It’s legal if the cops do it; it’s a felony if you do it

To be clear, the Illinois law makes it a felony crime for citizens to do exactly what the police do: record audio and video in public places.

When the police activate their video recorders, they claim citizens have “no reasonable expectation of a right to privacy in a public space,” and that’s their justification for recording. But when a citizen does the same thing, they will now be arrested and charged with the felony crime of “wiretapping” police conversations.

America is now a two-class system, in other words. There are the OFFICERS who are granted an elevated set of “rights,” privileges and powers; and then there are the SUBJECTS who are denied those same rights, privileges and powers.

A nation of law has descended into a lawless land of tyranny

The idea that America is a nation of law where all men and women are created equal is shattered. The very idea that all laws apply equally to everyone, including government officers, officials and even Presidents, is now openly abandoned. The new rule is that laws are only selectively applied to Subjects, while Officers of the government are exempt from those same laws.

Chicago is now a city where it is completely legal for a police officer to murder a citizen in plain sight, but it is a felony offense for a citizen to record the video of that event on their mobile phone. The citizen who witnesses the murder is now the criminal, you see, while the government employee who commits it is granted total immunity.

Similarly, when the government lies to the people, that’s never considered a crime. After all, politicians lie all the time to get elected. (Remember “if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor” promise?) But when citizens lie to the government, that’s a felony crime. That’s why Martha Stewart went to prison, by the way: for lying to the government.

When police interrogate suspects, they are allowed to lie with impunity. But if that suspect makes one false statement to the police, even in the context of having been lied to by those same police, that’s now a felony crime.

If a government commits accounting fraud and lies about its earnings and debt, nobody goes to jail at the Treasury. But if a small business owner does the exact same thing, he or she gets arrested and charged with felony fraud.

When militarized government police accidentally raid the wrong house and drop flashbang grenades in baby’s cribs — or shoot people dead — nobody in law enforcement goes to jail. They are immune to the same laws that you and I must abide by.

The rules and laws are completely different, you see, depending on whether you are a Subject or an elite government “Officer.”

Illinois criminalizes citizen journalism

The arrogance of a state legislative body that would criminalize a citizen’s public filming of police is beyond astonishing. It is an open admission that lawmakers are so terrified of transparency that they would criminalize citizen journalism and thereby provide cover for yet more police abuse like we’re witnessing across America.

This criminalization of citizen journalism is not very far away from North Korean laws where it is a crime to criticize the “dear leader” Kim Jong-Un. In North Korea, citizens are subjects of the dictator — property of the state — and they have no inherent rights or privileges other than what is granted by the state. More and more, this looks like where America is headed, and as a key component of this descent into absolute dictatorial control over the people, nearly all the socialist-leaning political leftists in America have, for years, tried to completely disarm the American people by gutting the Bill of Rights, leaving the masses defenseless against an increasingly oppressive, elitist and heavily armed government (where police militarization is out of control).

It is no coincidence that the very same state which has now criminalized citizen journalism is also where large cities like Chicago have for years criminalized private gun ownership and concealed carry by honest citizens. This pursuit of injustice is a predictable pattern: the criminalization of recording video in public goes hand in hand with trampling citizens’ constitutional rights, police brutality and selective government prosecutions of political enemies. The fall of the republic doesn’t take very long to become the rise of in-your-face tyranny, where a police officer can literally choke you to death on the sidewalk and simultaneously have his badge wearing buddies arrest anyone nearby who has the courage to try to video record your murder.

Most cops are not bad guys

Sadly, this new law only furthers widespread public suspicion that police are badge-wearing thugs — a belief which is almost entirely NOT true.

Most local law enforcement officers are honest, upstanding professionals who help keep the peace in cities and towns which might otherwise be overrun with gang violence. Yet this Orwellian desire by Illinois lawmakers to shroud the actions of police in total secrecy just smacks of a deeply-ingrained culture of corruption and criminality.

If the police are helping keep the peace, then what could possibly be wrong with recording them on video? And aren’t police officers taxpayer-funded public servants in the first place? How can a member of the taxpaying public possibly be criminalized for recording the actions of a public servant who is essentially an employee of the People?

Even more fundamentally speaking, doesn’t the U.S. government (via the NSA) covertly record all our phone calls, emails, web surfing destinations, phone texts, social media posts and bank transactions? How is this massive government surveillance of the People possibly justified when that same government criminalizes citizens who attempt to shed a little light on the public actions of government employees? In the United States today, it turns out, “transparency” is a one-way looking glass.

Why the Illinois government is headed for imminent financial collapse

You may find it interesting to note that when the inevitable financial collapse comes, Illinois will be among the first three states to see their governments fall into financial ruin. Those three states are: 1) California, 2) Illinois, 3) New York.

Other states aren’t far behind, of course, but CA, IL and NY will be among the very first to collide with bankruptcy. All three of them are operating on the verge of imminent financial collapse, and all three are bastions of runaway socialism, elitist government arrogance and systemic oppression of constitutional rights and basic human liberty.

Only states that promote (or at least tolerate) individual responsibility and productivity will make it through the financial crash that’s coming. Those states include Vermont, Maine, Texas, Wyoming, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Montana and several others. I very much doubt you’ll see any of these states passing laws that turn citizen journalists into felons. (But keep in mind there is still a communist/socialist element in each of these states that’s trying to seize power in every election.)

Like many states, over the last two decades Illinois has become a cesspool of political corruption and abuse of power. State retirement funds, to the great surprise of many Illinois retirees, have already been looted and will at some point evaporate overnight, leaving state pensioners with no incomes.

The state is so incredibly corrupt that it doesn’t even have a state law requiring the gathering of statistics detailing citizen killings caused by police (justified or not). Those numbers remain completely hidden, just as the state’s budget is also deliberately obfuscated and hidden from the public. Illinois, the political home base of Barack Obama, is truly the land of non-transparency and obfuscation. Is it any wonder the White House so closely parallels the political actions of Chicago?

In a state where the citizens are criminalized for watching the police, no one is safe

America’s dissatisfaction with police seems to be at an all-time high. Recent events in Ferguson, MO and NYC reveal a seething undercurrent of anger and resentment toward what citizens increasingly see as police brutality, corruption and abuse of power.

Illinois has just made that perception far worse by criminalizing citizen journalism. Now, the honest citizens of Illinois don’t merely suspect Chicago cops are corrupt criminals… they KNOW it! The Illinois legislature all but admitted it in the law. “Thou shall not video record our police crimes against the citizens…”

Every Illinois lawmaker who voted for this law needs to be immediately recalled and thrown out of office. This law needs to be immediately revolted against, challenged in the courts and openly denounced by all Illinois citizens… Gandhi style. It is an unjust law born out of a corrupt legislature that’s terrified of what real transparency might reveal about their own criminal behavior. This abuse of government power has reached a breaking point across America, and the citizens have almost reached their tolerance limit for abuses of government power and the rapid erosion of their freedoms. (Or, those who are awake anyway. The mercury-injected masses will of course never regain real consciousness.)

But guess what? The U.S. Treasury is buying up emergency survival kits to be distributed to bankers across the nation [3], apparently in anticipation of something coming that might demand survival kits. With all the dead bankers being “suicided” lately — i.e. winding up dead under suspicious circumstances — I have no doubt there are forces at play behind the scenes that you and I can’t even imagine.

What I do know is that everyone left holding U.S. dollars when the music stops will wish they had diversified into other assets.

"http://yournewswire.com/qatar-pledges-1b-for-gaza-strip-reconstruction/","Qatar Pledges $1B for Gaza Strip Reconstruction","Qatar pledged $1 billion Sunday toward the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip after this year’s devastating 50-day Israel-Hamas war as one of its Gulf Arab rivals, the United Arab Emirates, promised $200 million.

The Qatari pledge, announced by Foreign Minister Khalid bin Mohammed al-Attiyah, came during a one-day conference on the reconstruction of Gaza that opened in the Egyptian capital. Delegates representing some 50 nations and 20 regional and international organizations applauded the pledge.

Beside the Emirates’ $200 million, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced immediate U.S. assistance of $212 million earlier Sunday.

The Emirates, like regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia, charges that Qatar has been using its massive wealth undermine stability in the region, primarily through aiding militant Islamic groups, including Gaza’s Hamas.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said Gaza needs $4 billion to rebuild. He said the latest Gaza war caused “tragedies that are difficult to be described by words. … Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble.”

“The (Palestinian) government will carry out the reconstruction plan with full responsibility and transparency in coordination with the U.N., the donors, international financial institutions, civil society and the private sector,” he said.

Donors plan to funnel the aid through Abbas’ Palestinian Authority, and bypass Hamas. On hand for the conference were representatives of more than 50 countries, mostly foreign ministers, and at least 20 regional and international organizations, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and European Union negotiator Catherine Ashton.

Leading participants said the reconstruction of Gaza cannot be carried out in isolation from efforts to revive Israeli-Palestinian talks in search of a comprehensive and lasting settlement.

“We must not lose sight of the root causes of the recent hostilities: A restrictive occupation that has lasted almost half a century, the continued denial of Palestinian rights and the lack of tangible progress in peace negotiations,” said Ban, who later announced in a news conference that he planned to visit Gaza on Tuesday.

“I call on all parties to come together to chart a clear course toward a just and final peace,” he told the conference, held amid tight security at a luxury hotel on the eastern outskirts of Cairo. “Going back to the status quo is not an option; this is the moment for transformational change.”

The latest conflict in Gaza was the most ruinous of three wars between Hamas and Israel since 2008, killing more than 2,000 Palestinians — mostly civilians, the U.N. says. Another 11,000 were wounded, and some 100,000 people remain homeless.

Kerry said Gazans “need our help desperately — not tomorrow, not next week, but they need it now.” He said the new U.S. money, which nearly doubles American aid to the Palestinians this year, would go to security, economic development, food and medicine, shelter and water and sanitation projects.

Abbas and the militant Hamas group, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, recently formed a national unity government which held its first Cabinet meeting in Gaza last week. But a blockade of Gaza enforced by both Egypt and Israel remains in force, causing the territory of 1.8 million people economic hardships and high unemployment.

"http://yournewswire.com/california-governor-signs-bill-banning-gmo-salmon-production/","California Governor Signs Bill Banning GMO Salmon Production","Gov. Jerry Brown signed a North Coast lawmaker’s bill banning the commercial production of genetically altered salmon.

AB 504, authored by Assemblyman Wes Chesbro, D-Arcata, extends the prohibition of spawning or cultivating so-called “transgenic salmonids” in the Pacific Ocean to all waters of the state. The hatchery production and stocking of such fish also is prohibited.

The legislation protects the state’s native steelhead trout and salmon populations, Chesbro said. He noted that federal food and drug regulators are reviewing an application by a company, AquaBounty Technologies, that seeks to raise genetically altered salmon in the United States.

“If these ‘frankenfish’ were to escape into our waters, they could destroy our native salmonid populations through interbreeding, competition for food and the introduction of parasites and disease,” Chesbro stated in a news release. “The only way to ensure this never happens is to ban commercial hatchery production, cultivation or stocking of transgenic salmonids in California.”

The legislation prohibits research or experimentation for the commercial production of genetically-altered salmonids.

The bill was sponsored by the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations.

"http://yournewswire.com/canada-university-website-hacked-by-islamic-state-supporters/","Canada University Website Hacked by Islamic State Supporters","A group of hackers, claiming to be the supporters of the Islamic State, allegedly hacked the website of the University of New Brunswick Student Union. According to the union, the website was hacked on Monday.

UNBSU spokesperson Nicole Saulnier said that the RCMP as well as the website provider had been “promptly contacted.” While the site was reportedly down for around two hours, the website featured texts which indicated that it had apparently been hacked by pro-IS hackers. “I love you ISIS,” the texts on the website said, “This time is a time of Islam and victory. And lift the injustice for Muslims and the elimination of America and the allies of the infidels.” The group also left its signature as “Hacked By Team System Dz” also appeared on the website, Toronto Sun reported.

According to Saulnier, the website might not have been a specific target by the group of hackers as the entire server had been hacked. The UNBSU President Greg Bailey said that the student union did not waste any time before contacting police. He said that there was “no threat to anyone on campus” as he called the incident “just an act of vandalism.” He said that it was no different from someone defacing the university office with spray paint. The act of “vandalism” was cleaned up in just two hours, according to Bailey.

The group of hackers, on the other hand, made it clear that it was no random attack. The university website was specifically targeted. The hackers, who belong to an Algerian Technology News Website, explained in an email that the Canadian university website had been targeted as Canada had become a part of the coalition against the Islamic State. The hacking group is apparently working on spreading the Arab youth’s vision to everyone in a peaceful manner.

CBC News reported that Canadian Prime Minister had earlier warned that IS jihadists might attack the country. Several other MPs echoed Harper’s warning on the issue. The House of Commons voted in favour of deploying Canadian troops in the Middle East as a part of the U.S.-led mission against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

"http://yournewswire.com/did-you-know-the-world-health-organization-admitted-this-shocking-fact/","Did You Know The World Health Organization Admitted This Shocking Fact?","After decades of research, back in 2009, almost SEVEN years ago, a little known study was quietly pushed under the rug and not talked much about in the media: The World Health Organization admitted that cell phones cause brain cancer. Brain Cancer.

Mobile telecom companies have been denying this for years and their tactics to make the public believe that cell phones are harmless was compared to the tobacco manufacturers massive push to get the public thinking that cigarettes were safe in the final scene of the film “Thank You For Smoking”.

There are many scientists who believe that cell phones are the cigarettes of the 21st Century. Here is a great short video entitled “Cell Phones & Cigarettes: What do they have in Common?”

[youtube url=”http://youtu.be/K4uz2TUcwnI” width=”600″ height=”400″ responsive=”yes” autoplay=”no”]

Natural News was one of the only media sources to report on this admission from The World Health Organization in 2009 in an article titled “World Health Organization Says Cell Phones can Cause Brain Cancer“. They reported:

The results of the decade-long Interphone study on cell phone safety are that heavy cell phone use increases the risk of developing brain tumors later in life. The study, which focused on three types of brain cancer and tumors of the parotid gland, found a significant increase in cancer after a decade or more of cell phone use.

When a cell phone tower connects with a cell phone, electromagnetic radiation is created. When the cell phone is held against the ear, this radiation penetrates the brain, particularly in children. According to the Daily Telegraph in London, the World Health Organization (WHO) will soon publish the results of the Interphone study, which was conducted in 12 countries by the International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC). Head researcher Dr. Elisabeth Cardis told the Telegraph, “In the absence of definitive results and in the light of a number of studies which, though limited, suggest a possible effect of radio frequency radiation, precautions are important.

I am therefore globally in agreement with the idea of restricting the use by children, though I would not go as far as banning mobile phones as they can be a very important tool, not only in emergencies, but also maintaining contact between children and their parents and thus playing a reassurance role. Means to reduce our exposure (use of hands-free kits and moderating our use of phones) are also interesting.” These results from the Interphone study follow closely on research published in the Oct 13 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, which reviewed existing research on the association between cell phones and brain tumors.

It found that when just the well-done studies were included, there was an 18% increased risk of brain tumors in cell phone users, and that they tended to occur on the side of the head that the cell phone was used most. In the United States, which did not participate in the Interphone study, there are 270 million cell phones in use. Senator Tom Harkin, now head of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has promised to probe more deeply into the question of a link between cell phones and brain cancer.

There’s no argument that cell phones emit an electromagnetic field, a form of microwave radiation, that enters the brain when the cell phone is held against the ear, and there’s good research showing that the field does affect brain function. Although research has not shown that short term cell phone use causes cancer, a large population study from Sweden has shown that people who use cell phones for more than ten years on the same side of the head have a 40% higher risk of certain types of brain tumors. The Interphone study adds to this evidence. Cell phone users can distance the brain from electromagnetic fields by using the speaker phone function, a headset, or by texting.

"http://yournewswire.com/al-jazeera-isils-war-just-went-global/","Al Jazeera: “ISIL’s war just went global”","An interesting read from Al Jazeera (source): ISIL has today announced a doctrinal shift in its ideology that carries potential historical significance.

In a new 42-minute message posted on Monday, it has called for the first time on its global support to take its fight to foreign shores beyond the Middle East.

Abu Mohammed Ali al-Adnani, the group’s spokesman, urges listeners to strike the US and its allies and neither seek permission nor to look for justification.

He calls on them to use any means necessary to cause the enemy injury. The language is formal and clear: “Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military, for they have the same ruling. Both of them are disbelievers.”

The US president, Barack Obama, is openly mocked. Adnani refers to him as a “mule of the Jews” and a coward who refuses to fight on the ground but chooses instead to strike from the air. The group insists it did not declare war against Europe and the US but has been forced to act following a US-led international response in Iraq.

ISIL is convinced that the states making up the coalition against them will pay dearly in both blood and treasure. The Arab nations backing the coalition are also singled out for attack. Indeed anyone anywhere who has criticised ISIL is now fair game.

This statement of intent is both significant and chilling in its simple declarative voice.

‎ISIL wants to carry out a big attack on the soil of the US and its allies. Failing that, the group wants individuals to carry out operations.

Any large-scale organised attack claimed by ISIL will serve two purposes. It will scare people in to going to war while giving politicians the cover to be able to do so. The September 11 attacks of 2001 and the ensuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are the textbook example of that. As in the past, this new venture may mean coalition boots on the ground.

ISIL want to engage in a ground war against coalition troops. The reason for that is simple. Their recruitment, they hope, will go through the roof as young men the world over flock to Iraq and Syria to fight and kill enemy soldiers.

When it comes to writing the history of ISIL, Adnani’s statement will be seen as one of its defining moments. This is the moment when a declaration of war was made against the US and its allies.

Who’s listening to ISIL?

However, is anyone paying attention?

Muslim opinion is quickly turning against the group, a point Adnani dismissed in his statement.

Will ISIL encourage individuals to commit murderous crimes in the name of religion? The Australians claim they’ve had a taste of ISIL’s successful foreign recruitment already. In recent days there have been several arrests of young men suspected of being inspired by ISIL. Anti-Islamic feeling in Australia is now on the rise as a result.

So, as much as this statement is an act of war, it’s also an opportunity to dissect and analyse what the group is thinking.

Condemnation of this statement will be swift as the content of the message proposes neither a solution nor a way out; it simply offers a lust for spilt blood. The group’s limited appeal will be exposed if Muslims in the US, Europe and beyond ignore this call to violence.

However, all it takes is one individual to commit a crime, and a whole religion will come under vocal attack by the security services, the media and society at large.

ISIL understands this and hopes to achievement such an outcome. They want Muslims in “enemy” countries to be criminalised and marginalised in the hope that they rise up in anger.

This is a group with nothing to lose. The “caliphate” it has created ‎is ill-defined and lacks credibility. Few Muslim groups have voiced support for ISIL. Now, it is under aerial bombardment fby a US-led coalition, a threat it both acknowledges and feigns to ignore by saying:

“We have no way to deal with their airplanes. Oh God what you have said is true. Do not weaken and do not grieve. You will be superior if you are true believers.”

ISIL have thrown down the gauntlet, not just to the US and its allies, but for Muslims living in those countries. What happens next and who responds will be of crucial importance.","2014-09-29 23:11:45","0","24.0","12.0","4.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","37.0","28.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","5.0","1","740","88.55","77.13","29.90","6.34","16.09","20.27","85.27","51.22","9.46","3.65","0.00","1.35","0.41","0.54","1.35","5.81","9.59","15.68","8.51","2.84","6.76","1.35","15.14","4.32","1.76","1.35","0.95","2.57","7.43","2.84","4.59","0.27","3.24","0.41","10.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.81","11.62","2.97","2.30","1.35","2.03","1.35","3.11","1.62","0.41","0.95","0.14","1.22","0.41","0.68","0.14","0.14","10.81","3.78","1.76","4.86","0.68","0.68","2.57","10.54","2.43","13.65","1.89","8.65","3.51","2.03","0.27","0.00","0.41","1.49","1.35","0.41","0.00","0.14","0.14","0.14","0.00","13.11","5.81","3.11","0.27","0.14","0.41","0.00","0.95","1.35","0.95","0.14","0.00","3326","7.62","16.954545454545453","1022","732","46","72.26","10.0","7.1","9.92","8.9","148","10.7","16.44743169398907","374","15.86","23","0.49","0","31","6","90","1","86","49","0","0","11","120","62","1","36","0","0","25","11","24","0","0","5","31","0","40","12","16","21","17","43","0","6","0","2"
"http://yournewswire.com/orphans-used-in-military-experiments/","Orphans used in ‘military experiments’","Holyrood’s child abuse inqury will hear shocking claims that British military scientists conducted drug tests on orphans in Scottish mental hospitals.

The Express reports: The allegations centre on at least four institutions where thousands of children are said to have been experimented upon in conditions described as “like something out of Auschwitz”.

It is alleged that Porton Down, the top secret military facility in Wiltshire, was involved in trialling drugs for use in the Cold War on youngsters who were regarded as “feeble-minded”.

One survivor told this newspaper he has obtained written and video evidence that he will pass to the public inquiry into historical abuse of children in care when it begins next year.

The man, now in his 50s, has been advised by lawyers to conceal his identity for his own safety until his full submission can be lodged at the inquiry announced by Scottish Education Secretary Angela Constance.

However, he was willing to divulge some of his intended testimony about the treatment he and others suffered.

He said: “Six and seven year olds were tied to racks and given electric shocks.

“I was incarcerated with orderlies armed with rubber coshes.

“We were imprisoned, experimented upon, lobotomies, you name it, they did it.

“I was there, I saw it with my own eyes.

“I was classed as a misfit, a mental oddity, made a ward of court.

“My mother was killed and I became an orphan, so they took it upon themselves to have me experimented upon.”

Lennox Castle Hospital, near Lennoxtown, East Dunbartonshire, is one of four Scottish institutions alleged to have been involved.

The witness believes there may have been as many as 3,500 children who were involved in the Porton Down testing programme over the years.

He said: “They were using orphans to experiment with drugs for the Cold War.

“The drug programme ran from 1948 to 1982.

“I believe this happened throughout the UK but I’m referring to Scotland.

“We share your opinion regarding the nuclear security problem. Nuclear security represents a key problem for the Swiss nuclear policy,” Burkhalter wrote in a letter to Vladimir Gutenev, first deputy chairman of Russia’s State Duma committee on industry.

In June, Gutenev sent Burkhalter a letter, warning him about the potential threat to the security of European countries in the case of man-made disasters at Ukraine’s nuclear power plants in light of the intention of the current Kiev authorities to sign an agreement on fuel supply from the United States.’

"http://yournewswire.com/us-mulling-to-deploy-thaad-in-s-korea-amid-concerns-from-china-russia/","US mulling to deploy THAAD in S Korea amid concerns from China, Russia","The United States says it is mulling to deploy an advanced missile system in South Korea, despite concerns from China and Russia over the move.

A high-ranking American defense official said that Washington is now trying to find an appropriate site for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD in South Korea, Stars and Stripes reported on Wednesday.

“We’re working with the government of South Korea now to determine if that is the right thing to do,” said US Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work in a forum in Washington DC hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations.

The US official said the missiles are “strategic assets” of the United States and their movement requires “very, very important national level decision,” according to a transcript of his comments.

The development comes amid concerns in South Korea that the deployment could draw the ire of China.

A spokesman for South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense said on Wednesday that Seoul has had no discussion with Washington regarding the deployment of a politically sensitive THAAD battery in the country.

He added that South Korea has not received any request from the United States about the deployment of the system.

The Korean official also refused to comment whether Seoul supports the idea of deploying THAAD into the country. Many in South Korea believe that China deems the system as a threat.

There have also been reports that Seoul has been under pressure from Washington in order to put the advanced anti-ballistic missile system in South Korea as part of a regional system which also includes Japan.

Last year the United States deployed a THAAD system in Guam, an unincorporated territory of the United States in the western Pacific Ocean.

“We’ve emphasized to both China and to Russia that these are not strategic anti-ballistic missiles, that … they are essentially designed to address regional threats against both our allies and against U.S. territory,” Works said during the forum.

“So we continue to work with the Russians and the Chinese to allay any concerns that they have, but they have both indicated concerns, without question.”

"http://yournewswire.com/more-than-400-arrested-as-ferguson-protests-spread-to-other-u-s-cities/","More Than 400 Arrested as Ferguson Protests Spread to Other U.S. Cities","From Reuters (source): National Guard troops and police aimed to head off a third night of violence on Wednesday in Ferguson, Missouri, as more than 400 people have been arrested in the St. Louis suburb and around the United States in unrest after a white policeman was cleared in the killing of an unarmed black teenager.

There have been protests in Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta and other cities decrying Monday’s grand jury decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson in the Aug. 9 shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in a case that has touched off a debate about race relations in the United States.

Ferguson, a predominately black city, has been hit by two nights of rioting, looting and arson with some businesses burned to the ground, but authorities say an increased security presence on Tuesday night helped quell the violence.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has deployed about 2,200 National Guard troops in and around Ferguson. Police made 45 arrests in Ferguson in the Tuesday night protests, down from 61 in aftermath of Monday’s grand jury decision.

“The ramped up presence and action of the Missouri National Guard has been helpful,” Nixon said on Wednesday after facing criticism for not deploying enough guardsman in the hours after the grand jury’s decision.

Tensions between police and black Americans have simmered for decades, with many blacks feeling the U.S. legal system and law enforcement authorities do not treat them fairly. In Washington, President Barack Obama has tried to keep a lid on anger that has spilled over to other cities and garnered international attention.

Obama remained cautious in his comments in the immediate aftermath of the Ferguson shooting, but has been more expansive in recent days including remarks at the White House after the grand jury’s decision. On Monday he said deep distrust exists between police and minorities and that “communities of color aren’t just making these problems up.”

Russia on Wednesday pointed to rioting in Ferguson and the other protests across the United States as evidence that Moscow’s detractors in Washington were hypocrites and in no position to lecture Russia on human rights.

St. Louis police said three people were arrested at a protest near City Hall on Wednesday in which activists staged a mock trial of Wilson, who told the grand jury he shot Brown because he feared for his life.

Ferguson’s mayor, James Knowles, is white, as are most of its city council members. A 2013 state attorney general’s report found more than 85 percent of motorists pulled over in the city are black, and the arrest rate among blacks is twice the rate among white residents.

‘SAD FACT’

Obama’s Justice Department is probing the Ferguson shooting as it considers whether to bring federal civil rights charges against the officer and the police department.

“The sad fact is that it brings up issues that we’ve been struggling with in this country for a long, long time,” said Matthew Green, an associate professor of politics at the Catholic University of America.

“These are not problems and issues that are going to get resolved by one president in the remainder of his term.”

Wilson said his conscience was clear. He told ABC News that there was nothing he could have done differently that would have prevented Brown’s death. But the parents of the slain teenager said they did not accept the officer’s version of the events.

“I don’t believe a word of it,” Brown’s mother Lesley McSpadden told “CBS This Morning” on Wednesday.

The crowds in Ferguson were smaller and more controlled than on Monday, when about a dozen businesses were torched and others were looted amid rock-throwing and sporadic gunfire from protesters and volleys of tear gas fired by police. More than 60 people were arrested then.

“Generally, it was a much better night,” St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters on Wednesday, adding there was little arson or gunfire, and that lawlessness was confined to a relatively small group.

A Conoco gas station and convenience store in Ferguson has escaped looters with armed, black local residents guarding the white-owned store.

Protests over the Ferguson decision in several major cities on Tuesday night shut highways and led to some arrests.

Police in Boston said on Wednesday that 45 people were arrested in protests overnight that drew more than a thousand demonstrators. In Dallas, seven were arrested for blocking traffic on Interstate 35, a major north-south U.S. roadway.

In New York, where police used pepper spray to control the crowd after protesters tried to block the Lincoln Tunnel and Triborough Bridge, 10 demonstrators were arrested, police said.

Protesters in Los Angeles threw water bottles and other objects at officers outside city police headquarters and later obstructed both sides of a downtown freeway with makeshift roadblocks and debris, authorities said.","2014-11-27 02:22:09","0","29.0","12.0","4.0","0.0","9.0","0.0","37.0","28.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","5.0","1","811","96.71","56.37","52.21","9.22","23.85","25.89","74.11","41.18","5.06","1.60","0.12","0.12","0.00","1.11","0.25","3.45","7.27","16.77","6.17","1.60","4.81","1.11","10.48","6.29","3.08","0.62","2.59","1.97","4.07","1.36","2.71","0.37","1.36","0.25","5.67","0.25","0.00","0.12","1.11","7.27","1.73","0.99","0.49","0.74","0.49","2.96","3.58","1.85","1.36","0.37","0.37","0.12","0.12","0.00","0.12","8.75","1.23","0.86","5.30","0.37","1.48","5.67","3.95","0.25","18.13","1.11","11.84","5.18","3.95","0.12","0.37","0.49","0.12","0.49","0.12","0.00","0.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.69","4.69","4.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.62","1.85","1.85","0.12","0.00","3994","8.42","29.5","1178","804","34","55.98","12.8","11.3","12.94","14.7","184","11.625","20.594228855721397","415","26.93","11","0.42","0","31","17","67","1","125","59","6","1","2","122","122","4","68","0","0","13","6","15","2","0","6","13","0","13","49","15","30","12","17","4","1","0","2"
"http://yournewswire.com/fracking-a-violation-of-our-basic-human-rights-new-report/","Fracking a ‘Violation of Our Basic Human Rights’ – New Report","As the gas drilling industry tries to lay claim to the UK, a new report, delivered to David Cameron, issues warnings against hydraulic fracturing.

Article by Richard Heasman, DeSmog Blog

A hard hitting report commissioned by the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation was delivered this week to David Cameron and called on the government to investigate the impact of fracking on the rights of individuals.

The report cites human rights liabilities for the British government if fracking is to commence commercially across the UK. It was co-authored by the Global Network for the Study of Human Rights and the Environment as well as the Environment and Human Rights Advisory and the Human Rights Consortium at the University of London.

It focuses primarily on the health implications of people living by frack sites, where the government is “legally bound to respect and protect human rights, both under the auspices of its own Human Rights Act 1998 and of the European Convention on Human Rights.”

Under these acts, the UK is obligated to consider the environmental impacts of industry on its citizens by allowing for public participation as well as the ‘right to life’, which protects citizens from living near dangerous and contaminated areas, including poisonous water supplies.

The report also highlights the government’s concentrated efforts to sell the positives of fracking over a steady informative review, with consistent claims that burning shale gas produces fewer greenhouse emissions than burning coal.

This claim is disputed by the report, which was personally delivered to the Prime Minister’s home in Westminster by Bianca Jagger, the human rights advocate and Council of Europe Goodwill Ambassador, who believes renewable technologies offer greater rewards to the environment than fossil fuels.

“Fracking agenda”

The report particularly cites a 2011 submission to the UN Human Rights Council which argued: “The environmental damage caused by hydraulic fracturing for natural gas poses ‘a new threat to human rights’.”

Speaking about the report, Jagger stated: “The UK Government is promoting a fracking agenda despite the well-documented health and environmental impacts. The Government has disregarded the Human Rights of ordinary citizens.

“They are rushing through changes to the law of trespass to speed up the ability of shale gas companies to frack under people’s homes without their consent. The re-writing of the law is being introduced despite widespread public concern about the health and environmental impact of fracking and in the face of overwhelming public resistance from ordinary people.”

“The Infrastructure Bill [which covers shale gas development] is a violation of our basic Human Rights and of our democratic process.”

The government recently came under increasing criticism over a proposed amendment to the Infrastructure Bill which would allow fracking companies to use “any substance” under people’s homes in the extraction of shale gas.

As the Foundation’s report concludes: “There has been virtually no consideration at the policy level of the human rights dimensions of fracking.”

The full report will be launched on 30th November at the University of London.","2014-12-01 15:26:22","0","20.0","30.0","4.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","43.0","28.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","5.0","1","499","99.00","73.27","9.20","17.09","29.35","30.26","73.75","42.69","3.61","0.80","0.00","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.40","2.81","12.02","18.84","3.61","2.20","4.01","0.40","6.01","3.61","2.20","1.40","0.40","0.60","3.41","1.40","2.00","0.40","1.00","0.20","7.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.41","1.20","1.60","0.60","0.60","0.40","1.40","0.80","0.00","0.20","0.60","1.80","0.20","1.40","0.00","0.20","7.82","0.60","1.00","4.81","0.60","1.40","1.20","3.41","0.20","11.02","1.60","8.22","1.20","8.02","0.20","0.60","0.80","0.20","0.00","0.60","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.60","0.00","12.63","3.41","2.81","0.60","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.60","3.41","1.40","0.00","0.40","2645","9.48","42.0","827","496","17","33.38","16.2","15.9","15.33","19.2","138","12.875","24.809032258064516","248","33.42","6","0.41","0","12","3","65","1","74","38","2","0","2","74","61","5","36","0","0","3","5","13","0","0","1","19","0","12","8","20","17","3","22","5","1","0","1"

According to the report, the technology is used to answer one question, “Am I who I say I am?”

Some worry, however, that the RFID Microchip will give the government too much power, allowing them to track every move. In some states, like Virginia, legislation is in process to stop his from happening.

The report also reveals an RFID Brain Chip that has been developed and is currently being tested on several humans.

Her assertions were particularly passionate following the beheading of an American Journalist.

In fact, her comments have caused outrage in the Muslim community. Omar Baddar, an analyst for the Huffington post, took to social media to call for a movement that would ultimately get Tantaros fired.

Of course, others maintain that Tantaros is merely exercising her freedom of speech. She is also representing a sentiment contained by many Americans who believe that terrorists and radical Islam pose a direct and immediate threat.

ISIS in particular has a trail of blood in their path, and have been known to go as far as beheading children.

"http://americannews.com/what-obama-just-did-to-tony-stewart-has-the-country-shocked/","What Obama Just Did To Tony Stewart Has The Country Shocked","Recently, President Obama publicly congratulated Tony Stewart on winning his third Spring Cup Championship. He welcomed the NASCAR champion and his fellow drives into the White House. And then he revealed his prediction that Stewart would not be the winner this year.

“In fact, he said that if he did end up winning the championship—this is a quote—‘I’ll declare I’m a totally bumbling idiot.’ Here’s your chance, Tony.’”

Obama also took the opportunity to thank NASCAR for supporting our troops, and for their partnership with Joining Forces.

“You look out for Gold Star families,” the President announced. “You make regular visits to Walter Reed to raise spirits there. And for you guys to give that much back to folks who have given so much to us as a country and help protect us and keep us safe is remarkable. So I want to thank all of you for what you do on behalf of our troops.”","2014-08-29 12:38:27","0","28.0","37.0","3.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","58.0","17.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","25.0","4","158","59.63","98.36","1.00","99.00","15.80","18.35","86.71","52.53","18.35","13.92","1.90","3.16","3.80","4.43","0.63","4.43","5.70","13.92","5.70","4.43","7.59","0.63","13.29","3.16","1.27","1.27","0.63","1.90","8.23","7.59","0.63","0.00","0.63","0.00","18.99","1.27","1.90","0.00","5.70","6.96","0.63","1.27","1.90","1.27","1.90","1.27","3.16","1.90","1.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.46","7.59","4.43","6.96","3.16","1.27","2.53","9.49","1.90","9.49","1.27","5.06","3.80","3.16","0.63","1.27","0.00","0.63","0.00","0.63","0.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.09","6.33","3.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.43","3.16","0.00","0.00","702","7.45","20.125","215","156","10","72.56","10.1","7.0","9.8","8.6","30","4.875","15.932307692307695","113","18.25","5","0.5","0","6","0","12","0","17","9","0","0","1","13","20","0","8","0","0","15","7","11","0","0","2","7","0","9","7","3","1","8","3","0","2","0","0"
"http://americannews.com/bombshell-mike-brown-had-gang-affiliation-and-was-a-murderer/","BOMBSHELL: Mike Brown Had Gang Affiliation And Was A Murderer","Poor, sweet, innocent Mike Brown. That is the racially-charged story that is sweeping the nation. And it’s a compelling one—to think that an evil officer shot an innocent boy for no apparent reason other than race. But it’s not the truth.

In fact, the media’s version of the truth leaves out some very important facts. Like, for instance, the fact that Mike Brown had a juvenile criminal record. This follows reports from a journalist who claims that he has a lawsuit that will prove that Mike Brown was a gang member and a key suspect in a murder.

Recently, Charles Johnson, Editory-in-Chief of GotNews, announced that despite the family’s claims that Brown did not have a criminal record, evidence is starting to point elsewhere. Johnson revealed that he’d been approached by at least two law enforcement officers claiming that Brown did have a sealed record. He immediately filed suit to have the records released.

“To find out if these police officers are correct requires seeing Brown’s juvenile arrest record, which ought to be freely available given that he is dead and therefore has no right to privacy remaining,” Johnson stated. “Knowing the truth about Brown’s past will help us gauge the credibility of his parents and family who have called him a ‘gentle giant.’”

According to Johnson’s attorney, Brown’s records are no longer sealed because he is deceased. The court hearing takes place on September 3, and the records may be released after that decision. If the story is true, it would prove a major plot twist.","2014-08-29 12:35:40","0","29.0","37.0","3.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","58.0","17.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","25.0","4","261","78.24","60.58","8.19","75.53","17.40","23.75","80.08","47.89","11.49","3.07","0.00","0.38","0.00","2.68","0.00","8.43","9.96","9.96","11.11","1.53","3.45","1.92","14.94","6.51","2.30","1.15","1.15","1.15","4.98","3.83","1.15","0.00","0.38","0.00","7.66","0.77","0.38","0.00","3.07","13.41","3.83","1.53","1.53","1.53","4.21","3.45","3.45","2.68","0.38","0.00","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.38","7.28","2.30","0.00","4.60","0.77","0.00","3.45","8.43","1.15","9.58","1.53","5.36","2.68","2.30","0.38","0.77","0.38","0.00","1.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.01","5.75","5.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.15","1.92","3.83","0.00","0.00","1222","7.8","19.285714285714285","364","257","15","71.04","10.9","7.6","11.25","10.5","54","5.642857142857143","17.24466926070039","165","18.07","0","0.47","0","6","3","32","0","29","18","0","1","5","49","22","0","10","0","0","10","1","10","0","0","2","7","0","14","10","8","9","3","15","4","2","0","0"
"http://americannews.com/trey-gowdy-just-uncovered-something-huge-claims-he-has-evidence-to-arrest-obama/","Trey Gowdy Just Uncovered Something Huge, Claims He Has Evidence To Arrest Obama","According to recent reports, Trey Gowdy claims that he has evidence of a “systematic, intentional” effort by the Obama administration to hide some revealing documents that may give Congress insight into the 2012 Benghazi attacks.

“I have evidence that, not only are they hiding it, but there’s an intent to hide it,” the Republican House Member told Fox News. “I can’t disclose that evidence yet, but I have evidence that there was a systematic, intentional decision to withhold certain documents from Congress—and we’re just sick of it.”

Gowdy made the comments in response to a question regarding why Secretary of State John Kerry had been subpoenaed by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. According to reports, California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa wants an explanation from Kerry about why the panel did not receive an email that revealed Ben Rhodes providing U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice to link the Benghazi attacks to an anti-Muslim video.

The shocking email was released by Judicial Watch, who sued the State Department in order to obtain documents relating to Benghazi last year.

“Not only are we trying to get answers with respect to Benghazi, we’re also now investigating what appears to be a White House cover-up in one of the worst explanations for why they didn’t turn the documents over,” Gowdy told Fox. “I think the speaker just finally lost his patience. I’m glad he did what he did. “

What do you think of Gowdy’s claims?

In an unofficial campaign that attempts to make the people’s voice heard, Americans are calling for the impeachment of Obama. The Washington Post calls the event the “hardcore of the hardcore” and criticizes the organizers for holding on to this cause.

The protest is a taking place over a nine-day period between August 23rd and August 31st.

Below is a statement from the organization’s website:

The protest theme is to impeach and remove Obama from office for the following reasons. Gerald Ford said in the 1970’s that an “impeachable offense” is whatever the Congress will vote for at a given time. We are not here to bicker about what is impeachable, but to demand that this lawless, subversive and anti-American president be removed from office. We hold, however, that Obama is, in fact, criminal and treasonous. He and his collaborators are a grave threat to our representative constitutional republic.","2014-08-30 12:46:43","0","29.0","38.0","3.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","58.0","17.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","25.0","4","179","93.86","69.24","21.18","3.87","19.89","25.14","80.45","49.72","9.50","3.35","0.00","2.23","0.00","1.12","0.00","6.15","11.73","14.53","6.70","2.79","5.59","0.56","11.17","1.12","0.00","1.12","1.12","1.12","4.47","1.12","3.35","0.56","2.79","0.56","6.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.12","6.70","1.68","1.68","0.00","0.56","0.56","2.79","1.68","0.00","1.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.94","2.23","0.00","5.59","1.12","0.56","1.68","7.26","0.56","12.85","1.68","5.59","5.03","4.47","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.64","5.03","4.47","1.12","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.12","2.23","1.68","0.00","0.00","860","8.74","20.11111111111111","270","176","9","60.04","12.3","9.8","12.24","12.3","46","10.1","20.294545454545457","118","18.78","0","0.49","0","8","4","24","0","23","17","0","0","1","27","16","1","5","0","0","4","2","7","0","0","0","7","0","8","1","4","2","7","11","1","1","0","0"
"http://americannews.com/video-michelle-obama-takes-aggressive-action-against-a-photographer/","VIDEO: Michelle Obama Takes Aggressive Action Against A Photographer","Recently, the First Lady was caught in a shocking not-so-lady-like moment. A recent video reveals a photographer witnessing Michelle’s wrath as she power-walked with her friends on Martha’s Vineyard last weekend.

The video shows a member of the press approaching Michelle, and being confronted by a female Secret Service agent.

“Come on, really?” the Agen says to the cameraman. “Sir, she’s having a private moment right now.” The agent proceeds to attempt to block the photographer, while Michelle can be seen mouthing “don’t do that!” and then running away.

Now, the photographer’s publication, Vocatiy, is speaking out against the First Lady and her staff for their aggressive behavior.

“It’s hardly controversial to say that the president and his family deserve some privacy—everyone does,” a representative told The Blaze. “But there is, of course, a heated debate around the administration’s relationship with the news media and their tightly scripted control of images, which the New York Times has called ‘Orwellian.’”

Recently, a Marine veteran from the War on Terror, decided to take matters into his own hands—writing a heated letter to Islamic extremists.

Here is what Nick Powers had to say:

#AMessagefromUStoISIS

To all you ignorant Islamic extremist f—-. As I sit here watching you execute women, children and men in the Middle East I chuckle. Why do I chuckle you may ask? Well let me explain something to you idiots who think you are so tough. You are scaring a population that doesn’t know how to fight, you’re bullying the weak.

What did Saddam’s troops do when we came to town? Surrendered, twice… All your threats of coming to America and raising your flag over the White House amuse me more than you could ever understand. In 2012 there were 21.2 million veterans in the United States. Do you understand what that means? That means there are millions of pissed off veterans who have been dealing with years of abuse from their government stabbing them in the backs and having to watch friends die because you Islamic idiots can’t seem to act like human beings and stop terrorism and violence.

It’s one thing to take over an Islamic state, pretty sure we plowed through Fallujah in 4 days, do you really think you stand a chance on US soil? Do you really think it would be smart to poke that bear? Remember we are armed in the US and I can promise you that the Geneva Conventions will not apply to you. You attack us and there is no mercy. The ball is in your court Islam, we are more than ready to send you to your “prophet” Mohamed….

"http://americannews.com/video-riots-ensue-after-officers-caught-urinating-on-mike-brown-memorial/","VIDEO: Riots Ensue After Officers Caught Urinating On Mike Brown Memorial","Recently, a shocking story has surfaced in which a police officer allegedly allowed his dog to urinate on the spot where Mike Brown was shot and killed just three weeks ago. A day after his death, a memorial was erected for the 18-year-old. Apparently, this is the exact spot where the dog relieved himself.

According to reports, a group of unnamed police officers are also reported to have driven over the flowers and candles that Brown’s mother had taken to the memorial.

Not surprisingly, the actions spurred more protests from the already-violent black rioters in Ferguson. According to Missouri State Representative Sharon Pace, “That made people in the crowd mad and it made me mad.”

At the time of the incident, the officer was present with a police dog, being used to quell rioters. One might argue that the officer has very little control over where his dog urinates.

"http://americannews.com/muslims-fight-to-ban-christianity-from-the-military/","Muslims Fight To Ban Christianity From The Military","You learn a lot of things in the United States military. Including not to eat or drink in front of Muslims, and to learn more about their religion. At least, that’s according to recent reports from Fox News.

Apparently, that directive was released to active duty military personnel at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, which is a Department of Defense medical and graduate school in Maryland. The instructions were released just before the start of Ramadan.

“This is a period of great personal restraint and commitment in addition to renewed focus on worship,” Brigade Commander Col. Kevin Glasz wrote. “I’d like to encourage you to learn just a little more about this religion, but more importantly, I’m asking you to be considerate and do not consume food or drink in front of our Muslim colleagues; it is a simple, yet respectful action.”

In his email, the brigade commander provided a link to a website about Islam.

The announcement received some backlash from some of the officers and doctors who were in training.

“I respect the intention behind this email, but note that there is no similar call honoring other faiths,” one Marine told a Fox News reporter. “There is no similar invitation for non-Jewish colleagues to refrain from eating leavened products during Passover, or non-Christian colleagues to refrain from eating meat during Lent.”

The Marine continued on to conclude, “Our veterans have sacrificed too much blood, sweat and tears to have their own rights and freedoms be sacrificed on the altar of progressive political correctness.”

“Our troops are being told to respect the Muslim Ramadan and encouraged to say ‘Ramadan Kareem,’ while at the same time they cannot have a cross on chapels, display a manger scene or say ‘Merry Christmas’ for fear of offending,” another officer said. “There is something wrong with this picture.”

While we are not against religious tolerance, if the institution is attempting to make a statement, shouldn’t it be supporting all religions equally?","2014-09-08 13:06:06","1","33.0","38.0","3.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","58.0","17.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","25.0","4","333","90.54","64.09","18.48","84.18","20.81","28.23","87.09","48.95","8.71","4.20","0.90","1.20","0.90","0.30","0.90","4.50","7.51","17.12","7.51","3.30","5.11","2.10","12.01","5.41","3.30","0.60","0.30","3.30","6.61","4.80","1.50","0.30","0.30","0.30","8.41","0.00","0.90","0.00","0.30","9.31","1.80","0.90","0.60","3.00","0.90","3.90","1.50","0.60","0.90","0.00","3.60","0.60","0.90","0.00","2.10","8.71","3.00","0.30","4.20","0.30","1.20","2.40","8.11","0.00","9.91","0.60","5.71","3.90","6.31","0.60","0.00","0.00","6.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.02","4.50","5.71","0.00","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.60","4.80","1.80","0.00","0.00","1633","9.24","30.636363636363637","498","331","16","58.92","13.2","10.2","12.65","13.2","96","6.5","21.881208459214506","210","26.82","3","0.49","0","14","1","35","0","46","29","1","1","0","48","31","3","17","0","0","10","6","10","2","0","0","16","0","19","11","9","5","11","7","1","1","0","0"
"http://americannews.com/obamas-personal-threats-to-this-fox-news-anchor-just-blew-up-in-his-face/","Obama’s Personal Threats To This FOX News Anchor Just Blew Up In His Face","It is clear that the Obama administration has increased efforts to keep Fox News out of press briefings, and to stop them from reporting the truth about Benghazi. Obama has publicly proclaimed that the station is “unfair” for focusing on his unconstitutional actions.

Still, Fox News has continued strong in is opposition of Obama, and its desire to bring the truth to the American people. Now, it appears that administration has publicly spoken out against Fox News again, this time via social media.

According to reports, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki and Marie Harf could not stay quiet after receiving some harsh criticism from Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. Reportedly, O’Reilly was interviewing Fox reporter James Rosen about conflicting statements that were being made during a press conference held by Psaki. O’Reilly suggested that she was in over her head, and was perhaps unable to handle the pressure of the position she held.

The comments received a reaction from Marie Harf, who claimed that O’Reilly was sexist for criticizing Psaki. She failed to acknowledge that O’Reilly has voiced the same level of concern over press secretaries Jay Carney and Josh Earnest.

Harf’s tweet resulted in immediate response from the world of social media, and they became the source of much humor for the day. It is interesting that the pair did not recognize that as a public figure, they will face some criticism without doubt. Hopefully the incident will teach the entire administration a lesson when it comes to attempts to censor the press.","2014-09-08 12:50:34","0","29.0","37.0","3.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","58.0","17.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","25.0","4","258","91.20","70.64","8.57","19.95","21.50","21.32","79.84","45.35","9.30","3.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.94","1.16","6.20","7.75","15.12","7.75","3.10","3.10","1.16","11.63","2.71","1.16","0.78","0.00","1.55","5.81","2.71","3.10","0.78","1.16","0.39","8.14","0.00","0.00","1.55","0.39","10.47","2.33","1.94","1.16","2.33","1.55","1.55","4.26","0.78","1.55","1.94","0.78","0.78","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.98","1.16","1.16","3.49","0.39","1.55","4.65","5.81","1.16","12.02","2.71","5.04","5.43","5.81","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.00","1.94","0.00","1.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.40","4.65","4.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.78","2.71","0.00","0.00","1262","8.61","21.583333333333332","385","253","12","58.52","12.3","10.3","12.59","13.4","63","10.2","20.4004743083004","156","20.42","5","0.46","0","6","0","24","0","36","14","0","0","3","36","43","0","10","0","0","10","3","9","0","0","1","9","0","11","14","9","7","0","11","1","1","0","1"

Some have even started to protest.

“As far as I know, there’s no reason to believe this was an assault that broke out due to race,” Lisa Cox, Springfield Police Department spokeswoman told reporters. Still, on Friday, the departments Facebook page received more than 1,500 comments from users who believe there was racial motivation in the incident.

According to reports, the victims Meredith J. Cole (19) and Alex J. Vessey (23), suffered serious injuries following the attack, which happened by six black males. According to Cole, the attack happened after the men were disrespectful to her in a club downtown, and her boyfriend went outside to get a better look at them so that he could report the incident to police. As the couple was walking away, they were attacked.

"http://americannews.com/article-claims-obamas-face-will-be-put-on-new-dollar-bill/","Article Claims Obama’s Face Will Be Put On New Dollar Bill","Recently, and article was posted claiming that Barack Obama will be the face of the new dollar bill. While the “facts” listed in the article are a bit far fetched, it certainly raises some questions. And the humorous political commentary throughout the article is worth sharing in itself.

According to the article in the Weekly World News, Barack Obama will be on the new dollar bill. The Dollar Redesign Project, the article claims, was organized by creative strategy consultant Richard Smith, who hopes that a “rebranded redesign” would help the global recession.

Pointing to a site called “The Dollar Redesign Project” the article claims that “Benjamin Bernanke has signed off on our choice for the redesign.”

Here is some of the rest of the article:

“We don’t need a complete redesign of our coins, but we do want to put President Obama on the penny and move President Lincoln to the nickel. Thomas Jefferson, who was on the nickel, will be… discontinued.” Republican Congressman Paul Ryan suggested President Obama be put on both the “nickel and dime” instead of the penny.

Another American icon might also be replaced. “Uncle Sam is outdated,” said Axelrod. “We need to update this icon as well. It will now be Uncle Barack.”

Republicans are apoplectic about the changes the Administration is proposing. “They won’t get this passed when we get control of the house,” said Minority Leader John Boehner. “Typical Republicans, they want to block everything, even a little meaningless design issue,” said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. “It doesn’t matter what they think, we’re going to pass this and every American will be carrying Obama dollars in their wallets and purses come June.”

FYI: The Obama dollar will reportedly be worth $0.47.","2014-09-08 21:52:29","0","32.0","41.0","3.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","58.0","17.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","25.0","4","290","85.22","83.29","6.84","64.98","16.11","23.79","76.90","45.52","8.97","3.79","0.00","2.41","0.00","0.00","1.38","5.17","11.03","10.00","10.34","2.76","3.79","1.03","17.93","3.10","0.69","1.38","0.34","2.07","2.07","2.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.97","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.69","7.93","1.38","1.03","2.07","1.72","1.72","0.69","1.38","0.00","1.38","0.00","0.34","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.24","3.10","1.03","3.10","0.69","0.00","3.45","10.69","3.10","12.07","3.45","5.52","3.10","4.48","0.00","0.69","6.21","0.00","0.00","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.34","0.00","21.72","6.55","5.17","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.59","1.38","0.00","0.34","1393","8.46","21.071428571428573","437","290","18","63.59","11.8","8.4","11.83","10.5","74","6.333333333333333","18.646896551724137","172","18.79","1","0.44","0","7","2","40","0","24","17","0","0","8","39","48","2","7","0","0","12","3","11","0","0","1","7","0","16","9","7","11","10","10","0","3","0","1"

After Biden claimed that America could “drive and follow ISIS to the gates of hell”, soldiers began started speaking out against him. In doing so, they revealed the harsh truth about the policy that the current administration has implemented.

“Follow #ISIS to the Gates of Hell? We’re not allowed to follow them out the front gate of our base!” one soldier tweeted online.

It is becoming increasingly clear that United States forces are being halted by the current administration, in an effort to be more tolerant to religious differences and those who worship Allah. Even if that means losing Americans to violent beheadings.

Our president has done virtually nothing to show ISIS militants that their acts of violence and aggression will not be tolerated by the United States, even though the videos released were designed to be a statement to America.

And, as one article puts it, “in an effort to appear morally superior, we’ve come off as weak and hesitant.” We’re slowly losing our reputation as a country that will stand up for itself, and has the means to do so.

According to reports, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe shocked his audience when he told them that, “all white people should go back to England.”

“What is the problem?” He continued. “We now have aeroplanes which can take them back quicker than the ships used by their ancestors.”

Zimbabwe was once part of the British Empire, but gained its independence from Rhodesia in 1980. Mugabe has historically been seen as a hero in his country for taking land “back” from white framers and giving it to black citizens. Because of his actions, he has also faced international scrutiny.

During the same speech, Mugabe told the crowd that President Obama is afraid of him.

However, her latest idea is by far one of the oddest ideas we’ve heard from the Obamas so far—and that is saying a lot.

Recently, reports unveiled a plan from Michelle’s organization Let’s Move to create talking water fountains. These fountains talk to people as they walk by. It also entertains the drinker as they are drinking from it, telling them the benefits of drinking water.

According to reports, the fountain will start talking when a person’s lips touch the water and while recite a series of phrases as long as the person is drinking.

Meanwhile, our borders remain unprotected. We might as well have a welcome sign for violent gangs or drug cartels to cross into our country. Now, we face a continued threat from ISIS.

According to recent reports, ISIS terrorists have begun working out of Ciudad Juarez, just eight piles outside of El Paso, Texas. The reports are not as outlandish as they may seem. ISIS insurgents have allegedly been encouraged to sneak through our southern border and into the United States.

A government watchdog group released the original report, claiming that the information had been confirmed by high-level law enforcement. The report also claims that officials have been picking up on radio chatter that indicates that groups are considering an attack on the border.

Homeland Security, defense agencies, and the DOJ are staying on high alert. Meanwhile, the Obama administration steadfastly denies having any knowledge of threats.

"http://americannews.com/breaking-obama-caught-arming-the-isis/","BREAKING: Obama Caught Arming The ISIS","According to new reports, some Americans are now claiming that Obama himself is responsible for the rise of ISIS, as well as the technologically advanced weaponry they are now touting. Obama’s involvement with the group extends beyond the Benghazi attack, and back to Libya in 2012.

According to a new military intelligence report released by the West Point counterterrorism center, the increase in weaponry can track back to Libya, when Obama unilaterally decided to wage war on Qaddafi. At the time, Obama gave arms to Libyan rebels, who were linked to Al-Qaeda. Ultimately, Libyan militants were able to assassinate Qaddafi and overthrow his regime.

Still, Libya has been left to recover as a terrorist state, and the United States has been unable to recover the weapons we once provided. This was still taking place in Benghazi, under the direction of the CIA. Some even suspect this is the reason for the attack. While that connection is in the question, a new shocking discovery is not.

According to the report, the “moderate” Syrian rebels have started to build an increasing partnership with Al Nusra Front, linked closely to Al Qaeda. The weapons are now believed to have fallen into the hands of ISIS. They are joined by the weapons Obama provided to the Iraqi Army, which were abandoned as they fled their posts to avoid ISIS advances.

"http://americannews.com/judge-promises-obama-will-serve-10-years-to-life-for-this-major-crime/","Judge Promises Obama Will Serve 10 Years To Life For This Major Crime","At the beginning of this year, President Obama blatantly disregarded Congress when he decided to free five Taliban leaders from the Guantanamo Bay prison. The action has since been viewed as “aiding and abetting” the enemy, as well as providing them with “material support.” There are also allegations that the President involved a large sum of cash in the deal—all hoping to return army deserter Bowe Bergdahl.

Now, the House has opened an investigation into the circumstances leading up to the exchange, believing that it is very likely that several laws were broken. These laws would land citizens in prison for years, and Americans wonder how it will affect the president.

According to Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, even if Obama had made the decision to involve Congress, his actions till would have been illegal.

“The statue requiring the 30 days notice prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars, or federal funds, to pay for the removal of anybody from Gitmo,” the judge claimed. “The other unlawful behavior is far more problematic for the President, and that is the argument that by releasing these guys into the theater of war that is the Middle East, he has provided material assistance to a terrorist organization…Federal statute makes it a crime, punishable by 10 years in jail, up to life in prison, for materially aiding a terrorist organization.”

The judge also confirmed that he believes the President did provide material assistance, but he doubts Obama will be prosecuted by Attorney General Eric Holder.

During his presidency, he has deliberately weakened our military with budget cuts and new policies—not to mention a purging of high-ranking officers that refuse to support his own agenda.

In fact, his blatant efforts have gotten to the point that Generals and officers have decided to take a stand against the president.

Retired Generals Paul Vallely and Tom McInerney have been the leaders in the group opposing the president, and are encouraging both former and current military leaders to speak their piece against him. According to reports, they are extraordinarily worried that America is vulnerable to attacks right now.

Not only are our borders being left unprotected, but so is a threat from inside for those who have entered our country illegally. McInerney believes that “something bad” is likely to happen to our country in the near future if we don’t take action.

The report includes some gruesome details of the attack, during which Muhammad put his wife in a vehicle against her will, and began to physically assault her. When she tried to leave, Muhammad told her he could kill her, due to his “Islamic belief.”

In fairness, Harman did acknowledge that Obama has made numerous policy errors that hasn’t helped the situation. According to her, his policies regarding the use of drones and military force have made situations in the Middle East worse.

What do you think? Are Harman’s comments fair or is she putting too much of the weight on the Bush administration?","2014-07-18 03:24:31","0","28.0","37.0","3.0","1.0","13.0","0.0","58.0","17.0","0.0","140.0","0.0","25.0","4","164","94.93","76.78","29.01","5.89","18.22","21.34","78.66","46.34","9.15","4.27","0.00","0.61","0.61","3.05","0.00","4.88","10.37","14.63","9.15","1.22","2.44","0.61","14.02","6.71","4.88","1.22","0.00","1.22","3.05","0.61","2.44","0.00","1.22","0.00","7.93","0.00","0.00","2.44","0.61","9.15","2.44","4.27","0.61","1.22","0.00","1.22","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.61","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.61","9.15","0.61","0.00","6.71","0.00","1.83","8.54","8.54","0.00","17.68","2.44","9.15","6.10","6.10","0.00","0.00","1.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.59","4.27","3.05","0.00","0.00","1.22","0.00","0.00","1.22","1.83","0.00","0.00","813","8.58","20.875","253","164","9","61.46","12.5","9.2","12.36","11.7","42","10.5","19.523902439024393","115","18.88","2","0.45","0","3","1","18","0","23","15","0","1","1","21","28","0","7","0","0","4","4","3","0","1","0","4","0","5","9","4","6","2","5","0","2","0","0"

“Make no mistake about it,we have to keep on fighting as hard as we can on immigration,” she told the crowd, “And as my husband has said, he’s going to do whatever administrative action it takes to fix this broken system.”

Michelle continued on to say, “We cannot afford to wait on Congress to lift up our next generation. We can’t afford to wait on anybody when it comes to our kids’ future.”

This wasn’t the end of her ridiculous speech.

“Latinos were being brutalized and killed by police and lynched by the KKK,” Michelle blurted out, “’No Mexicans Allowed’ signs hung outside of restaurants and storefronts. Latinos often couldn’t own property or serve on a jury. And if you walked into a public building, you’d often see not two water fountains, but three—one white, one black, and one brown.”

It appears the Obamas aren’t just willing to deny the present to meet their needs, they’re also willing to alter history. What do you think?

According to Chief Justice Roderick Ireland, in a report by The Boston Globe, “The fact that a school or other public entity operates a voluntary program or offers an activity that offends the religious beliefs of one or more individuals, and leaves them feeling ‘stigmatized’ or ‘excluded’ as a result, does not mean that the program or activity necessarily violates equal protect principles.”

Ireland continued on to discuss the case of parents ‘John and Jane Doe.’

“There is no evidence,” he wrote, “that the Doe children have ever been subjected to any type of punishment, bullying, or other mistreatment, criticism, condemnation, or ostracism as a result of not participating in the pledge or not reciting the words ‘under God.’”

Thankfully, it appears that the court system actually did what it could to support America. What do you think?

Hillary demands a whopping $2,777 per minute to speak publicly, and her contracts include demands that press be prohibited from the venue. Another limit? The number of photos she has to take with attendees.

As if that isn’t enough, Hillary wants the spotlight entirely to herself, and demands that she is the only one on stage during her speeches. And that is only if she shows up.

“That should happen as soon as possible,” Michelle said to the crowd, who met the statement with applause. “And I think this country is ready for anyone who can do the job. What we have learned is that the person who can do the job doesn’t have a particular race or gender or background or socioeconomic status. The person who should do the job is the person who is the most qualified, and I think we have some options, don’t we?”

The statement only leaves questions as to whether or not Hillary and Michelle are working together for the 2016 election.

A clip later shows a Kurdish man being beheaded in front of the Grand Mosque in Mosul, Iraq.

In pattern with the recording of the James Foley execution, the video cuts out during the actual beheading. It returns to show the severed head of the man resting on his body.

As extreme winter weather continues to move across much of the United States, we are reminded of those in power who have sought to control the world’s climate through various forms of weather modification…

Rain producing cloud seeding operations, along with drought-linked real weather modification programs and directed energy technology have been working in tandem, altering the world for sometime under the umbrella of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, better known as HAARP, a joint project funded by the U.S. Air Force, Navy and DARPA. At the core of the program’s development is said to be a “unique high frequency ionospheric heating capability.” In addition to that, there is the mention of ELF waves, Geophysical probing and other military applications.

Facilities like HAARP are said to exist worldwide.



IMAGE: An apparent image of a HAARP-like facility.

Directed energy is an exotic brand of weather manipulation linked to tectonic plate shifts, the triggering of volcanic eruptions, as well as being a potential “force multiplier” of tsunami’s and hurricanes throughout the world.

A United States patent established in December 1987 by Physicist Dr. Bernard J. Eastlund and Simon Ramos appears to outline an apparatus that can create an artificial magnetic field that is capable of producing large amounts of electromagnetic radiation, Similar to what the HAARP program has been alleged to do. Eastlund has a total of three patents linked to this kind of technology, with famed inventor and scientist Nikolai Tesla listed as a reference. The concept and design behind HAARP is almost identical to Tesla’s early designs – some of which were seized by the Pentagon upon his death in 1943.

The Atlantic Richfield Company or ARCO Oil and Gas Company was said to have approached Eastlund in the spring of 1984 about the possible sale of 23 trillion cubic feet in Alaska. His apparent suggestion was to use the land for a gas powered large phased electromagnetic generator, creating a missile defense system for the United States.

The global warming narrative began intensifying over the past two decades right around the time the HAARP facility became operational in Gakona, Alaska. More recently, this same narrative has under gone a surgical transformation in the wake of one of the coldest and most snow rich winter’s on record, now being referred to as ‘climate change.’



IMAGE: Strange cloud formations seen worldwide.

United States Secretary of State John Kerry was recently seen speaking to a group of students in Jakarta, Indonesia, banging the drums of other notable climate alarmist’s, claiming that climate change is “the world’s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.”

Kerry then made a reference to one of the largest typhoons on record that devastated the Philippines in November of 2013, a typhoon which researchers believed was microwave pulse induced storm that had been weaponized to pressure the Philippines into joining the Trans Pacific Partnership.

In an article by By professor Michel Chossudovsky, entitled, “Weather Warfare: Beware the US Military’s Experiments with Climatic Warfare,” with a sub heading titled, “Climatic warfare has been excluded from the agenda on climate change,” military weather control is further exposed:

“According to a report by the Russian State Duma: ‘The US plans to carry out large-scale experiments under the HAARP programme [and] create weapons capable of breaking radio communication lines and equipment installed on spaceships and rockets, provoke serious accidents in electricity networks and in oil and gas pipelines, and have a negative impact on the mental health of entire regions.’*

An analysis of statements emanating from the US Air Force points to the unthinkable: the covert manipulation of weather patterns, communications and electric power systems as a weapon of global warfare, enabling the US to disrupt and dominate entire regions. Weather manipulation is the pre-emptive weapon par excellence. It can be directed against enemy countries or ‘friendly nations’ without their knowledge, used to destabilise economies, ecosystems and agriculture. It can also trigger havoc in financial and commodity markets. The disruption in agriculture creates a greater dependency on food aid and imported grain staples from the US and other Western countries.”

Former Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen is perhaps the most well-known government official to publicly acknowledge that weaponized weather has been in use for sometime, when he stated in an April 1997 Department of Defense news briefing that: “Others are engaging even in an eco- type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.”

Evelyn De Rothschild was interviewed on Bloomberg discussing of some the most sophisticated weather forecasting via the Rothschild’s newly acquired Weather Central. In 2011 the Rothschild dynasty bought up an apparent 70% share in the company. Defense contractors Raytheon and Lockheed Martin create weather forecast modeling for the National Weather Service, NOAA and the FAA.

In 1991, The Global Environment Facility was founded just prior to the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and is said to be one of the largest funding organs of environmental projects worldwide, as well as being affiliated with a number of financial institutions and programs, including the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the African Development bank, to name a few. The Rothschild family and former under-secretary general of the United Nations Maurice Strong are said to have been instrumental in GEF’s growth through the creation of the World Conservation Bank.



BIZARRE: A table setting at the Rothschild surrealist ball from December 12th 1972. Eyes Wide Shut conservation, with what appears to be a mountain of caviar enshrined by votive candles and taxidermied turtles.

In October of 1987 at the 4th World Wilderness Congress in Denver, Colorado, Edmund De Rothschild delivered a speech in which he seemingly outlined a call for action, referencing fraudulent CO2 emission science to back up his claims, all the while setting up GEF’s primary objective, which has been said to use mineral rich areas around the world as security for IMF lent loans to poverty-stricken countries. Many believe that when these countries fail to payback the loan GEF will then collect any potential resources to repay the loan.

One only needs to look at how the spoils of Africa have been divided up over the years to see if there is any truth to this claim.

Recently Harvard University Professor Martin Weitzman was seen trying to sell the public on the latest version of climate hysteria, outlining the benefits of sunshade geo-engineering, however being careful not to mention the historical evidence of current and ongoing weather control.

In August of 1996, a military research paper was presented to the Air Force, entitled, “Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025.” The controversial paper outlined a series of strategic goals for air and space dominance, complete with a disclaimer absolving the Air Force of any involvement in the stated views expressed by those in the military who authored it. Similarly to the MindWar paper penned by former Major General Paul Vallely and Lt. Colonel Michael Aquino, Owning the Weather in 2025, appears to have been downplayed by those in esteemed positions of military and government. However, one cannot deny the chilling text contained in these documents:

“Today, weather-modification is the alteration of weather phenomena over a limited area for a limited period of time. Within the next three decades, the concept of weather-modification could expand to include the ability to shape weather patterns by influencing their determining factors.”

Continuing, the report stated the following:

“In the broadest sense, weather-modification can be divided into two major categories: suppression and intensification of weather patterns. In extreme cases, it might involve the creation of completely new weather patterns, attenuation or control of severe storms, or even alteration of global climate on a far-reaching and/or long-lasting scale.”

In the past year, California has been experiencing terrible droughts, yet we’ve had the capability to cloud seed since the Vietnam war era under Operation Popeye through the disbursement silver iodide and lead iodide. It has been said that chemical weather modification programs were sponsored by then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and CIA.

In the summer of 2013, the CIA partially funded a $630,000 study by the National Academy of Sciences, the program is stated to “look into several techniques for altering the environment.”

Here is a YouTube video depicting the Desert Research Institute’s exploration in weather modification cloud seeding programs, through the use of cloud seeding generators placed at high altitutdes. DRI admits this technology has been in place for decades…

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otW4Nj71xec

If the geoengineer’s claim to be using this technology for good, then why have they been unable to engineer rain producing clouds in drought laden areas throughout the world, as the future of fresh crops grow dim?



IMAGE: Weather Manipulation streaks across the sky.

Chemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto recently purchased the Climate Corporation, the Climate Corp. is said to be supported by Founders Fund, Khosla, Google Ventures,NEA, Index Ventures and Atomico. The company uses state of the art forecast modeling to predict the weather.

In 2010, the Abu Dhabi government had admitted to creating more than 50 rainstorms in Al Ain during the summer months.

Iran’s chief meteorologist Hassan Mousavi back in 2012 claimed that the West was launching a climate war against the southern region of Iran, deliberately causing a drought.

21st Century Wire says…

As manufactured FBI ‘terror plots’ go, this is one of the most ridiculous, and as it turns out, it may backfire badly on the federal agencies who are used to working above the law and in the shadows.

Clearly, 2010’s ‘Christmas Tree Bomber’, a troubled young and mentally ill student named, Mohamed Osman Mohamud (pictured below), wasn’t playing with a full deck, but he was being played – by both the FBI – and the NSA.



In what appears to be a clear case of entrapment of a possible mentally deranged 19 year old Somalia-born, American college student, this might be one of the first cases of it’s kind to successfully win an NSA challenge in the higher court.

The crux of the defendant’s appeal: the suppression of unlawfully or unconstitutionally obtained evidence, namely, secret wiretaps from the NSA.

If there aren’t any real terrorists, just make your own

With politicians so eager to justify their porous policies and bloated federal agency budgets, and media so desperate for fear stories – almost no one in national politics or media will ever admit the obvious: almost every major terror plot in the US since 9/11 has featured FBI involvement in the handling of the eventual ‘terrorists‘. They will even go so far as to supply actual bombs or materials involved that the agency would later submit as evidence. If it sounds dodgy, that’s because it is, but few have ever dared how and why US federal law enforcement has managed to sink to such depths.

The FBI employs some 15,000 undercover agents today, roughly ten fold what they had 30 years ago. When you read through all the mainstream media hype and political grandstanding, witnessed during the Boston Bombings, one fact stands out like a sore thumb – that chief suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev (deceased) was being handled by the FBI before the bombing and also was sent overseas under CIA cover. Someone(s) in government appears to have been building his profile for some reason. I think we now know why.

In 1995, the same situation rang true with Timothy McVeigh, who himself was handled by the FBI right up to the time of the bombing as part of the FBI’s mission to build up the profile of an extremist right-wing militia group at Elohim City. Again, McVeigh’s profile was being built up for some reason before the Oklahoma City bombings, but just like Tsarnaev, McVeigh was pinned with the crime – one of the FBI’s many ‘lone gunmen’ and more domestic terrorist for the history books.

Americans seem to have completely forgotten also, that the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing was a top to bottom FBI operation, but instead of swapping out the explosive material with harmless powder at the last minute, the FBI decided to let their ‘terrorist’ go ahead and set off a bomb with killed Americans.

Man convicted in terror case seeks evidence from warrantless spying

The Washington Post reports today…

.

Ellen Nakashima

Washington Post

An Oregon man convicted last year of attempted terrorism filed a motion Monday that paves the way for the first constitutional challenge by a criminal defendant to a warrantless surveillance program operated by the National Security Agency.

Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 22, was found guilty of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction after he was caught in an FBI sting operation trying to detonate what turned out to be a fake bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in 2010.

His attorneys have argued that he was entrapped — a bluster-filled college student who was conned — while the government has said he was a genuine jihadist who could have made contact with real terrorists.

Late Monday, Mohamud’s attorneys filed a 66-page motion in U.S. District Court in Portland, Ore., seeking discovery of information that they believe will aid in an eventual challenge to the constitutionality of the law that authorized the surveillance used in his case. At the very least, they say, Mohamud deserves a new trial because he was not informed that the government used the warrantless program in bringing its case the first time.

That “raises a wide range of serious issues regarding suppression of unlawfully or unconstitutionally obtained evidence, dismissal or other sanctions based on the government’s intentional violation of governing rules, and, at least, a new trial based on new evidence of governmental overreaching,” wrote Stephen R. Sady, one of the three lawyers defending Mohamud who filed the motion.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment Monday.

Mohamud was informed last year that the FBI used evidence obtained through the NSA’s use of intercepts under a provision of a 2008 law that permits eavesdropping without warrants on Americans’ international phone calls and e-mails as long as the surveillance is targeted at foreigners overseas.

That provision, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, has been challenged before, but the Supreme Court last year dismissed a lawsuit brought by a group of lawyers, journalists and human rights organizations on grounds that the plaintiffs could not prove they were caught up in the surveillance. The group believes the surveillance violates Americans’ constitutional privacy rights.

SPECIAL REPORT

Uncanny timing in Ottawa. Just as the book on Ebola is closed, suddenly, a new chapter on ISIS is open. Have intelligence agencies finally dragged Canada into their ‘War on Terror’?



This morning, the Canadian Parliament building located in the capitol of Ottawa, was reported to have been besieged by a Canadian citizen – a ‘lone wolf gunman’ named Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (pictured below).

According to FOX News, this is a shooter “with possible connections to ISIS” (Islamic State terrorist organization). Really?

BREAKING | This is a photo of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, gunman in this morning’s shootings in Ottawa. #cbcOTT #OTTnews pic.twitter.com/OLSxlYPelj — CBC Ottawa (@CBCOttawa) October 22, 2014







Rest assured, ‘John Kerry has been briefed’…

FOX News reported, “In Washington, the State Department said the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa is on lock-down, and Secretary of State John Kerry has been briefed. President Obama also has spoken with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.”

We’re told how the Canuck shooter was dressed in black, wearing “an Arab scarf” covering his face, before he fatally shot a security guard at a war memorial, before “storming” Canada’s Parliament building.

Shooter Zehaf-Bibeau was then shot and killed by a ceremonial Seargent-at-Arms.

Canadian police say the downtown Ottawa “safety perimeter” has now been lifted. Crisis over. Another radical Islamic terror event. Case closed, or so we’re told…

BREAKING VIDEO | Dash cam video appears to show gunman moments after shooting http://t.co/MltEFiZ5SJ #cbcOTT #OTTnews pic.twitter.com/yktVn6yr9B — CBC Ottawa (@CBCOttawa) October 23, 2014

Bizarrely, at least one hundred Canadian armed police wearing various outfits, and some wearing ski masks, could be seen all Wednesday during international news coverage, running in various directions, groups of 20 officers running 2×2 in single file, drawing and pointing weapons in various directions, etc. All very impressive for the cameras.



STAGED: The scene across the street include officers posing, pretending to aim their weapons, wearing ski masks for dramatic effect.

A number of armed officers outside the building could also be seen laughing and joking even as they drew their weapons. Others appeared to be posing for the news crew cameras. In one shot, two officers pointed their guns in unison up at the building across the street – then taking cover behind a police vehicle – while the officer behind them is casually leaning up against a wall. These scenes could be an indicator that the Ottawa shooting was staged and part of a major terror drill gone live – apparently.

To see police play-acting for cameras, go straight to the 11 minute mark of this video:

More laughing by Canadian police – was it a drill? Watch beginning at 1 min 50 sec mark…

As expected, US media are pushing hard to try and connect this bizarre shooting event toRight-wing news outlets like FOX and The Blaze are claiming that, “according to multiple reports” (we’re not sure which reports they mean as there are no links to these reports ) the shooter was a “recent convert to Islam”, according to multiple reports.

Other loose reports claim that security services had been watching Bibeau “for some time”, and feared he had “terrorist ambitions”.

As the shooter is not alive to tell his tale, you can expect the media will fill in the blanks with the usual litany of hyperbolic and cliched statements:

“A loner”

“A disturbed individual”

“Friends say he became more radicalized”

“Influenced by ISIS”

“His manifesto was posted on Facebook”

“Radical thoughts, posted on Twitter”

“Security services had previously flagged him as a person of interest” (but stood by and did nothing)

“He was taking SSRI medication for depression”

“Neighbors say he was a loner and kept to himself”

“Family, friends are shocked, but not surprised”

Shooter Zehaf-Bibeau has the perfect modus operandi for typical directionless loser turned informant – where government agencies like the FBI or intelligence services will take control of their mentally ill, repeat offender asset, hoping he can radicalize other male youths at his local mosque in order to create a new domestic terror cell that the agency can observe and report on. Amazingly, this Canadian shooter fits the bill perfectly.

Montreal reporter Domenic Fazioli (below) confirmed that Zehaf-Bibeau has already been arrested five times for drug possession and violating parole.

As far as informant patsies go, so far it’s reading like a fairytale story.

Pressured By Canadian Security Services

According to the Globe and Mail, Zehaf-Bibeau was already designated as a “high risk traveller” by the Canadian government’s security services – who had also seized his passport. Could this be the reason why the shooter had snapped? Was he being targeted or being pressured into becoming an informant – just like dozens of similar FBI-entrapment cases in the US (read about similar cases in detail, further below in this article)?

Read more about how the FBI and other government agencies recruit, train, and deploy their terror patsies to create the public perception that there are terrorists constantly running amok among the populace in North America and Europe (see the ‘Informant Game’ below).

FOX News has led the charge today, wasting no time tying the Canadian Shooter to ISIS.



FOX NEWS SPOKESMODEL: Overly flippant Guilfoyle takes on a nasty Neoconservative, warmongering veneer.

FOX’s latest addition to its news team, a Victoria Secrets lingerie model named Kimberly Guilfoyle, was flippant as usual, seeming to be over doing it in her attempt to nail the shooting as an Islamic terrorist attack, with her and her guest claiming that, “ISIS chatter spiked just before the shooting”.

Guilfoyle underlined her segment by concluding, “this is terrorist attack right across our border… in Canada!“. (Yes, it’s true, Canada really is located along the north US border)

Spokesmodel Guilfoyle was also quick to remind her viewers that personal sacrifices will be required in the War on Terror, and reminded viewers that they must focus on, “the bigger theme here, we have to be hyper-vigilant about terrorism”, and added that we all may have to sacrifice some privacy to maintain that security. She might as well be a spokesmodel for the NSA.

FOX goes on, dutifully filling in all the relevant terror blanks in the story they would like you to remember:

“A counter-terrorism source tells Fox News that there was a spike in Islamic State-related online chatter focusing on Canada in the days leading up to the shooting Wednesday in the capital of Ottawa.”

A counter-terrorism source tells Fox News? Of course, there is no way to validate that claim… because it’s a secret.



TERROR EXPERT: FOX’s Agent Gilliam blames political correctness for the Ottawa shooting.

One of the FOX ‘experts’, a former FBI officer, Jonathan Gilliam, went straight for the midterm election Obama jugular, creatively trying to tie the Canadian shooting with US immigration policies. “We’re making it very easy for them (Muslims) to come in, because we’re not screening them properly – and this is because of very ‘liberal immigration policies’.

Incredibly, Gilliam also blames the Canadian shooting on political correctness”, because politicians and activists don’t want to infringe on religious rights (of Muslims)”.

‘The Informant Game’

Of course, Agent Gilliam would also know that the majority (if not all) of the major ‘terror busts’ in the US since the first World Trade Center bombing – have all been cooked up through the FBI’s opaque entrapment/informant program. In other words, the FBI has profiled, targeted, recruited, trained and deployed countless “Muslim radicals” – all groomed by the agency to carry out contrived terror attacks in the US and beyond.

Human Rights Watch explains, “The 214-page report, “Illusion of Justice: Human Rights Abuses in US Terrorism Prosecutions,”examines 27 federal terrorism cases from initiation of the investigations to sentencing and post-conviction conditions of confinement. It documents the significant human cost of certain counter-terrorism practices, such as overly aggressive sting operations and unnecessarily restrictive conditions of confinement.”

The list of terror informants and puppet is as long as it is colurful, starting with the infamous ‘Underwear Bomber’, who was allowed to travel to the US without a passport and was accompanied by an intelligence agent on his flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.

Who can forget the FBI’s ill-fated 1993 World Trade Center bombing attempt, where FBI handlers trained the driver and gave them explosives – and worst of all – stood by and watched as their sting subjects went ahead and detonated their concoction underneath the world’s tallest building in New York City.

Other recent FBI terror stooge/informant nightmares include:

Tamerlan Tsarnaev (see his informant story here)

Buford Rogers (see his informant story here)

Jerad Miller (see his informant story here)

Naji Mansour (see his informant story here)

Quazi Mohammad Nafis (see his informant story here)

Mohamed Osman Mohamud (see his informant story here)

Timothy McVeigh (see his informant story here)

… plus many others, and along with their European counterparts like the curious case of mass shooter, Anders Breivik aka “Andrew Berwick” in Norway.

And it’s not just the FBI running these ‘terror cells’. New York City’s Police Department (NYPD) have also been caught doing their own version of this type of operation.

Another classic case of a young ‘convert to Islam’ who was being targeted, or pressured, by British government security services to become an informant – the case of the ‘Woolwich Slasher’, Michael Adebolajo. It was later revealed during a BBC interview with his childhood friend, Abu Nusaybah, that Adebolajo was in Kenya and was being recruited or ‘groomed’ in some way – by British intelligence service MI5, and was also arrested and tortured ‘anti-terror’ police in Nairobi.

Watch as the BBC carefully smooth over the allegations regarding MI5, as “perfectly normal procedure”…

Other ‘Recent Converts’ to Islam

This Canadian shooter – a ‘recent convert to Islam’ (that’s the story line), is very similar in profile to another ‘recent convert’ who made big headlines in the US last month, Alton Nolen (photo, left), 30 years old, who was “very angry” after losing his job and violently beheaded his co-worker at Vaughn Foods in Moore, Oklahoma.

Right-wing media outlets like FOX were insisting with non-stop coverage – that this was “ISIS in America”. FOX and other sensational news outlets quickly spun the story into an Islamic terror event, claiming it was “linked to ISIS in our Homeland”.

It’s important to note that Nolen was yet another mentally ill ex-con, and like this week’s L‘enfant terrible of terror, Canadian shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the Oklahoman had a perfect M.O.for any FBI or CIA handler worth his hummus.

The Ottawa shooting looks more like an informant who has snapped under pressure, and rather conveniently (for authorities anyway), did not live to testify.

A more likely explanation for the Ottawa Shooter and a number of other lone gunman events, is that these individuals had taken part in well-documented government-run psychiatric projects like MK ULTRA, which combine trauma and stress based techniques with pychiatric drugs to produce a type of mind control where a handler is able to ‘manage’ the subject.

Aside from coaxing the general public into more military intervention in Syria and Iraq, the end result of this crisis will be

It will be interesting to see if the media eventually retract their ISIS claims surrounding the Canadian shooter, or if the story fades away quickly.

21st Century Wire says…

Behind the White House’s political smokescreen in Ferguson and New York, US lawmakers were busy sliding through a pre-declaration of war against Russia.

The latest resolution by the US Congress, most likely drafted and presented to the speaker by Washington DC-based Neoconservative think tank, Foreign Policy Initiative (formerly Project for a New American Century), calls for renewed political, and military support for Fascist and NeoNazi-sympathizing regime in Kiev, Ukraine, which will include:

– US aid for Kiev regime to keep using its military against ethnic Russians in east Ukraine.

– US funding for more weapons and military support in the Ukraine.

– More US funding for foreign language, pro-US, and anti-Russian propaganda throughout eastern Europe and in countries bordering Russia.

In all but name, this US resolution is preliminary declaration of war, moving Washington right up to the final step, which is a formal declaration of war. Based on its recent record of engaging in foreign conflicts, it is unlikely a final declaration will come, as the US has already set numerous precedents already by waging Wiemar-style undeclared wars, or by simply bypassing its domestic checks-and-balances by waging any war through NATO.



NAZI & NATO MERGER: US-backed fascist and NeoNazi ‘volunteer battalion’ militants in Kiev are flying NATO banner next to their fascist flags.

It’s believed that the US-funded propaganda portion of the operation is already underway.

As Zero Hedge reported today, the Kiev government announced to formation of what it calls, “The Ministry of Information Policy”:

“The Ukraine government has established a department that critics are calling the ‘Ministry of Truth’ in a dystopian reference to George Orwell’s 1984 (apparent instruction manual). Run by (a close ally) of President Poroshenko’s close ally, while its main objective appears to be confronting Russia’s formidable propaganda machine, the Ministry is likely to also restrict free speech and inhibit journalists’ work – particularly in war-torn eastern Ukraine, according to observers.”

In addition to ‘on the books’ warfare, there would normally be additional budgetary provisions included in this latest initiative for funding and directing proxy war and terrorist guerrilla against Russia through non-state actors in the region – which has already been done by the US against Iran, as reported by New Yorker Magazine’s award-winning investigative reporter Seymour Hersh in 2008:

“President George W. Bush signed an intelligence finding in late 2007 that allocated up to $400 million for covert operations intended to destabilize Iran’s government, in part, by supporting militant organizations.”

Bush allocated the ‘start-up’ fund help ‘sponsor’ (pay-off) terrorist groups in and around Iran to help Washington in its effort to first destabilize and overthrow the ruling government in Tehran during his second term in the White House. A similar, clandestine operation is believed to already be underway in the Russian region of Chechnya, as weapons used in today’s terrorist attack there were found to have come from abroad.

As NATO expands eastward fulfilling the organizations plans for the encirclement of Russia, a number of high-profile opposition voices have pointed out the obvious – that this alone is an overt act of war. Former Congressman Dennis Kucinich warns about the House’s reckless adoption of the HR 758:

“NATO encirclement, the US-backed coup in Ukraine, an attempt to use an agreement with the European Union to bring NATO into Ukraine at the Russian border, a US nuclear first-strike policy, are all policies which attempt to substitute force for diplomacy,” (Truthdig).

According international watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW), the US-backed junta in Kiev has refused to investigate its army’s use of banned cluster bombs against ethnic Russian civilians in eastern Ukraine. It also has recommended that Kiev be subject to charges in the International Criminal Court, in order for a proper investigation into its war crimes to take place in public view.

The Project for a New America Century is still alive and well, and in terms of party politics it’s color blind, and its facilitators include both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, as well as Secretary John Kerry and Senator John McCain alike.

This is one of the final, formal steps towards a world war…

House of Representatives passes resolution against Russia

.

RT.com



The US House of Representatives has overwhelmingly approved a document which strongly condemns Moscow’s actions against its neighbors, calling them a policy of aggression.

Passed with 411-10 votes, the resolution slams Russia’s “continuing political, economic, and military aggression” against Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova and the “continuing violation of their sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity.”

“The US, Europe and our allies must aggressively keep the pressure on Mr. Putin to encourage him to change his behavior,” Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the resolution’s sponsor, said.

The resolution calls for Russia to stop supporting local militias in eastern Ukraine and for the cancellation of Crimea’s decision to join Russia. In addition, it calls on Moscow to withdraw its troops which the US claims are in Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova.

The House calls on President Barack Obama to provide Ukraine with defense equipment and training…

“Ukraine is clearly in need of urgent military assistance,” Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said as quoted by The Hill.

Previously Obama declined Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko’s plea for lethal military aid. During his visit to Washington in September, Poroshenko addressed Congress calling to provide Kiev with “more military equipment, lethal and non-lethal” drawing applause from the audience.

Thursday resolution also urges NATO members and US allies to suspend military cooperation with Russia. Addressing Obama, the House urged him to review the readiness of US and NATO armed forces under the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE).

The lawmakers agreed that the president and State Department should also find a way to “distribute news and information” in Russian to countries with Russian-speaking populations.

RT’s Gayane Chichakyan asked US State Department spokesperson Marie Harf whether this is a fight for more US influence in the region during Thursday’s daily press briefing.

Harf denied that US wants to fight for influence, saying that it plans to “fight for the people of Ukraine and indeed the entire region to get the truth about what’s happening on the ground” and to “talk about exactly what is happening in a much more truthful way.”…

21st Century Wire says…

What is the appropriate age for a child to become “gender aware”?

As transvestites get a 21st century medical upgrade to ‘transgender’, the storm of gender politics is becoming more and more visible in American life. By the same token, LGBT agents of change are targeting a much younger audience these days.

Previously, 21WIRE reported on the story in California where a state law was passed which allows K -12 students to ‘decide’ what gender they would like to be at any given time, giving them free access to either-sex school locker rooms, bathrooms and self-nominate which sports team they would like to play for – all enforced by the state courts.

Activist will say that this is only about Civil Rights, but it’s hard not to notice how politicized this issue is becoming, and how children are being pulled in between the gears of an adult political machine.

This week, the State of Maine got into the transgender act as well, passing a similar ‘transgender access’ law for students (see full report below) based on what was passed earlier in California. Is this is bona fide social trend, or is it merely part of the new extremist liberal social engineering agenda? The aggressive nature at which the gender agenda is targeting very children is a little disturbing, to say the least…



Barbie Online: Children are being nudged away from gender identity.

We’re told that it’s all about catering to the “unique problems of young transgender people in America”, only children do not manifest these kind of social agendas. Adults do.

Culture engineers have even designed a new flag for this new social compartment…



IMAGE: The new ‘Transgender Pride’ flag.

One should ask the obvious question here: what does a 10 yr old 5th grade student really know about ‘gender identity’? Is it down to their parents, or are aggressive gender politics simply the inevitable byproduct of an ultra-liberal social agenda which dominates America’s media and entertainment in the 21st century? Children are already heavily challenged by the fast pace of education, technology and media in their lives – without adding additional confusion by introducing sexual politics into their lives.

A cursory glance at who is promoting the ‘third gender’ agenda reveals some of the major player and corporations behind political trend:

“In the 2010s transgender people became increasingly prominent in entertainment. Chaz Bono became a highly visible transgender celebrity when he appeared on the 13th season of the US version of Dancing with the Stars in 2011, which was the first time an openly transgender man starred on a major network television show for something unrelated to being transgender. He also made Becoming Chaz, a documentary about his gender transition that premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. OWN (the Oprah Winfrey Network) acquired the rights to the documentary and debuted it on May 10, 2011.” (Wiki)

Adults can and will do whatever they like in a free society. Everyone accepts the endless machinations and fascinations of adults in their pursuit of happiness, but the overt sexual politicization of children is something else altogether. To the casual observer, this seemingly innocuous adult sexual and gender agenda appears to be focused only on promoting ‘alternative lifestyles’, but there exists a much more extremist circle within this broader international movement who are actively campaigning to lower the age of sexual consent – earmarking children as young as 12 as potential sexual targets. A minority of adults are literally dragging our children by the hair into this twisted hall of mirrors.

Political operatives see today’s youth as nothing more than tomorrow’s voting block, and corporate marketeers see them as future consumers for their new products – flags, T-shirts, fashion, film, music and media. This is just another example of ‘Divide and Rule’.

As with any major social engineering project, the target audience gets ever younger, and at its present rate, this ‘progressive’ gender agenda may succeed in dissolving the fundamental fabric of the family-oriented society in one generation.

New State Law Allows ‘Transgender’ Students to Use Any Bathroom or Changing Room



Washington Post

So holds today’s Maine Supreme Judicial Court decision in Doe v. Regional School Unit 26, as to a fifth-grade student who is biologically male but identifies and dresses as a girl. Maine law bans discrimination in places of public accommodation based on “sexual orientation,” which includes “gender identity or expression.”

The court held that this means that transgender people were entitled to use the restrooms appropriate to their gender identity, rather than their biological sex.

Maine law requires schools to provide restrooms “[s]eparated according to sex and accessible only by separate entrances and exits.” The court, though, concluded that this doesn’t affect the analysis under the public accommodations statute:

Because [the school bathroom statute] does not mandate, or even suggest, the manner in which transgender students should be permitted to use sex-separated facilities, each school is left with the responsibility of creating its own policies concerning how these public accommodations are to be used. Those policies must comply with the [antidiscrimination law]…. [W]e do not suggest that any person could demand access to any school facility or program based solely on a self-declaration of gender identity or confusion without the plans developed in cooperation with the school and the accepted and respected diagnosis that are present in this case. Our opinion must not be read to require schools to permit students casual access to any bathroom of their choice. Decisions about how to address students’ legitimate gender identity issues are not to be taken lightly. Where, as here, it has been clearly established that a student’s psychological well-being and educational success depend upon being permitted to use the communal bathroom consistent with her gender identity, denying access to the appropriate bathroom constitutes sexual orientation discrimination in violation of the [public accommodations law].

Justice Mead’s dissent disagreed, reasoning that,

The statutory directive to segregate bathrooms in schools by sex, and providing for separate entrances and exits for those bathrooms, clearly anticipates that the use of a bathroom would be restricted to the sex for which it has been designated…. The plain language of the provisions of [the school bathroom statute] and the [antidiscrimination statute] are in conflict, and I believe that principles of comity require us to defer to the representative branch of government to resolve the issue.

Chief Justice Saufley’s concurrence agreed with the majority, but noted an important point that the dissent also mentioned:

[T]he Court has concluded, as it must based on the statutes, that discrimination in the public accommodation of communal bathrooms is prohibited based on sexual orientation. The statute requiring that result also prohibits discrimination based simply on “sex.” Thus, the next logical step given the Court’s inevitable interpretation of the existing statute is, as the dissent points out, the assertion that access to the public accommodation of designated communal bathrooms cannot be denied based on a person’s sex.

Put simply, it could now be argued that it would be illegal discrimination for a restaurant, for example, to prohibit a man from using the women’s communal bathroom, and vice versa. I agree with the dissent that it is highly unlikely that the Legislature actually intended that result. Accordingly, on this matter of public policy, it would benefit the public for the Legislature to act quickly to address the concern raised by the dissent in this matter…

Andrew McKillop

21st Century Wire

Much has been made of Vladimir Putin’s geopolitical strategic prowess in recent weeks, with Obama being accused of playing dominos to Putin’s ‘triple chess’.

Most pundits agree that Putin has gotten the better of his European and Washington counterparts so far, which has lit a fire under one former Russian chess legend turned political activist, one irate Garry Kasparov, who believes he has the secret to toppling the Kremlin’s Grand Master...

Something Borrowed, Something Blue

IBM websites remind us the corporation’s pride and joy, Deep Blue, a supercomputer which played a fascinating and winning series of matches with then-reigning World Chess Champion, Kasparov in 1997. Kasparov lost.



KASPAROV: ‘The computer must have caught me on a bad day, or it must have cheated’.

After a previous series of chess games starting in Feb 1996, which Kasparov won, his luck wore thin and by 1997 he was regularly beaten by the Big Blue machine of IBM. Very predictably, Kasparov accused IBM of cheating. How does a computer “cheat”?

After his humbling string of defeats, Kasparov turned to couched potato punditry of the political sort, running street protests in Moscow but also without much luck. Trying his hand again, he is now advising what he calls “the west” on how to beat Putin. Here again, his luck doesn’t look too good because his one-liners only tell us nothing new.

Paid by outlets such as Rupert Murdoch’s new toy, the Wall Street Journal, political pundit Kasparov tells us that the west should, “Sanction the 140 oligarchs who would dump Mr. Putin in the trash tomorrow if he cannot protect their assets abroad. Target their visas, their mansions and IPOs in London, their yachts and Swiss bank accounts. Use banks, not tanks”.

Great stuff which “the west” could (or should) also do to its own 140 criminal bankers and dodgy brokers, and their army of bent traders, tax dodgers and parasites, but because they own the finance system, the same way that Russia’s oligarchs do, the likelihood of that is low. Your move, Mr Kasparov.

Kasparov, writing in the WSJ, tried a flanking move to confuse or amuse us all. He claimed to know that Putin will run a divide-and-rule strategy on the world’s finance markets, pitting Europe against the US. He wrote that “Wall Street’s loss (will be) London’s gain, and Mr. Putin’s divide-and-conquer tactics will work again”.

This is pure nonsense. If that is how Kasparov plays chess, then it’s really no surprise that Deep Blue beat him. His ignorance of how world financial markets operate, and who operates them, is stunning.

He ignores the basic fact that Wall Street and London rise in lockstep, with Tokyo and other places like Frankfurt, and they will all fall together, also. This is the seamless grid of stock exchange operators, since 2009 dedicated to a “permanent bull” market – who cares about “fundamentals” – but Kasparov airily claims that Wall Street can fall while London gains. Somehow he got it 100% wrong.

What’s more frightening is how Kasparov wants so badly to get into politics.

No Market Panic – Except When We Want It

Those very same Western financial market operators are now giving us a vintage show of mock-panic. The bankers, brokers and traders who own and operate the markets have lots of fancy explanations for their sudden urge to sell, but their real intention is to nudge Western politicians further and faster down the road to war. This is bankers’ mass psychology. War is good for stock exchanges because after the ritual slaying of fake value, there can be the ritual “buy on the dip”, afterwards. It is a tried and tested formula, operated for far more than a hundred years.

Kasparov doesn’t tell us (or simply doesn’t know) that “the markets”, including Moscow’s stock exchange, generate and feed off panic on a daily basis. The important point is that since 2009 the panic is obligatorily euphoric, aimed at driving stock prices, commodity prices – anything at all, including Mr Putin’s own oil and gas revenues… to the Moon. When the euphoria-panic turns tail and descends into sell-everything-and-scoot the panic is black, like Kasparov’s chess pieces. The events are totally symmetrical. Ask Janet Yellen, or Mario Draghi.



KASPAROV AND PUTIN: Political rivals, sort of – but Kasparov is firmly in the globalist camp, relying on western support to maintain his platform.

How Mr Putin could divide-and-rule all that is very hard to imagine, but he could buy a few stock options, no?

By the end of a “hectic week’s trading”, March 14, the programmed constant ramp upward of the world’s stock exchange darlings – equity prices and oil prices – was doing very badly, in fact threatened with Mass Extinction. The Ukraine-Crimea threat was being “priced in”. Panic business as usual. The market operators want war, or something close to it.

Garry Kasparov was paid to fill several columns, so he wheeled out Google search one-liners in his own show of mock-panic. He said that the “post-1945 world of territorial integrity” is threatened with desecration by Vladimir Putin, believing that somehow the Ukraine is the red line in the sand.

Whether South Sudan secedes (by referendum) from North Sudan, or the Czech Republic separates from Slovakia, or Kosovo was surgically carved out of Serbia (by NATO military strikes), or East Germany – and even the Ukraine itself which seceded from the collapsed USSR in 1991 (is Kasparov’s memory that short?), relatively peacefully but without referendums, or if Sikkim was annexed by an Indian military force like Tibet was annexed by China, or if North and South Vietnam were reunited following a colonial war of over 20 years, or if Kurdistan secedes from rump Iraq, or perhaps if Scotland secedes from the Union with England in 2014 by referendum vote – none of this in any way at all threatens the Universe of post-1945 ‘Territorial Integrity’. Yet, Kasparov says so!

Pull the other leg, Mister Kasparov – or go back to Deep Blue.



OBAMA: Prefers putting.

Kasparov’s think-pieces in western government-friendly media tell us that only 500 kilometres south of Crimea, across the the Black Sea, Russian soldiers still occupy parts of Georgia—South Ossetia and Abkhazia—where they have been since Mr. Putin’s 2008 invasion and de facto annexation. How many market-playing traders take any notice of that? Do they key that into their iPhone of a Monday morning before they pile into equities, talk up oil a little or a lot, play the JPY/USD carry trade story, or any other “ultra-transparent” finance market circus act?

You have to be kidding, Mr Kasparov.

Saddam and Slobodan

Western interest in Georgia’s territorial integrity almost instantly fell to absolute zero, but Kasparov doesn’t want to know that. Instead, he brazenly announces, in his WSJ piece, that Vladimir Putin is now the living and breathing embodiment of Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic. No less than that!

He writes: “Mr. Putin belongs to an exclusive club, along with Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Miloševic, as one of the very few leaders to invade a neighboring nation in the nuclear age”.

Kasparov forgot about George W. Bush and Iraq, 2003 following George W. Bush and Afghanistan, 2001. Kosovo and Libya for example? Forget it. Apparently none of these military invasions “ever existed”, but Kasparov could wiggle around that one by saying the invaded countries weren’t exactly neighbors of the US.

Kasparov forgets plenty. He should remind himself, and us, that Russia is a UN Security Council Declared Nuclear Power. One of the Big 5 nuclear weapons-owning powers. Russia can hit back very hard, Mr Kasparov. Not at all like Hussein’s Iraq or Milosevic’s Serbia or whoever was running Afghanistan in 2001 when the Americans invaded. Russia’s nuclear weapons status means that when or if NATO was stupid or arrogant enough (and we hope neither) to try a bombing party or turkey shoot in Russia, the party will “go nuclear” very fast.

NATO would be simply mad to send troops anywhere near Russian Crimea, but the Western politicians who seem to like Kasparov, and he seems to like them, are edging towards an endgame like that. This will be literally losing all your pawns – your fighting assets – in a nuclear chess game! NATO knows very well that “modern war” is only against weak unprepared nations which can’t hit back. That folks, is New World Order “heroism”. Such is Western Manifest Destiny, these days. Shoot up the ‘Towelheads’ (as the US military like to refer to them) and hope they might have some oil and mineral assets, to pillage later on.

Interestingly, Kasparov, to fill column space and deliver his paid-for rant, tells us that “expansionist aggression” has been out of fashion since the time of Adolf Hitler, adding that Hitler failed but Joseph Stalin succeeded – because he could bully “a wheelchair US president close to death, Franklin Roosevelt, and a powerless and ruined Winston Churchill”. How then could their liberal democracies with free-flowing markets vote such stick insects to power? Kasparov is not interested in subjects like that. He tells us in a semi-confidential way that Evil Stalin was able to annexe Poland by promising elections that he knew would be won by the communist government already in place. Voted into power, you mean, Mr Kasparov?

Replace Motherland with Homeland

Kasparov is of course (of course) gung-ho for the Kiev Euro-Maidan flash mob, and its so-called “democratic government” infected with neo-Nazi hard rightists, which was certainly not elected. He actually calls it a moral victory for the West but nowhere in his writings does he refer to the Russian Orthodox Church, which as in several post-Soviet countries, notably Poland, has a powerful political role in society. Kasparov says “the 140 oligarchs” will turn on a dice and dump Putin when the stock exchange casino’s roulette wheels turn the wrong way – tilted that way by Mr Obama, Mrs Merkel and suchlike – but the Russian Orthodox Church sees Putin as a savior.

Possibly a truant who later in life turned away from Evil, but a savior all the same. Orthodox Church web sites in English, and with no doubt more vehemently in Russian, hammer out the message that Putin is the thin red line in the sand. Putin defends the West – meaning Russia – against the barbarous degeneracy of the USA and Europe, and against the barbarous savagery of the Islamic world. Putin’s popularity ratings inside Russia (of course the polls are doctored) say he is approved by about 72% of the public – which Kasparov can compare with the scores of Obama, Hollande or Cameron.

For Kasparov, Putin’s talk about the Russian Motherland rings of the ‘Nazi era’. He says it is exactly the same as Adolf Hitler. And what about Barack O’Drone’s JSOC and the bulging Homeland Security domestic army, and the NSA who read your mails before you even send them? The crucial difference is that Adolf Hitler did not possess nuclear weapons – although he tried, in an unwilling and unbelieving way, to have the 1933 Nobel physics prizewinner Werner Karl Heisenberg develop an atom bomb for Nazi Germany. If you are going to talk ‘theoretical Hitler’ chess master, then you have to go all the way…

If Nazi Germany had developed the bomb, using Heisenberg’s heavy water and depleted uranium reactor route, before the USA, the Second World War would have been mightily different… of that you can be very, very sure, Mr Kasparov.

Kasparov can understand that even if he is too stupid to beat an IBM computer, Putin is not in charge of an essentially under-armed and under-protected country like Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in 1991 and in 2003. Equip a country such as Hussein’s Iraq with nuclear weapons – and watch the Dogs of War stop their barking and blethering, as they crawl back into their kennels to eat offal.

Without the nuclear weapons, the Dogs of War from the west can triumphantly sweep in to desecrate, destroy and pillage any place on earth – in an orgy of violence. ‘Freedom and Liberty’ is like that, in Newspeak anyway.

According to Boris Kasparov, Mr. Putin’s divide-and-conquer tactics are working again. He sternly adds, finishing up his paid diatribe in the WSJ, that “If Mr. Putin succeeds—and if there is no united Western response, he will have succeeded regardless of whether or not Russian troops stay in Crimea”.

This allows him to make the Biblical prediction that “The world, or at least the world order as we know it will have ended”.

Yes. The sooner the better.

21st Century Wire says…

Not a day goes by now that we do not hear the following words coming out of White House or NATO’s head office: “The Russian threat”.

What is clever turn of words, seeing that the only entities moving eastward right now are the US and its world police force, NATO.

The whole idea of the ‘Russian threat’ was devised during the last century by propaganda merchants in the United States and incredibly, survives to this day, and is still effective on a section of society: the truly stupid and intellectually challenged, which (unfortunately for the rest of the world) includes many career politicians in sensitive decision-making positions…



OBAMA’S TURN: The idiocy of western Cold War propaganda is back again.

Nato’s action plan in Ukraine is right out of Dr Strangelove



From China to Ukraine, the US is pursuing its longstanding ambition to dominate the Eurasian landmass.



John Pilger

The Guardian



I watched Dr Strangelove the other day. I have seen it perhaps a dozen times; it makes sense of senseless news.

When Major TJ “King” Kong goes “toe to toe with the Rooskies” and flies his rogue B52 nuclear bomber to a target in Russia, it’s left to General “Buck” Turgidson to reassure the president. Strike first, says the general, and “you got no more than 10-20 million killed, tops”. President Merkin Muffley: “I will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since Adolf Hitler.” General Turgidson: “Perhaps it might be better, Mr President, if you were more concerned with the American people than with your image in the history books.”

The genius of Stanley Kubrick’s film is that it accurately represents the cold war’s lunacy and dangers. Most of the characters are based on real people and real maniacs. There is no equivalent to Strangelove today because popular culture is directed almost entirely at our interior lives, as if identity is the moral zeitgeist and true satire is redundant, yet the dangers are the same. The nuclear clock has remained at five minutes to midnight; the same false flags are hoisted above the same targets by the same “invisible government”, as Edward Bernays, the inventor of public relations, described modern propaganda.

In 1964, the year Dr Strangelove was made, “the missile gap” was the false flag. To build more and bigger nuclear weapons and pursue an undeclared policy of domination, President John F Kennedy approved the CIA’s propaganda that the Soviet Union was well ahead of the US in the production of intercontinental ballistic missiles. This filled front pages as the “Russian threat”. In fact, the Americans were so far ahead in production of the missiles, the Russians never approached them. The cold war was based largely on this lie.

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US has ringed Russia with military bases, nuclear warplanes and missiles as part of its Nato enlargement project. Reneging on the Reagan administration’s promise to the Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 that Nato would not expand “one inch to the east”, Nato has all but taken over eastern Europe. In the former Soviet Caucasus, Nato’s military build-up is the most extensive since the second world war.

In February, the US mounted one of its proxy “colour” coups against the elected government of Ukraine; the shock troops were fascists. For the first time since 1945, a pro-Nazi, openly antisemitic party controls key areas of state power in a European capital. No western European leader has condemned this revival of fascism on the border of Russia. Some 30 million Russians died in the invasion of their country by Hitler’s Nazis, who were supported by the infamous Ukrainian Insurgent Army (the UPA) which was responsible for numerous Jewish and Polish massacres. The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, of which the UPA was the military wing, inspires today’s Svoboda party.

Since Washington’s putsch in Kiev – and Moscow’s inevitable response in Russian Crimea to protect its Black Sea fleet – the provocation and isolation of Russia have been inverted in the news to the “Russian threat”. This is fossilised propaganda. The US air force general who runs Nato forces in Europe – General Philip Breedlove, no less – claimed more than two weeks ago to have pictures showing 40,000 Russian troops “massing” on the border with Ukraine. So did Colin Powell claim to have pictures proving there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

What is certain is that Barack Obama’s rapacious, reckless coup in Ukraine has ignited a civil war and Vladimir Putin is being lured into a trap…

"http://21stcenturywire.com/2014/05/07/whats-up-with-the-george-soros-pot-revolution/","George Soros and the GMO Cannabis Revolution","By

21st Century Wire says…

Is there a globalist agenda behind the legalisation of pot?

George Soros and his Open Society Institute has pushed hard, dumping substantial sums of money into a public campaign to legalise marijuana in Uruguay. Why? The Washington Times confirmed the extent of their public relations investment into this issue:

“Through a network of nonprofit groups, Mr. Soros has spent at least $80 million on the legalization effort since 1994, when he diverted a portion of his foundation’s funds to organizations exploring alternative drug policies, according to tax filings”.

In 2013, the Marijuana Policy Project listed its “Top 50 Most Influential Marijuana Users”, which they claim is “meant to identify people who have used marijuana and achieved high levels of success or influence”. George Soros is ranked 9th, alongside Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher (one can only guess which other ‘users’ lists this crowd also falls under). Not to mention, it’s always comforting to know that your President might be stoned at the wheel of the nation (by contrast, the golf doesn’t seem so bad).

In the US, the much-celebrated Colorado story has dominated pot news, and there are a number of other states set to follow.

“It’s only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized under federal law,” Tom Angell, founder and chairman of the Marijuana Majority advocacy group, told the Times. “We now have 20 states plus the District of Columbia considering legalization efforts, two states have already legalized it for all adults over the age of 21 — politicians will have to follow the will of the people on this.”

Aside from the Soros agenda for a One World Government, financing the Occupy Movement and of overthrowing governments, destablising nations and fomenting civil wars around the globe through carefully planned ‘color revolutions’, how does the Open Society Institute’s push for legalisation of drugs fit into all of this?

Critics are wondering if it could have something to do with influencing the governments in those countries where the legalisation efforts are most intense. Is this connected to the UN’s Agenda 21? Or is this paving the way for gene giants in big pharma to replace natural strands of cannabis with their own patented GMO variety? Definitely the ladder…

the Uruguayan government hopes legalising the sale of marijuana “will tackle drug cartels”, but what they’re not telling you is that they are paving the way for a bigger drug cartel to take over. Soros is reportedly also a big Monsanto shareholder, and guess who is test planting their GMO version of cannabis later this year in Uruguay? Yes, it’s Monsanto.

BTW – Monsanto’s best lobbyist right now is Barack Obama himself (it’s not about cool, or pot – it’s about eugenics).

Let’s look at what’s happening in Latin America…

Uruguay: The World’s First Legalized Weed Nation

Brasscheck TV

Late last year Uruguay became the first country in modern times to legalize cannabis.

I feel the same way about cannabis prohibition as I did about the Berlin War the first time I saw it (when it was still up). It makes no sense at all. Cannabis is a plant. How can a plant be illegal?

It’s a nutritious food (the seeds), a sturdy fiber (the stalk), and a multi-facted medicine (the leaves and flowers).

One country has gotten the clue: Uruguay.

The general law has been passed. Let’s see how they execute on the details.

By the way, poor people all over the world in Africa, Asia and Latin America have been using cannabis for medicine continuously throughout the multi-decade prohibition…

21st Century Wire says…

After being caught out coordinating a neoconservative think tank-sponsored political stunt, ex-RT presenter Liz Wahl has been doing the rounds again this week…



DAMAGED GOODS: Wahl’s on-air FPI kamikaze mission makes future employment with broadcast news very tricky.

Wahl talks about the ‘truth’ but seems to be a little too loose with it.

Her recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter was scheduled as a result of Max Blumenthal and Truth Dig’s damning expose of her not-so-spontaneous and much celebrated on-air resignation from RT America. She’s now dutifully performing what is known in PR circles as ‘rear-guard action’.

Due to the negative exposure and revelations of her stage-managed exit and teaming-up in advance of her resignation with pro-war neocon think thank Foreign Policy Initiative (FPI) and its ‘senior fellow’ James “Jamie” Kirchick, this week Wahl has been forced to do a little overtime for FPI in order to sweep-up Kirchick’s mess. Here Wahl does what any loyal corporate journalist or politician does as standard – attempting to re-write history:

“I knew that I had to quit in the wake of what was going on and was thinking about it for a couple of months, but it took a while to gain the courage. I was going to quit quietly, however on this day I was particularly appalled and disgusted by the coverage of the Ukraine, especially when one of my interviews was censored,” says Wahl, who joined RT in 2011 after working overseas as a reporter on the island of Saipen.

“All these things pushed me over the edge and I thought, ‘I can’t do this quietly. I needed to do it publicly and let the viewers know exactly what the station is about.’

“I went to the bathroom and scribbled some thoughts on a piece of paper and decided that this was the course of action to take. And then it went down on air,” she reveals.



Unfortunately for Wahl, Truth Dig’s investigation tells an entirely different story:

“Kirchick acknowledged having been in contact with Wahl since August, but cast himself as a passive bystander to the spectacle, claiming that they merely “stayed in touch periodically over the past 6 months, and I always encouraged her to follow her conscience in making a decision about her professional future.”

Kirchick wrote that by quitting, Wahl paid “the price real reporters—not Russian-government funded propagandists—have to pay if they are concerned with quaint notions like objectivity and the truth.”

Later that evening, Kirchick tweeted a photo of himself with Wahl (see below), calling it a “Freedom selfie.” The two had apparently gathered to celebrate…”



SELFIE! Liz Wahl celebrates with her co-conspirator Jamie Kirchick.

Wahl’s PR backtracking also refutes her own admission that she ‘wanted the attention’. Here she admits, “I have faith that it will work out. I wanted to get attention and I did want to make a splash — but I never thought it would make so many waves”. Clearly, Wahl is not the brightest spark in the hardware shop, as evidenced by her somewhat inaudible ‘Clueless’-style interview with FOX News presenter Neil Cavuto:

Later in that Hollywood Reporter piece, Wahl continues to pile it on, now trying to extract sympathy from public, claiming that she is in imminent danger as a result of her PR stunt: “I haven’t felt like my life has been in imminent danger and I haven’t had any death threats, but there’s been some pretty terrible things out there in the depths of Twitter and on blogs. I just try not to read them and I feel pretty safe where I am in Washington D.C.”

In the depths of Twitter… Yes, very scary indeed.

In the Cavuto piece Wahl claims to be concerned with a new “Cold War”, yet her efforts have only fanned the flames of stereotypical Russian fear in America, and now we know that this was not by accident.

What’s becoming more and more apparent throughout this story, is that Liz Wahl will allow herself to be used by just about anyone. She worked for 2 and a half years with RT America, allegedly she tells us against her own ‘principles’ – and did so for money. Then, sensing she was going to get the sack from RT, she allowed herself to be used by Kirchick and FPI, which in this case, was used to help promote tension between the US and Russia. As far as journalism and hard news goes, she’s already damaged goods.

It will be amusing to see – now that she has given herself away to a very nasty clique of neoconservative operators in Washington, where Wahl will end up next?

At this stage, it looks like a toss-up between E! Entertainment, The View, or have another go on the FOX News casting couch…

Shawn Helton

21st Century Wire

The United States Department of Homeland Security has begun looking into the seizure of hidden assets owned by blacklisted Russians that have become the subject of Ukrainian sanctions ordered by the West.

This is the latest attempt by those in Washington DC to put a hangman’s knot around Russia under the guise of humanitarian intervention and this time they’ve employed one of their favorite pet-agencies, namely the DHS. Homeland Security is operating in unison with the United States Treasury Department to aid in financially-induced, western-guided color revolution that erupted into chaos this past winter, an event that has framed Russian leadership as the perpetrators of violent activity within the country, giving the West the impetus to impose harsh sanctions.

Frozen assets and failed policy

The items that have been sought by the US government agency include ‘shiny toy’ seizures of helicopters, large homes, mega-yachts, high-priced artifacts, planes – as well as accessing bank accounts and investments.

According to a report this week by Bloomberg.com, “The U.S. government has blacklisted 19 companies and 45 political and business leaders, including four it designated as members of Putin’s inner circle.”

Assets are said to be frozen by the US Treasury, as agents from the Homeland Security’s Foreign Corruption Investigations Group are working in tandem with other US intelligence analysts to determine who may or may not be taking a pro-Russian stance on the situation in Ukraine.

The problem here is that it was already revealed back in late February in an article appearing on 21st Century Wire, by geopolitical researcher and author F. William Engdahl, that the West had already begun pressurizing Ukraine, helping to oust the Ukrainian President, Viktor Yanukovich for reportedly rejecting a $15 billion deal in debt relief offered by the EU, which was then subsequently followed by the deployment of a NATO Gladio-style organization stirring up violence in the region:

“According to these sources, UNA-UNSO have been involved (confirmed officially) in the Lithuanian events in the Winter of 1991, the Soviet Coup d’etat in Summer 1991, the war for the Pridnister Republic 1992, the anti-Moscow Abkhazia War 1993, the Chechen War, the US-organized Kosovo Campaign Against the Serbs, and the August 8 2008 war in Georgia. According to these reports, UNA-UNSO para-military have been involved in every NATO dirty war in the post-cold war period, always fighting on behalf of NATO. “These people are the dangerous mercenaries used all over the world to fight NATO’s dirty war, and to frame Russia because this group pretends to be Russian special forces.”

This current stranglehold to seize assets by the West seems to be a political balloon that lacks any legitimacy or credibility, especially when it appears that Washington DC itself has played the central role in the revolt and collapse of the elected Yanukovich government in Kiev. The DHS seizures appears to reveal the growing encroachment made by Western policy designers, which reflects a very heavy-handed approach designed to support its ‘neocontainment’ policy regarding Russia. Remember, there were also reports back in March about the transfer of 33 tons of gold out of Ukraine taken into US custody – an event which was blacked-out by US media outlets.



While we’re on the topic of credibility in the West, this week it was also revealed that Hunter Biden, son of US vice President Joe Biden, was named as being on the board of directors at Burisma Holdings, a company that owns several Ukrainian oil and gas companies, such as Esko Pivnich and Pari. Here is how Hunter describes his new position on Burisma’s own website, as reported by Moscow Times:

“I believe that my assistance in consulting the company on matters of transparency, corporate governance and government responsibility, international expansion and other priorities will contribute to the economy and benefit the people of Ukraine.”

This story comes right on the heels of the growing scandals that have plagued the Obama administration in recent years such as the Bengahzi cover-up and IRS emails that targeted conservatives. In addition to this, media distortion has been at an all-time high lately, as propaganda regarding terror outfit Boko Haram appears to be ‘Konyesque’ in scope, with all its #hashtag Hollywood veneer, linked to US intelligence agencies, as well as having sourced funding by Al Muntada Trust out of London.

Perhaps the most disturbing example of Western policy failure is in its attempt to exude control over Ukraine by force, were the horrific reports coming out that – people had been burned alive in Odessa and the deployment of some 400 para military mercenaries were sent to exacerbate an already volatile situation created by the West’s proxy war with Russia.

The Western Proxy: Magnitsky, Khodorkovsky

In 2008, Sergi Magnitsky, a lawyer and auditor for Hermitage Capital Management Fund, was being investigated for his part in an apparent tax-evasion scam. While being held in a pre-trial detention center in Moscow, he reportedly died from heart failure in 2009. There were widespread reports of beatings and abuse suffered by Magnitsky prior to his demise but according to Russian officials the cause of death was not from a violent attack as suggested by Hermitage’s head and founder, William Browder. It turns out that Browder had been convicted for his role in the same tax fraud scheme and sentenced to nine years. Browder left Russia in 2006 after authorities put pressure on him about his criminal activity. Much of the investigation into Magnitsky’s death was influenced by Hermitage’s own documents – which were later proven false by police.

With the help of US government NGOs, Browder is believed to have crafted a media campaign about Magnitsky’s abuse, helping to facilitate an NGO response via the State Department to eventually bring tighter sanctions against Russia and its leaders, significantly aided by a bipartisan bill in 2012 passed by the Senate called The Magnitsky Act.

Many believe this Senate Act, as well as other Western guided operations, were the catalyst for the tension we see in Russia today.

The US State Department funded NGO Freedom House, operating under the guise of a ‘human rights’ think tank, one that boasts of democracy designers such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Donald Rumsfeld as former members, both well-known insider policy ‘change agents’ linked to much of the destabilization we’ve seen throughout the Middle East since the late 70’s. Freedom House then decided to get in on the propaganda campaign seemingly exploiting Magnitsky’s death.

Global researcher and author, Tony Cartalucci, offered his thoughts on the subject in an article entitled, Wall Street vs. Russia:

“Another Freedom House statement, provided on their own website, again calls for the “Sergei Magnitsky Act” are made to leverage their false claims of human rights abuses to sanction and begin bringing down Russia’s leadership. The statement is signed off not by noted humanitarians, but by notorious Neo-Cons Eric Edelman, Jamie Fly, Robert Kagan, Kramer himself, and Stephen Rademaker, a corporate lobbyist at the notorious Podesta Group and a “foreign policy adviser” for Mitt Romney.”



Controlling Russian oil

There has been other evidence of US meddling in Russia. Former oil baron of the Yukos Oil Company in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, reportedly was used by the West to create infrastructural problems within Russia through the Carlyle Group. He even started a Russian foundation echoing George Soros’s group the Open Society, called the Open Russia Foundation, listing Henry Kissinger and Jacob Rothschild on its board. He was later caught trying to buy an election using his wealth to challenge Putin to become President. It was also said that behind the scenes he was looking to change the oil business in Russia, specifically parties that could own oil in Russia. The West crafted a different version of events following his arrest to garner public support against those in power within Russia.

This is how the West exudes its power over other countries by selling distortions to promote its failing policies. This is reflected in the sweeping executive order Obama recently signed regarding Ukrainian sanctions.

U.S. Agents Start Hunting for Sanctioned Russians’ ‘Shiny Toys’



Prashant Gopal

Bloomberg



The Department of Homeland Security has begun a search for planes, yachts, mansions and other U.S. belongings of Russians facing Ukraine-related sanctions.

Agents are looking for “shiny toys” that wealthy Russians on the sanctions list likely have hidden behind layers of shell companies, as well as their bank accounts and investments, said John Tobon, who heads the agency’s financial investigations division in Miami. The U.S. government has blacklisted 19 companies and 45 political and business leaders, including four it designated as members of Putin’s inner circle.

Any assets traced to blacklisted Russians will be frozen by the Treasury Department, which enforces sanctions, Tobon said. Agents from Homeland Security’s Foreign Corruption Investigations Group, including forensic accountants and intelligence analysts, are working on the case, along with other branches of the federal government, he said.

“This is the equivalent of the U.S. Treasury throwing up a bat signal — it’s all hands on deck and here is your mission,” Tobon said. “The challenge comes to trying to find an asset that somebody is deliberately trying to hide.”

Freezing the assets could “translate quickly into political pressure” on Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Neil Shearing, chief emerging market economist for Capital Economics Ltd. in London.

21st Century Wire says…

After a century of being taken to the cleaners by the US federal government, mining and energy giants, along with the nuclear power industry, the Navajo Nation has managed to claw back some of what is rightfully theirs.

The historic legal victory addresses the issue of past mismanagement, but it still leaves the door open for the tribe to pursue more funds to deal with the government’s physical mess left behind regarding water, and uranium/radioactive pollution left on its reservation.



Past uranium mining and ‘leach mining’ operations went mostly unregulated throughout the Navajo Nation…



Residents and property owners have been directly affected by groundwater pollution and radiation releases from uranium mills and piles, forced to deal with the environmental health from impacts of past uranium development. Issues like water contamination from uranium mining have largely gone unresolved, even though they have posed a direct threat to the natural and cultural survival in parts of the Navajo lands.

It’s important for readers to know that beyond the nuclear power industry, the final destination of all this uranium is in military nuclear weapons – missiles and bombs. The nuclear industry is both dirty and destructive at every point in the supply/production chain.

For now, it looks like this tribe has gained the higher ground over the Washington-Corporate syndicate…

US to pay largest Native American nation $554 mn in landmark settlement



RT.com

The Obama administration will pay the Navajo Nation a record $554 million to settle claims by the most populous Native American tribe that funds and natural resources on its reservation were mismanaged by the US government for decades.

The agreement will be formally signed on Friday at Window Rock, Arizona, the capital of the Navajo reservation, the largest in the US by land mass.

The accord was borne from litigation that accused the government of mishandling Navajo funds and natural resources on its more than 14 million acres across Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, all held in trust for the tribe and leased out for purposes of farming, energy development, logging, and mining. The Navajo claims date back as far as 50 years.

In return for $554 million, the Navajo have agreed to drop its lawsuit and forego any future litigation over past US management of Navajo funds or resources held by the federal government, Reuters reported.



The deal does not, though, negate future trust claims or any other claims over water and uranium pollution on the reservation, Navajo Attorney General Harrison Tsosie said. Based on non-disclosure clauses, he could not say how much the Navajo had claimed it was owed ahead of the settlement.

From 1944 to 1986, nearly four million tons of uranium ore were extracted from Navajo land under lease agreements between the federal government and the Navajo Nation, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.



Now, the mines are closed, but over 500 abandoned uranium mines, as well as homes and drinking water sources, have been found to have high levels of radiation.

The legacy of uranium mining earned the reservation a Superfund designation, an EPA program that addresses hazardous waste sites in dire need of clean-up and control.

The settlement deal was hailed by Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly as a “victory for tribal sovereignty”. He vowed to hold town hall meetings in the process of deciding how to use the settlement funds across a population of around 300,000 on nearly 27,000 miles of reservation.



“After a long, hard-won process, I am pleased that we have finally come to a resolution on this matter to receive fair and just compensation for the Navajo Nation,” Shelly said in a statement.

The historic agreement, US Attorney General Eric Holder said, exemplified the US Justice Department’s commitment to “strengthening our partnership with tribal nations.”

Over two years ago, the Obama administration came to similar settlements with 41 tribes for about $1 billion overall. Since that deal, the federal government has resolved breach of trust claims by around 40 additional tribes for more than $1.5 billion, according to the Justice Department.

21st Century Wire says…

Over the weekend, China announced sure signs of stabilising with a 7.7% growth rate, matching it’s performance for 2012, along with an announcement that the People’s Republic has finally passed the US as the world’s number producer. But that celebration was short-live…



Fears of a ‘major default contagion’, due to hit on January 31st – have already begun to cascade, as Shanghai stock market closed today at lowest level since last July.

It’s China’s first major ‘shadow banking’ default event, and investors on the bad end of the default were expecting that someone would bail them out, but that’s not looking very likely right now. Reuters reports:

“Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world’s largest bank by assets, said on Thursday that it has no plans to use its own money to repay investors in a troubled off-balance-sheet investment product that it helped to market.”

The Chinese Ministry of Finance is keen to reform a potentially chaotic trend towards shady money, and thus may use this collapse to send a message to other players that it will not encourage the dodgy shadow banking shell game, and let it fail. In short, the doctor will be administering ‘bad medicine’ to the patient – unlike in America and Europe, where elite gamblers operate under the expectation that a bailout is all but guaranteed should the ponzi scheme collapse.

What does this mean for the rest of the world markets?

It may deliver a short-term hit to the Yuan, shock pan-Asian investor confidence, and scare away some big speculators for a period of time. Whether the ripple effect hits the west remains to be seen, and won’t be seen overnight.

This will be a big test for China’s economy and financial management, and whether or not this collapse in Trust’ causes a chain reaction. Zero Hedge explains the root of the problem facing Chinese investors who’ve bought into Chinese wealth management products (WMP) right now:

A major test for the Chinese economy, and may hit their inflated property market hard, as well as the Yuan – but if they take the hit and recover without kicking the can down the road like the US Fed have done, over and over, then it will help China achieve an even stronger credit rating, but only after the dust clears.

Mega Default in China Scheduled for Jan 31st

Gordon Chang

Forbes

On Friday, Chinese state media reported that China Credit Trust Co. warned investors that they may not be repaid when one of its wealth management products matures on January 31, the first day of the Year of the Horse.



The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China sold the China Credit Trust product to its customers in inland Shanxi province. This bank, the world’s largest by assets, on Thursday suggested it will not compensate investors, stating in a phone interview with Reuters that “a situation completely does not exist in which ICBC will assume the main responsibility.”

There should be no mystery why this investment, known as “2010 China Credit-Credit Equals Gold #1 Collective Trust Product,” is on the verge of default. China Credit Trust loaned the proceeds from sales of the 3.03 billion-yuan ($496.2 million) product to unlisted Shanxi Zhenfu Energy Group, a coal miner. The coal company probably is paying something like 12% for the money because Credit Equals Gold promised a 10% annual return to investors—more than three times current bank deposit rates—and China Credit Trust undoubtedly took a hefty cut of the interest.

Zhenfu was undoubtedly desperate for money. One of its vice chairmen was arrested in May 2012 for taking deposits without a banking license, undoubtedly trying to raise funds through unconventional channels. In any event, the company was permitted to borrow long after it should have been stopped—reports indicate that it had accumulated 5.9 billion yuan in obligations. Zhenfu, according to one Chinese newspaper account, has already been declared bankrupt with assets of less than 500 million yuan.

21st Century Wire says…

An era of cover-ups is drawing to an end. We can only imagine what scandal is brewing behind the scenes. For someone this high-up the Obama food chain to jump ship before the mid-term elections, means something very damaging for the White House may be coming down the pipeline…

Eric Holder (photo, below) announced today that he will be resigning as US Attorney General and head of the US Department of Justice. Holder says he’ll be staying on until a successor is confirmed.

Holder, known as ‘Obama’s legal pit bull’, has served as attorney general since 2009, and is regarded as the President’s closest person friend in the administration.

Critics believe that Holder is Washington’s most overtly political and corrupt Attorney General in history…



With so much open law-breaking being done by the Federal government, and with much of it covered-up and contained by the Department of Justice, it’s anyone’s guess what has prompted Holder’s exit this week.

What’s forced Holder into early retirement? Perhaps it’s that the Ferguson, Missouri case may not go the way the DOJ wants and public fall-out will be too messy. His exit could also be part of a larger deal cut between the opposition and the White House involving a scandal threatening to explode.

From the beginning of Obama’s first term in 2009, Holder’s job was to protect the President from any legal recoiling, and to make any illegal actions appear legal on paper. The result has been a huge dent in the public’s confidence that the DOJ’s is able to dispense justice fairly and free of White House politics.

Holder took it upon himself to defend the Obama White House from a string of high-profile scandals, often at professional and personal expense. Holder was also the first Attorney General in US history to be held in contempt of Congress – for not complying with (ignoring) Congressional subpoenas relating to Fast and Furious. Many consider this as further proof the Holder was running a cover-up – not the sort of behaviour one would expect from the head of any ‘Justice Department’.

Many believed that Holder’s involvement in covertly running thousands of illegal guns to Mexican criminals gangs through Operation Fast Furious would have been the scandal that broke the DOJ’s back, but the issue failed to gain enough traction to prompt a White House meltdown. In the end, Holder’s guns were used by criminal gangs to murder US border patrol and ICE agents, and wound an Arizona sheriff, along with untold more victims.

21WIRE’s Patrick Henningsen investigated Holder’s ‘Operation Fast and Furious’ back in 2012 while reporting for Infowars.com:

.

Then came Holder’s refusal to take any action over the IRS scandal. Here the White House was found to be directing the agency to target and harass conservative charities and groups. This abuse of power was roundly condemned, as was the destruction of email evidence by the IRS, and Lois Lerner’s incredible claim of broken and lost hard drives. IRS harassment was shown to deterring Republican donors from giving money to conservative organizations – which may have affected election results.

White House micro-management of the IRS scandal recently cause a PR meltdown at the DOJ in September, when Holder’s aid accidentally called House Oversight Head Darrell Issa’s office instead of Democratic Rep. Elijah Cumming’s staff, requesting to leak documents in order to “help get ahead of news stories”, as reported by Breitbart. It was a disaster: Holder’s aide Brian Fallon called and unveiled the DOJ’s political cover-up plan to the very office he was seeking to undermine.

Holder also came under fire for his absence when the President went behind the back of Congress to negotiate a prisoner swap with the Taliban in Afghanistan, trading disgraced US soldier Bowe Bergdahl for no less than five Taliban operatives.

Then there were Holder’s direct involvement in targeting the free press in the US, where the DOJ were caught stealing telephone numbers of journalists during an East German-like raid on the offices of Associated Press (AP). Holder and the DOJ refused to police itself in this scandal, which delegitimized it in the eyes of many Americans.

In addition, Holder has been criticized for actively politicizing and stoking up racial tensions around nationally televised tragedies involving young African-American victims, like with the death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, and most recently with the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

Most recently, Holder and the DOJ was found missing in action, allowing President Obama – without any legal standing at all, to bypass Congress to launch an undeclared war against the country of Syria this week with US-led bombing raids in that country.

It could be one of the above which has prompted Holder escape from the DOJ, or it could be a completely new scandal which may emerge in the coming weeks or months.

Time will tell…

Holder is expected to move immediately into his new career as a partner in a high-profile Human Rights law firm.

Meanwhile, the White House remains exposed until Holder’s replacement is confirmed. The confirmation process could, in itself, develop into a whole other drama.

21st Century Wire says…

In the new American Stasi States, it’s been imperative for White House technocrats to ‘never let a good crisis go to waste’. Instead of repealing the unconstitutional Patriot Acts (these legally enable illegal gov’t practices), the public outrage over the NSA’s rape of 4th Amendment privacy rights has been used by President Barack Obama to order the siezure of even more of our metadata.

Even better now, instead of the NSA collecting and storing up to 30% of our phone records and communications, Obama has ordered that US telecoms firms store ALL of our data, and will come calling when they want it. Very clever.

In other words, the whole operation has just gone “more corporate” now. More fascist.

The devil is in the detail…



MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO: Obama follows orders, maintains the integrity of the American Stasi he helped build up.

Telecoms could be forced to collect even more metadata under Obama’s NSA overhaul



RT.com

An effort from the White House to revamp the rules that govern how the National Security Agency goes about getting telephone data may actually force service providers to start logging more records that they do now, a new report suggests.

Government and industry sources in the United States say that the NSA has been collecting only a fraction of the so-called metadata it’s allowed to acquire under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Reuters reported this week, and that the systems used by telecommunication companies to create those records rarely capture all the details they could be.

Last month, US President Barack Obama said his administration had settled on a plan that, if approved by Congress, would no longer allow the NSA to regularly collect the metadata pertaining to millions of Americans without first getting authorization on an individual basis. Currently, Section 215 of the US PATRIOT Act is interpreted in a way that allows the NSA to compel telecoms for metadata without making a case against intelligence targets, but Pres. Obama’s new proposal would make it so that the telephone companies would create and keep those records for themselves unless they’re specifically requested by intel officials and approved of by the FISA court.

According to Reuters’ sources, however, telecoms aren’t recording as much metadata as many Americans think. Although secret documents leaked to the media last year by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA was compelling telecoms for those call records, sources say telephone service providers seldom log all the data that the government wants them to.

An industry source told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the systems used by telecoms to log records are “complex,” but added, “I doubt there are companies out there that have a nice, neat, single database that can tell you how long records are kept universally.”

Another source identified only as being a former senior US official also suggested to Reuters that fewer records are being kept on account of the growing popularity of unlimited-calling plans offered by telecoms, the likes of which often don’t involve billing customers for individual calls. Without individual calls being billed, some companies may not be logging conversation-specific metadata.

“The change in the nature of billing data means that there’s a lot less such data than there used to be,” Stewart Baker, a former senior official at both the NSA and the Department of Homeland Security, told Reuters.

Both the industry source and the unnamed former government official, the Reuters report continued, said the NSA has been collecting only 25 percent to one-third of the total US metadata that it is authorized to collect. Obama’s new plan would relinquish the agency from holding onto any of that information, but would instead require the telecoms to make more detailed logs.

“It strips from us the ability to make business decisions as the technology evolves,” the industry source told Reuters journalists Mark Hosenball and Alina Selyukh. “It would cause us to continue to collect stuff that we don’t need,” they said.

Currently, the US Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, requires telecoms to retain for 18 months the records on “toll,” or long-distance calls, Reuters reported.

“Will the reconstituted program retain equal efficiency in acquiring and analyzing the data as the current program?” Carrie Cordero, the director of National Security Studies at Georgetown University Law Center, asked on the Lawfareblog this week. “This is a big question, with a very unclear answer from where we sit today. Currently, it is impossible to tell, but also hard to imagine that it will. What we do know is that communications companies are in the business of providing communications services. And while they will respond to lawful legal process, they are not inherently suited to perform, nor are they interested in dramatically changing their business model to facilitate, intelligence collection and analysis.”

Last week, the executive vice president for public policy at Verizon wrote on the telecom’s own blog that the company will of course compel with future requests for call records from the government, but added that he believed “companies should not be required to create, analyze or retain records for reasons other than business purposes.”

Under the White House’s plan, telecoms “would be compelled by court order to provide technical assistance to ensure that the records can be queried and that results are transmitted to the government in a usable format and in a timely manner.”

Pres. Obama has asked Congress to draft and approve legislation that adheres to that provision and others announced last month by his administration.

21st Century Wire

SPECIAL REPORT

The fanfare surrounding the Taliban prisoner swap for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl neglects to mention the most shocking aspects of this story. As we unravel this unique case, it becomes evident how the government narrative does not at all resemble the reality behind this controversial affair.

The White House’s first stumbling block was explaining why Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay were released without Congressional approval. In this instance, President Obama is actually breaking his own law, signed in 2014 – a renewal of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which stipulates policy as outlined by the House Armed Services Committee confirming that the Secretary of Defense must notify Congress at least 30 days in advance of any transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees.

The second issue is even more incendiary. The current White House regime has cynically attempted to paint Bowe Bergdahl as a ‘hero’, perhaps to gather some political capital – but more likely to distract media and critics from looking closer into what Bowe Bergdahl was up to since he walked off this military post in Afghanistan in 2009.

Aiding the Enemy



William Rentiers served in the 501st Infantry, East Company alongside Bergdahl, and was also involved in the effort to find him after his disappearance. In an interview with radio talk show host Pete Santilli on Army Specialistserved in the 501st Infantry, East Company alongside Bergdahl, and was also involved in the effort to find him after his disappearance. In an interview with radio talk show host Pete Santilli on GMN , Rentiers revealed new insights into the Bergdahl Affair that have been largely ignored by the US government and mainstream media. Regarding accusations of Bergdahl providing strategic intel to the Taliban, Rentiers explaining:

“There was never a single doubt. No one ever doubted he (Bergdahl) was a deserter and We called him what he really was a defector​. I can’t prove it, but what happened after he joined the Taliban speaks for itself​​. The enemy changed and men died. The enemy became more complex and more strategically accurate than they had ever been before. It just seemed like we couldn’t get ahead of them anymore.”

“Their attacks got so much more sophisticated and complex. There’s no way to prove that he gave them help. But there’s a whole lot of “huh” going on there like that just doesn’t seem right. So why is it all of a sudden these guys are getting better at it, and they seem like they know what we do.”

These latest revelations come on the back of numerous mainstream reports that challenge The White House’s own insistence that Bowe Bergdahl was a bona fide P.O.W., even as all available facts point to Bergdahl being a deserter.

Rentiers adds here, “Immediately after they realized that he was, gone, you know within a matter of hours, myself and portions of my company arrived on the scene and the very first thing that everyone that was there with him said – because there was never any doubt, he had left of his own volition. Out of every man and woman involved in the search process, no one ever doubted he deserted.”

Rentiers felt compelled to come forward following a string of misinformed media reports and unsubstantiated rumors circulating around the Bergdahl story. He explains, “They were trying to paint him as a POW at that time, as if he had been captured. I had seen reports that he was coming back from a bar, which doesn’t exist, and he got abducted. Or he fell behind on a foot patrol that, was not conducted, like, I mean it was just a bunch of obvious things, when you’re standing right there participating in this stuff, and then you read it on the news, and it’s not changed a little bit, it’s just completely fabricated.”

After Bergdahl left his post, units were immediately dedicated to searching for Bergdahl, a search which also may have cost the lives of fellow soldiers.

“Every soldier from multiple units and multiple countries in that province, were searching for him for two to three months. And immediately after he left our entire operation changed to find Bergdhal.”

“Everything else got put on the back burner, and everyone in the province was, find Bergdhal, find Bergdhal, and there were other units in other places, who normally would have air assets, like surveillance and attack choppers, A10 warthogs and stuff, that were diverted for the search for him, so indirectly he caused the loss of life in, many other places. And as a matter of fact, before he disappeared, we had these mine-rollers on our trucks, that extend anywhere from five to fifteen feet out in front of the trucks. And every time you hit a bomb with one it would just blow up the mine roller and the truck would be fine, and the people would be fine. Well, after he disappeared, they started offsetting the pressure plates inside the charge, so when you hit the pressure plate, it went off under the truck and completely destroyed it. Now often because we had MRAPs, there was little to no injury, but, lots of trucks got destroyed.”

Bergdahl Search Cost Lives

“Six men, Six men or, seven total, but six (died) after Bergdhal decided to leave. They were put in harm’s way in the search for him, that would otherwise not have been. And I want to clear something up. He walked off of a combat outpost that was nothing more than a couple of trucks and some concertina wire, and I was not there at that moment. But I was there just a few hours later, because I was on an outpost nearby. It was just really tiny, just easy for anybody to leave.”

Rentiers states that he did know Bergdahl, but that they were not close friends. “I had talked to him several times but he was so quiet, and real reclusive, and he didn’t seem like he had too many close friends, which is kind of strange in an Army unit, especially out in Afghanistan.”

Listen to the full interview here which recently aired on the GMN Radio Network:

Was the CIA Managing Bergdahl?

US intelligence reports indicate that Bergdahl was handed over to the Haqqani Network in 2009-2010. Rolling Stone journalist Michael Hastings reported this in 2011:

“Intelligence reports suggest that Bowe was moved into Pakistan sometime in late 2009 or 2010, where he is being held by the Haqqani network, an insurgent group with links to Al Qaeda that has joined the Taliban in fighting the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. It’s also a group that, before the attacks of September 11th, was funded by the CIA. The network, which now has ties to the Pakistani government, is likely living under the protection of the Pakistani intelligence service, as Osama bin Laden and other top Al Qaeda leaders did for years.”

It can then be said that Berdahl was essentially handed over to a CIA-controlled terror group in 2011, because it is a matter of public record that the Haqqani Network was actually founded and funded by the CIA in 2004 in order for the agency to have their own formidable counterweight to some of the major al Qaeda groups operating out of Pakistan.

Huff Post describes Haqqani’s pure CIA pedigree:

“Haqqani’s rise to power can be traced directly back to the secret, multi-billion-dollar U.S. campaign to create a radicalized and well-equipped army of Islamic jihadists — known as the mujahideen — to lead a war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

Back then, when a top U.S. foreign policy goal was to bog the invading Soviets down in Afghanistan, the ferocious Haqqani was one of the CIA’s favorite commanders, showered with money and shoulder-fired missiles and other weapons — and sent out to repel the foreign occupiers.”



The case for CIA management of the Bergdahl Affair is also strengthened by the peculiar role of ‘Intel Center’ – a Pentagon-run media organization who somehow has enjoyed a monopoly on all high profile ‘terror videos’, including many of the dubious exclusive Osama bin Laden, Ayman Al-Zawahri and Adam Gadahn (aka Adam Pearlman, the notorious Jewish-American ‘al Qaeda’ leader) video released to the American public since 2001. Intel Center’s logo has been embossed on a number of the major photo releases for Bowe Bergdahl (see image above).

Previously, IntelCenter was exposed by journalist Neal Krawetz inserting their own logo on Al-Qaeda videos at the same time the so called ‘Al-Qaeda’ Arabic media logo was inserted in the same videos.

At least one of the most famous bin Laden videos has been roundly proven as a fake, but this never stopped Washington from using it as a media feature to help hype DHS Threat Alerts and bolster funding for the global War on Terror.



Bergdahl and ‘Clinton 2016’

Rolling Stone journalist Michael Hastings was the first to give in-depth detail of the Bergdahl Affair and the journalist met an untimely death shortly after his feature on the missing soldier. The media had connected the timing of Hastings’s death with his exposure of US General Stanley McChrystal, but little was mentioned by the media at time of the Bergdahl angle – an omission which has now fuel more speculation regarding the circumstances surrounding the journalist’s bizarre car accident.

Interestingly, Hastings also reported before his death of how then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was at the center of previous exchange deals struck for Bergdahl, and one deal which Clinton had spiked at the eleventh hour. Arizona Senator John McCain was also involved in the early swap deals and was known to be flip-flopping on backing various scenarios. One US Official is on record with Hastings stating that Hillary did not really care about Bergdahl as a ‘P.O.W.’, but was more concerned with her political image:

“Some top-level officials within the administration, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are very wary about making a swap for Bowe. “Panetta and Hillary don’t give a shit about getting him home,” says one senior U.S. official involved in the negotiations. “They want to be able to say they COINed their way out of Afghanistan, or whatever, so it doesn’t look like they are cutting and running.” (Both Clinton and Panetta, by law, would have to sign off on any exchange.) As with Vietnam, many in the military are resisting any attempt to end the war. “Even after Robert Bales” – the Army staff sergeant charged with massacring 17 Afghan civilians in March – “they are making the argument that the war is turning a corner,” says this official. “They don’t realize that the mission is changing. We don’t need all those U.S. soldiers there anymore.”

The Daily Mail details exactly how political the Bergdahl Affair is, with Presidential campaigns of Democrats Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 – both appeared to be heavily concerned with how the Bergdahl Affair plays out in the media:

“Clinton’s plan would have also required the Qatari government to surveil the released Taliban fighters, and the prisoners wouldn’t have been allowed to travel out of Qatar ‘until there was peace,’ The Daily Beast reported.

‘Break ties with al Qaida, renounce violence, and abide by the Afghan constitution, and you can rejoin Afghan society,’ Clinton told the Taliban in 2011. ‘Refuse and you will continue to face the consequences of being tied to al Qaida as an enemy of the international community.’

The plan that president Obama ultimately went with only slaps the released Taliban fighters with a one-year travel ban. Other details of the deal are being kept secret.

‘The talks evolved. The fact that we are going to be pulling out of Afghanistan shortly meant that the likelihood of retrieving Bergdahl was diminishing,’ Rep. Moran said. ‘And once the war in Afghanistan is over, some will argue that we no longer have a legal right to detain the Taliban.”

Afghan Drugs Trade

You cannot talk about Afghanistan without talking about Heroin and Marijuana – two crops for which Afghanistan is presently the planetary leader in illegal export trade. What is also noticeably absent from the current Bergdahl Affair, is this narcotics industry that has been flowing freely out of Afghanistan since the US-led NATO invasion and occupation that began in 2001. The gaping lack of any kind of resolution between the US-installed Karzai government in Kabul, the CIA-linked al Qaeda insurgents, and Washington DC. Meanwhile, American taxpayers have unknowingly been footing the bill for US troops who have been guarding the poppy fields of Afghanistan.

One thing is certain: Washington is not telling the full story of Bowe Bergdahl, and members of the Left and Right are manipulating the story in order to gain – or take, political capital.

What will come of the newly released detainees and what else will be revealed about Bergdahl as this story continues?

Andrew McKillop

21st Century Wire

Britain’s Foreign Secretary William Hague is certainly talking a big game, but is having some trouble producing his big stick.

In Spanish bull-fighting, the man with the red cape is known as El Matador. He pretends he can stop the bull, but in the end is only attempting to fool the beast. When the Matador gets too fancy with his moves however, he sometimes ends up getting trampled by the beast. Either way, the crowd gets their money’s worth.

William Hague’s verbal show of force towards Russia is about as convincing to the crowd as that dusty old red cape. Hague is either too afraid, or too uninformed to know tell the cluster of press microphones the truth – that neither EU, nor the UK, has any real leverage for economic sanctions, and cannot finish the fight which Washington and EU instigated and which all western players have actively egged on from the onset.

Instead of Europe working for mutual benefit with Russia – diplomatically and economically, they do the opposite. You can guess who benefits.

Better, imagine William Hague wearing a toga. Caesar’s emissary, Hague, has been dispatched, scroll in hand, to the steps of the Pantheon to tell crowds that Caesar is still strong and that the outer reaches of the empire are still secure and growing, and that those Barbarian hordes will be severely dealt with – but that Romans will have to tighten their belts, pay more for heating and of course – cough up more taxes.



Now for a bitter dose of reality…

High Priced Energy – High Priced Security

Speaking to the press, 9 March, the UK’s Foreign minister William Hague said:

“If no solution to this (energy dependence on Russia) can be found”, European countries will “Recast their approach to energy and economic links with Russia over time”.

He was very careful not to give any time lines, and certainly no investment cost estimates for making Europe energy independent from Russia. Present plans so far mooted by officials in Europe’s capitals, and in Washington include larger imports of U.S. natural gas, reversing gas flows through pipelines from Western Europe back into Ukraine, and accelerated buying of more energy from countries other than Russia.

In all cases the investment costs are either high or very high, and the timelines are long. Taking oil, any rapid cutback in present EU28 oil imports from Russia of around 3.5 million barrels a day will instantly drive oil market prices far higher, easily reaching $150 per barrel.

Foreign ministers like Hague, and his opposite numbers in other EU states and in the US can close their eyes to economic and energy-economic realities on the ground as they set out to “punish Putin”, but Europe’s energy policies already cast high energy prices in stone. The Dec 2008 climate-energy policy vote by the European Parliament, transposed into member state regulations, laws and energy-economic policies from March 2009, sets out to reduce Europe’s import dependence on oil and gas. It has the never-stated but obligatory assumption that European energy prices will stay high, or increase. In turn this means fuel poverty and Europe’s energy intensive industries fleeing the continent, for as long as member state governments play the card of “free flowing markets” and refuse to prevent the real world results of extreme high energy prices “to save the climate and reduce European dependence on Russia”.

The real results are a frenetic energy asset bubble, for as long governments allow energy prices to stay at extreme highs, followed by a market collapse when energy prices decline due to oversupply.

If the Price is High Enough

Put in more simple terms, if the energy price is high enough – and it certainly is in Europe – there will be supply, in fact as we find, too much of it. European energy demand of all kinds – electricity, oil, gas and coal – is on a down-trend, but supply is rising. Sooner or later, this has to result in a reset during which the speculative energy investment bubble fed on high and increasing energy prices collapses. To be sure and certain, the results will not be pretty.

The present Washington-influence EU foreign policy mindset, conversely, is resolutely piecemeal and ad hoc, shown by Russian oil supplies to Europe being treated as unrelated and unaffected by any Washington-backed European de facto embargo on Russian natural gas exports to the continent. Russia would supposedly continue supplying oil to Europe in all tranquility, as the Europeans scramble to reduce Russian gas imports to nothing, in order to punish Putin!



Making these ad hoc instant foreign policy initiatives all the more laughable, Europe’s gas prices are already high – which directly aids Russia, Norway and Algeria – because gas prices are indexed to the price of oil, making the oil-gas relationship fundamental. Put another way, if oil prices are for any reason maintained at their present high level, European gas prices will also remain high, despite the talk about “de-indexing” gas.

In brief and worldwide, Asian gas prices remain tightly linked or indexed to oil prices at about $100 per barrel equivalent (boe), European prices are close-linked at about $70 per boe, while only North American gas prices are fully-deindexed at less than $30 per boe.

Low Cost Gas and Gas Import Dependence

Ukraine, despite its own massive national gas reserves which have been ignored for decades, relies on Russia for 70% of its natural-gas supply. Six other European nations rely on Russia for 100% of their gas. Another seven obtain at least 50% of their gas from Russia, and several others depend on Russia for 25%-33% of their national gas consumption.

The “legacy reason” for this was low-priced Russian gas supply, which slowly but steadily morphed into high-priced Russian supply, as other suppliers – especially Norway and Algeria – increased their own exports to Europe in order to profit from high oil-indexed gas prices. LNG suppliers to Europe have followed suit for exactly the same reason. Europe, in overall gas supply and potential gas supply terms – which include European shale gas development – faces the real prospect of oversupply at some near-term stage and point in time. This will be brought forward by the continent’s now four-year trend of significant falls in its yearly gas consumption, in part due to the high price of gas!

Europe’s gas import dependence on Russia is very clear. Certainly in the short-term, it can be called “structural” due to the short-term impossibility of ramping up either pipeline supplies, mainly from Norway and Algeria, or imported more expensive LNG from world suppliers to cover any theoretical short-term cut-off of Russia supplies. This is completely evident and should be known – even to Mr William Hague.

Highly significant for understanding the gulf between mindsets in Moscow and in Brussels (and Washington), officials in Moscow cited by US media including ‘Wall Street Journal’ say they are convinced that the biggest immediate threat is of Western responses which will undercut the price Russia gets for its gas exports. Russia’s Gazprom officials go on to repeat their base-case analysis of rising European demand for Russia gas, as pipeline supply from Norway, Algeria, the U.K., Holland and elsewhere slows, and LNG import capacities in European countries fail to ramp up, in part due to high LNG terminal construction costs and low-growing EU gas consumption, and world LNG supplies moving towards the even higher-priced, gas-hungry markets of Asia.

Threatened gas sanctions, in particular, are seen by some key Russian officials as a disguised commercial policy simply seeking lower prices for Russian gas…

Gas Infrastructures Depend on Gas Prices, not Politics

Rightly called a permanent circus act, the map of potential new gas pipeline and LNG supply infrastructures in Europe is a pathwork overlay to a continent already criss-crossed with both “legacy” and “project” gas pipelines and gas reservoirs. It is also criss-crossed, but mostly at the “project” stage with LNG import terminals, and their actual or planned national or regional pipeline delivery infrastructures.

In overall and total terms, continental Europe has close to, or more than the total of approximately 240 000 kilometres of gas pipeline and delivery infrastructures that exist in the much larger area of the continental US. Europe is not short of gas infrastructures, and will not be short of the gas to fill them!

Spectacular and very high-cost projects such as the Nord Stream and South Stream gaslines serving Germany alone (Nord Stream) and several western EU states, by South Stream when it is completed and operational, are also accompanied or rivaled by mostly-projected new gas lines oriented to the southern EU states. Web search with “projected gas pipelines, Europe” will suffice to show the continent is promised – or threatened – with a deluge of new gas pipelines.

Russia’s massive gas infrastructures for supplying all of Europe are the largest of the “legacy” infrastructures, with Ukraine being the key legacy pipeline route and hub.

Brave words from the European Commission, 6 March, are that it would help expand the Ukraine’s natural-gas pipeline system as part of an aid package. This expansion’s completion date, nor its funding were described, but the EC’s aim is enabling Ukraine to import gas from certain other neighboring countries – although the gas will be of Russian origin or mostly Russian origin. European officials call this the “reverse flow strategy”, that is to pump mostly Russian-origin gas back into the Ukraine – to reduce the country’s dependence on Russian gas!

Ukraine’s heavily oversized gas infrastructures are able to transport and store more than 4 times the country’s annual demand for domestic consumption of about 80 billion cubic metres, and are used not only to transport gas at different daily flow rates depending on compressor power utilised, but also to store gas in situ (gas stored in slow-moving pipelines). The gas can also be offloaded to underground storage reservoirs, which in Ukraine’s case are massive but in degraded or badly-maintained condition.

As at present, according to specialist publications such as Platts Gas News and Market Data, Ukraine’s reservoirs are at extreme high levels, for reasons including mild winter weather and economic recession in Europe damping gas demand. The present European Commission “outline proposal” to reverse-flow gas to Ukraine would, if it was ever funded and built, certainly face serious infrastructure problems, possibly including the need for repairing existing, or building more storage infrastructures – while the alternate and rational strategy of rapidly developing Ukraine’s own massive national gas reserves is at present ignored!

Proving that gas prices are a lot more important than talk about “energy security” the first U.S. LNG export terminal out of the six approved by regulators so far, is expected to start production in late 2015. Its total output is however already under contract to customers in Asia, due to Asian gas prices being even higher than European. This signals the commercial limits on the brave talk coming out of Washington, Brussels, London and elsewhere on “cutting Europe’s gas dependence on Russia to nothing”.

If the price is right, yes. If not, forget it.

Shawn Helton

21st Century Wire

The Pentagon along with the Minerva Research Initiative, appears to have resuscitated and partially reconstituted a 1960’s Cold War-era social science program used to detect, infiltrate and steer political protest…

The controversial program called Project Camelot had been operational nearly a decade into the Vietnam War, as the Special Operations Research Office (SORO) located at American University had received millions in funding from the US Army to conduct a six country study on civil unrest.

The current social science program directed by Minerva and the Department of Defense (DoD), appears to have also partnered with some of the most well-known universities in the United States by studying the behavior of peaceful activism and how political ideology shapes protest movements in the world at large.

Under both the Bush and Obama administrations, the Minerva Research Initiative has been conducting partly clandestine studies with the sponsorship of the Department of Defense and its university partners since 2010.

The big question should be: what is the endgame of this expensive and all-encompassing project?

This new program has prompted a rebirth of the militarization of social science and in the process has undoubtedly opened a floodgate of ethical concerns. The creation of this partnership was born out of a speech by former Secretary of Defense as well as past Director of the CIA, Robert Gates. In April of 2008, Gates delivered a speech at the Association of American Universities, there he provided a vague outline for research that worked in conjunction with academia and other Pentagon affiliated agencies such as the DoD :

“What we are considering is based to some degree on the success we had in the Cold War. During that period, we built up the Department of Defense’s – and the nation’s – intellectual capital with new research centers such as RAND and new mechanisms like, as I mentioned, the National Defense Education Act. With the Minerva initiative, we envision a consortia of universities that will promote research in specific areas. These consortia could also be repositories of open-source documentary archives. The Department of Defense, perhaps in conjunction with other government agencies, could provide the funding for these projects.”

Global policy think-tanks like the RAND corporation and laws such as the National Defense Education Act (NDEA), are hardly anything new as RAND was founded in 1948 and the NDEA was put into law in 1958. The RAND corporation has been linked to many risky and paranoid-driven creations during the height of the Cold War, with strategy based analysis born out of “suspicion and self-interest” which was personified in their vision of Game Theory, which was used to predict a possible nuclear conflict by gauging a series of mathematical models on Soviet behavior. One of RAND corporation’s most well-known Mathematician’s John Nash, applied this theory ruthlessly, suggesting it that could be used for other dark purposes, as those engaged in the theory could also betray one another if necessary, resulting in subterfuge. RAND had developed a network of so-called field experts, such as political scientists, social psychologists and anthropologists to oversee many of its most pressing projects.

The National Defense Education Act was passed with a distrustful affidavit that stated that all beneficiaries of the law disclaim a belief to overthrow the US government. That portion of the law was later repealed by President Kennedy in 1962.

The US federal government has long since been wary of its perception in the eyes of the public and has used historical happenings such as the Cold War or the War on Terror as devices to quell any criticism of foreign or domestic policy. One has gotten the impression over the last half century or more, that the West must engage in a perpetual war with an ever-changing enemy, at all costs to restore humanity – this is the ultimate ploy to convince the next wave of youthful statists.

Gates has taken heavy criticism for the role he played under William Casey’s direction while working as Deputy Director at the CIA. According to former CIA analyst Melvin Goodman, Gates had been a part of one the most corrupt times in the agency’s history serving under Casey. It was also said that Gates had provided misleading information during the highly publicized Iran-Contra operations and oversaw the channeling of weapons as well as other aid to Islamic brigades during the blowback-ridden Soviet /Afghan conflict.

Civil unrest, the military & Project Camelot

In a recent article entitled, “Pentagon preparing for mass civil breakdown,” by Nafeez Ahmed, at the Guardian, we learned that a new “research programme is funding universities to model the dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world, under the supervision of various US military agencies.” The program was brought to fruition during the height of the banking crisis in 2008, as Ahmed points out, suggesting it was already in the works for some time – and time was of the essence. This latest social science study could be as big or bigger then the Snowden documents on NSA bulk collection, not only are Americans being tracked but their behavior is being categorized, labeled and scrutinized, prompting those who value sovereignty to question the ethics of such a program. The Guardian article outlined the type of language used to describe civil movements promoting political change, ironically the uprising in Egypt was engineered by US NGO’s working in concert with the State Department :

“Among the projects awarded for the period 2014-2017 is a Cornell University-led study managed by the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research which aims to develop an empirical model “of the dynamics of social movement mobilisation and contagions.” The project will determine “the critical mass (tipping point)” of social contagians by studying their “digital traces” in the cases of “the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Russian Duma elections, the 2012 Nigerian fuel subsidy crisis and the 2013 Gazi park protests in Turkey.”

If you consider the historical context of the American Revolution, why would mass political protests in the United States be regarded as a social contagion?

Is this program setup to use college institutions as a laboratory to quell future dissent through some sort of re-education or will the subjects themselves become future targets?

In 1964, Project Camelot had been born out of the “Office of the Chief of Research and Development and presented to the Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering who thereafter passed it on to the Army Research and Development Office who turned to the Special Operations and Research Office (SORO) at American University of Washington DC.” The project itself is said to have received 6 million in funding from the US Army.

The Special Operations and Research Office had sent a consultant and anthropologist named Hugo Nutini to approach Chilean social scientists and other anthropologists about being a part of the military social science program called Project Camelot. The true nature of the project had been brought to question by Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung, after Galtung had received a memorandum inviting him to participate in a discussion on the project in 1966, even though the actual meeting was to take place in the summer of 1965. Galtung then gave the letter to Claudio Bunster a Chilean theoretical physicist, who immediately expressed doubt over the projects motivations and its connection to the US military.

A letter to the editor in July of 1965 was published in the Latin American Review of Sociology outlining the immoral context with which to view Project Camelot, as it appeared to be a, “grave violation of the most elementary rules of professional ethics which must govern relations between scientists.”

Bunster’s comments to colleagues on the Camelot Affair as it was later called, sent a shock-wave through Chile, as they were to be the test subject for the infamous project, “the study was financed by the armed forces of a foreign power,” continuing he described how the plan could have been exploited, “formulating foreign policy of that foreign power.” Following the media firestorm and outspoken critics like Bunster and Galtung the project was disbanded and put to rest.

The main purpose of Project Camelot was stated by the army as such:

“Success in such tasks as equipping and training indigenous forces for an internal security mission, civic action, psychological warfare, or other counterinsurgency action depends on a thorough understanding of the indigenous social structure, upon the accuracy with which changes within the indigenous culture, particularly violent changes, are anticipated, and the effects of various courses of action available to the military and other agencies of government upon the indigenous process of change.”

Its important to note that all of the researchers that had been a part of Project Camelot were all members of some of America’s most prestigious universities such as Chicago, Columbia, Harvard, Pennsylvania and Yale – does this sound familiar?

By the end of the 60’s, many scholars and activists had exposed the Pentagon’s social science research and other black operations like the Phoenix Program, which was a counterinsurgency project run by the CIA during Vietnam. The Program focused on the development of controversial counter-terrorism techniques and through its application became the quintessential false flag, employing terror tactics to destabilize the North Vietnamese leadership claiming to eradicate the Vietcong through the use of psyops, extortion, the release of criminals and random targeting of civilians to achieve its aims. Many people believe that this template for destabilization has been used in Afganistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and more recently South Sudan.

In 2010, it was revealed in an Associated Press article, that US military had been looking for a way to re-brand its psychological operations, due its ‘ominous’ nature. The name change extended to all facets of the military and was directed by policy makers that worked under previous Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The article then went on to describe psyops as persuading the enemy through radio, loudspeakers and government sponsored leaflets:

“The Army has dropped the Vietnam-era name “psychological operations” for its branch in charge of trying to change minds behind enemy lines, acknowledging the term can sound ominous.

The Defense Department picked a more neutral moniker: “Military Information Support Operations,” or MISO.”

What was behind the psychological operation name change, why would they change it now?

When looking at how secretive the Minerva Initiative has been since Gates helped conjure the concept and given his sordid background – we have to consider this military operations name change as being significant.

Minerva, NGO’s & threats of terror

The Minerva Initiative along with the DoD funded a project with US Naval Postgraduate School, that connected peaceful activists and non-violent political protesters to that of terrorism in a document entitled,’Who Does Not Become a Terrorist, and Why?,‘ it gives a brief breakdown of individuals who might have a “background of those who decided to engage in terrorism,” but have, “chosen a path of non-violence.” The document appears to have blended violent militancy with that of someone or some persons who may oppose a particular political ideology, which would only broaden the scope of people characterized in this manner.

This should be a major ethical concern when thinking about historical accounts of damaging social science programs, as it raises many more questions in terms of how this research will be used in the future:



“In every context we find many individuals who share the demographic, family, cultural, and/or socioeconomical background of those who decided to engage in terrorism, and yet refrained themselves from taking up armed militancy, even though they were sympathetic to the end goals of armed groups. The field of terrorism studies has not, until recently, attempted to look at this control group. This project is not about terrorists, but about supporters of political violence. Our goal is twofold. First, we propose to study supporters of armed militancy, in order to describe the panoply of activities they are willing to undertake short of violence, and the determinants of those actions. At the same time, we aim to contribute to theory building in the field of individual radicalization by looking at a control group that has, so far, never been studied.”

Here you catch an inside glimpse into how non-violent dissidents or political activists are categorized as “supporters of political violence,” as the document confidently claims that based on your family history and socioeconomic standing you could be considered “sympathetic to the end goals of armed groups.”

Why would the US military be focusing on intellectuals in American universities in this new social science control group – How is it possible that they would have any connection to the socioeconomic background of those who are considered radical terrorists?

The project is also stated as having 14 case studies with 140 life histories being evaluated, involving lengthy interviews with activists, militants, parties and NGO’s. According to Ahmed’s article for the Guardian, he attempted to contact the principal investigator on the project, Professor Maria Rasmussen of the US Naval Postgraduate School – but received no answer.

The Minerva program had also been contacted by the Guardian and issued a canned response from the DoD press office on the matter, one excerpt stated:

“Minerva helps fund basic social science research that helps increase the Department of Defense’s understanding of what causes instability and insecurity around the world.”

There seems to be a historical precedence for targeting thinkers of society when we look back to WW2, as Nazi leaders had deliberately ordered deaths of intellectuals, after being deemed a threat during Hitler’s reign. The humanitarian crisis for scholars and intellectuals during the Nazi-era was then surpassed by that of Mao Zedong’s dark rule during China’s cultural revolution, as he specifically executed intellectuals, viewing them to be one of his main enemies and in doing so, slaughtered some 46,000 scholars. All told, Mao is said to have taken the lives of 65 million or more under his oppressive socialist regime, more then Hitler and Stalin combined.

In today’s society of hyper surveillance and NSA bulk collection of data, we should be very cautious about these kinds of vague research programs that can impact the United States domestically and its relationships throughout the world through its applied science.

21st Century Wire says…

After their total failure to blame eastern Ukrainian Rebels and Moscow for what appears to be Kiev forces shooting down Fight MH17 on July 17th, Washington and its NATO allies have shifted their propaganda strategy in a new attempt to implicate Russia for international war crimes…

Over the weekend, Washington used its US ambassador to the Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, to launch another fabricated social media post designed to blame Russia for “firing artillery over its border into the Ukraine”.



Twitter Bombed: Pyatt’s tweeting turned out to be a bad joke. It’s a wonder he still has a job.

Moscow’s Defense Ministry came out immediately to demonstrating that the images posted by Pyatt on his Twitter account were in fact “faked”, as ITAR-TASS reported. It was simple to see how Pyatt had simply grabbed a series of images off of the Google World-style satellite mapping website Digital Globe, claiming it was “evidence” of Russia artillery fired into eastern Ukraine. If you combine Pyatt’s performance here alongside the less-than-mediocre abilities of US State Dept. Deputy Spokesperson, Marie Harf, as she attempted to convince the world she wasn’t running interference for the collection of lies being juggled by Washington at present – it’s just further proof that Washington’s regime change agents have completely lost the plot.

Here is Geoff’s rather flamboyant, and ultimately embarrassing Tweet:

New releases of imagery of Russian artillery attacks against Ukrainian military | @TIME: http://t.co/yKdmZ7m0oq pic.twitter.com/gPdZQi3aw6 — US Mission to NATO (@USNATO) July 27, 2014





It turns out, Pyatt’s Twitter gaff, was part of an “disinformation merry-go-round” currently on heavy rotation in Kiev. Unlike the legion all-too-eager media drones in the US and Europe, Russian officials have been able to explain the mechanics of the Washington-Kiev fiction mill:

“This scheme is called “an informational merry-go-round,” Konashenkov added, using an expression commonly uttered in Russia relating to feeding the information to the media.

“It’s no secret to anyone that fakes like this are made by a group of US counselors staying in the Kiev building of the Security Council, led by General Randy Kee,” he noted.

The general outlined the cycle as follows: the US counselors in the Kiev feed the disinformation to the Ukrainian media, with the news being taken by the Washington official representatives and presented as statements.

Afterwards, the Ukrainian media cited the US authorities and publish articles claiming Pyatt’s findings were somehow “objective.”

Washington Raises the Stakes

Clearly, war planners in Washington are determined to fabricate a case against Russia in order to enable either of these two outcomes:

1. Create a ‘global’ mandate for wider international sanctions against Russia.

2. Create a UN Security Council Crisis by implicating Russia via an “international violation”.

The first outcome is already in motion, but has failed to gain any real traction, not least of all because the US had expended most of its credibility and goodwill as a result of lying its way into successive wars and being caught doing, as was the case in Syria last September.

With the first outcome set firmly in place, the second desired outcome was set into motion by ‘Lawyer-n- Chief’, President Barrack Obama, who has accused Russia of Violating a 1980’s international missile treaty:



“In an escalation of tensions, the Obama administration accused Russia on Monday of conducting tests in violation of a 1987 nuclear missile treaty, calling the breach ‘a very serious matter’ and going public with allegations that have simmered for some time.” New sanctions from world leaders are imminent “amid worries that Moscow is stepping up its intervention in Ukraine and may be setting the stage for an outright invasion.” Moscow appears to be preparing for “deeper international isolation.” [AP]

Evidently, this is just the latest desperate lunge by Washington, dipping back into Soviet era legalese in order to bolster and intensify the idea of a ‘Russian Threat’ to the US and Europe.

What Obama fails to mention is that Washington is able to conveniently side-step any of the US treaty obligations by going via the NATO route. Obama himself has been a key driver in pushing NATO ‘defensive missiles’ into eastern European countries right on Russia’s own doorstep. When the US began this push to militarize the European border with the Russian Federation, it used the rather incredulous excuse that their new encirclement was to protect against, “an Iranian intercontinental ballistic missile threat”, even though no such threat exists. Obama’s phase two is set to be implemented this year:

Phase Two (in the 2015 time frame) – After appropriate testing, deploy a more capable version of the SM-3 interceptor (Block IB) in both sea- and land-based configurations, and more advanced sensors, to expand the defended area against short- and medium-range missile threats.

Expect more of the same for Washington over the next 60 days, as it angles for an open door to restart its military engagement of Syria, beginning from the fall of 2014. Already, the US have its Naval assets and air strike assets firmly in position around the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and only require another false flag incident, or random encroachment over either Turkish, or Israeli borders by some entity in Syria, in order to initiate plans already made to bomb Syria last September 2013.

US, NATO Are Fast-Tracking War Plans

Following 21WIRE’s initial independent investigation into the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, hundreds of thousands of readers now have a clearer insight into what appears to be a failed false flag operation designed to assign blame for the tragedy – to eastern Ukrainian rebels and Moscow. Fortunately, the world is waking up fast to this latest tale of overt deception by neo-fascists in Kiev, Washington and its NATO allies, but the danger stakes are now higher than ever, as western planners are even more desperate to expedite their plans to re-polarize the globe into a binary conflict.

21st Century Wire says…



After listening to CIA director John Brennan’s long-winded attempt at community relations today, only three words come to mind…

Ya vol Commandant!

And then maybe these two words, “Verschärfte Vernehmung”. As it happens, those two German words are straight out of the Gestapo’s own manual on torture. Translated from German to English, it means, ‘enhanced interrogation’ – you get that fancy term we keep hearing about this week, you know, that thing that’s ‘keeping America safe’.



OPERATION MOCKINGBIRD: Let the record show that, in the wake of the release of the Senate’s Torture Report, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer spent most of the week defending the CIA’s erroneous, immoral and highly ineffective torture program.

So for all those still romanticizing about CIA during the golden Bush Jr years, and to the security state hacks, torture apologists and pretend journalists in big media (like Wolf Blitzer) – just remember that the brainchild of Pennsylvania Ave’s legal pond life, Johns Ashcroft and Yoo, and AG Alberto Gonzalez – was gleaned straight out of a Nazi handbook – and the term you proudly festoon today, was casually tossed around by Cheney and Rumsfeld’s professional predecessors, Hermann Göring and Heinrich ‘Gestapo’ Müller…



Now, we’re pretty sure that newsroom gatekeeper Wolf will be upset and throw a tantrum if we made unauthorized use of the term ‘Nazi’ like he did when Dr. Ben Carson used it during a recent segment on Blitzer’s ‘Situation Room’ program on CNN. Are we comparing America’s contemporary political system to that of the Nazi’s in the 1930’s and 40’s? Of course not, there’s no comparison politically – but we will say that’s both governments’ prescription of “Verschärfte Vernehmung” and ‘Enhanced Interrogation’, are identical from where we’re sitting.

The Atlantic

The phrase “Verschärfte Vernehmung” is German for “enhanced interrogation”. Other translations include “intensified interrogation” or “sharpened interrogation”. It’s a phrase that appears to have been concocted in 1937, to describe a form of torture that would leave no marks, and hence save the embarrassment pre-war Nazi officials were experiencing as their wounded torture victims ended up in court.

The methods, as you can see above, are indistinguishable from those described as “enhanced interrogation techniques” by the president. As you can see from the Gestapo memo, moreover, the Nazis were adamant that their “enhanced interrogation techniques” would be carefully restricted and controlled, monitored by an elite professional staff, of the kind recommended by Charles Krauthammer (FOX News), and strictly reserved for certain categories of prisoner. At least, that was the original plan.

Also: the use of hypothermia, authorized by Bush and Rumsfeld, was initially forbidden. “Waterboarding” was forbidden too, unlike that authorized by Bush. As time went on, historians have found that all the bureaucratic restrictions were eventually broken or abridged. Once you start torturing, it has a life of its own. The “cold bath” technique – the same as that used by Bush against al-Qahtani in Guantanamo – was, according to professor Darius Rejali of Reed College, pioneered by a member of the French Gestapo by the pseudonym Masuy about 1943. The Belgian resistance referred to it as the Paris method, and the Gestapo authorized its extension from France to at least two places late in the war, Norway and Czechoslovakia. That is where people report experiencing it.

In Norway, we actually have a 1948 court case that weighs whether “enhanced interrogation” using the methods approved by president Bush amounted to torture. The proceedings are fascinating, with specific reference to the hypothermia used in Gitmo, and throughout interrogation centers across the field of conflict. The Nazi defense of the techniques is almost verbatim that of the Bush administration…

Here’s a document from Norway’s 1948 war-crimes trials detailing the prosecution of Nazis convicted of “enhanced interrogation techniques” in the Second World War. Money quote from the cases of three Germans convicted of war crimes for “enhanced interrogation”:

Between 1942 and 1945, Bruns used the method of “verschärfte Vernehmung” on 11 Norwegian citizens. This method involved the use of various implements of torture, cold baths and blows and kicks in the face and all over the body. Most of the prisoners suffered for a considerable time from the injuries received during those interrogations. Between 1942 and 1945, Schubert gave 14 Norwegian prisoners “verschärfte Vernehmung,” using various instruments of torture and hitting them in the face and over the body. Many of the prisoners suffered for a considerable time from the effects of injuries they received. On 1st February, 1945, Clemens shot a second Norwegian prisoner from a distance of 1.5 metres while he was trying to escape. Between 1943 and 1945, Clemens employed the method of ” verschäfte Vernehmung ” on 23 Norwegian prisoners. He used various instruments of torture and cold baths. Some of the prisoners continued for a considerable time to suffer from injuries received at his hands.

Freezing prisoners to near-death, repeated beatings, long forced-standing, waterboarding, cold showers in air-conditioned rooms, stress positions [Arrest mit Verschaerfung], withholding of medicine and leaving wounded or sick prisoners alone in cells for days on end – all these have occurred at US detention camps under the command of president George W. Bush. Over a hundred documented deaths have occurred in these interrogation sessions. The Pentagon itself has conceded homocide by torture in multiple cases. Notice the classic, universal and simple criterion used to define torture in 1948 (my italics):

In deciding the degree of punishment, the Court found it decisive that the defendants had inflicted serious physical and mental suffering on their victims, and did not find sufficient reason for a mitigation of the punishment in accordance with the provisions laid down in Art. 5 of the Provisional Decree of 4th May, 1945. The Court came to the conclusion that such acts, even though they were committed with the connivance of superiors in rank or even on their orders, must be regarded and punished as serious war crimes.

The victims, by the way, were not in uniform. And the Nazis tried to argue, just as John Yoo did, that this made torturing them legit. The victims were paramilitary Norwegians, operating as an insurgency, against an occupying force. And the torturers had also interrogated some prisoners humanely. But the argument, deployed by Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and the Nazis before them, didn’t wash with the court. Money quote:

As extenuating circumstances, Bruns had pleaded various incidents in which he had helped Norwegians, Schubert had pleaded difficulties at home, and Clemens had pointed to several hundred interrogations during which he had treated prisoners humanely. The Court did not regard any of the above-mentioned circumstances as a sufficient reason for mitigating the punishment and found it necessary to act with the utmost severity. Each of the defendants was responsible for a series of incidents of torture, every one of which could, according to Art. 3 (a), (c) and (d) of the Provisional Decree of 4th May, 1945, be punished by the death sentence.

So using “enhanced interrogation techniques” against insurgent prisoners out of uniform was punishable by death. Here’s the Nazi defense argument:

(c) That the acts of torture in no case resulted in death. Most of the injuries inflicted were slight and did not result in permanent disablement.

This is the Yoo position. It’s what Glenn Reynolds calls the “sensible” position on torture. It was the camp slogan at Camp Nama in Iraq: “No Blood, No Foul.” Now take the issue of “stress positions”, photographed at Abu Ghraib and used at Bagram to murder an innocent detainee. Here’s a good description of how stress positions operate:

The hands were tied together closely with a cord on the back of the prisoner, raised then the body and hung the cord to a hook, which was attached into two meters height in a tree, so that the feet in air hung. The whole body weight rested thus at the joints bent to the rear. The minimum period of hanging up was a half hour. To remain there three hours hung up, was pretty often. This punishment was carried out at least twice weekly.

This is how one detainee at Abu Ghraib died (combined with beating) as in the photograph above. The experience of enduring these stress positions has been described by Rush Limbaugh as no worse than frat-house hazings. Those who have gone through them disagree. They describe:

Dreadful pain in the shoulders and wrists were the results of this treatment. Only laboriously the lung could be supplied with the necessary oxygen. The heart worked in a racing speed. From all pores the sweat penetrated.

Yes, this is an account of someone who went through the “enhanced interrogation techniques” at Dachau. (Google translation here.)

Critics will no doubt say I am accusing the Bush administration of being Hitler. I’m not…

21st Century Wire says…

The infection in America’s judicial system continues, as judges work to ‘customize’ Americans’ rights – all in the name of ‘National Security’.

The latest in a long line of corrupt anti-American judges who seek to rule against the US Constitution and Bill of Rights…

The shame United States federal government under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama rolls on, and with the help of a string of willing unconstitutional federal judges, it has successfully implementing its new culture of paranoia – including secret courts, secret police, torture, rendition, lying to congress, and a war on whistleblowers. The ineptitude of the Department of Justice, also with a lack of constitutional backbone by judges have transferred an an unprecedented level of invasive power over to unaccountable back-budget agencies like the NSA and the DHS.

U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III (photo, left), ‘ruled’ that the domestic collection program is legal.

The Washington Post reports this morning that Pauley’s action came after “a Dec. 16 ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon that granted a request for an injunction and blocked the collection of the phone data for conservative legal activist Larry Klayman and a co-plaintiff.and rejected a challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed an appeal Thursday.”

Watch Klayman in a recent MSNBC segment where ultra-liberal host Don Lemon cut off his mic in order to keep Klayman’s efforts from reaching an American audience…

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjvgSShiMlo

By contrast, pro-American Judge Leon described the NSA’s digital Stasi as “almost-Orwellian technology” allowing federal thugs to collect, store and analyze phone metadata is “unlike anything that could have been conceived in 1979” and is “at best, the stuff of science fiction,” Leon wrote.

Judge Pauley’s attack against America’s Bill of Rights came after another deadly blow to the Fourth Amendment earlier in the week by fellow anti-American US District Judge Edward Korman from New York who ruled that US border officials do not need any reasonable suspicion to search a person’s personal items or electronic devices – within 100 miles of a US border.

According the ACLU’s Catherine Crump, “We’re disappointed in (Korman’s) decision, which allows the government to conduct intrusive searches of Americans’ laptops and other electronics at the border without any suspicion that those devices contain evidence of wrongdoing.”

“Suspicionless searches of devices containing vast amounts of personal information cannot meet the standard set by the Fourth Amendment… Unfortunately, these searches are part of a broader pattern of aggressive government surveillance that collects information on too many innocent people, under lax standards, and without adequate oversight.”

Ruling against NSA collection of phone data is appealed

.

Sari Horwitz

Washington Post



The Justice Department on Friday appealed the ruling of a federal judge who said the National Security Agency’s massive collection of domestic telephone data was almost certainly unconstitutional.

The Justice Department’s filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit follows a Dec. 16 ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon that granted a request for an injunction and blocked the collection of the phone data for conservative legal activist Larry Klayman and a co-plaintiff.

Leon, who was nominated by President George W. Bush and appointed to the bench in 2002, stayed his decision to allow the Justice Department time to appeal. But in a strongly worded opinion, he rejected the government’s arguments that the program is legal.

The “almost-Orwellian technology” that allows the government to collect, store and analyze phone metadata is “unlike anything that could have been conceived in 1979” and is “at best, the stuff of science fiction,” Leon wrote.

In 1979, the Supreme Court ruled that Americans have no reasonable expectation of privacy in records of their calls that are held by phone companies, and the court said that a warrant to collect them is not required.

In a separate case, less than two weeks after Leon’s ruling, a federal judge in New York found just the opposite. U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III ruled that the domestic collection program was legal and rejected a challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed an appeal Thursday.

If the constitutionality of the NSA program divides the federal appeals courts, it is likely the Supreme Court will decide the issue.

Along with its appeal, the Obama administration on Friday revealed that the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court renewed an order allowing the NSA’s domestic phone record collection.

In a statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said that Leon’s ruling was the “lone contrary decision” and cited several rulings that sided with the administration, including the Dec. 27 ruling by Pauley.

“It is the administration’s view, consistent with the recent holdings of the United States District Courts for the Southern District of New York and Southern District of California, as well as the findings of 15 judges of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on 36 separate occasions over the past seven years, that the telephony metadata collection program is lawful,” the ODNI statement said.

REPORT

In the wake of the recent armed federal standoff at Bundy Ranch – a crisis sparked by the incursion of 200 armed federal agents from the Bureau of Land Management and the seizure of private property there, it seems that the federal government has its sights set on another large patch of farm land.

According to one local Indian rancher, the Department of Interior are now targeting Indian ranchers living and working on a once protected reservation land located at Pine Ridge in South Dakota.

The Oglala Sioux and Lakota Sioux of the reservation have been told by the Federal Government that the National Parks Service will be taking land that comprises the South Unit of the Badlands National Park as a new ‘Tribal National Park’, only the wording in the bill clearly indicates that it will be a federally managed national park under the Department of Interior, giving mere lip service to its tribal title. The Congressional bill has already been written, and if passed through Congress, both tribal members and non tribal members will be stripped of their deeded land – at a price set by the federal government. If owners do not accept Washington’s offer (expected to be a meager one), the land can be acquired at no cost because the measure has waived all appraisal rights and stipulates that Washington can simply take Indian land by force under ‘eminent domain’.

Thousands of tribe members will be affected by the land-grab. Some residents will be forced to relocate, and many more others will lose their income from grazing allotments on the land – a result which will ultimately force any remaining independent cattle ranchers out of business. In addition to all this, Tribal members will lose their share of income from entrance fees collected at the adjacent North Gate of the Badlands National Park – a punitive measure which will further compound the existing economic depression on a reservation where the average annual income is around $8,000 per year.

Washington may be pining for yet another ‘Wounded Knee’, as many residents and tribal members are prepared to stand their ground in the face of a federal imperialist policy inside US borders – a trend which many Americans have experienced first-hand, particularly in western states like Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona and California.

Tribal member and local cattle rancher Bud May believes the issue is not confined to Pine Ridge.

May states, “There is a feeling of common cause between attached parties on this issue – namely tribes and other reservations. The bottom line is we’ll all be under dictatorial control if something is not done quick”.

The federal move initially gained traction after a Tribal Ordinance passed by the Tribal Council in the spring of 2013.

Many Tribal members have been frustrated with the tribal council, which has gone against the will of the people to back the park. All 9 districts on the reservation have passed unanimous resolutions against the park along with the Shannon County Commissioners and several South Dakota State legislators.

To add insult to injury, it appears that all landowners were only notified of the measure until after it had passed, with their first news of the federal plan coming in the form of eviction notices issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Land Operations department in the fall of 2013.

The Tribal Council of 19 has yet to allow a democratic referendum on the federal takeover, although sources confirm that the referendum option is on the agenda for next month’s council meeting.

‘Cowboys and Indian’ in Common Cause

The federal land-grab crisis was elevated to national news in April when Nevada independent rancher Cliven Bundy and his supporters stood toe to toe in an armed standoff with the the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) over Bundy’s private property, land and water rights – which trace back to 1870’s.

Lory Storm, a Nebraska radio host who has been following recent developments at Pine Ridge describes the synergy now happening between what were previously strange bedfellows. Storm explains, “The difference between this situation and the Bundy Ranch conﬂict? It will be the ﬁrst time in the history of our Country that the Cowboys and Indians pose a united front against a federal government that is used to winning battles by first dividing and then conquering.”

Already, many land owners are taking the position that they will not comply with the latest order from the government – leaving many to wonder whether this potential standoff will become the third ‘Wounded Knee’ incident involving a standoff between the Sioux Nation and the US Federal government.

June 25th is the anniversary of the infamous battle at the Little Big Horn between General Custer, the Northern Cheyenne and the Lakota Sioux, and this year’s anniversary will see residents of the Pine Ridge Reservation along with other protesters gathering again Wounded Knee to protest the theft of their land by the Federal Government.

Crowds will gather to protest and a symbolic ride will take place today, where tribal riders will be joined by riders from ranches in Nebraska and South Dakota in the afternoon at the Gordon Legion in a show of solidarity on the issue of private property rights and grazing rights.

21st Century Wire says…



The human rights group Amnesty International has charged that Israel was in violation of humanitarian law due to the deliberate destruction of civilian buildings in the Gaza Strip following a two part brutal siege over the summer dubbed, Operation Protective Edge and Operation Brother’s Keeper.





According to a recent investigative report by Amnesty International, Israel’s actions were tantamount to war crimes – a ‘festival of violence’ which began with the slaughter of nearly 2,500 Palestinians, including 500 children by the IDF, and which culminated weeks later in the unjustified destruction of buildings in the Gaza Strip between August 23-26 of 2014. Even though there were no civilian casualties during the final decimation of those buildings at the end of the conflict, the advocacy group report states that the ‘collective punishment’ was without justification and in clear violation of the international community.

Predictably, Israel has asserted that the buildings destroyed have been allegedly linked to Hamas and that Amnesty International has fallen prey to a conspiratorial plot crafted by Hamas. However, there has been no definitive proof offered by Israel to prove this claim.

The advocacy group’s report has added fuel to a growing international debate over Israel’s role during the decidedly vicious incursion, which killed nearly 2,200 Palestinians. As the conflict seemed to wind down over this past summer – the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bombed several large civilian buildings without any justifiable reason according to Amnesty International.

There’s seemingly been a wave of strange stories concerning Israel in the news cycle lately and Amnesty International’s report comes just as there has been several high profile incidents involving the country in recent weeks.

Is this a coincidence, or is there something else at play here?

Palestinian statehood is being recognized

According to a recent news release from Reuters, a Palestinian resolution will be presented by Wednesday to the 15-member U.N. Security Council designed to end Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory by November of 2016.



As we recently pointed out here at 21 WIRE,“Palestine’s drive for statehood has been gaining traction in the last few years, prompting many critics of Israel’s brutal bombing campaign over the summertime to strengthen those calls.”

While resolution talks and calls for a Palestinian statehood have cascaded throughout the world, we’ve seen a rash of reactionary violence said to have occurred between Israel and Hamas this past year. As the violent activity has seemingly reached a boiling point, the public should be wary of such activity while officials are pushing for a peaceful negotiation at this time.

Israel is inextricably linked to the creation of Hamas and quite frankly, given the country’s close association to the Islamic group, one should be very careful when examining this conflict at face value.

Back in late August, here at 21WIRE we took a closer look at the Israeli/Hamas lineage:

It has been stated that Hamas itself was in fact an Israeli creation, as a way to strategically weaken the PLO during the late 1980′s and some have associated the following quote with Charles Freeman a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia:



“Israel started Hamas. It was a project of Shin Bet which had a feeling they would use it to hem in the PLO.”



Additionally, we pointed out the possibility of Israeli double agents actively working within Hamas leadership.

Also, in that same report, we outlined the relationship between Turkey and Israel, which has seemingly played out to the benefit of known terror groups including ISIS:

“It should also be noted that Turkey was very supportive of its NATO colleagues that were seeking to attack Syria, a strategy which fit snugly with the policy planning of the US-Israel-GCC alliance. There seems to be a warmth between Turkey and Israel despite the often overplayed icy relationship.”

“In 2012, Turkey was said to have replaced Iran, as a Hamas’ top financial backer according to Israeli intelligence. Additionally, Turkey has had multiple defense contracting bids with Israel in recent years with the support of Turkish PM Erdogan.”

This begs the question: why would Israel be working with Turkey, a known supporter of Hamas, Israel’s ‘makeshift rocket’ foe?

Israel & ISIS

In September, it was reported by Haaretz that the Syria/Israeli border was under control by rebels, according to senior officials in Israel:

“The IDF estimates that around 1,500 to 2,000 armed rebels from three different groups are now across the border from Israel. These groups are the Free Syrian Army, the Nusra Front and a coalition of forces interested in setting up an Islamist state in Syria that the defense establishment refers to as the Muslim Brotherhood rebels. All three groups are well armed, possessing antitank missiles, artillery batteries and even tanks that were either captured from the Syrian Army or brought by deserters from the army.”

It appears that Israel has benefited from both the recent incursion with Hamas and the violent trek of ISIS, as we know the US-NATO-GCC alliance has backed the various coalition forces seeking to destabilize Syria.



Similarly, the death-theater going on in Iraq also reveals a larger role played by Israel. This was evident when it was reported that Israeli air strikes on Syria over the summer appeared to provide air cover for ISIS, as they moved between the Iraq and Syrian border.

The Washington post revealed in September, that weapons sent to the so-called ‘moderate’ rebels in Syria, ended up in the hands of ISIS according to Conflict Armament Research:

“The Islamic State has also captured “significant quantities” of U.S.-manufactured small arms and has employed them on the battlefield, researchers found.”

“The new research suggests they have also amassed arms after overrunning the moderate Syrian rebels being supplied by the United States and other allied nations.”

Last month according to Israel National News the Sunni-based al-Qaeda offshoot dubbed Ansar Bayt Al-Maqdis aka ‘Supporters of Jerusalem’ pledged its alliance to ISIS:

“Ansar Bayt Al-Maqdis pledged its allegiance to ISIS in Iraq and Syria, in a bid to boost recruitment and bolster its fight against the Egyptian army, according to analysts.”

Strangely, after the Supporters of Jerusalem Jihadist group in Egypt issued threats to Israel on January 20th, they claimed to have fired a rocket near the outskirts of an Israeli resort city. Around the same time rocket fire was said to have come from Salafist group in Gaza, Israel responded by striking several sites in the Gaza Strip.

Was Israel using the attacks as a pretext to bomb other targets in Gaza?

Terror events sometimes appear in tandem and a doubling effect occurs, often obscuring a persons ability to understand an event, clouding the core intent of such activity.

In a 21WIRE Special Report, just over a week ago, many terror connections between the West and their valued partners – have been confirmed:

“Israel’s strategic partnership with Turkey, a known supporter of Islamic foreign fighters in Syria (see details below), puts Israel squarely in the frame with US and GCC-backed Islamic insurgent fighting groups, including Islamic State terrorist (ISIS/ISL).

Among other sources, the Jerusalem Post reported one testimony from an ISIS fighter confirming that Turkey is funding the Islamic terrorist group. As a NATO member and close ally of the US, it is now widely understood how Turkey has played the pivotal role in helping foreign terrorist fighters and ISIS militants, in its wider effort to help destablize and exact the official US foreign policy of regime change in Damascus, Syria.”

Continuing the report outlined a specific connection between Israel and ISIS:

“Foreign Policy Magazine (CFR) recently published documents admitting how Israel is also treating ISIS terrorists for free in its hospitals, and providing medical care and other unidentified supplies to the insurgents.”

Back in September we noted that the US-Backed Syrian rebels had signed pact with ISIS, “Syrian rebels or FSA, along with ISIS jihadists, have signed a non-aggression pact in the suburbs of Syria’s capital Damascus. The cease-fire deal brokered between so-called ‘moderate’ rebels and the black-clad Sunnis of the Islamic State, have agreed that Assad is their “principal enemy.”

In the aftermath of Operation Brother’s Keeper this past summer, Israel claimed its largest land grab in 30 years, in an area known as Gevaot, as a part of a continued expropriation of land on occupied West Bank land, apparently since 2000. Officially, 988 acres are being designated as ‘state land’ for Israel.

‘War crime’: Amnesty Intl says IDF destroyed Gaza blocks as ‘collective punishment’

RT news



Human rights group Amnesty International accused Israel of the unjustified destruction of civilian buildings in Gaza during this summer’s conflict, branding it a symbolic form of “collective punishment.” Israel says the buildings served as Hamas bases.

The advocacy group has called for an international investigation of Israel’s behavior during the incursion, in which over 2,100 Palestinians and 60 Israelis died. In its latest report, Amnesty particularly noted that in the last – relatively bloodless – days of the war, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deliberately bombed several large civilian constructions without any apparent necessity.

“While no one was killed during the destruction of the four landmark civilian buildings in the Gaza Strip during the four last days of the war, the attacks are of great significance because they are examples of what appears to have been deliberate destruction and targeting of civilian buildings and property on a large scale, carried out without military necessity,” the group said, referring to three apartment blocks and one shopping center which were bombarded by Israeli shells between August 23-26, for allegedly harboring militants.

“The timing of these attacks and statements by Israeli officials suggest that these were instances of collective punishment, ones with long-term impact on the already perilous economic situation of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” Amnesty International said.

If Israel’s intent is proven, “it would be a grave breach of the prohibition against such attacks in international humanitarian law (the laws of war), including the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a state party, and therefore amount to a war crime.”

RT spoke with officials from both the Israeli government and Amnesty International, and asked them for their side of the story.

Israel has refuted the contents of the report, saying it is Hamas – Gaza’s leading political and military organization – which should be investigated, and that it purposefully concealed terrorist units in civilian buildings.

“We know for sure that those buildings were used for Hamas as military bases. Now, we have our sources. We cannot reveal our intelligence sources because we are compromising people there who face Hamas, who are trying to avoid the casualties within the civilian Palestinians,” Alon Melchior, deputy spokesman for Israel’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, told RT.

“Now, the question is why Hamas is using those civilian buildings as terrorist bases – that’s what Amnesty should ask, should investigate why Hamas is using the Palestinian people as human shields,”Melchior said.

Israel has rejected the testimonies of Gaza locals and Amnesty researchers.

“We know for a fact that all the evidence in the report is based on false evidence, no one can question those testimonies over there – no one can check their credibility. There is only one true evidence that we agree on: that no one was killed during those attacks that were checked,” said Melchior.

“We think that Amnesty are victims of Hamas propaganda,” the Israeli official claimed.

Amnesty International’s Philip Luther, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program, responded to the allegations live on RT, calling them “absolutely nonsense.”

“This report is based on meticulous research that has looked into these four airstrikes in particular…it didn’t just take out those buildings, of course, it destroyed hundreds of homes and livelihoods. And the reality is that the evidence that we’ve gathered and that we’ve presented is detailed – and it is based not just on the facts on the ground, but on statements by Israeli military authorities and others at the time of the conflict,” Luther told RT.

According to Luther, “scores of people were injured in neighboring buildings as a result of the attack”and had their homes wiped out, “and this for people who already have a precarious existence because of Israel’s longstanding military blockade on the Gaza Strip.”","2014-12-16 19:49:26","0","12.0","11.0","0.0","0.0","8.0","0.0","72.0","69.0","0.0","33.0","0.0","2.0","0","2132","95.95","74.74","26.66","5.63","32.30","27.95","74.25","42.82","6.61","1.92","0.00","1.22","0.05","0.00","0.66","4.69","8.86","15.62","6.05","2.91","4.36","0.61","10.04","3.66","2.25","1.03","2.16","1.97","5.44","1.78","3.66","0.52","2.53","0.09","7.18","0.14","0.23","0.05","0.14","7.65","2.53","1.88","0.47","1.59","0.89","1.17","2.39","1.45","0.61","0.28","0.75","0.33","0.47","0.00","0.00","9.57","2.91","0.80","5.25","0.47","0.47","4.08","5.07","0.19","14.02","0.98","8.49","4.60","3.19","0.42","0.23","0.61","0.75","0.70","0.52","0.00","0.38","0.38","0.05","0.00","15.99","3.33","5.16","0.75","0.00","0.14","0.00","1.03","2.86","1.78","0.75","0.19","10836","8.64","42.31372549019608","3302","2106","69","40.52","15.5","15.2","14.52","19.2","465","27.75","23.031908831908837","848","35.33","61","0.41","0","54","41","223","2","303","176","1","2","12","296","327","5","141","1","0","41","15","68","0","0","9","51","0","37","86","58","76","38","61","15","5","0","7"

21st Century Wire says…

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) masquerades as a ‘green’ arm of government, but the green they are really looking after is the color of corporate money…

One of the fundamental problems with centralized federal agencies like the EPA in the United States – is that they cannot rest when it comes to social control. They cannot stay idle. Why? Because in a full-blown fascist system, social control ultimately means economic control.

We reported earlier this week how the interests of large private energy corporations are steering teams of armed government ‘NATS’ thugs in California to crack down on independent homes generating their own solar power. They don’t want anyone off the grid, and will do whatever it takes to shut down anyone who is not feeding off the energy monopoly nipple.



Now we can see how the EPA, through its “Burn Wise” program, is targeting (and eventually harassing) any homes with wood burning stoves, or even BBQ’s – forcing them to “comply” (aka spend money) with new creative regulation. They claim it’s about cleaner air, but in reality they want everyone on the grid. Failure to comply means trouble.

Notice how this ‘environmental protection’ agency is obliged to turn a blind eye to the dangers and radiation leaks from the nuclear power industry, or how they ignore the dangers posed by toxic products from GMO and chemical giants like Monsanto Corp.

This is fascism in its purest form.

This is America…

Wood-burning stoves offer warmth and enhance off-grid living options during cold weather months, but the tried-and-true heating devices now are under attack by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The EPA has banned the production and sale of the types of stoves used by about 80 percent of those with such stoves. The regulations limit the amount of “airborne fine-particle matter” to 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air. The current EPA regulations allow for 15 micrograms in the same amount of air space.

Most of the wood stoves currently nestled inside cabins and homes from coast-to-coast don’t meet the new environmental standard. The EPA launched a “Burn Wise” website to help convince the public that the new regulations were needed.

Trading in an old stove for a newer stove isn’t allowed.

“Replacing an older stove with a cleaner-burning stove will not improve air quality if the older stove is reused somewhere else,” the website says. “For this reason, wood stove change out programs usually require older stoves to be destroyed and recycled as scrap metal, or rendered inoperable.”

In some areas of the country, local governments have gone further than the EPA and banned not just the sale of such stoves, but the usage of old stoves – and even the usage of fireplaces. That means that even if you still have a stove or a fireplace, you can’t burn it for fear of a fine. Puget Sound, Washington, is one such location.

Burn Wise is a partnership program associated with the EPA that is tasked with emphasizing the “importance of burning the right wood, the right way, in the right stove.” Information shared on the website operated by the federal government also states that both state and local agencies are pursuing ways to improve air quality that relate to wood-burning stoves.

The overall goal of the EPA Burn Wise program is to educate both local governmental agencies and citizens about the need for more “cleaner-burning” in the marketplace. Three of the most recent highlighted articles and webinars on the EPA Burn Wise website include details about a voluntary wood burning fireplace program, strategies for reducing residential wood some in state, tribal, and local communities, and a recording entitled, “Reducing Residential Wood Some: Is it Worth it?”

The EPA also has compiled a list of “approved” stoves.

According to a Washington Times review of the wood stove ban, the most dangerous aspect of the EPA proposed guidelines is the one-size-fits-all approach to the perceived problem. The same wood burning stove rules would apply to both heavily air-pollution laden major cities and far cleaner rural regions with extremely cooler temperatures. Families living in Alaska, or off the grid in wilderness area in the West, will most likely have extreme difficulty remaining in their cold, secluded homes if the EPA wood stove rules are approved.

The Times further said that wood burning stoves put less airborne fine-particle manner in the air than is present from secondhand some in a closed vehicle. When an individual smokes inside a car with the windows up, passengers are reportedly exposed to approximately 4,000 micrograms of soot per cubic meter.

Wrote the Times’ editorial board:

“Alaska’s 663,000 square miles is mostly forested, offering residents an abundant source of affordable firewood. When county officials floated a plan to regulate the burning of wood, residents were understandably inflamed. ‘Everybody wants clean air. We just have to make sure that we can also heat our homes,’ state Rep. Tammie Wilson told the Associated Press. Rather than fret over EPA’s computer-model-based warning about the dangers of inhaling soot from wood smoke, residents have more pressing concerns on their minds such as the immediate risk of freezing when the mercury plunges.”

Do you support the EPA’s wood stove ban?

Jay Dyer

21st Century Wire

The popular views attributed to Niccolo Machiavelli are not actually his own. Having not actually read him, the assumption by many is that he is known for advocating the notion that, ‘the ends justify the means’, and how rulers of state must have no scruples in achieving their ends.

While Machiavelli was a pragmatist in many respects, his positions place him firmly within the classical Western tradition of statecraft. As a Renaissance thinker, the desire to revive classical Greek and Roman learning was in fashion, and it is within that milieu that we must situate him. He does not advocate tyranny and abuse, and his insights on intrigue, subterfuge and conspiracy illuminate and rebuke many of the errors of our degenerate, effeminate gaggle of so-called leaders.

Machiavelli’s The Prince is well-known, but few are familiar with his other works, Art of War, and The Discourses, which contain a wealth of knowledge about the workings of the state and strategic designs, and it is to all of these we must look to gain deeper insight.

In The Discourses, Machiavelli describes the cycle through which most civil states go, from oligarchy to revolution to democracy to anarchy. Revolutionaries should take note, as the “revolution” they often seek to inflame often ends up bringing an even worse tyranny to follow. Revolutionaries, unfortunately, are not historically known for a keen understanding of human nature, allowing their ideals to override the real, and as a result, the Marxist state for example, finds itself frustrated and collapsing from within. Add to this the fact that most historical revolutionaries have been the tools of foreign and economic interests, and one begins to see why the pattern persists. We can also see something akin to the future ideas of Oswald Spengler, where patterns and cycles are crucial, timeless phenomenon for historical analysis.

Machiavelli writes of the cycle of the state in The Discourses on Livy, Book I:

“Having proposed to myself to treat of the kind of government established at Rome, and of the events that led to its perfection, I must at the beginning observe that some of the writers on politics distinguished three kinds of government, viz. the monarchical, the aristocratic, and the democratic; and maintain that the legislators of a people must choose from these three the one that seems to them most suitable. Other authors, wiser according to the opinion of many, count six kinds of governments, three of which are very bad, and three good in themselves, but so liable to be corrupted that they become absolutely bad. The three good ones are those which we have just named; the three bad ones result from the degradation of the other three, and each of them resembles its corresponding original, so that the transition from the one to the other is very easy. Thus monarchy becomes tyranny; aristocracy degenerates into oligarchy; and the popular government lapses readily into licentiousness. So that a legislator who gives to a state which he founds, either of these three forms of government, constitutes it but for a brief time; for no precautions can prevent either one of the three that are reputed good, from degenerating into its opposite kind; so great are in these the attractions and resemblances between the good and the evil.”

We see here a realistic perspective inherited from the ancients.

All governments are liable to corruption and tyranny, although some more than others…



The pattern for degeneration is monarchy becoming a tyranny, aristocracy becoming and oligarchy, and democracy becoming anarchy. This pattern also hearkens to Aristotle, who made a similar list in his work, Politics.

History has seen many states, but all fall into these same basic forms. While some governments are certainly better in form than others, nothing can halt a corrupt, degenerate elite and populace from collapsing when moral degeneracy and corruption reign. However, there is an important realist corrective to modernity and progressive thinking here that cannot be passed over, which is that the reason for the collapse of any state is not the form of government itself, but the rise of corruption in men’s hearts.

Modern liberalism, which is still the norm among most, in praxis at least, assumes that the solution to problems arises from changes in law and government. If we can only change our political leaders and get a new crop in! If we can only change the law to get Proposition 666 passed, why then we would have our freedom and progress! Nothing could be further from the truth, as the problem ultimately lies not in externals, but in man’s own heart. Corruption is rooted in, and proceeds from, individuals and their decisions, not from external forms and systems. Classical liberalism and modern liberalism are rooted in the metaphysical error of attributing the location of evil in some institution, and not in man’s own decisions.

In this regard, Machiavelli is a pessimist with respect to human nature. While the Renaissance is often lauded for its high view of human nature adopted from the Greeks, Machiavelli does not see the populace as able to govern themselves. Heavily influenced by St. Augustine, Niccolo’s negative appraisal of human nature places him in a non-democratic tradition of classical republicanism.

While critical of monarchy due to its liability to fall into tyranny through its hereditary descendants, it is certainly not the worst form of government, which is democracy. Early seeds of the U.S. Constitution can also be seen here, as Machiavelli is one of the most famous proponents of republicanism of the Italian tradition, and Madison and Hamilton had clearly read and been influenced by the Florentine thinker, as The Federalist Papers appear to show. Elucidating the cycle of collapse, Machiavelli comments, with hints of the nascent social contract theory:

“Chance has given birth to these different kinds of governments amongst men; for at the beginning of the world the inhabitants were few in number, and lived for a time dispersed, like beasts. As the human race increased, the necessity for uniting themselves for defence made itself felt; the better to attain this object, they chose the strongest and most courageous from amongst themselves and placed him at their head, promising to obey him. Thence they began to know the good and the honest, and to distinguish them from the bad and vicious; for seeing a man injure his benefactor aroused at once two sentiments in every heart, hatred against the ingrate and love for the benefactor. They blamed the first, and on the contrary honored those the more who showed themselves grateful, for each felt that he in turn might be subject to a like wrong; and to prevent similar evils, they set to work to make laws, and to institute punishments for those who contravened them. Such was the origin of justice. This caused them, when they had afterwards to choose a prince, neither to look to the strongest nor bravest, but to the wisest and most just. But when they began to make sovereignty hereditary and non-elective, the children quickly degenerated from their fathers; and, so far from trying to equal their virtues, they considered that a prince had nothing else to do than to excel all the rest in luxury, indulgence, and every other variety of pleasure. The prince consequently soon drew upon himself the general hatred. An object of hatred, he naturally felt fear; fear in turn dictated to him precautions and wrongs, and thus tyranny quickly developed itself. Such were the beginning and causes of disorders, conspiracies, and plots against the sovereigns, set on foot, not by the feeble and timid, but by those citizens who, surpassing the others in grandeur of soul, in wealth, and in courage, could not submit to the outrages and excesses of their princes.

Under such powerful leaders the masses armed themselves against the tyrant, and, after having rid themselves of him, submitted to these chiefs as their liberators. These, abhorring the very name of prince, constituted themselves a new government; and at first, bearing in mind the past tyranny, they governed in strict accordance with the laws which they had established themselves; preferring public interests to their own, and to administer and protect with greatest care both public and private affairs. The children succeeded their fathers, and ignorant of the changes of fortune, having never experienced its reverses, and indisposed to remain content with this civil equality, they in turn gave themselves up to cupidity, ambition, libertinage, and violence, and soon caused the aristocratic government to degenerate into an oligarchic tyranny, regardless of all civil rights. They soon, however, experienced the same fate as the first tyrant; the people, disgusted with their government, placed themselves at the command of whoever was willing to attack them, and this disposition soon produced an avenger, who was sufficiently well seconded to destroy them.

The memory of the prince and the wrongs committed by him being still fresh in their minds, and having overthrown the oligarchy, the people were not willing to return to the government of a prince. A popular government was therefore resolved upon, and it was so organized that the authority should not again fall into the hands of a prince or a small number of nobles. And as all governments are at first looked up to with some degree of reverence, the popular state also maintained itself for a time, but which was never of long duration, and lasted generally only about as long as the generation that had established it; for it soon ran into that kind of license which inflicts injury upon public as well as private interests. Each individual only consulted his own passions, and a thousand acts of injustice were daily committed, so that, constrained by necessity, or directed by the counsels of some good man, or for the purpose of escaping from this anarchy, they returned anew to the government of a prince, and from this they generally lapsed again into anarchy, step by step, in the same manner and from the same causes as we have indicated. Such is the circle which all republics are destined to run through.”

The cycle of collapse for the republic is similar to that of other forms of government, but is all the more relevant for our present day. Since the French Revolution, the majority of the world’s states operate under the auspices of being “republics,” but there is an important distinction to be made that Machiavelli could have never foreseen: a highly sophisticated technocratic, global Shadow Government. In fact, it is Machiavellian realism that leads one to easily understand that our world is governed by international shadow entities that utilize nation states as fronts.

In the 21st century, we are far beyond the era of the outdated nation-state going to war against rival nation-state – ours is the era of global oligarchical cartels in competition, with the Anglo-American establishment currently at the top. Cartels and empires have always existed, but the world has never seen a global secret technocratic shadow government, and in that respect, we are in a unique situation.

The issues of corruption and degeneracy, are not new, but even more rampant than anything in Machiavelli’s day, precisely because there are newer, more sophisticated means of technological tyranny and evil than in any previous age. We can see from this classical perspective that conspiracies and espionage are not surprising – they are synonymous with perennial statecraft.

On conspiracies, Machiavelli explains in The Prince:

“But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a conspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.

And, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and thus cannot hope for any escape….

For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear everything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have.”

Here Niccolo expounds the heart of conspiracy from the perspective of the ruler. Conspiracy need only be feared when the ruler is hated as a result of his tyranny or sadistic cruelty. Fear is a crucial key in the arsenal of the state, but fear must be tempered by virtue and security, and the imbalance in either direction leads to sedition from others and conspiracies become successful. For the ruler, conspiracy the maintenance of goodwill among subjects is obtained through the management of public perception and genuine goodwill by the ruler. It is not a license for doing anything and everything to maintain power, as many wrongly accuse Machiavelli, but as a balance of mercy and severity, and that power is maintained by fear. Contrary to popular opinion, Machiavelli firmly rebukes the notion of immorality and devious designs, opting instead for an approach of balance, with the ruler’s reputation standing on its own through virtue. Any other imbalance leads the ruler to fall prey to his own vices and overthrown by his own self-destructive folly.

Roman Catholicism through St. Augustine and classical virtue ethics also factor into Machiavelli’s tempering of the prince as it did for medieval warfare as a whole. This comes to the fore in his lesser known, Art of War, that was the first treatise on modern warfare that would revolutionize the field. For ancient and medieval leaders, the state, espionage, warfare and its deceptions, and the game of politics were considered “arts” that could only be mastered through study and practice. Systematizing everything from military camps, music, flags and colors, size and ranks, Machiavelli revolutionized the medieval army to become a hierarchical standard that would be the norm for future Europe. On another level, it also contains interesting aspects relating to psychological warfare, espionage and deception that are instructive for us in our day that help to grasp the level of deception we live under. The ancient arts of statecraft and deception are not forgotten, they have been perfected and through a high-tech overlay – are beyond anything Niccolo could have imagined in his day.

He writes:

“Birds or dust have often discovered the enemy, for where the enemy comes to meet you, he will always raise a great dust which will point out his coming to you. Thus often a Captain when he sees in a place whence he ought to pass, pigeons taking off and other birds flying about freely, circling and not setting, has recognized this to be the place of any enemy ambush, and knowing this has sent his forces forward, saving himself and injuring the enemy. As to the second case, being drawn into it ((which our men call being drawn into a trap)) you ought to look out not to believe readily those things that appear to be less reasonable than they should be: as would be (the case) if an enemy places some booty before you, you would believe that it to be (an act of) love, but would conceal deceit inside it.”

Book VI is the best section for these machinations, and in it we see the following perennial tactics:

Consult a rising enemy or possible sedition to give the impression of heeding his ideas and win him by feigned interest

Send wise men into the enemy’s camp as fake attendants of a fake dignitary to assess the enemy

Use false defectors to be spies in the enemy’s camp

Conversely, capture the enemy’s commanders to gain intelligence on the opponent

If you have suspected spies in your camp, disseminate false information to various parties to see how the enemy reacts to which

Sacrifice a town or some pawns as a gambit to give the enemy a false sense of security

Utilize religious and superstitious omens as far as your soldiers revere them or invent them

Disguise your soldiers as the enemy

Give the appearance of retreat to lead the enemy into a trap

Leave an open encampment for the enemy with fresh, albeit poisoned, supplies

Never cause an enemy to despair, since he will only fight more desperately and possibly defeat you

Use a subterfuge of a fake illness in your camp that leads the enemy to think you are weak

Communicate among your generals and men with secret ciphers and codes the enemy cannot decode

Use propaganda and stories to create a boost of morale among your men

Many more could be listed, but these are the most interesting and in our day, these tricks are used by the elite, not on foreign powers primarily, but as the bases for mass deception, with a massive surveillance state, poisoned food and water, false media reports, and countless other ruses. One might think from this list Machiavelli is immoral and devious, but for him, these are necessary facts of war with the enemy, not on the populace itself. The goal of war is not virtue for him, but simply to win at all costs. Yet winning at all costs does not mean being sadistic or cruel or a brute, it means learning the art of war to be a just ruler and by so doing, win the admiration of your soldiers and homeland. Far from corruption, Machiavelli castigated the corrupt leaders of his day and it serves as an apt warning to ours. Corruption and effeminate degeneracy among the elite does not lead to power, it leads to the loss of power. As far as one concedes to evil and vice in his own heart, especially the ruler, to that degree does he lose his power and become subservient to the passions.

He concludes:

“But let us turn to the Italians, who, because they have not wise Princes, have not produced any good army; and because they did not have the necessity that the Spaniards had, have not undertaken it by themselves, so that they remain the shame of the world. And the people are not to blame, but their Princes are, who have been castigated, and by their ignorance have received a just punishment, ignominiously losing the State, (and) without any show of virtu….

Our Italian Princes, before they tasted the blows of the ultramontane wars, believed it was enough for them to know what was written, think of a cautious reply, write a beautiful letter, show wit and promptness in his sayings and in his words, know how to weave a deception, ornament himself with gems and gold, sleep and eat with greater splendor than others, keep many lascivious persons around, conduct himself avariciously and haughtily toward his subjects, become rotten with idleness, hand out military ranks at his will, express contempt for anyone who may have demonstrated any praiseworthy manner, want their words should be the responses of oracles; nor were these little men aware that they were preparing themselves to be the prey of anyone who assaulted them.”

SACKED? CDC head Tom Frieden may not last to end of week (Photo: Politico)

Another Ebola bombshell dropped today…

CDC spokesman Tom Frieden will likely be forced to fall on his sword after it’s been revealed that his federal agency gave the ‘OK’ to the latest Ebola patient, a Dallas nurse named Amber Vinson – the same nurse who treated America’s first Ebola fatality, Thomas Duncan.

Are the CDC trying to spread Ebola across the US?

It’s not likely that Frieden will be able to withstand the political pressure which is about to come down on his office.

Media pundits and talk radio hosts are already smelling blood, so expect a resignation announcement soon…



Anna Horowitz

Huff Post

A Dallas nurse who took a commercial flight from Cleveland hours before reporting symptoms of Ebola says that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention told her it was okay to fly.

Amber Vinson helped treat Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who died in Dallas of the Ebola virus earlier this month. On Wednesday, the CDC announced that she had contracted the virus as well. The CDC also revealed that she had taken a flight to Dallas on Monday, though it said that it was extremely unlikely that any other passengers were exposed.

Vinson told CBS Dallas Fort Worth that she was feeling ill before boarding her flight. She had a low grade fever, but she said that officials told her it was okay to get on the plane. Vinson told CBS that she called the CDC several times with concerns.

Ebola is only contagious when a patient is symptomatic. Vinson’s 99.5 F fever wasn’t high enough to be considered a symptom.

The CDC confirmed to FOX 4 News that they gave Vinson the green light to fly. “Vinson was not told that she could not fly,” a government spokesperson told NBC News.

Vinson’s comments contradict remarks made earlier today by CDC Director Tom Freiden, who said that she never should have gotten on the plane.

After Vinson reported symptoms of Ebola on Tuesday, she was placed in isolation. On Wednesday, she was transported to Emory Hospital in Atlanta, where she will continue to receive treatment. She is in stable condition…

21st Century Wire says…

It was only a question of time before we would begin to see scenes like this – America’s latest Terrordrome…

This passenger (see photo below) in the departing terminal at Dulles International Airport has gone to extra lengths to keep safe from Ebola.



Photo Source: The Daily Caller

As 21WIRE has reported this week, Ebola virus should be taken seriously, but the viral fear, should not. The pathogen is now on the radar of health officials worldwide and screening is already taking place at major air travel hubs globally, but there is is perfect solution to stop it spreading.

Before you join the Ebola frenzy, however, consider a few key points first…

More than any other nation, Americans are well known for exhibitions of extreme over-reaction to perceived threats, while often ignoring genuine ones. Fear of Ebola has propelled public fear frenzy into hyper-drive.

Incredibly (or not), the majority of Americans are now begging the government for increased regulations – and greater restriction on personal travel and movement. Just like in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 with Patriot Act 1 & II, this may eventually lead to certain politicians and members of the public demanding less rights. Downtrend reports this week:

“The numbers show that a total of two-thirds of those polled, 67 percent, want to restrict entry to the US from countries who are currently battling Ebola. Beyond that, 91 percent of people want to see more serious screening procedures implemented in our nation’s airports. Simply having temperature scans at five airports is not going far enough. These numbers include nearly 60 percent of self-identified Democrats who support flight restrictions.”

Another recent Reuters poll is showing that 45% of Americans now want to avoid international air travel.

Clearly, the US corporate media are fueling this mass paranoia and hypochondria, and rating (and advertising revenues) are up as the public crave new information and updates. The award for politicized sensationalism goes to the Right-wing US media outlets who have managed to bundle the Ebola fear frenzy together with this past summer’s ‘secure our border’ crisis, blaming President Obama’s ‘lack of leadership’ for the spread of the outbreak. Granted, the Democratic White House has a number of scandals already on its plate, but to blame Obama for not ‘shutting it down’ over an Ebola threat which is still small compared to other infectious diseases taking many thousands of lives in the US annually – is as careless as it is insane.

This week, Republican Senate nominee Scott Brown (R-NH) has ranted that Obama’s border policies are so lax that ISIS terrorists who have intentionally infected themselves with Ebola can enter The Homeland, accusing his opponents on this issue as being “naive”. It’s funny how these same politicians will call the alternative media conspiracy theorists, when it’s the mainstream that seem to have a monopoly on wild conjecture and conspiracy theories now.

Brown’s childish conspiracy theory shouldn’t deserve an official rebuttal, yet, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson responded to the wild Ebola-ISIS connection, stating, “We’ve seen no specific credible intelligence that (ISIS) is attempting to use any sort of disease or virus to attack our Homeland”.

So lunatic ravings from men like Scott Brown, and FOX News headlines like, “Time to lock it down”, has little to do with safety and more to do with cheap pre-midterm electioneering to bring home a Republican majority in the US Senate.

And we’re fast learning that idiocy has no limits: Republican Congressmen, and media ‘Experts’ like CNN’s Peter King et all, who are all calling for ‘travel bans’ to and from West Africa’s Ebola countries seem to have no clue that there are already no direct flights between the U.S. and Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone.

It’s worth noting also, that a cheap Haz-mat suit couldn’t keep you dry when it rains, let alone stop a Bio-safety Level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen, which is what Ebola is…

It Begins: HazMat-Wearing Passenger Spotted At Airport

.

Zero Hedge

Last week we hinted at what was to come as Ebola fears spread across America. Today, we get confirmation.

As The Daily Caller reports, one passenger at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C. is apparently not taking any chances. A female passenger dressed in a hazmat suit – complete with a full body gown, mask and gloves – was spotted Wednesday waiting for a flight at the airport.

We particularly liked the JCPenney bag – maybe that’s a new business line for the bankrupt retailer…

On a side note, try Halloween stores if you need a Haz-Mat suit in a hurry…

Patrick Henningsen

21st Century Wire

Did Ebola really jump from African Fruit Bats to humans in 1976, or has this deadly pathogen emerged from a high-level bioweapons lab?

The Ebola Airline Frenzy hit fever pitch this week in the US. A select few lunatics in the corporate media government are saying some crazy things, too. For the first time ever, establishment conspiracy theorists are out-doing the blogosphere.

Leading the charge is Capt. Al Shimkus, a retired Professor of National Security Affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, who believes ISIS terrorists will use “human carriers” by intentionally infecting themselves in West Africa, before transporting the deadly virus via passenger airliner. That’s a lot of air miles for ISIS. Other wild wayward politicians, like former US Senator Scott Brown, are saying it too. Just imagine, a plot so outlandish that even Hollywood would have to politely pass on it.

But while highly-paid official media and military conspiracy theorists try to capitalize on the Ebola panic, the real truth is being obscured by their highly ornate, fear-driven PR smokescreen.

Before we make up our mind on the question of a genetically weaponized Ebola, let’s look at some facts, some cover-ups, as well as better understand historically how governments have always had a fatal attraction to a variety of deadly bioweapons…



In addition to a number international theories and analysis pointing to Ebola as a bioweapon, most Americans are completely unaware that the US is set to open one of the world’s largest bioweapons labs in 2015 – not in the US, but in the former Soviet satellite state of Kazakhstan. To top it all off, it’s built on an active seismic zone.

The new off-shore clandestine facility appears to fall under the Pentagon’s previously low-profiled, Orwellian titled, ‘US Defense Threat Reduction Agency’. A colorful former Soviet bioweaons scientist who is now affiliated with CIA, Dr Ken Alibek, also seems to be somehow involved with the the new US lab.

In their article, “Why The U.S. Is Building A High-Tech Bubonic Plague Lab In Kazakhstan?”, Vice Magazine’s Alex Pasternack seems to think other forces are at play:

“Today, biologists who worked in the former Soviet Union—like those who responded to a case of the plague across the border in Kyrgyzstan this week—are likely to brush Alibek’s fears aside. But they’ll also tell you that the fall of the Soviet Union devastated their profession, leaving some once prominent scientists in places like Almaty scrambling for new work.”

“That sense of desperation, underlined by Alibek’s defection to the US, has helped pump hundreds of millions of dollars into a Pentagon program to secure not just nuclear materials but chemical and biological ones, in a process by which Washington became, in essence, their highest bidder.”

“When it opens in September 2015, the $102-million project laboratory is meant to serve as a Central Asian way station for a global war on dangerous disease. And as a project under that Pentagon program, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the lab will be built, and some of its early operation funded, by American taxpayers.”

Despite the serious lack of any hard evidence that bioweapons were stolen and then sold on the international terrorist black market during the early 1990s, it hasn’t stopped US Pentagon officials from insisting that rogue scientists and rogue terrorists have them and are preparing to use them:

“You cannot erase this knowledge from someone’s mind,” said Lt. Col. Charles Carlton, director of the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency office in Kazakhstan. The threat of scientists going rogue, he said, is “a serious concern.” “We’re doing our best to employ these people. Our hope is that through gainful employment they won’t be drawn down other avenues.”

Governments Love Bioweapons

Is Ebola a US-developed bioweapon – as many have speculated already? US patent records show that an Ebola virus strain is held with the CDC. Check it out here.



Government and military fascination (and machinations) with biological weapons, or “bioweapons”, dates back to as early as 1,50­0 B.C. when the Hittites of Asia Minor sent plague victims into their adversaries’ lands. Later, the Romans used biological warfare on many occasions, including putting dead horses into an enemy’s water supply, and poisoning their enemy’s water supply with an intestinal typhoid bacteria.

The Crusades also saw both bio and chemical weapons deployed against the Arabs.

Fast forward to the 20th century and we can see industrial development and military deployment of chemical and biological weapons like Anthrax – used by the Japanese against the Chinese, but also ready to be used by the British – against Germany. As it turns out, it is the British who really pioneered the use of live virus bioweapons, with many war historians believing they used Smallpox as a biological warfare agent in the French and Indian Wars (1754-1763), and the American Revolutionary War (1775-1778).

Aside from classified US bioweapons facilities at Fort Detrick, Maryland and Plum Island in New York, other top bioweapons labs include Porton Down in England, Great Britian, and in South Africa at Roodeplaat Research Laboratories, home of the notorious and deadly Project Coast.

Evidence suggests that the infamous US Anthrax Attacks of 2001 were the result of an engineered bioweapon being taken out of the lab and used against the public. Journalists like Wall Street Journal’s Edward Jay Epstein reported how the FBI ‘disproved its main theory’ – about how the spores were weaponized (obscuring the fact that they were weaponized in a US military lab), but none of the mainstream pundits dare dig-up the story of award-winning Army biologist Bruce Ivins, who appeared to be conveniently suicided in 2008 before being charged with the alleged anthrax mailings. His death seemed to mirror another high profile scientist, Dr. David Kelly (photo, left), who was also ‘suicided’ before being able to testify in front of a public hearing on, among other things, the missing Iraqi WMD’s.

Other popular bioweapons throughout history include Dead bodies, Tuberculosis, Bubonic Plague, Cholera, Tularemia (rabbit fever) and Botulinum Toxins, along with bioweapons still being researched – like Chimera Viruses. Ebola could easily be added to that list, if hasn’t been already.

If you’ve been following this subject of vaccines , then you will know that the truly mad visions and projects are those of the elite and the think tank-funded ‘futurists’. Melissa Melton from Truthstream Media explains:

“Questions like what happens if a mosquito bites an infected person, then flies off and bites someone else. Can Ebola spread then? Bill Gates certainly seemed to think so when he was funding research into mosquitoes as vaccine deployment systems.”

Conversely, concerns that the virus could be used by as biologica weaponl, are warranted, considering the depth and pedigree of bioweapons programs, particularly those ‘top secret’ military lab facilities in, or run by the US, which the US is still very reluctant to disclose.



Is the African Ebola the spill-over, either accidentally or intentionally, into Europe and the US – from a bioweapons lab?

US Links to Bio-Warfare Labs in Ebola Zone: Scholar

.

RIA Novosti

NEW YORK – The United States may be behind the deadly Ebola outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone, two West African countries known to host American biological warfare laboratories, a University of Illinois College of Law scholar told RIA Novosti on Wednesday.

“US government agencies have a long history of carrying out allegedly defensive biological warfare research at labs in Liberia and Sierra Leone. This includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is now the point agency for managing the Ebola spill-over into the US,” Prof. Francis Boyle said.

“Why has the Obama administration dispatched troops to Liberia when they have no training to provide medical treatment to dying Africans?

How did Zaire/Ebola get to West Africa from about 3,500km away from where it was first identified in 1976?”

The US has pledged as many as 4,000 troops to the region. Thomas Duncan, 42, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US, died on Wednesday. He caught the virus in his native Liberia and traveled to see relatives in the US.

“Why is the CDC not better-prepared for this emergency after the US government spent about $70 billion since the anthrax attacks of October 2001 to prepare for this exact contingency?” Boyle said…

By Anngwyn St. Just

Given that plagues have been known to alter the course of history, this recent Ebola epidemic deserves our studied attention.

Epidemics qualify as one of the “Greater Forces” that have the potential to alter our world as we know it and this has been true throughout human history. Plagues often serve as catalysts for major social, political and economic upheavals.



ROMAN PLAGUE: The ‘Antonine Plague’ that killed these people is thought to have been smallpox (Image Source: Matica)

To date, the four deadliest epidemics include; Black Death outbreaks from 1347-1351, during which bubonic plague and its airborne pneumonic offspring decimated some 3/5 of the European inhabitants. We now know that this is a flea borne plague, which kills about 2/3 of its victims within four days, recognized at least as far back as the Roman Empire and the Plague of Justinian in 541 A.D. This painful scourge, which reportedly left some 25 million dead, decimated nearly half the population of Constantinople, now modern Istanbul. An estimated 5,000 citizens died every day.

In modern times, bubonic/pneumonic plague was utilized by the Japanese as one of the several bio-weapons employed by their Imperial Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1941). They introduced infected fleas into Chinese territory, ostensibly in the interest of conquest and colonization.

In 1918-1919 the Spanish Flu actually killed more people than World War I and infected nearly a third of the global population. The causes of this outbreak remain highly controversial, especially among those who maintain that various influenza and other government-promoted vaccines may have actually served to weaken the immune systems of both the military and civilians; collectively stressed populations during and after World War I.

Beginning in the late 20th century, around 60 million unfortunates have been infected by HIV/Aids, since it was first reported in 1981; and another 30 million are living with this as a chronic condition. (Daniel Jennings, Survivalbackpack.com, September, 2014).

During my Rolfing training in Berkeley, in the late seventies, I was sleep walking, as usual, until it was disclosed to me that Nick Rock, a young actor from New York and my genial gay roommate, was diagnosed as our country’s first AIDs patient. Within our local bodywork community, it had been believed that Nick had “cat scratch fever” and we were naturally concerned that after showing some serious symptoms, he was not showing any improvement. Inexplicably, this previously healthy and physically fit young man, rapidly declined and died. Only many years later, after randomly selecting Randy Shilt’s, And the Band Played On: Politics, People and the Aids Epidemic, (1987) in a San Francisco bookstore while waiting to meet my husband for a date night dinner, did I finally realize the truth about my friend and colleague’s untimely demise.

And then there was Smallpox, which raged through the Antonin Plague 165-180 A.D., killing 5 million people, including two emperors, (regime change) and may have greatly weakened the late Roman Empire; and promoted the spread of Christianity by diminishing faith in their pagan deities. Smallpox, which also has a hemorrhagic variety, is thought to have emerged within the human population as early as 10,000 B.C. Scars from its characteristic pustular rash have been documented on the mummy of Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses V; and this disease was known in China in 1122 B.C. Smallpox killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans toward the end of the 18th century, and earlier, including five reigning monarchs, (more regime change), and blinded countless others.

The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that smallpox was responsible for 300-500 million fatalities during the 20th century. Together with other European diseases, smallpox devastated many indigenous populations following the discovery of the New World. It is widely believed to have been employed as a major bio-weapon in genocidal attempts at population control, and to eradicate indigenous peoples throughout North, Central and South America as well. It was probably employed in Australia and New Zealand also, since this is what colonizing white people seem to believe is their mission. (Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs and Steel, PBS.org).

While smallpox was eradicated in 1979, varicella continues to live on in laboratories, as do all of the above mentioned organisms; as sources for actual and potential bioweapons. Here, one might bear in mind the fact that at the close of World War II, the Third Reich’s top virologists and bioweapons specialists for racially and genetically targeted diseases for population control and eugenics, (so-called science-based genocide), were sent to U.S. and British laboratories under Project Paperclip. The Pentagon has been interested in filoviruses with high mortality rates since the seventies and one wonders.

And now, in Africa, there is Ebola, again. While there have been 19 known outbreaks of Ebola in relatively isolated rural villages, this one is different, having reached major urban centers in West Africa where it has not been previously known. Moreover, there are concerns that the current version of this highly contagious, often lethal virus, may be airborne via respiratory routes, hitch a ride onto international flights, cross borders, and sail throughout the Mediterranean with the potential to become a global pandemic. The strain causing this recent outbreak is of a lineage known as Ebola Zaire, so named as it emerged in 1976 in Zaire, somewhere near the Ebola River, in what is now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.

This Ebola virus belongs to the family Filoviridae, order Mononega virales. One of the first photos taken in October, 1976 reveal this filovirus as an elongated, tubular, wormlike particle with a characteristic “shepherd’s crook”. Ebola virus attacks and disables the immune system of its host. Early symptoms resemble influenza, including headache, sore throat, cough, fever, muscle pain and weakness. As the disease progresses, patients suffer vomiting, diarrhea, and severe dehydration. The final stages are marked by visceral liquidation; the vascular system dissolves resulting in internal hemorrhages and bleeding from every orifice, evoking passages from Edgar Allen Poe’s Gothic fiction classic …… “No pestilence had ever been so fatal or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal…. the redness and the horror”. (The Masque of the Red Death, 1842).

The pandemic possibilities of this current epidemic first came to my attention in the sci-fi medical disaster film “Outbreak” released in March 1995. As the story unfolds, a fictional devastating, Ebola-like virus called Motaba appears in Zaire (Congo) and then in Smalltown USA. Film critic, the late Roger Ebert, called it “One of the great scare stories of our time. …the notion that deep within uncharted rain forests, deadly diseases are lurking and if they ever escape their jungle homes and enter the human bloodstream, there will be a new plague the likes of which we have never seen.” (Chicago Sun Times, 1995). Other critics dismissed this film’s warning premise as “an absolute hoot”. (Rita Kempley, Washington Post, March 10, 1995).

Still dozing within the pervasive fog of our mainstream media matrix, I failed to notice or pay attention to the salient fact that the pathogen named in the film was ‘Motaba’. As this blog plot thickens, we now know that reversed, this spells Abatom, the name of a small, privately owned, pandemic research “think tank” in Jericho, Ibadan, Nigeria; located directly in the middle and between places where past Ebola outbreaks have occurred and where this new contagion is now taking place. (J.C. Collins, August 2, 2014), (www.abatom.com).

Five months later, still in 1995, along the theme of pandemic contagion, Richard Preston’s The Hot Zone, appeared on the New York Times bestseller list; a genuine page turner which I read on a flight to Munich, which was coincidently dealing with an Ebola related Marburg hemorrhagic virus in laboratory primates. German scientists subsequently euthanized all of their lab monkeys and any potential health threat to humans was declared to be over. Still asleep and blissfully unaware throughout my fast paced reading of this so called medical fiction, I also failed to notice that the author had made a point of expressing gratitude for his research grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. This seemingly unimportant acknowledgement now leads us even deeper into more than one dark labyrinth of complexes within some interrelated rabbit holes of undetermined depth.

Industrialist Alfred P. Sloan, as head of General Motors, was a Nazi collaborator, and ardent admirer of Hitler. Sloan’s hatred of blacks was almost as intense as his hatred of Jews. He had a close connection with the eugenics movement which eventually became the Human Genome Project. The Sloan Foundation, together with the Rockefeller nexus, held a long standing interest in population reduction, including their involvement with the introduction of mysterious new vaccines together with the World Health Organization, which has a stated policy of population reduction, as clearly set forth in Agenda 21. (truthaboutagenda21.com).

This dubious enterprise led to a massive vaccine initiative to vaccinate against relatively rare tetanus in The Philippines, Nicaragua, and Mexico. These vaccine vials, distributed by the WHO, were found to contain hCG, which when combined with tetanus toxoid carrier, stimulated formation of antibodies against human chorionic gonadotropin, rendering women incapable of maintaining a pregnancy and potentially inducing a covert, involuntary abortion. Population control under the cover of health care. (ethiofreedom.com).

This seemingly altruistic Sloan Foundation also funded the Community Blood Council of Greater New York, Inc., which allowed more than 10,000 hemophiliacs and countless others to become fatally infected with HIV/Aids.

Moreover, The Sloan Foundation held 24,000-53,000 shares issued by Merck and Co., whose president George W. Merck was director of America’s biological weapons industry and whose Hepatitis C and polio vaccines have been suspected of transmitting AIDs; and who knows what else. (Population Control:” Aids/Ebola and other man-made diseases”, S.R. Shearer, July 29, 2014). Dr. Leonard Horowitz’s seminal work, Aids and Ebola: Nature, Accident or Intentional, contends that both Ebola and Aids were bio-engineered by scientists working for the CIA.

Ebola’s current outbreak apparently began in Guinea in December 2013 along with speculation that this disease was being spread by fruit bats and “bush meat” and then traveled to densely populated urban areas along with the country’s highly mobile population. This explanation was almost immediately met with suspicion in view of vaccine trials known to be going on in West Africa at that time. According to Dr. Cecil Broderick, multiple reports narrate U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) funded ebola virus research on humans just weeks before the present outbreak. Reports continue that the DOD awarded a contract worth 140 million dollars to Tekmira, a Canadian pharmaceutical firm to conduct research which involved injecting and infusing healthy humans with the deadly ebola virus beginning in January 2014, (liberianobserver.com).

Investigative reporter Jon Rappaport notes that for the last several years Tulane University researchers have been active in West African areas where Ebola has broken out in 2014, together with the U.S. Army Medical Research of Infectious Diseases center, well known as a center for bio-warfare studies at Fort Detrick, Maryland. This raises questions as to whether there has been a “research accident”, or yet another money making scheme launched by the military/industrial/pharmaceutical complex and maybe neither or both.

The formerly French, now Republic of Guinea, sometimes called Guinea-Conakry, not to be confused with Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, or Papua New Guinea, achieved independence in 1958. This West African nation is located on the Atlantic coast, and shares borders with Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, Mali, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone. Predominantly Islamic, Guinea’s official language is French and the country holds rich deposits of gold, as well as bauxite and diamonds. In recent years, Guinea has been the focus of international human rights concerns relating to torture, the abuse of women and children, female genital mutilation, and has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. Poverty is widespread, and there is a lack of clean water and sanitation. Malnutrition is endemic as is malaria and a host of other respiratory, parasitic, waterborne and sexually transmitted diseases. The majority of the rural population is illiterate with little access to health education or care. (BBC: 03/28/2014).

Many residents believe that their government and outsiders cannot be trusted. Rural villagers are hostile to health-care workers who they believe are white people and foreigners spreading Ebola for genocidal purposes. Just recently an angry mob set upon a team of health educators and journalists with rocks, clubs and machetes and tossed their bodies into the village latrine. This attack occurred in an area where the workers had arrived in a Red Cross vehicle and were spraying disinfectant around a market place area, and the locals thought that they were contaminating people.

Ebola was also discovered in nearby Sierra Leone which soon became the epicenter of the outbreak. This former British colony, called Mama Salone, by the locals, declared independence in 1961 and shares borders with Liberia and Guinea and opens out onto the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest. Home to the world’s third largest harbor, Sierra Leone was one of the centers for the Atlantic slave trade. Predominantly Muslim, the country is among the most religiously tolerant nations. Despite diamonds, gold and a wealth of mineral resources the population lives in abject poverty. Civil wars, coups and corruption have devastated the country’s infrastructure.



The Kenema Government Hospital, located in the nation’s third largest city, was recently attacked by a hostile mob convinced that this installation was spreading disease and that patients are killed in hospitals. This dual purpose facility contained a Level 2, U.S. bio-security and bioweapons (BSL-2) research lab with links to eugenics and population control advocates Bill and Melinda Gates and the Soros Foundation. American biodefense scientists have been working on viral fevers at this location since 2011. There was also a consortium there consisting of collaboration with Tulane, Scripps Research Institute, Broad Institute for Genomics, Harvard, U.C. San Diego, University of Texas, Autoimmune Technologies, Corgenix Medical Corporation and various other partners in West Africa. (http://vhfc.org/consortium).

Following the mob attack, the government expelled the WHO, closed down this bioweapons research lab; and foreign personnel were asked to leave the country. (birdflu666.wordpress.com), (drrimatruthreports.com).

Doctors Without Borders, the only cadre with experience treating Ebola in West Africa, who have been on site since the onset of this 2014 outbreak, acknowledged that public fears that hospitals were spreading disease were “understandable” and nosocomial transmission is real. This term refers to any spread of a disease within a health care setting such as a clinic or a hospital, and it occurs frequently during Ebola outbreaks. Exposure to the virus has occurred when health care workers treated individuals with Ebola without wearing sufficiently protective clothing. In addition, when needles and syringes are used for vaccines or other purposes, they may not be of a disposable variety or may not have been properly sterilized and so infection spreads. Health care workers may, in fact, be themselves, although unknowingly, infected and also be tending early stage Ebola patients who have not yet been accurately diagnosed. (CDC, Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever: fact sheet, April 9, 2010).

As this often lethal hemorrhagic virus continues to spread, much of Sierra Leone is under quarantine; residents are advised to refrain from touching, and movements within the country are heavily restricted. This containment strategy can be likened to digging barrier trenches in order to halt the spread of wildfires. Schools are closed, crops are not being harvested or brought to market, food prices are soaring and supplies limited for a population already suffering under a grinding poverty.

Government officials plan to maintain the lock-down until the chains of viral transmission are broken. Meanwhile, Ebola has also taken a firm hold in neighboring Liberia…

Here is the official information on them according to Wikipedia The Islamic State (IS; Arabic: الدولة الإسلامية‎ ad-Dawlah l-ʾIslāmiyyah), previously calling itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL; /ˈaɪsəl/) or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS; /ˈaɪsɪs/; Arabic: الدولة الإسلامية في العراق والشام‎), and also known by the Arabic acronym Daʿesh (داعش),[a] is an unrecognized state and a Sunni jihadist group active in Iraq and Syria in the Middle East. In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world[67] and aspires to bring most of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control[68] beginning with territory in the Levant region which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey.[69] It has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group[70] and has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. The United Nations and Amnesty International have accused the group of grave human rights abuses.

The Islamic State, also widely known as ISIS, ISIL and Daʿes

On the show today I talk with Tim Brown from Freedom Outpost where we discuss ISIS, its creation, the truth about the Islamic faith and push towards war in Syria.

Tim posted an article about the speech Obama gave on ISIS or as he calls them ISIL and that they are not Islamic despite their actions and statements to the contrary.

Obama Taqiyya claim Islamic State neither Islamic nor State

Doug Funderburk who sponsored HB 1439 known as to many as the Federal Gun Law Nullification Act. This bill if passed by the Senate and signed by the Governor would invalidate any Federal regulation that would infringe on Missourians 2nd Amendment rights.

In addition I will take a look at the continued saga revolving around the 2013 shutdown of a government corruption investigation by PA Attorney General Kathleen Kane. The investigation started back in 2010 and caught on tape five elected officials taking bribes in the form of cash and gifts.

The events going on between Ukraine and Russia and what that might mean to the US and NATO. As well as the events that took place on the Nevada ranch of Cliven Bundyâ€™s cattle ranch with BLM and much more today on the TGB Report.

The BLM claim that the family and the 800 or so protestors with a SWAT like force had sniper rifles and used excessive force on the group for doing nothing more than assembling peacefully to stand up for Cliven Bundyâ€™s rights as a rancher.

When the stand off finally ended there was extensive damage to the property, such as, knocked down fences, destruction to water wayâ€™s and the murder and mass grave burial of approximately fourteen head of cattle from Mr. Budyâ€™s ranch by the BLM.

"http://fprnradio.com/tgb-report-thomas-brown-043014/","The TGB Report with Thomas Brown","On this edition of The TGB Report I discuss the role of race in this country and how the words racists, bigot and similar phrases are used by the media and enemies of freedom to silence folks they disagree with. Case in point, Cliven Bundy.

When he started his stance with supporters two weeks ago against the Federal Government, taking over ranching land from his family and other ranchers, the argument was that he was a tax dodger and would not pay his grazing fees. Well that proved false so the NY Times interviewed him and then cherry picked his comments on Blacks and Hispanics in this country and labeled him a racist.

In another twist of racism, L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling, was recorded by his girlfriend/escort making some truly reprehensible remarks on his thoughts on blacks.

But as bad as his remarks are they where made in a private setting and were just words. There has not been any type of findings where he actually took actions within the Clippers organization that would be considered abuse in the workplace.Â Even still, he is being punished with a lifetime ban from anything related to the NBA including visiting any Clippers facility as well as a $2.5 million fine by the NBA Commissioner. The NBA is also pushing owners to force him to sell his team. This is a very dangerous precedent as you are going to make it more common place to be fired for your thoughts and words if they do not line up with the majority of the public. Can you say thought crimes?

We have Joel Salatin from Polyface Farms on the program to talk about this movement and the damage that factory farms. They not only destroy the environment, but the health of humans as well since they are nutrient deficient.

Not to mention that the food either meat or plant based is not even real compared to the varieties grown on family farms. Many are Genetically Modified Organisms which are altered for what is deemed more efficient products. In some cases the organisms are mixed with other species completely.

We will discuss this for the majority of the program as I find itâ€™s be the a fascinating subject that would fill dozens of shows, not just one.

Joel has been on countless shows and in several great documentaries. He is also an accomplished author who has penned nine books you can purchase from his website.

It seems though that Sgt. Bergdhal was not kidnapped by his captors from his camp in the middle of the night. But instead he walked away from his post going AWOL and possibly getting six of his fellow soldiers killed in the coming months after his disappearance.

"http://fprnradio.com/tgb-report-thomas-brown-061814/","The TGB Report with Thomas Brown","On today’s show I discuss the attempted smear against Sheriff Richard Mack by the Southern Poverty Law Center on there site Hatewatch.com where they try to tie him to one of the shooters Jared Miller. The only link is a photo of Sheriff Mack and Mr. Miller that was on Miller’s Facebook page. Mack does over 100 talks and appearances a year and at each function their are about 50 to 100 folks who want photos with him. This is just but one photo.

The SPLC goes on to quote Sheriff Mack in their article although during the interview conducted yesterday by Truth Watch’s Ben Swann. Mack states he had no contact with the center about this issue.

Then we have everyone’s favorite liar and criminal Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on CNN Tuesday night doing a “town meeting” event where upon a question about gun violence in schools she goes on to inaccurately portray semi-automatic weapons as automatic weapons and pushes for more stringent background checks. By more stringent she means using medical records to deem people unfit to obtain a firearm. You can read the story here.

While on the topic of school shootings I briefly discuss the push by uninformed parents and school boards to get funding so they can buy “Body Guard” blankets for the students to protect them from shooters during a school shooting. Let’s set aside the cost of $1,000 a blanket and the less than 1 percent chance your child will be subject to such a rare event.

The fact is the blankets where created by a group in Oklahoma to protect students during tornadoes and the flying debris which is a real possibility for folks in OK and other states in tornado alley. You can read about it at ammoland.com which has the story.

The show then turns towards the waste in public schools from a monetary standpoint and the many causes such as corruption in contracts, over staffing of admiration in lieu of the shrinking student population.

Philly School demands more money from the state of PA despite being state’s most expensive public school.

Read about it on Philly.com.

Another cost is the federal control of education that has increased over the past two Presidents. Under Bush we had “No Child Left Behind”. Now under Obama we have the dumbing down of education through Common Core. Congressman Ron Paul had a great piece on this a year ago on his Texas Straight Talk Website.

One real positive note is that it looks like teacher tenure which allows teachers to hold onto jobs solely based on seniority vs merit. A CA Superior court judge in ruled that tenure hurt poor and minority kids and violated their civil rights. You can read the story on the NY Times.

The final segment of the program discussed an article by Mike Adams’ aka The Health Ranger on his Natural News Site about the attack on alternative medical treatments and products discussed on the Dr. Oz show by Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO).

The last topic of the day dealt with the United State’s Patent Office canceling the trademark protect of the NFL Redskin’s logo as they deemed it a slur. This not only destroys a business’s ability to operate and generate revenue through the sale and licensing of it’s trademark. But, is also a huge violation of free speech and is basically a thought crime. You can check out the story on the Washington Post website.

This is leading to criminals and gang members to slip into the country with much more ease. This is causing havoc for ranchers and citizens all throughout the country particularly the southwest in Texas, California, Arizona, and New Mexico.

In addition we discuss the plight of Sgt. Andrew Tahmooreessi. The U.S. Marine who is being held in a Mexican prison for the crime of making a wrong turn into Mexico with all his belongings in his truck. The problem is that he is one of those evil gun owners and had three firearms in with his belongings.

"http://fprnradio.com/tgb-report-thomas-brown-070214/","The TGB Report with Thomas Brown","Today we discuss the events unfolding in Northern Iraq and Syria where the group known as ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or Islamic State of Iraq and the Leveant) has taken several cities in Iraq and Syria and are wrongly being labeled a terrorist organization by the folks who pushed for war in Iraq during the Bush administration 2003.

But as Dan Carlin so astutely pointed out in his latest Uncommon Sense podcast these folks are not terrorists as they don’t just kill for killing sake. But, are working more like a group who has a central power and purpose which is to take and win cities across Iraq which they have already done.

The main issues with the Middle East can be dated back to the break up of the Ottoman Empire and the carving up the empire into countries that benefits Ango -Economic interest and not the native folks.

In Benghazi more has come out through testimony by Gregory Hicks which points more evidence of a cover-up of the real reason Ambassador Stevens and several others where killed on September 11, 2012.

Hillary Clinton completely disagrees with Hicks but then again she has been know to lie time and time again.

What ever happened to the film maker who was blamed then jailed for “causing” this attack on the Ambassador and other Americans?

What was the real motive all this and more on today’s show.

"http://fprnradio.com/tgb-report-thomas-brown-070914/","The TGB Report with Thomas Brown","On Today’s show I tackled the multitude of issue surrounding the illegal immigration problem which has skyrocket out of control thanks to President Obama’s policy to ignore the current law when it comes to deporting these folks. Instead he has unilaterally imposed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). This is illegal as the executive branch not only is ignoring the law but making law up on it’s own in violation of the separation of powers clearly outline in the Constitution.

The U.S. Constitution in Article 1 section 8 state the Congress set immigration and naturalization laws as well as write all laws. In the section that deals with Presidential duties the actions he can take on bills is to sign then once passed by both the House and Senate or veto the bill. But, he can not ignore passed law, or create his own laws as some Imperial King.

On the show today we had Patrice Lynes the organizer behind the protests that are taking place in Murrieta, CA Immigration. S Detention Center. She and her group have turned three groups of immigrants that have been flown into San Diego, CA and then bused to the Detention Center in Murrieta. Patrice has great shared a wealth of knowledge with us today on what she has seen and heard on the front lines. A source has revealed to her that five of the Murrieta ICE agents who where sent down to stations closer to the border to process the illegals that have been turned away by protestors have contracted scabies thanks to the poor health screening protocols being followed at detention centers and holding facilitates. In addition her source has revealed that several children have fevers and are coughing blood indicating Tuberculosis a deadly lung disease which is highly contagious. There are suspected infections of bird flu within the illegal population.

Patrice Lynes is willing to guide anyone who wants to start a group in their area of the country as the illegals are being shipped all over the country. So send her an e-mail @ patrice.lynes@gmail.com if you want to discuss what has worked for her group.

"http://fprnradio.com/tgb-report-thomas-brown-071614/","The TGB Report with Thomas Brown","On today’s program we discuss the issued with public schools and their poor job of actually educating children to not only obtain gainful employment but to give them the tools to become free thinkers and nurture a thirst for learning. The main issue in schools today is the one size fits all approach that has been the model from several decades. In addition the centralized control that came from the states and now come down from Washington. We now have No Child Left Behind, and Common Core which seeks to standardize the what and how every child is educated in the country who attends the government schools.

To Illustrate the inevitable outcome of a school system that is controls from the central government I have added this cartoon from Walt Disney.

The issue of Common Core. I have linked the name Common Core to a site that gives a lot of great information on this issue. But, if you missed it the link for Rethinking Schools is right here http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/28_02/28_02_karp.shtml

Also here is a video of a Tennessee mother who speaks to her school board and illistrates how confusing and inefficient the system for teaching math is under this system.

Another problem and again it finds it’s origins at the hands of the Federal Government is the forced enrollment of illegal immigrant children into our school systems regardless of the wishes or strain it will cause on the local school district.

This is all thanks to are weak willed Supreme Court, Congress, and we can’t forget Attorney General Eric Holder who stated he will use the Justice Dept. to strictly enforce this Federal dictate.

These subjects and other issues dealing with the failing behind public schools all today on today’s TGB Report.

"http://fprnradio.com/tgb-report-thomas-brown-073014/","The TGB Report with Thomas Brown","On this edition of The TGB Report, I try to give a broad view of the complexities that are involved in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and it’s origins. The aspects discussed deal with the creation of Israel, the role of each side, outside influences and much more.

The creation of Israel starts back at the end of WWII 1948 when Palestine was sectioned off to create a homeland for the Jews by the United Nations. This land was then formally recognized as Israel on May 14, 1948 the day they Declared their Independence. This not only angered the Palestinian people who whom had their homes taken and businesses destroyed but made the Palestinian people permanent refugees as they where not welcome in Israel as equal citizens and could not apply for citizenship in other nations that are part of the Arab League.

The show goes into the creation of Hamas and how it was originally created by Israel’s Shin Bet (Israel’s Intelligence Agency) to reduce the power of Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization. Sadly, much like the U.S. plan back in the 80′s to radicalize Muslims and partner with with this Saudi fellow named Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden to take on the U.S.S.R and drive them out of Afghanistan.

The American people would be shocked if they knew the extent of the aid and support financially and military that the U.S. provides to Israel and then turns around and pays for the rebuilding of facilities in Gaza and other Palestinian areas that our money and weapons where used to destroy.

Here is the link to a report produced by the website If American Knew Feb. 7, 2014 that outlines U.S. aid to Israel cost taxpayers.

The Staggering Cost Of Israel to Americans

Here is a video that outlines U.S. aid to Israel as well.

"http://fprnradio.com/tgb-report-thomas-brown-082714/","The TGB Report with Thomas Brown","On this episode of The TGB Report we look into the cover-up of a study that shows a correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism by the CDC. The CDC also has been caught numerous times over the years in lies about vaccine safety in general. The Health and Human Dept. has been also caught doing illegal experiments on American citizens and even citizens of other countries without any consent.

There is also a revolving door between the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC which leads to this hiding of information from the public.

We find out about the hidden information in relation to the MMR vaccine and it’s disproportionate amount of autism causes it causes in African American babies thanks to a whistle blower by the name of Dr. William Thompson and his letter he sent in 2004 to then head of the CDC Dr. Julie Gerberding.

Click link to see letter

Dr. Thompson’s letter

Dr. Gerberding stepped down from being the head of the CDC in 2009 and immediately took up her current position with Merk Pharmaceuticals as President of their vaccine department. Merk is the creator of the MMR vaccine which Dr. Thompson complained about in his letter in 2004.

In light of the revelation that Dr. William Thompson, senior scientist at CDC, has admitted guilt in hiding data that found that black males are 340% more likely to have an autism diagnosis when given the MMR before age 3, Rob Schneider has written to the office of the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, to assure himself that Brown is aware of the fraud, and to demand answers and actions to protect California children.

"http://fprnradio.com/tgb-report-thomas-brown-052114/","The TGB Report with Thomas Brown","On todayâ€™s program I discussed the new revelations about Bitcoin exchanges being investigated for possible links to the Silk Road online store which only uses bitcoins for transactions.

I had Tim Brown from Freedom Outpost to discuss two issues he recently had featured on his website. The first of which was the attack on the 1st Amendment that is going on right now by Harry Reid and other Democrats. They are not the only ones who are for curtailing free speech. Many so called Republicans such as Sen. Lyndsay Graham and others support free speech suppression in the name of the Hate Crime Prevention Act 2014.

The second item we discussed has to do with the Federal Appeals Court of the 7th Circuit’s decision to deny the rights of citizens to refuse entry into their homes by police officers without warrant or charges being filed, all under the name of safety if the officer deems it necessary. This is a clear violation of the 4th Amendment which the judge who wrote the opinion agrees was violated.

The TGB Report is a show about freedom and liberty. Focusing on the truth in political and economic news. Tom will not pull punches or compromise his core believes of classical liberalism in the model of Thomas Jefferson in his fight against government and corporate oppression of the American People.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/03/19/philippines-lays-claim-to-polynesia/","PHILIPPINES LAYS CLAIM TO POLYNESIA","The Hague, Netherlands – The Philippine government has filed a formal petition with the United Nations, laying territorial claim to the countries in Polynesia. The petition was submitted by the Philippines’ permanent representative to the U.N. Libran Cabactulan to the International Court of Justice located at The Hague in the Netherlands.

The petition came after the National Geographic published the results of a new research study on ancient chicken DNA which led to the conclusion that the Philippines could actually be the ancestral home of the Polynesians.

The researchers found that Polynesian chickens had their roots in the Philippines, making that region a candidate for the homeland of the mysterious Lapita people thought to be ancestral to Polynesians who transported the domesticated birds to the Pacific islands.

“We have identified genetic signatures of the original Polynesian chickens, and used these to track early movements and trading patterns across the Pacific,” said lead author Dr. Vicki Thomson of the Australian Center for Ancient DNA (ACAD). “We were also able to trace the origins of these lineages back into the Philippines, providing clues about the source of the original Polynesian chicken populations.”

Philippine President NoyNoy Aquino ecstatically briefed reporters about the petition, saying that the territorial claim could be the highlight of his presidency. He added that the Philippines will abandon its claim to the disputed Spratly Islands in the West Philippine Sea, which are also being claimed by China.

Aquino said he would rather pursue the claim to Polynesia because it would mean the Philippines’ expansion to larger territories like Hawaii, Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands, Fiji, New Zealand , and several other islands in the Pacific. “This would make the Philippines truly a world power,” Aquino said.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/10/20/the-x-factor-reality-shows-new-rules-only-native-born-citizens-allowed/","THE X FACTOR REALITY SHOW’S NEW RULES: ONLY NATIVE-BORN CITIZENS ALLOWED","Los Angeles California (The Adobo Chronicles) – The producers of the internationally-syndicated reality show The X Factor have issued new rules on eligibility for contestants. Henceforth, only native-born citizens will be allowed to join the singing contest in the country in which the show is being held. Only native-born U.S. citizens for X Factor America, native-born Australian citizens for X Factor Australia, native-born Israeli citizens for X Factor Israel, and so on. The rules also state that both parents of the contestants must also be native-born citizens.

The decision came immediately after 15-year-old Marlisa Punzalan won the grand finals in this season’s X Factor Australia, beating fellow Australians Dean Ray and Brothers 3. Although Marlisa was born in Australia, both her parents were born in the Philippines.

Just months ago, a Filipina caregiver in Tel Aviv, Rose Fostanes, won the first X Factor Israel. Other Filipinos have figured prominently and became finalists in other reality singing competitions in the U.S., U.K., Bulgaria and other countries. Many will recall that Pinay singer Jessica Sanchez was runner-up in American Idol.

“We know Filipinos are among the best singers in the world, but we wanted to showcase other world talents and that’s why we have established X Factor in different countries outside of the U.S. or the U.K.,” the producers said.

The Philippines has its own X Factor syndicated show in Manila.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/09/13/asian-american-journalists-want-to-erase-chinaman-from-hawaii/","ASIAN AMERICAN JOURNALISTS WANT TO ERASE ‘CHINAMAN’ FROM HAWAII","San Francisco, California (The Adobo Chronicles) – The Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA), a national membership organization composed of Asian Americans working in mainstream media, has sent a strongly-worded letter to the Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA) demanding that the name ‘Chinaman’ be erased from all literature and references to Chinaman’s Hat, a famed attraction on the island of Oahu.

Located in Kāne’ohe Bay, Chinaman’s Hat, also known as Mokoli’i Island, is a scenic wonder resembling that of a cone-shaped straw hat often seen worn in several countries in Southeast Asia.

But the term ‘Chinaman’ is considered derogatory, according to AAJA and other Asian American groups. MediaWatch, AAJA’s watchdog arm, has been calling out news organizations that have printed or broadcast terms, phrases or statements that are considered racist, discriminatory or offensive to the Asian American community in the U.S.

In its stylebook distributed to newsrooms, AAJA has this to say about the term:

The Adobo Chronicles learned that HTC has yet to receive the letter which was supposedly sent by registered mail from AAJA’s headquarters in San Francisco. Nevertheless, HTC questioned why it has taken this long for AAJA to demand this change, when Chinaman’s Hat has been the name of this tourist attraction for many decades, perhaps even predating the journalist organization.

“Besides,” HTC said, “it will cost the state tourism body millions of dollars to make the change, having to update all tourism videos, brochures, and web sites, not to mention the cost of re-educating both Hawaii residents and tourists about a new name.”

What could that new name be? Perhaps, the island could be renamed after Hawaii’s state fish, humuhumunukunukuapua’a ? That would seem appropriate.

KOAT-TV reports that Alex Gonzales was terminated last week in connection with the lewd act caught on camera on the morning of May 6.

According to the video, the driver stopped at a park and ride and a woman walked onto the bus without paying her fare. On the video Gonzales is heard saying, “You know what time it is!” He then proceeded to have sex with the woman.

Meanwhile, Gonzales claimed there is a double standard when it comes to Albuquerque law.

Last week, another man was caught on surveillance cameras having sex on the beach — inside a cocktail bar. No arrests were made, but the man got drunk.

But the Republicans have a good chance of sending one of their own to the U.S. Congress come the 2014 elections, in the person of Charles Djou of the 1st Congressional district of Oahu.

The Huffington Post lists 8 reasons why Hawaii could elect a Republican candidate in this year’s congressional elections.

The Adobo Chronicles agrees with the No. 8 reason listed by HuffPost: that Charles has a memorable last name, one that voters would easily remember when they enter the polling booth.

Imagine a candidate whose last name is humuhumunukunukuapua’a. Okay, that’s Hawaii’s state fish, but you know what we mean.

Charles’ last name is easy enough to remember. Is it a cross between French and Chinese. But voters just need to think about the mustard they put on their BBQ burgers or their loco mocos: dijon.

The medical community was quick to criticize APA’s use of the term ‘selfitis,’ saying that the suffix ‘itis’ refers to a condition or disease that involves some form of inflammation. Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial passages of the lungs; tonsilitis is the inflammation of the tonsils; dermatitis is the inflammation of the skin. Many doctors and scientists said that the correct term for an “addiction” such as the addiction to take self photos should be ‘selfism,’ just like addiction to alcohol is ‘alcoholism.’

However, APA defended its choice for the term ‘selfitis’ saying that the newly classified mental disorder is an ‘inflammation of one’s ego.’

Lee said that this will give 49er fans the much-needed time to process their team’s failure to earn a spot in this year’s Superbowl and to recuperate from all the shouting, cheering and screaming that marked Sunday’s NFC championship game.

All city and county offices will be closed on Tuesday, making it a four-day weekend for most San Franciscans. Monday is also a holiday, being Martin Luther King Day.

San Francisco’s City Hall which in the past week has been illuminated with the red and gold colors, will go completely dark starting at midnight Sunday until midnight Tuesday.

After listing achievements made possible by continuing reforms of his administration in the past four years, Aquino concluded his speech with a challenge to the people to make sure they continue to reap the fruits of these reforms by choosing the right leader to succeed him.

“We know who is going to a stop my reforms,” Aquino said as he looked directly into the eyes of Vice President Jejomar Binay. “And we know who will continue my reforms,” he said, this time looking directly into the eyes of his sister, television host Kris Aquino who was seated at the VIP gallery. At that point, television cameras caught the presidential sister bursting into tears, while the Vice President excused himself for a bathroom break.

Interviewed by The Adobo Chronicles after the SONA, Kris said she could not hold back her tears. “They were tears of joy — joy over the great confidence that my brother has put on me to continue his daang matuwid (the right path), this administration’s rallying cry and mantra.”

In a lighter moment during the interview, Kris was asked what nickname she would like to be called when she becomes president. “In the family tradition where my dad was called Ninoy and my brother NoyNoy, I would love to be called KringKring,” she said, this time with a big smile on her face.

(The Adobo Chronicles) – After meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House today, top leaders of the now Republican-controlled Congress announced their 2-year, 12-point agenda.

Called the “Conservative Contract with the American People,” the comprehensive and ambitious agenda will be officially launched at a joint session of the 114th Congress scheduled for January 5, 2015.

House Speaker John Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, officially unveiled the agenda before reporters at the steps of the Capitol.

The 12-point agenda:

Repeal ObamaCare Strike down any federal and state law that resembles the Dream Act Deport all Undocumented Immigrants, including all those whose cases are pending in immigration courts Close all U.S.-Mexico borders and ban all flights from West Africa Amend the U.S. Constitution to define marriage to be only between one man and one woman Privatize Social Security and increase retirement benefits for members of Congress Double the tax breaks for the Fortune 500 Companies Pressure the liberal members of the Supreme Court to retire or resign if they continue to have dissenting opinions with the rest of the Supremes Re-invade Iraq; invade Syria and Afghanistan; renew the Cold War with Russia Tax all use of social media and limit public access to news programs except Fox News Require all school classes, government and private meetings, conferences, concerts, sports events, the Tonys, Emmys, Grammys , Oscars, and Video Music Awards to begin with the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. It will be a federal offense to omit the phrase “under God” Postpone the 2016 presidential elections and give President Obama an extra four years so that he can try to work more closely with the Republican Congress on the above issues.

That means the current Orange County in southern California.

Orange County, with a population of more than three million –making it the sixth most populous county in the United States — is one of the few remaining California bastions of the Republican party, along with a couple of counties in Central California. Of Orange County’s six congressional representatives, all but one are Republican. The lone Democrat is Loretta Sanchez of the 47th Congressional District.

“It is about time we had a red state in the west coast of the U.S.,” the Republican leaders said. Orange county is known for its political conservatism and three Orange County cities (City of Orange, Garden Grove and Huntington Beach) are among America’s most conservative.

The Adobo Chronicles learned that should Orange become its own state, the Republican leaders want the State Capitol to be located in Anaheim, right inside Disneyland. They have even decided on a state meme, “The Magic State,” with Mickey Mouse gracing the official state seal.

Currently, the City of Santa Ana serves as the county’s government center.

The current ballot initiatives proposes to divide California into these six states: South California, West California, Central California, Silicon Valley (which would include San Francisco), North California and finally, Jefferson.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/10/28/monday-october-31-declared-a-holiday-in-the-philippines/","MONDAY, OCTOBER 31 DECLARED A HOLIDAY IN THE PHILIPPINES","Manila, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles) – Filipinos woke up this morning to the exciting news that President NoyNoy Aquino has signed an executive order declaring Monday, October 31 a special non-working holiday.

The news was carried by The Inquirer, the country’s leading daily newspaper.

The executive order was signed by Aquino’s Executive Secretary Pacquito Ochoa, Jr., who said that the President wanted to give Filipinos an extra day off to honor their dearly departed. November 1, All Saints’ Day, is when Filipinos troop to cemeteries to pay respect to the dead.

But wait, isn’t October 31 a Friday?

Indeed it is. Apparently, The Inquirer mistakenly printed a news story from its 2011 issue. October 31, 2011, was a Monday.

Aquino felt so bad about the newspaper’s goof that he went ahead and declared Monday, November 3 a special non-working holiday.

Have a great long weekend!

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/10/20/dean-ray-fans-demand-a-recount-of-x-factor-australia-final-results/","DEAN RAY FANS DEMAND A RECOUNT OF X FACTOR AUSTRALIA FINAL RESULTS","Sydney, Australia (The Adobo Chronicles) – The X Factor Australia’s results night came down to two finalists: Dean Ray and Marlisa Punzalan. Like the reality show’s counterparts in the U.S., U.K., and elsewhere, the winner is determined exclusively by viewers’ votes.

Then came the announcement: 15-year-old Filipina Australian Marlisa was declared the winner. The show’s host Luke Jacobz revealed that the difference in votes between Dean and Marlisa was an astonishing 0.01 per cent — the closest ever in any reality show viewer voting.

While Dean was gracious in defeat, his fans were not. They have collected one million signatures asking for a recount of the votes.

In politics, recounts are not uncommon in electoral contests where the difference between the two top candidates is less than one percent of votes cast.

Many Americans will recall the 2000 U.S. presidential elections in which a recount was ordered to determine whether George W. Bush or Al Gore won the Florida vote. In the end, the election was settled in favor of Bush, by a margin of only 537 votes out of almost 6 million cast. That’s when the term “hanging chads” became a household word in America.

The X Factor Australia producers have not received a copy of the recount petition and they have no clue on how to deal with it.

In political elections, optional recounts are usually paid for by the losing candidate or his or her political party. Dean’s fans have not said whether they are willing to pay for the recount if the show’s producers decide to do it.

There are no hanging chads to deal with, but a recount in this case would involve a review of all phone calls and text messages, or proof that there was a computer glitch in the final vote tally.

If a recount does happen, an Aussie TV producer has already said he will make an entire reality show out of the recount. Do we hear cash registers going ka-ching?

Winfrey once touted Charice as “the most talented girl in the world.” The 22-year-old former Glee star came out in the Philippines last year as a lesbian. The interview is her official ‘coming out’ on U.S. television.

During the interview, Winfrey, who is godmother to Charice, asked the Filipina singer if she “were thinking about transitioning to becoming a male.”

Charice was reportedly very nervous about doing the interview, but Winfrey calmed her down and said this was her “homecoming.”

So there you have it. Oprah and Charice both coming out on national television.

(The Adobo Chronicles) – Last week, The Adobo Chronicles reported that Republicans in Congress have voted to impeach President Barack Obama for bringing disgrace to the Office of the President. The move stemmed from Obama wearing a tan-colored suit at a White House press briefing. Republican legislators had said that no other president in U.S. history has ever worn a light-colored suit. They were one in saying that U.S. presidents should dignify the office by wearing only dark suits.

However, after photos of Presidents Reagan, George H. and George W. Bush, as well as Clinton wearing light-colored suits appeared on social media, the Republicans immediately withdrew their impeachment charge.

“We apologize for this fiasco,” Speaker John Boehner said, adding, ” our legislative staff didn’t do a good job at research. Some heads are gonna roll!”

Meanwhile, The White House responded by saying , “Wait till the Republicans discover photos of earlier U.S. presidents wearing white suits, even after Labor Day.”

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/11/02/president-aquino-to-fire-overweight-cabinet-members/","PRESIDENT AQUINO TO FIRE OVERWEIGHT CABINET MEMBERS","Manila, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles) – Philippine President NoyNoy Aquino is serious about fulfilling his campaign promise to rid the government of corruption and maximize the efficiency of the bureaucracy. Aquino has consistently proclaimed that his administration will always pursue what he calls Daang Matuwid (straight path).

In recent months, Aquino’s critics have called for the resignation or firing of several of his cabinet members for alleged corruption or total inefficiency on the job, among them, Vice President Jejomar Binay, Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala, Agrarian Reform Secretary Virgilio de los Reyes, Philippine National Police Director General Alan Purisima and Budget Secretary Florencio Abad.

Today, The Philippine Daily Inquirer reported that Aquino is weighing his cabinet members.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/10/30/sf-giants-quarantined-for-21-days-fridays-victory-parade-cancelled/","SF GIANTS QUARANTINED FOR 21 DAYS; FRIDAY’S VICTORY PARADE CANCELLED","San Francisco, California (The Adobo Chronicles) – Friday’s victory parade for the World Series champs has been cancelled, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee announced this morning. The San Francisco Giants beat the Kansas City Royals in Game 7 Wednesday night to clinch its third World Series title in five years.

The announcement came after Lee received a call from from Kansas City Mayor Sly James that the entire San Francisco team has been quarantined for 21 days and barred from flying.

The state of Kansas has declared a new viral outbreak that’s highly contagious, more so than Ebola. The outbreak seemed to have started during Game 6 of the World Series. Tens of thousands of baseball fans, many of whom came in direct contact with the Giants, exhibited severe symptoms of euphoria, nervous breakdown, intoxication, inflammation of the vocal cords and hypertension — all of which were traced back to Game 6. By Game 7, the new contagion tripled, causing the state of Kansas to declare a health emergency. A new symptom — depression — developed overnight but strangely enough, only the Royals fans are exhibiting it.

Upon consultation with the Feds, notably the Centers for Disease Control, Kansas imposed a mandatory 21-day quarantine on all who attended Games 6 and 7 of the Word Series at the Kauffman stadium. Unfortunately, that includes the Giants team.

Mayor Lee asked for calm in San Francisco and promised that the victory parade will be rescheduled immediately after the Giants are released from quarantine.

Madison Bumgarner, who is widely credited for his role in clinching the World Series title for the Giants, tweeted from Kansas: ‘Bummer!’

BUSH WANTED TO TRANSFER THE SEAT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT TO IRAQ","Ebril, Iraq (The Adobo Chronicles) – The latest secret document to be published by WikiLeaks, the international online organization that has been uncovering classified information, reveals that President George W. Bush wanted to transfer the seat of the U.S. Government to Ebril in Northern Iraq.

It was purportedly part of the overall plan that began with the U.S. invasion of Iraq disguised as a search for Saddam Hussein’s Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).

The document shows that Bush was so confident that he could find WMD to justify his desire to colonize Iraq that he ordered the construction of a White House replica in Ebril. His plan was to occupy the “other” White House in Ebril for the rest of his presidency. Bush is known to fancy desert weather.

Following the latest leak, ABC News went in search of the White House replica in Ebril (see photo), and found that it was never fully completed. It is still undergoing the final touches but it is now owned by a prominent Kurdish businessman.

So the next time you see a photograph of the White House, it may not be the one on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/11/02/levis-withdraws-from-naming-rights-agreement-for-49er-stadium/","LEVI’S WITHDRAWS FROM NAMING RIGHTS AGREEMENT FOR 49er STADIUM","Santa Clara, California (The Adobo Chronicles) – Levi Strauss & Co. today announced that it is withdrawing from its $220 Million, 20-year agreement with the San Francisco 49ers for the naming rights to the new football stadium in Santa Clara.

Levi’s Stadium just opened this summer to become the new home of the 49ers following the closure of Candlestick Park in San Francisco.

Levi’s CEO Chip Bergh made the stunning announcement following today’s disappointing 49er loss to the St. Louis Rams. Today’s loss puts the 49ers at 4 wins and 4 losses in the current National Football Conference season. They now trail The Arizona Cardinals and the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC West Division.

“We don’t want our name to be associated with a losing team,” Bergh said, adding that “we would rather pay a penalty and default on our contract with the 49ers.” Levi’s will pay an undisclosed hefty penalty for breaking the contract.

49ers CEO Jed York said that he is currently in talks with underwear company Jockey for a deal to rename Levi’s Stadium to Jockey Stadium.

Jockey is the same company that produced and gave away 2,000 limited edition underwear marked ‘Mad Bum’ to honor SF Giants’ Mad Bumgarner’s fantastic season that led to the team’s third World Series title in five years.

Well, Jockey has some kind of nice ring to it, as long as fans don’t mistake it to be a hockey stadium.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/11/05/mitch-mcconnell-ebola-has-been-eradicated-in-the-u-s/","MITCH MCCONNELL: ‘EBOLA HAS BEEN ERADICATED IN THE U.S.’","Louisville, Kentucky (The Adobo Chronicles) – After two months of causing widespread panic among the American public, Ebola has finally been eradicated in the U.S.

This was announced today by Senator Mitch McConnell, the presumptive next Senate majority leader. The Kentucky senator defeated his Democratic rival in yesterday’s midterm elections, as did several other Republicans in various state contests. The Republican victory virtually put both the Senate and the House of Representatives under full control by the GOP.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first-ever case of Ebola diagnosed in America on September 30. The patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, came from Liberia and had remained in isolation at a hospital in Dallas, Texas for over a week. On the morning of October 8, he died.

Several other cases of nurses and doctors suspected to have been exposed to the Ebola virus after arriving from medical missions in West Africa prompted extreme measures by several states, including mandatory quarantine and active monitoring by the federal government.

Many Republican candidates campaigned on scare tactics and criticized the Obama administration for doing nothing or very little to combat the spread of the deadly virus in the U.S.

It turns out that “Ebola” was a code name used by Republican leaders to refer to their political strategy to gain full control of Congress in Tuesday’s elections. Choosing the code name worked perfectly for Republican candidates because it resulted in a “double entendre,” scaring many voters who believed that the Democrats were not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus. Exit polls confirmed that voters went for Republican candidates because of this.

As soon as the television networks and news media called the election in favor of a full Republican control of Congress, the GOP officially declared that Ebola has been eradicated in the U.S.– their election strategy code name, that is. With it came the eradication of Democrats in key states.

The arrest came shortly after the Russians won the gold medal in the team skating competition, beating out Canada and the United States. Putin, who was in the audience all evening, rushed to the athletes’ stand and embraced the handsome Evgeni Plushenko.

Putin was booked but later released after making a public apology. “I just could not contain myself, ” he said, “and I am really sorry for bringing embarassment to Russia.”

Bachmann said that America was not ready for a woman president, alluding to Hillary Clinton who is believed to be the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. She also said that Barack Obama was elected president only because white people felt guilty about slavery.

Pressed by reporters on whether she was planning to seek the Republican presidential nomination again in 2016, Bachmann admitted that she can’t get elected because she’s dumb. “I’ve come to this reality for quite some time now,” she told reporters, “so I’m quite fine with giving up the contest in favor of our Republican boys’ club. But what I won’t give up is my title as ‘Queen of the Tea Party.'” She is the founder of the House Tea Party Caucus.

“Just like the Queen of England, Ms. Bachmann likes to be addressed as ‘Your Highness,’ aides told The Adobo Chronicles.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/11/13/obama-expected-to-issue-immigration-executive-order-whats-wal-mart-got-to-do-with-it/","OBAMA EXPECTED TO ISSUE IMMIGRATION EXECUTIVE ORDER: WHAT’S WAL-MART GOT TO DO WITH IT?","Washington, D.C. (The Adobo Chronicles) – Sources close to Barack Obama have all but confirmed that the President is preparing to issue an executive order that would, among other things, halt the deportation of some 5 Million undocumented immigrants.

Many will recall that in 2012, Obama issued a similar EO halting the deportation of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. It was known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

The new order, which the President is expected to issue upon his return from his trip to Asia, will allow undocumented parents of children born in the U.S. to remain in the country and have the opportunity to apply for some legal status.

If and when issued, this new executive order will put the President in direct confrontation with Republican Senators and Congressmen who have vowed to stop Obama from bypassing the legislature when it comes to changes in immigration policy.

Legal experts say that Congress cannot overturn an executive order but it can refuse to fund activities stemming from all or parts of it, which makes it a challenge to the Obama administration when it comes to implementing the order.

Enter the Waltons – the billionaire owners of Wal-Mart, the largest private employer in the United States.

Wal-Mart is infamous for its unfair labor laws and employment practices ranging from wage law violations, inadequate health care, exploitation, and its anti-union stance. But the Waltons have sent signals to the White House that if Congress refuses to fund Obama’s immigration Executive Order, Wal-Mart will provide all the needed funds for implementation. The Waltons are worth a combined total of $152 Billion as of July, 2014.

What’s in it for Wal-Mart? Well, that’s 5 Million potential workers they can employ under substandard labor conditions, which means increased profits for the company. In no time, Wal-Mart can recoup whatever amount it spends to fund Obama’s immigration order.

Once again, the Republicans have been out-smarted. Obama wins. Unfortunately, so does Wal-Mart.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/11/12/human-rights-campaign-unveils-new-lgbt-logo/","HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN UNVEILS NEW LGBT LOGO","Washington , D.C. (The Adobo Chronicles) – The equal sign (=) has long been a symbol of the LGBT community’s quest for equality and is, in fact, the logo of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT advocacy organization in the U.S.

In an op-ed piece published in the latest issue of the LGBT magazine The Advocate, Ringo Le, director of the film ‘Big Gay Love,’ wrote a scathing criticism of the HRC logo. The film is about the struggles of being an Asian man in the American gay community.

In his piece, Le said:

“An equal sign is often used as a symbol for the LGBT community, but I believe a pyramid is a more appropriate image. And at the top of the social hierarchy stands the idealized gay white man, and it will probably never change.”

Being the responsive and and socially-responsible organization that it is, the HRC announced it was changing its logo from an equal sign to a pyramid with the rainbow colors of the gay flag, with the top section of the pyramid representing the gay white man.

African American, Asian and Latino gay men and women across the country immediately praised the HRC move, saying that this could signal a historic kumbaya moment in the American LGBT community.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/10/05/a-president-obama-beach-in-hawaii/","A PRESIDENT OBAMA BEACH IN HAWAII?","Honolulu, Hawaii (The Adobo Chronicles) – Hawaii may not get a Presidential Library, but it may get a Presidential Beach, if Honolulu City Council member Stanley Chang gets his way.

Chang and fellow council member Ernie Martin are hoping to rename Sandy Beach Park to President Barack Obama Sandy Beach Park. It comes after a video was taken of the President bodysurfing back in August 2008.

Known for its powerful waves and white sandy beaches, Sandy Beach Park is one of the most scenic spots on Oahu.

“We’ve already included funding in the past year’s budget for a plaque commemorating his love for bodysurfing there, and we hope to generate additional interest in the park. We hope to have it as an additional showcase for residents and visitors from all over the world,” said Chang.

But not everyone is convinced.

“I think you should just leave it as Sandy Beach”, said one beachgoer.

“I don’t think it’s fair because, personally, he’s done nothing for our beach over here,” Waimanalo resident Kanaloa Kane said. “Maybe he did grow up here, but as a local, I’ve been surfing here for 10 years easy and I don’t think it’s fair.”

Is renaming a beach good enough for the President of the United States? Obama doesn’t think so. “Oracle’s Larry Ellison and Facebook’s Mark Mark Zuckerberg get to name entire islands like Lana’i and Moloka’i after them,” said Obama, “so I’d rather rename the entire island of my birth place Oahu to Obama Island.”

Chang was disappointed at Obama’s comment, but he seems to be warming up to the idea of renaming the entire Oahu to Obama Island.

They will also be stepping onto new rainbow-colored crosswalks for the first time when traversing the intersection of 18th and Castro Streets.

The painting of the crosswalks is part of the overall Castro Street Redesign, a $4.5 Million makeover intended to return “fabulous” to the historic district.

Everything seems to be on schedule, including the unveiling of the rainbow crosswalks this Sunday. Except for one thing.

The Human Rights Capaign (HRC), the nation’s largest LGBT advocacy group, has just filed for an emergency court injunction to stop the painting of the crosswalks in the Castro. It is a court case that could have a far-reaching effect on similar projects in other major U.S. cities like Los Angeles and Chicago.

In petitioning the court, the HRC said that the rainbow colors and flag are a sacred symbol of the worldwide LGBT community. “To paint this symbol on street pavements only to be trampled upon by pedestrians is a total desecration,” it added.

HRC president Chad Griffin told The Adobo Chronicles that his organization will fight to the very end to stop the Castro project and other similar projects in the country. “Think about it this way, ” Griffin said, “if cities start painting their pedestrian crosswalks with the U.S. flag, would Americans just sit by and do nothing to stop this desecration?”

San Francisco county supervisor Scott Wiener, who represents the Castro district, could not be reached for comment.

In the meantime, reliable sources revealed that the next phase of the crosswalk project would be to change the stop light signals on Castro Street. Instead of red, green and yellow lights, the warning signals will say ‘Shantay’ for walk, ‘Sashay’ for hurry up, and ‘Strike a pose,” for don’t walk.

Come November, 2016, California voters are expected to approve a ballot proposal authored by venture capitalist Tim Draper. His proposal is to split California into: Jefferson, North California, Silicon Valley, Central California, West California and South California.

There was no specific agenda set for the summit held at the governor’s office in Sacramento other than three nights of cocktails and dinners at various venues in the state capital.

Among those invited to the summit were Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, Miguel Pulido of Santa Ana, Robert Garcia of Long Beach, Chuck Reed of San Jose, Kevin Johnson of Sacramento, Ed Lee of San Francisco and Jean Quan of Oakland.

A spokesperson for the governor’s office told The Adobo Chronicles that if the mayors will have some down time, they will discuss strategies on solving the state’s water shortage crisis.

We are quoting Aquino’s message in its official English translation and have decided to interpret them through photographs:

On Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda)

“Your government wasted no time in responding. We immediately cleared the airport, which is why, within 24 hours after the storm, three C130s were able to bring in aid. On that same day, we were also able to set up a communications hub to hasten the flow of information. On the second day, the Department of Health’s Rapid Health Assessment teams arrived, as well as additional soldiers, policemen, and BFP personnel from other provinces. Likewise, workers from DSWD lead relief operations—in the distribution centers in Eastern Visayas or in repacking centers all around the country.”

On Poverty

“We are investing in our most valuable resource: The Filipino people. Data from the National Economic Development Authority attests to our success. According to them, the 27.9 percent poverty rate during the first semester of 2012 went down to 24.9 percent for the same period in 2013. These three percentage points are equivalent to 2.5 million Filipinos who have crossed the poverty line.”

On Classroom Shortage: “The inherited backlog in books, chairs, and classrooms: erased; while we are working to fulfill the new needs brought about by the implementation of K to 12.” Students “no longer have to study in overcrowded classrooms.” “The inherited backlog in books, chairs, and classrooms: erased; while we are working to fulfill the new needs brought about by the implementation of K to 12.” Students “no longer have to study in overcrowded classrooms.” On Government Spending of Taxpayer Money: “In addition to the national integrity we have restored is the world’s recognition of a new Philippines. The nation’s coffers, which come from the sweat of our citizens, are being spent only for their benefit.” In addition to the national integrity we have restored is the world’s recognition of a new Philippines. The nation’s coffers, which come from the sweat of our citizens, are being spent only for their benefit.” On Disaster Preparedness and Modern Forecasting System: “Let us remember: God proposes, but man disposes. This is likewise the idea behind our efforts for disaster preparedness. We are strengthening the capabilities of our LGUs, (Local Government Units) who are the frontliners in times of disasters, through a modern and comprehensive forecasting system. “ “Let us remember: God proposes, but man disposes.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/07/30/revealed-sarah-palin-arrested-for-public-intoxication/","REVEALED: SARAH PALIN ARRESTED FOR PUBLIC INTOXICATION","Denver, Colorado (Exclusive to The Adobo Chronicles) – Many people know about Sarah Palin’s recent speech in Denver, ranting for more than 30 minutes about impeaching President Barack Obama. But very few people know that the former vice presidential candidate and Alaska governor was arrested for public intoxication.

Palin was guest speaker at the Western Conservative Summit. Apparently, she flew into Denver the same day and was reportedly anxious about the turbulence on the approach to the Denver airport. A flight attendant said that Palin had ordered several shots of tequila as a way to calm her nerves.

Upon arrival in Denver, she was picked up at the airport by a limousine driver who was to take her to the site of the summit. Along the way, she made one brief stop at a marijuana retail shop a few miles from the airport.

She received a warm welcome from the summit organizers who offered her not one, not two, but three glasses of chardonnay. Then it was time for her to deliver her speech. One observer described her drunken speech as lacking in substance and full of Tea Party talking points that sounded like excepts from a poetry slam competition.

One audience member called the Denver police to complain about Palin’s drunken behavior which led to her arrest for public intoxication. The police report indicated that in addition to her blood alcohol level which was three times the legal limit, she was also high on drugs. That explained her brief stop on her way to her speaking engagement.

Denver police, however, said that she was only charged and arrested for public intoxication and not for being under the influence of controlled substance because, as most everyone knows, the state of Colorado has now legalized the recreational use of marijuana.

Palin was released 5 hours later after posting bail and sobering up.

For our readers who are curious and at the same time patient enough to listen to Palin’s drunken speech, here it is in its entirety:

One of her latest career milestones was the establishment of her own television network, OWN, or Oprah Winfrey Network.

The Adobo Chronicles has learned that Winfrey is very nervous about the recent launching of the Sarah Palin Network. “Tired of media filters? Well, so am I,” the former Alaska governor proclaimed Sunday on her Facebook page. “So let’s go rogue and launch our own member-supported channel. “

Palin’s internet video channel is accessible to both fans and critics at a subscription rate of $9.99 a month. The former vice presidential candidate and Alaska governor described her new channel as a “community” where she and viewers can share ideas. “I want to talk to directly to you on our channel on my terms and no need to please the powers that be,” she says, promising to go beyond soundbites and to “cut through the media’s politically correct filter.”

Winfrey told The Adobo Chronicles that she has never been so challenged by anyone in her entire life, much less from a rifle-carrying hockey mom. She is running scared that the launch of the Palin channel will be the beginning of the downfall of the Winfrey media empire. “When you have Americans believing the unintelligible soundbites and wacky opinions from the likes of Palin, America has a big problem,” Winfrey said. “And when such wackery is given a bully pulpit via the ever-expanding world of social media, the threat to America’s sanity becomes even more real.”

Asked if she had any plans to counter Palin’s latest move, the billionaire Winfrey said she will purchase all available subscription spots on the Palin network, then block all content from reaching its intended audience. “In effect, Palin would be broadcasting only to me,” Winfrey added.

Now we know who the real diva is!

Tonight is no exception.

When he delivers his fifth State Of The Union tonight, Obama is reportedy adding a new paragraph that will respond to an online petition demanding the deportation of pop star Justin Bieber. Bieber, a Canadian citizen, has had many encounters with U.S. law enforcement, including his latest charges of and booking for DUI, resisting arrest and drag racing. The petition also asks for the revocation of Bieber’s green card.

The petition, posted on The White House “We The People” website, is nearing 100,000 signatures, the threshold that would elicit an official White House response.

The new paragraph is reportedly being inserted into the part where Obama addresses the issue of immigration reform.

"https://adobochronicles.com/2014/08/04/u-s-food-and-drug-administration-approves-new-pills-to-cure-selfitis/","U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVES NEW PILLS TO CURE SELFITIS","Washington, D.C. (The Adobo Chronicles) – The. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today announced the approval of a new pill that would cure selfitis, the obsessive-compulsive urge to take photos of one’s self and posting them on social media.

Recently, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) officially classified selfie-taking as a mental disorder with three levels of the disease: borderline, acute and chronic.

The FDA announcement unveiled three color-coded pills that doctors can prescribe to their patients: green for borderline, blue for acute and red for chronic selfitis. In clinical trials conducted prior to the FDA approval, the pills showed an efficacy rate of plus or minus three percent.

The new pills are similar to FDA-approved drugs that fall under the category of SSRI, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, used to treat depression and anxiety. The new pills’ manufacturer, Actavis which recently acquired Forest Laboratories, said the new drug will be marketed under the brand name selpram . Forest Laboratories owns the brand name Celexa (citalopram) which is prescribed for depression.

The FDA announcement came as a huge relief to selfie addicts, a population that has grown to almost 1 Billion worldwide. Equally, Facebook and Instagram users will be spared from the agony of having to deal with their friends’ selfies all too frequently posted on their walls.

Selpram will be available in the market starting this fall.

"http://politicot.com/gop-rep-isis-will-force-nfl-play-burqas-dont-act/","GOP Rep.: ‘ISIS Will Force the NFL to Play in Burqas If We Don't Act’","HOUSTON—Representative Ted Poe, R-Texas, warned the Obama administration Wednesday that “ISIS will force the NFL to wear burqas and other forms of Islamic dress if we don’t act immediately.

“ISIS’s inevitable takeover of the NFL is a horrific vision. Burqas provide no head or body protection whatsoever. And by dressing all teams identically, ISIS will make it extremely difficult for NFL players to distinguish between their team members and opponents. How we will determine the true winner of this year’s Superbowl!” Mr. Poe added.

While ISIS has not specifically threatened to dress NFL players in Islamic garb during their violent messages to America, Mr. Poe sees redecorating the NFL as “ISIS’s most obvious next move.”

Prior to his address about ISIS’s NFL burqa Armageddon, Poe alerted the American people that ISIS could infiltrate the United States across the southern border. Poe predicts ISIS will call upon Mexican drug cartels to traffic terrorists into America, thus advising President Obama to strengthen security at the U.S.-Mexico border, not only as means to prevent illegal aliens from entering, but as a weapon for thwarting ISIS’s next act of terror against the NFL.

Poe’s premonition that ISIS will seep into America has been further validated by Gary Painter, sheriff of Midland County, Texas, who reported finding Qurans, Islamic clothing, and sketches of Dallas Cowboys players wearing full-length burqas scattered along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has seconded these concerns, stating that President Obama “needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home, before ISIS covertly enters NFL locker rooms across America and sends our athletes out onto the field dressed in burqas, which aren’t even supposed to be worn by men in the first place.”","2014-09-19 09:33:11","0","25.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","67.0","1.0","35.0","5","296","93.46","61.96","19.68","12.37","26.91","27.36","66.22","38.18","5.74","2.36","0.00","1.35","0.00","0.34","0.68","3.38","5.41","15.20","4.73","3.38","4.39","1.69","9.46","4.73","2.36","1.01","0.34","1.35","4.39","1.69","2.70","1.01","1.35","0.00","6.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","10.14","1.01","1.35","1.01","2.36","2.36","3.04","0.34","0.34","0.00","0.00","1.69","1.35","0.34","0.00","0.00","9.12","2.70","1.69","3.38","1.01","2.03","1.69","6.08","2.03","13.18","1.69","8.11","4.05","2.36","1.01","1.01","0.00","1.35","0.34","0.68","0.00","0.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.26","6.08","6.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.34","1.69","2.36","2.70","0.00","0.00","1477","9.0","34.0","454","289","13","48.94","13.6","11.9","14.05","14.9","78","7.583333333333334","21.675847750865053","197","31.22","28","0.38","0","7","0","21","0","38","16","0","1","6","38","70","1","18","0","1","4","4","16","0","0","1","11","0","13","7","8","8","4","10","1","1","0","1"
"http://politicot.com/leafs-losing-revealed-rigged/","Leafs Losing Revealed to be Rigged","CANADA- The famous failure of the Toronto Maple Leafs has been revealed to be a dirty game.

On Wednesday night, following the Leafs 4-3 defeat to Montreal, Toronto team captain Dion Phaneuf broke the ice by addressing the team’s constant failure to associated press.

“I can’t stand it any longer,” Phanuef raged. “We do not suck. Our scores are rigged by higher powers. Our losing is rigged!”

The team’s general manager, Dave Nonis, confirmed this rumour to be true.

“I’ve been skating around the idea of going public about this for years,” Nonis said in an interview Friday. “It’s true- our game is controlled by the gods of the seasons. We’re always walking on thin ice.”

Nonis went on to explain that the Seasons dictate the team’s losses. For example, he said, in winter time, the team’s abilities are frozen, whereas in spring, they being to bloom.

“Too bad for us we’re usually eliminated by the time spring rolls around,” Nonis added.

When asked for comment, the Seasons politely declined.

The Leafs play next on Saturday at 7pm against Pittsburgh. Captain Phaneuf reported that while his teammates have been putting in an exceptional amount of ice time and mental work to prepare for this game, he still doesn’t feel optimistic about the outcome.

“It’s autumn, after all,” he said. “And the Seasons say that in autumn, the Leafs must fall.”","2014-10-11 15:19:32","0","29.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","62.0","1.0","34.0","5","231","92.84","89.52","57.14","6.50","12.83","20.35","83.98","45.45","9.96","6.06","0.87","3.03","0.00","1.73","0.43","3.90","9.09","15.58","7.79","3.46","2.16","1.30","14.72","4.76","1.30","0.43","0.87","1.73","6.06","2.16","3.90","0.00","0.87","2.16","13.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.73","7.36","1.73","0.87","0.43","0.87","2.16","1.73","3.46","0.43","1.73","1.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.15","6.93","5.63","4.76","1.30","2.16","4.33","9.09","0.87","19.91","2.60","6.49","10.82","5.63","4.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.43","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","27.27","7.36","7.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.43","1.30","6.06","4.76","0.00","0.00","1056","7.5","15.125","315","230","18","75.4","9.2","5.9","10.48","8.2","47","5.0","15.293913043478263","153","14.56","3","0.46","0","2","3","26","0","33","15","1","0","2","39","26","0","11","0","0","13","4","6","1","0","0","7","0","10","12","7","9","9","5","0","0","0","1"

"http://politicot.com/nh-republican-calls-swimsuit-competition-decide-congressional-race/","NH Republican Calls for Swimsuit Competition","MANCHESTER, New Hampshire – Republican State Representative Steve Vaillancourt recently took to a political blog to explain why the current race for Congress between Democratic Representative Ann McLane Kuster and New Hampshire State Representative Marilinda Garcia will come down to which one is prettier. Vaillancourt suggested that since voters will want to vote for the more attractive woman, the two candidates should just hold a swimsuit competition to ‘show off the whole package.’

“Let’s be honest. Does anyone not believe that Congressman Annie Kuster is as ugly as sin? And I hope I haven’t offended sin,” wrote Vaillancourt on NH Insider, a blog dedicated to New Hampshire politics. “Get her in a swimsuit and people will be hurling in the aisles.”

In comparison, said Vaillancourt, Republican challenger Garcia is “one of the most attractive women on the political scene anywhere. Not so attractive as to be intimidating, but truly attractive. We’re talking smoking. I don’t know why she doesn’t just campaign in a bikini 24/7.”

Vaillancourt then compared Kuster to a drag queen, saying, “How ugly is Annie Kuster?… drag queens are more attractive than Annie Kuster… not that there’s anything wrong with that. Annie Kuster looks more like a drag queen than most men in drag.”

At the top of his post, Vaillancourt gave readers a warning. “The subject matter, although very real, may prove uncomfortable for some of my more sensitive readers,” Garcia wrote. “ Not as uncomfortable as a picture of Annie Kuster in a two-piece, but pretty uncomfortable.”

Garcia refused to stand behind her fellow Republican, calling him out for his “sexist” comments. “Both Rep. Kuster and I have experienced this unfortunate reality of being a woman in politics. I hope that as time moves forward and more female candidates run for political office around the country, people will focus on the content of our ideas rather than what we wear and how we look,” she said. “That being said, I so totally rock a bikini.”

In a follow-up post, Vaillancourt doubled down on his suggestion. “Facts are facts, and Kuster is one ugly woman. Put her and Garcia in bikinis and stand them next to each other, this race is over,” he said. “In fact, why stop there? Let ‘em go topless. Who doesn’t want to see Garcia’s boobs?”","2014-10-14 15:44:00","0","24.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","385","81.80","68.91","15.08","7.66","14.81","21.30","79.48","46.23","9.61","5.97","1.82","1.30","0.00","2.60","0.26","3.64","6.23","15.06","7.01","4.42","5.97","2.08","14.81","11.17","5.71","2.08","2.08","3.38","5.19","1.82","3.38","0.78","1.30","0.00","11.17","0.00","0.26","3.38","1.82","10.91","1.30","1.56","1.56","2.60","1.56","3.38","2.86","1.30","1.30","0.00","0.78","0.52","0.00","0.26","0.26","7.53","1.30","1.30","4.68","0.52","0.78","2.08","9.87","2.08","12.47","2.34","7.27","2.86","3.12","1.30","0.00","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","22.86","6.49","5.97","0.00","0.00","1.04","0.00","0.52","6.23","2.34","0.00","0.26","1830","7.37","20.68421052631579","576","384","26","64.91","11.0","7.9","11.3","9.6","73","9.0","15.524166666666668","211","18.95","8","0.46","0","11","7","30","0","46","23","2","2","6","49","57","0","17","0","0","17","6","24","4","1","5","11","0","20","12","8","4","13","10","1","1","0","4"
"http://politicot.com/john-mccain-sexiest-caliph/","Bloggers Claim John McCain Named 1996's Sexiest Caliph, Rand Paul Weighs in","New York-For the last few months it’s been reported, in a plethora of conspiratorial blogs based in the United States, that Senator John McCain (R-AZ) is not only part of ISIS, but had been named the Muslim World’s Sexiest Caliph in 1996. Despite McCain calling the rumors “unsubstantiated and absolutely ridiculous” questions about his involvement with the putative pageant continue to hound him.

McCain has spent a great deal of the last few months attempting to discredit rumors that he not only helped start ISIS, but is bedmates with the groups leader. The rumors were originated by a number of pictures McCain-some of which he shared on his twitter account-posed for with members of the Free Syrian Army. In the photos many of the bloggers have claimed that a man in the background looks suspiciously similar too ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghadadi. Though the only proof that’s been offered anent McCain’s involvement with ISIS has been the photos Mccain posted on his twitter, and other doctored photos, the rumors continue to persist.דפשמ>

On Monday the website ScarcytruthsforpatritoicseekersoftruthwhoalawaysknewthetruthwastheAmericanGovenmentisevil.com, published photos of the senator dressed in the traditional garb of a Caliph, holding a bouquet of assorted flowers, and posing on stage in front of a giant curtain that reads “Mr. Muslim World’s Sexiest Caliph 1996”.

Mccain, speaking earlier today, said of the new photo, “That’s… Do I even need to respond to questions about something so absurd? I’m a war hero damnit!

"http://politicot.com/republicans-prefer-putin-rather-obama-us-presidency/","The Republicans prefer Putin rather Than Obama for US presidency","WASHINGTON DC – Pat Buchanan: “if only Putin would have been leader of the free world and Obama of Russia”.

An unnamed source from the Republican party has openly stated that the general opinion within the party is that Obama is leading the country into doomsday recession, which has a twofold effect on world events: primarily, it is felt that such practice is diminishing the power and significance of American presence worldwide, while countries like Russia and China are increasing theirs.

Secondly, the symbolism of the Russian president has become incredibly potent in recent years, which is why an increasing number of American politicians (and especially republican ones) are openly admitting to admiring Vladimir Putin!

The fact to the matter is that world leaders with the kind of charisma that, for example, Kennedy had will never be born again, but it seems that the “iron bear” (how Putin is often referred to) is slowly managing to do the impossible. In fact, there have even been rumors that several party officials have stated that they would rather have a vodka or watch a hockey game with Putin than have a conversation with Obama! Additionally, it’s no secret that people just don’t like the fact that Obama keeps hiding that he’s a Muslim, unlike Putin who has on several occasions pointed out his belief in the Christian Orthodox Church.

Furthermore, they say that not only is Putin widely praised for his perseverance when it comes to the representation of Russia’s global socio-economic interests, but he is also being openly admired by several prominent republican party members, who feel that his charisma and relentlessness are exemplary characteristics of a global leader. The republicans’ next step remains to be seen, but it will undoubtedly be a very light one.

Who would you prefer as President of the United States? PUTIN

"http://politicot.com/republican-calls-bombing-dallas-stop-ebola-spread/","Republican Calls For Bombing Dallas to Stop Ebola Spread","South Carolina – Todd Kincannon, the former general counsel and executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party, used social media to give life to his solution to the Ebola crisis. Via Twitter, Kincannon called for anyone who contracts Ebola to be executed. Later, he upped the ante by saying any city where Ebola has been confirmed should be bombed off the face of the Earth, starting with Dallas.

“People with Ebola in the U.S. need to be humanely put down immediately,” he said through Twitter. “The protocol for a positive Ebola test should be immediate humane execution and sanitization of the whole area. That will save lives.”

When asked what he meant by the term ‘sanitization’ he responded, “Bomb them back to the stone age. Use nukes. Dallas must be wiped off the map.”

His Tweets sparked some outrage among many. Some pointed out that killing 1.25 million people after a single case of Ebola had been confirmed seemed excessive. Kincannon disagreed, Tweeting, “Ebola has a strong transmission vector through health care personnel. No effective way to contain while treating. Mass extermination only viable alternative.”

Aware that stopping the spread of Ebola in the U.S. was only the first step, Kincannon advocated using nuclear weapons on infected areas in Africa, saying the people of Africa have only themselves to blame.

“The people of Africa are to blame for why it’s so shitty,” he tweeted. “They could stop eating each other and learn calculus at any time… We need to be napalming villages from the air right now. No reason not to start with Dallas.”

This is not the first time Kincannon has used Twitter to post controversial remarks. He previously used the social media channel to mock Florida shooting victim Trayvon Martin, call for transgendered individuals to be placed in concentration camps, lament that Michael Prysner- an Iraq war veteran who became an anti-war protester- didn’t come home in a body bag, and saying that Ray Rice had every right to beat his fiance.

He has also long made a series of statements insulting and degrading Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, whom, in his most recent series of Tweets, he claimed was key to his anti-Ebola plan.

“We should put Wendy Davis’ vagina in charge of the Ebola outbreak,” he Tweeted. “It will kill all of them without mercy and go to Nordstrom’s afterwards.”","2014-10-07 13:12:31","0","26.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","62.0","1.0","35.0","3","396","91.52","87.73","11.00","3.73","17.22","20.71","78.54","42.68","8.59","5.05","0.00","0.51","0.00","3.54","1.01","3.54","7.07","14.39","7.32","2.78","2.53","1.52","15.15","2.53","1.26","1.77","1.26","3.28","4.80","1.26","3.54","0.00","2.78","0.00","14.39","0.25","0.25","0.00","3.79","9.85","2.53","2.53","1.77","1.77","1.01","1.52","1.26","0.00","1.26","0.00","2.53","1.01","1.01","0.25","0.51","8.33","3.54","1.26","2.78","0.25","0.76","5.05","7.07","0.76","14.90","1.26","8.08","5.56","1.52","1.26","0.25","0.00","0.25","1.52","1.01","0.25","0.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.43","7.07","4.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","4.29","1.26","0.00","0.00","1890","8.22","21.157894736842106","589","395","25","63.9","11.0","8.3","11.54","10.1","95","7.833333333333334","17.940253164556964","251","19.63","4","0.43","0","6","3","37","0","41","29","0","0","8","58","58","0","18","0","0","17","5","15","0","1","3","17","0","21","21","13","11","3","9","1","4","0","3"
"http://politicot.com/judge-accused-domestic-abuse-suspended-two-hearings/","Judge Accused of Domestic Abuse is Suspended Two Hearings","MONTGOMERY, Ala.— As Judge Mark E. Fuller explains it, the best defense is a strong offense. His offense: strong-arming his wife, Kelli Fuller, after she confronted him in August with suspicions that he had been unfaithful. Now his defense team is fighting for leniency in the face of a two-hearing suspension designed to allow time for Judge Fuller to “cool off” and provide his wife “the opportunity to apologize for her mistrustful behavior.”

“I deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve these difficulties with my family, where they should be resolved,” said Judge Fuller in a statement. “What is clear is that my wife needs space to think about how she can begin to repair the reputational damage she caused me.”

Before he accepts an apology from his wife, Judge Fuller suggested that “Kelli needs to work on her own issues first,” presumably referring to the visible lacerations to her mouth and forehead noted in the police report.

Judge Fuller went on to say, “Kelli and I had a long talk, and she’s adamant that I not be at home right now. Suspending me from court would leave me no option but to ferment my marital strife with a bottle of Jack Daniels in the den.”

Terri Sewell—a Democrat representing the state of Alabama, which includes the district over which Fuller presides—sees it differently. Said Sewell, “If an NFL player can lose his job because of domestic violence, then a federal judge should definitely not be allowed to keep his lifetime appointment to the federal bench.”

After taking more than a month to “gauge public opinion” over judge Fuller’s behavior, some state politicians even have come to the conclusion that Fuller should resign, so as to protect the judicial system from “a public relations nightmare.”

Rep. Marlin Richards noted, “I have to thank TMZ, Ray Rice, and [NFL] Commissioner Goodell for bringing the issue of domestic violence perpetrated by public figures to the fore. Without heroes like them to stir public outcry, we probably would’ve turned a blind eye to this whole Judge Fuller affair.”

Still, removing a judge from the bench by force can be difficult—if not impossible—for abuses not directly related to court proceedings, even after felony convictions.

For now, the commissioner of U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has indicated that criminal offenders who wish to return their sentences issued by Judge Fuller are entitled to a retrial or a free pizza, whichever is given less value.","2014-09-21 19:39:05","0","27.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","48.0","31.0","0.0","65.0","1.0","35.0","4","422","91.60","67.37","13.76","10.72","23.44","22.04","82.23","47.39","11.14","7.35","2.37","0.24","0.00","4.03","0.71","3.79","7.58","16.35","5.92","2.84","3.79","1.42","11.14","6.64","4.98","1.66","0.47","0.95","7.35","3.08","4.27","0.24","1.42","0.71","10.66","1.18","0.00","2.61","2.37","11.14","3.08","1.42","2.84","1.66","0.71","2.61","2.61","1.42","0.95","0.24","1.66","0.95","0.24","0.00","0.47","10.43","1.90","2.13","5.45","0.71","1.42","2.13","9.00","0.47","13.27","2.37","6.87","4.50","1.66","0.47","1.18","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","16.82","4.74","5.45","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.47","4.74","0.71","0.00","0.47","1987","8.84","47.333333333333336","610","416","17","55.07","13.3","11.7","12.02","14.4","105","8.4","21.896153846153847","258","40.11","11","0.46","0","8","2","37","0","53","27","2","1","8","65","49","0","14","0","0","20","13","21","0","0","0","24","0","27","10","9","12","6","12","2","2","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/free-lap-dance-to-hillary/","Democrat Candidate A Former Male Stripper; Offers Free Lap-Dance To Hillary Clinton","“John Burkhalter, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor in Arkansas, used to be a male stripper before getting into politics, and he’s not embarrassed to talk about it, apparently. According to an interview Burkhalter gave to a CBS affiliate in Arkansas, 5NEWS, being a male stripper in Little Rock was one of the many “tough jobs” he had in his past.

“Asked about being portrayed as a candidate with a “different background, from Chippendales dancer to multi-millionaire”, Burkhalter openly said “I did have that job for a while, a very short time. It was when I was in Little Rock; I’ve always been an athlete, and I was actually buying cows from a farm.”

“The Democratic candidate also stated “I had like 17 acres in a little place called Billy Goat Hill, which is in North Pulaski County, and I was trying to make my way in life”.

But, what surprised during his interview the most is the fact that, apparently, stripping is like riding a bicycle: one never forgets how to do it (or loses the appetite for it).

“I’ll tell ya, stripping is one of those things that you can stop doing for a while, but it keeps on lurking beneath the surface, and pops up every now and then”, he continued. “Considering I was into bodybuilding in my younger days, stripping seemed like a quick way to earn some extra cash. I’ve had a lot of women in my day, but I have to admit that Hillary (Clinton) is one lady I wouldn’t mind revisiting my old ways for once again”, Burkhalter said.

Whether the former US Secretary of State has an irresistible aura or it’s just Burkhalter who sees something special in her is unclear; however, any woman who makes a man want to go back to his wicked ways for her is special, and Burkhalter agrees: “I wouldn’t even mind giving her a lap dance, and that has nothing to do with the fact that we’re members of the same party.”","2014-10-30 18:18:41","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","337","68.00","60.54","44.56","41.89","33.70","18.69","85.46","56.38","14.24","8.61","4.75","0.59","0.59","2.67","0.00","5.64","8.31","15.13","10.68","4.75","6.23","1.48","17.21","4.45","2.97","2.08","2.08","2.08","2.97","1.78","0.89","0.30","0.30","0.30","10.68","0.00","0.00","1.78","2.67","10.39","0.89","1.19","0.89","3.56","1.78","2.97","0.89","0.30","0.59","0.00","0.89","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.30","4.45","1.78","0.89","1.19","0.59","0.59","5.93","9.50","0.59","15.13","0.89","8.01","6.53","2.67","2.08","0.00","0.59","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.47","2.97","7.42","0.59","0.59","0.00","0.00","0.30","5.04","2.37","1.19","0.00","1451","8.03","38.333333333333336","462","336","10","54.29","12.9","14.0","9.7","16.8","58","12.375","22.34476190476191","199","33.56","15","0.54","0","12","7","34","0","41","21","1","0","1","44","27","0","10","0","0","24","9","18","0","1","1","12","0","13","19","14","4","7","18","2","3","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/oklahoma-state-house-candidate-says-gays-able-choose-stoning-crucifixion/","Oklahoma State House Candidate Says Gays Should Be Able to Choose Between Stoning and Crucifixion","TULSA, Okla. – An Oklahoma magazine discovered this week that current Tea Party State House candidate Scott Esk endorsed stoning gay people to death. “I think we would be totally in the right to do it,” he wrote last summer in a Facebook post. “That [stoning gay people to death] goes against some parts of libertarianism, I realize, and I’m largely libertarian, but ignoring as a nation things that are worthy of death is very remiss.”

When pressed recently to explain the post, Esk admitted that he may have been overly harsh. “As a libertarian, I believe in personal choice,” he said. “Therefore I think it only fair that gay people be given a choice between stoning and crucifixion when they are put to death.”

Asked why he thought gay individuals deserved to be put to death, Esk spoke with passion about his faith. “That was done in the Old Testament under a law that came directly from God and in that time there it was totally just. It came directly from God, he said. “I know what was done in the Old Testament and what was done back then was what’s just. … And I do stand for Biblical morality.”

Esk explained that his decision to accept for crucifixion as an allowable alternative to stoning came after much soul searching. “On the one hand, our Lord Jesus was crucified, and I wouldn’t want any gay person to feel close to Jesus,” he said. “But on the other hand, death by stoning is relatively quick while a crucifixion can last for days. It’s really all about maximizing the suffering of the gays.”

He said some of his fellow Republicans who were Hell-bent on stoning or nothing were out of step with the times. “I understand the desire to pelt gays with heavy stones until they die, but we have to remember to think like Jesus,” he said. “And I’m pretty sure Jesus would find it in His heart to crucify a gay if they asked.”

Pressed if he would lobby for legislation that would condemn gay people to a Biblical death if elected, Esk hesitated. “I never said I would author legislation to put homosexuals to death,” he clarified. “But I didn’t have a problem with it.”","2014-06-11 16:26:19","0","26.0","7.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","70.0","1.0","35.0","6","376","62.02","65.52","32.95","45.30","17.09","18.09","91.22","53.19","15.16","8.78","3.46","0.80","0.00","3.72","0.80","6.38","5.59","14.89","9.84","4.52","6.12","1.06","19.95","3.99","1.60","1.86","0.27","1.33","5.05","2.93","1.86","0.27","0.27","0.27","11.44","0.00","0.27","0.00","3.99","15.69","5.32","0.80","3.19","2.66","2.13","3.46","3.99","0.27","1.86","1.86","3.99","0.80","0.00","2.93","0.27","3.99","1.33","0.00","1.86","0.27","0.53","8.51","8.24","0.53","13.03","2.13","5.32","5.32","0.53","0.80","0.27","0.00","5.32","3.72","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.41","6.12","4.79","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.27","6.12","1.60","0.00","0.53","1632","6.92","23.875","534","377","21","70.13","11.3","8.0","8.81","9.0","57","8.7","15.247745358090185","201","21.38","14","0.5","0","12","1","28","0","46","22","0","0","7","46","29","1","14","0","0","35","5","18","0","0","0","18","0","18","28","9","11","17","5","4","4","0","3"
"http://politicot.com/mississippi-tea-party-challenger/","Mississippi Tea Party Challenger Offers $1,000 for Proof Black Conservatives Don’t Exist","WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate hopeful and tea party candidate Chris McDaniel isn’t ready to concede victory to Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., just yet. McDaniel announced that he would provide a $1,000 reward to anyone who is able to bring forward proof of fraud in last month’s Mississippi Republican primary, in which his competitor received 7,000 more votes.

“Specifically, what my campaign needs is incontrovertible proof that black conservatives don’t exist,” McDaniel said on an interview with CNN’s Kate Bolduan. “I mean let’s be honest here. Cochran won because of the black vote. Yet, as we all know, blacks don’t vote Republican. Something’s rotten in Mississippi, Kate, and it’s not just the stench from the Delta.”

McDaniel realizes that his “theory on black conservatives” is a mere gut feeling and requires some form of empirical proof, though, which led to his idea for offering a reward. He has urged political researchers, members of academia, and even blacks themselves to provide hard evidence that blacks are incapable of either registering as Republicans or voting for Republicans.

“Charts, regression analyses, an official declaration from Al Sharpton–I’ll take whatever I can get to show that these people couldn’t have legitimately voted for this crook,” continued state Sen. McDaniel, whose distrust of Cochran has existed since at least last month, when he hired poll watchers to oversee voting operations in those black communities courted by the incumbent senator.

McDaniel later admitted that since his announcement, he has received a wide array of underwhelming responses, including a hand-written letter reading, “I’m black and only vote for Democrats. Where’s my $1,000?”

“It’s a step in the right direction, but we’ll need something a bit stronger,” said McDaniel. “If nobody gives me what I’m looking for, I guess I’ll just bang my drum a little harder. Saying something enough times usually becomes the truth anyway.”","2014-07-07 21:28:53","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","312","64.27","62.57","13.65","56.01","18.35","26.92","77.24","44.23","14.74","7.37","3.53","0.96","0.00","2.56","0.32","7.37","5.13","11.86","7.37","4.17","4.17","1.92","15.38","4.81","2.56","2.88","1.92","1.92","4.17","2.88","1.28","0.00","0.32","0.32","9.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.56","12.82","2.88","1.60","1.92","3.53","1.92","2.24","5.45","2.24","0.96","1.60","1.28","0.64","0.32","0.00","0.32","7.69","1.92","2.24","3.53","1.92","0.32","2.56","10.58","1.28","10.26","1.92","4.49","5.13","3.53","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.64","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.32","25.96","6.09","8.65","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.64","4.49","5.13","0.00","0.64","1555","8.6","25.307692307692307","473","307","18","62.58","12.1","8.8","13.57","12.4","80","5.6875","19.263452768729646","212","23.85","12","0.43","0","7","6","21","0","36","27","2","1","2","52","34","3","15","0","0","18","7","15","0","0","0","8","0","12","11","8","7","15","13","4","3","1","1"
"http://politicot.com/cuccinelli-conservative-wants-to-ban-teenage-bdsm-in-virginia/","‘Cuccinelli Conservative’ Wants To Ban Teenage BDSM In Virginia","RICHMOND, Va. – Announcing that “youngsters are getting a little too kinky,” a Virginia legislator has pushed a new law that would make it a felony for teenagers to engage in sex acts involving bondage, discipline, and sadomasochism, also known as BDSM.

“It’s just not right,” said Virginia state legislator and self-described “Cuccinelli conservative” Thomas Garrett (R). “Let’s say a nubile young woman of only 17 is getting into leather, and maybe she wants to experiment with her cherubic, slightly younger boyfriend. Maybe tie him up and make him bite her toes—not hard, just like a simpering nibble—well that sort of thing doesn’t belong in Virginia.”

Garrett’s attack on underage fetish is part of a new bill that would bring back much of Virginia’s “Crimes Against Nature” law, which federal courts declared unconstitutional months ago.

“Here’s another scenario for you,” Garrett began during a packed legislative session. “Two young men come home after football practice, and because they’re still jacked on testosterone, they take off their shirts to reveal powerful, bronzed upper-bodies and go out to the woodshed. Maybe they find a length of rope—strong, thick rope. Virginia currently has no law that would stop these two strapping young specimens from experimenting with all those strands of jute and shafts of lumber, which is why Old Dominion must demand that senate bill 14 be passed!”","2014-01-13 11:29:57","0","21.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","229","74.33","75.77","10.69","41.56","22.90","22.71","78.17","43.67","10.48","4.37","0.00","0.44","0.44","2.18","1.31","6.11","4.37","12.66","6.11","5.68","4.37","1.75","14.41","4.80","1.75","1.31","1.75","1.75","1.75","1.31","0.44","0.00","0.44","0.00","9.17","0.00","0.44","1.75","1.75","9.17","1.31","2.18","2.18","1.75","0.87","1.31","2.62","0.44","0.87","1.31","5.24","1.31","0.44","3.49","0.00","8.30","1.31","0.87","4.80","1.31","0.44","2.18","10.04","0.44","15.28","2.18","6.11","7.42","2.18","0.44","0.44","0.87","0.00","0.00","0.87","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.44","0.00","22.27","3.93","6.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.87","6.11","3.06","0.87","0.00","1124","8.1","29.5","323","225","9","63.02","12.7","10.7","13.58","15.9","46","12.875","20.177777777777777","171","27.38","3","0.39","0","7","4","14","0","25","21","1","0","4","38","20","0","12","1","0","11","2","20","0","0","2","4","0","12","6","5","7","6","8","5","0","0","1"
"http://politicot.com/women-against-birth-control/","Group of Women Protest Against Birth Control","LOS ANGELES, CA – A large group of women decided to put a stop to the feminist movement that has plagued the country for the better of fifty years. Mightily holding up signs that read, “TELL US WHAT TO DO WITH OUR BODIES” AND “MY UTERUS IS YOUR UTERUS,” Stacey Wilson and Rita Johnson are clearly passionate about their rights – or rather, their right to not have rights.

“I’m just sick of women needing all this contraception mumbo jumbo,” Stacey fumed. “I have no idea how my menstrual cycle works, and why should I? I think we need to trust our government officials. These men know our bodies better than we do.”

“I agree,” chimed in Rita. “I have never used contraception, and my life has been much better for it. Sure, I have six children with five different men and none of us can afford them, but God loves me so it’s a fair trade off.”

Stacey, Rita and fifteen other anti-feminists gathered outside a Planned Parenthood on Monday afternoon to share their opinions with unsuspecting women walking in for their pelvic exam appointments. They handed out pamphlets titled “How To Surrender Your Body To Your Government” and “Leave Your Sexual Health To The Pros. P.S. It’s Not You,” and tried to convince women not to go into the sexual health center.

The group of women will hold a condom-burning event in Hollywood over the weekend.

"http://politicot.com/news-crew-quarantined-order-politicians-fearing-apocalypse/","News Crew Quarantined Under Order By Politicians Fearing Apocalypse","NEW JERSY – It should come as no surprise that in recent weeks there has been a heightened awareness of public health hazards that threaten the well being of the public. Government agencies, law enforcement, medical professionals, and even airlines have taken to new guidelines to try and prevent the spread of diseases across the country. However, one news crew is finding those guidelines rather – solitary.

According to reports a news crew recently returned from Liberia have been taken into custody for Quarantine. The reason? Zombie Apocalypse.

As shocking as this sounds, it seems that local officials were weary on taking the chance that the walking dead could, in fact, become a reality on the streets of New Jersey. While no names have been released, facts on the case have been made known to the public.

Sources from New Jersey Department of Health report that the members of the news crew who work for an affiliate of a major news outlet were recently on assignment in the African country of Liberia. The crew, whose names have not yet been released, were apparently traveling a region of the country where the Ebola virus had wiped out whole villages.

So, why are they being quarantined now?

Apparently footage recovered from the crew’s trip, indicate that some of the dead affected by the virus, reanimated hours after their demise. Sources say that while the crew may not exhibit signs or symptoms of Ebola, they could however be infected with a mutant strain that could cause them to become part of the walking dead.

This new order for mandatory quarantine was not a surprise to some. While on location, the news crew’s cameraman did become infected with the Ebola Virus. The other member’s of the crew had agreed to a state of voluntary quarantine upon return to the United States as per the standards for those considered to be at low probability for infection. Despite the fact that the rest of the members of said crew remain symptom free, the suggestion that the virus had mutated to reanimate the dead remains a concern for local politicians.

Be that as it may, sources close to the Health Department have said that the quarantine order came down from other levels of government. Rumors abound that evidence this strain of Ebola creates Zombies has politician’s clamoring to eliminate the problem before it gets started.

Although initially reported to be a memoir, “Hard Choices”is actually an alternative history novel in which Hillary Clinton was elected president in 2008 over Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

The book, which begins with Sen. Barack Obama suspending his campaign for the Democratic nomination in June 2008, offers a gripping and vivid portrayal of the fictitious Clinton presidency. The novel features behind-the-scenes glimpses at several pivotal moments in the Clinton presidency, from the successful launch of the Hillarycare website, to the campaign to depose Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in 2013 after he crossed the so-called “Clinton Red Line” when he used chemical weapons on civilians.

In addition, significant detail is given to the hunt for Osama bin Laden, culminating in the raid that killed the terrorist mastermind in May 2011. Clinton fantasizes that the search for the al-Qaeda leader “was an obsession I pursued relentlessly from Day 1.

“I’ll never forget the moment when [then-CIA Director] Leon Panetta looked me in the eyes and said, ‘Madam President, we just can’t know it’s [bin Laden]. We need more time,’ ” reads an excerpt from Chapter 11, “Justice Done.” “I looked right back at him and said, ‘Leon, the American people have already waited 10 years. Send in the SEALs.’”

“Hard Choices” is widely seen as a publicity generator for Clinton’s upcoming presidential run. The Wall Street Journal described it as a first draft of her 2016 convention speech. Political pundits are already praising the choice to write an alternative history novel as a classic Clinton maneuver, saying that a fictitious universe of her own imagination creates distance from the controversy-soaked Obama administration.

“Hard Choices”isn’t all roses, however; Clinton readily admits her pretend mistakes, and doesn’t attempt to explain away or shift blame. Clinton is particularly harsh on herself for failing to reverse the losses of the ‘08-‘09 recession until late 2011 and concedes that her green energy initiatives “didn’t go nearly as far as they should have,” to combat climate change.

Reactions to “Hard Choices”have been divided. “Even in her fictitious world, Hillary Clinton succumbs to failed policies that punish our nation’s business leaders and damage America’s standing abroad,” said Speaker John Boehner, who is occasionally referred to as “former Rep. Boehner” in the novel.","2014-06-05 11:38:40","0","24.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","421","94.31","66.56","24.52","5.50","21.05","31.12","72.92","40.38","7.13","4.51","0.95","0.71","0.00","2.61","0.24","2.61","9.50","13.54","4.99","3.09","4.99","1.19","10.93","5.70","2.14","1.43","3.09","1.19","4.75","1.43","3.33","0.48","1.19","0.95","7.84","0.00","0.00","1.90","0.95","9.03","2.85","1.90","0.71","0.95","0.71","2.14","5.46","2.14","1.43","1.90","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.08","0.71","2.38","5.94","0.24","0.71","4.28","5.70","0.95","14.25","1.19","6.89","6.41","4.99","1.66","0.00","0.71","0.00","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.75","4.75","5.23","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","2.14","7.36","3.09","0.00","0.95","2130","9.58","28.8","654","411","20","50.57","12.9","11.3","14.39","14.6","128","7.25","22.697420924574214","274","26.8","6","0.39","0","8","12","41","0","48","34","1","0","2","70","68","2","16","0","0","14","7","22","0","0","0","12","0","13","15","8","8","9","15","3","2","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/preexisting-condition-precludes-al-qaidas-life-insurance-payout/","Preexisting Condition Precludes Al-Qaida's Life Insurance Payout","BEIRUT — Al-Qaida members may be asked to give up their life in the name of jihad, but their job benefits were historically considered sacrosanct. With its leadership now splintered and resources stretched, the terrorist organization has been forced to make cutbacks in their once generous offerings.

The family of the late Majid Al-Majid, former commander of a Sunni militant group linked to al-Qaida, filed an official complaint with the group’s office of martyr resources after he died while in Lebanese custody this past Saturday.

“My husband died protecting the principles of the Abdullah Azzam Brigades,” said al-Majid’s widow, referring to the al-Qaida-linked Sunni militant group he headed. “The least the organization could do is provide the life insurance payout we were promised.”

Prior to Osama bin Laden’s death in 2011, al-Qaida “functioned really like a multinational,” said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University.

Married members were entitled to a monthly salary and a week of vacation for every three worked under the old regime. This is in addition to the 72 virgins promised to jihadist martyrs, according to some interpretations of the Quran.

A representative from the office of martyr resources acknowledged that “current circumstances compelled a reduction in benefits,” but refused to provide updated policy details.

“Al-Majid’s preexisting kidney condition contributed to his death,” the unnamed representative explained. “We cannot be held responsible for his ultimate demise. At best, he’s looking at 12 virgins in the afterlife.”

The leader’s kidney troubles brought about his demise in more ways than one. Al-Majid was originally detained in an ambulance after he had undergone dialysis late last year.

Lebanese state-run media reported that al-Majid died “after his health conditions deteriorated” in a central military hospital.

The hospital’s chief nephrologist Farid Faysal explained that, “most deaths I see follow some sort of a deterioration of health. In fact, all of them do.”

Continued Faysal, “Fortunately, my union fights to ensure that my insurance would cover such eventualities. They make it clear to my employers that they’re either with us or against us, in terms of our insurance and 401(k) plan.”","2014-01-13 08:28:37","0","28.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","55.0","1.0","35.0","3","361","96.84","83.39","20.55","35.44","19.00","27.70","78.67","40.72","8.86","6.37","1.39","1.39","0.00","2.22","1.39","2.49","8.31","15.24","5.26","1.66","1.94","0.28","10.53","3.88","3.05","0.00","1.94","3.05","3.32","1.94","1.39","0.55","0.28","0.00","12.19","1.11","0.00","0.00","2.49","9.14","2.22","1.11","0.55","1.66","1.66","2.22","1.39","0.83","0.55","0.00","2.77","0.55","1.66","0.55","0.00","10.53","3.88","1.39","4.99","0.83","0.55","5.54","5.54","0.55","13.02","1.11","5.82","6.09","5.54","0.55","0.28","1.39","1.66","2.22","0.28","0.00","0.28","0.28","0.00","0.00","21.05","5.26","4.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.05","4.99","2.22","0.55","0.00","1838","9.24","23.0625","567","350","19","52.8","13.8","10.5","14.79","13.8","104","11.125","21.245714285714286","229","21.81","3","0.41","0","6","6","36","0","48","28","0","2","3","66","36","0","25","0","0","13","12","6","1","1","1","13","0","11","27","5","14","5","4","0","0","0","0"
"http://politicot.com/colorado-gop-tests-new-strategy-sends-gunmen-doors-hesitant-voters/","Colorado GOP Tests New Strategy, Sends Gunmen to Doors of Hesitant Voters","DENVER, Colo. – Throughout the nation, GOP hopefuls have recently begun offering voters who submit personal contact information to their campaign websites and e-mailing lists the chance to win a firearm through number-based raffles.

Though a relatively unexploited political maneuver, such gun raffles have been used to collect information during a California race for sheriff, a Senate primary in South Carolina, and an unsuccessful gubernatorial run in Colorado. Though he was unsuccessful in making the Republican ballot, state Sen. Greg Brophy also ran his own gun sweepstakes while campaigning for governor of Colorado.

Brophy was quoted in an April 19th interview with Patriots, Pecs, and Ammo Magazine saying, “This gun sweepstakes, it’s just the beginning. These men and women who are entering the raffles are Republicans anyway. Now the next step is we gots [sic] to figure out how to get these people to the polls.”

In cooperation with the fundraising group Sons and Daughters of Constitutional Soil, a new Colorado GOP-sponsored website has since been launched. The site attempts to solicit volunteers to “help get hesitant voters to the polls, and, more importantly, educate them on why they should vote right”, according to the website’s mission statement.

The website, VOTEORWE’LLBLOWYOURSKULLAPART.COM, so far has already received 50,000 hits and attracted upwards of a 1,000 volunteers.

A request from the site owners for further information has been ignored, though an excerpt from an instructional handbook, normally available only to volunteers, has been obtained by Newslo.

It reads, in part, “To attract voters who might be hesitant to vote, and vote right, we are embarking on a new strategy in which we send armed volunteers to the homes of anyone who has not submitted contact information to our gun raffles… If, after gentle prodding, they still seem undecided or hesitant in voting, we suggest firing a warning shot just to let them know this is serious business. Perhaps aim at a birdbath or vanity mailbox. If the warning shot doesn’t produce the desired effect, more extreme measures are encouraged.”

State Sen. Brophy, when queried on the Colorado GOP’s new strategy responded,

“Look, man. No one’s doing anything illegal. You’re allowed to go door to door here. And to be honest if we have to blow a skull apart it’s only because these people still refuse to vote, and, to be entirely honest now, that scares us.”

He continued, “So really we’re just standing our political ground like a political Zimmerman, and what’s wrong with that? When Jay Z said ‘Vote or Die,’ he’s on all your musical televisions. But when we actually carry the warning out, we’re demonized by the liberal media. Now isn’t that the real issue here?”","2014-04-29 09:16:33","0","27.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","453","77.00","84.51","20.77","13.75","18.88","26.93","76.38","47.46","9.05","4.86","0.00","2.43","0.44","0.88","1.10","4.19","7.95","12.58","7.51","6.62","6.62","0.88","13.25","4.42","1.32","2.43","0.88","1.32","5.08","1.99","2.87","0.88","0.00","0.44","11.48","0.44","0.44","0.44","1.55","10.82","2.21","2.43","1.32","3.53","0.44","3.31","1.77","1.10","0.66","0.00","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.71","3.31","1.32","3.31","1.10","1.55","2.87","9.05","0.22","12.80","1.99","5.96","5.08","1.99","0.66","1.32","0.22","0.00","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","21.19","5.30","8.83","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.66","2.43","3.09","0.00","0.44","2211","8.87","25.833333333333332","701","447","24","52.6","12.6","10.5","12.88","12.4","122","11.2","20.357225950783","283","23.22","9","0.46","0","15","5","42","0","43","39","0","0","2","62","40","1","28","0","0","20","5","28","2","0","2","22","0","22","11","15","17","20","13","1","5","0","5"
"http://politicot.com/love-story-white-house/","Love Story in the White House","On September 19th, 2014 a man by the name of Omar Gonzalez (42) became one of the selected few in the history of America who made it past the heavy security and into the White House. Having scaled the fence and run across the lawn, Gonzalez was able to slip through an unlocked door just prior to being tackled.

While this is not a new embarrassment for the Secret Service (the elite agency has been severely criticized for the many recent lapses of its agents and personnel), its reason might be. Namely, although the director (now former) of the US Secret Service, Julia Pierson, didn’t state it directly during a White House oversight committee hearing regarding the incident, a rumor has it that Gonzalez attempted to reach the US President because he had, and get a load of this – a huge crush on him!

Officials categorically deny such a claim and that’s completely understandable, considering the fact that Barrack Obama is the current President of one of the most powerful and influential countries on the planet. But, if he’s charming enough to inspire a married man of 42 years old to “come out of the closet” just because of him, then surely he should be capable of solving much more difficult global issues, wouldn’t you say?

Gonzalez was even successful enough to make it to the White House’s first floor and the East Room thanks to the fact that he pushed the unsuspecting guard from his way when he entered the unlocked door. Unfortunately for him, his love, Mr. Obama had left the White House some 10 minutes ago via helicopter. Apparently, in the end love doesn’t conquer all.

Although men have done insane things in the name of love in the past, breaking into the White House for a little r n’r between two married men is borderline incomprehensible. Then again, where better to hide such a secret than in plain sight? The incident is a demonstration of the power of raw sexual attraction; luckily (or maybe not) for the US President, the agent who tackled Gonzalez was probably a republican. Who knows what would have happened if he was a democrat.","2014-10-12 15:32:11","0","8.0","2.0","18.0","2.0","1.0","0.0","21.0","17.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","9.0","0","364","92.28","75.40","23.97","62.24","28.00","20.60","87.09","51.65","8.79","4.12","0.00","0.82","0.27","3.02","0.00","4.67","12.91","13.46","7.69","3.85","5.22","1.37","12.09","6.32","1.65","1.65","2.20","1.92","4.67","3.30","1.37","0.27","0.27","0.00","9.89","0.55","0.00","0.00","4.12","11.81","3.02","1.65","1.37","3.02","1.92","2.75","2.47","1.65","0.55","0.27","1.10","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","8.79","2.20","2.47","3.57","0.82","1.10","5.22","6.32","0.82","15.38","1.37","7.42","6.59","3.30","0.00","2.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.55","0.00","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.74","3.02","4.95","0.00","0.27","0.55","0.27","0.00","0.55","1.92","2.20","0.00","1652","8.35","28.46153846153846","531","364","14","53.55","13.5","12.3","10.28","13.7","79","12.0","21.08131868131868","218","24.77","3","0.49","0","9","8","51","1","52","33","1","0","3","49","39","0","11","1","0","14","4","25","1","1","0","9","0","11","16","6","7","5","8","0","3","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/abolished-slavery-got-obama/","Sarah Palin: “We Abolished Slavery And Got Obama; What’s Next If We Change The Immigration Law – A Latin President?”","Wasilla, Alaska – Sarah Palin, arguably one of the most beautiful Republicans ever and the former Governor or Alaska, seems to be on a war path with President Obama.

One might be under the impression that there’s nothing strange about that, considering the fact that the Republicans are generally interested in the Democrats as much as they are in some third world country.

On the other hand, when they’re faced with a situation in which the current president is a Democrat, everybody knows that the GOP loves to sharpen its claws on the current White House occupant.

When it comes to Sarah Palin as a Republican, the fact that the woman has had her share of scandals and incredibly ingenious statements on a wide array of topics just goes to show that she loves being under the spotlight. However, her latest bombshell pertaining to the President of the United States has really ticked off millions of Americans (as well as those who feel that way).

See also: Ted Cruz Denies His Father Suggested Placing Atheists In Camps: “He Meant ‘Camping’”

Namely, in a recent interview with Newslo in her home in Wasilla, Alaska, Mrs. Palin expressed her anger regarding the current issue with the immigration law in a somewhat unexpected way: “I’m all for racial equality and I’ve never had a problem with anyone of another skin color. But, think about this for a second: slavery was abolished in America by 1865; a century and a half later, the US has an African-American president. Has anyone thought about what’s going to happen in today’s insanely fast-living world if we allow millions of Mexicans and other immigrants to grab a piece of the American dream?!”

Infuriated, she continued: “it boggles my mind how no one is thinking about the future consequences of our actions in the present! Are we seriously going to allow our children and grandchildren to be in a position where they’re expected to vote for a Hispanic president?! In the middle of the United States?! Seriously?!

"http://politicot.com/former-sen-scott-brown/","Former Sen. Scott Brown: “If Romney Were President, There Would Be No Ebola…Or Russia”","“Rye, New Hampshire – Scott Brown, a former Massachusetts Senator (and a republican), recently made an interview about how America would be much better off if Mitt Romney made it to President instead of Barrack Obama back in 2012.

Brown stated that Romney “was right about Russia, was also right about Obamacare, as well as being spot on about the economy. In fact, if Romney were President right now, I guarantee you we would not be worrying about Ebola right now and, you know, worrying about our foreign policy screw ups”.

“Then again, why stop there? If you really want to get down to it, the Ruskies were always a pain in our butt and we’d have been better off if we had taken care of them when we had the chance. We all know Mitt to be a man who’s not afraid to get his hands dirty, and you better believe that he would have “taken care” of Russia easily if he had had the chance”, Brown added.

"http://politicot.com/rick-perry-white-and-wealthy/","Rick Perry: “It’s All About Being White And Wealthy; Everybody Should Try It”","“Austin, TX – Many say that Rick Perry is a man who’s already made history. The iconic Texas governor is leaving a mark on his state that won’t soon be forgotten.

“It’s official – the state’s longest-serving governor will leave the office he’s held for more than three consecutive terms after new year. Perry is handing the rains to Attorney General Greg Abbott and the transition marks the end of an era in Texas politics.

“The legacy of Rick Perry is a remarkable one, by all accounts – his supporters call it the “Texas miracle”, but the man himself is a bit more down-to-earth when it comes to the name: “miracles I can’t explain, I’ll leave those to the good Lord. This is not a miracle. We know how this happened”, he said. Even his final days in the Governor’s Mansion are spent burnishing his brainchild.

“The “Texas miracle” refers to his state’s steady job growth and sturdy economy. From his own words, it’s a proven blueprint that can work across the country.

“Not even Perry’s critics could ignore the cold, hard facts. Author of “Lone Star Tarnished” and SMU political science professor, Cal Jillson, said: “Governor Perry established in the national mind that Texas is the place for jobs and freedom where entrepreneurship thrives and the American dream is alive.”

“But, like all critics, Jillson wasn’t going to end it there: “if you’re white and wealthy, Texas is a great place.”

However, Jillson’s comment on poverty really struck a nerve with Perry.

“You know, the man does have a point. Because, when you strip down all the statistics and economic indicators, the fact to the matter is – you’re better off if you’re white. And if you happen to be rich at the same time, you’ve got it made. Texas is no exception”, Perry said in an interview with Newslo.

He added: “I don’t even have to say anything, the facts are already there. I’ve been the governor of Texas for a long time, and look at the state of things here today. For reference sake, take a look at the rest of the country. Guess what color is our president? There’s your connection. The lesson? Everybody should just try to be white. Your life would be a whole lot easier.”","2014-12-27 18:54:31","0","28.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","69.0","1.0","35.0","5","381","74.49","72.69","13.69","55.46","14.65","17.32","81.89","50.39","11.29","6.56","1.05","0.52","2.36","2.62","0.00","4.72","11.29","10.50","10.50","4.46","4.99","1.84","17.59","6.04","2.36","1.57","0.52","2.62","2.62","2.10","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.26","9.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.41","9.97","1.84","1.05","1.57","1.84","2.10","3.41","3.67","1.57","1.57","0.52","1.05","0.52","0.52","0.00","0.00","6.82","0.52","0.79","4.20","1.57","0.00","4.20","13.12","1.31","12.34","1.57","6.30","4.46","4.99","0.26","0.00","1.84","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","25.20","6.30","5.51","1.05","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.79","5.77","5.25","0.00","0.00","1671","7.29","16.708333333333332","508","382","25","81.33","10.3","5.7","9.27","8.3","70","8.1","15.449842931937173","228","15.17","6","0.51","0","11","2","50","0","34","29","3","1","6","64","40","0","18","0","0","22","8","16","1","0","2","10","0","15","13","5","5","20","18","1","2","0","4"
"http://politicot.com/obama-opposes-scottish-independence-like-need-another-country-spy/","Obama Opposes Scottish Independence: ‘Like We Need Another Country to Spy On’","BRUSSELS — President Obama came out against an independent Scotland Thursday, saying he wished the U.K. “remains a strong, robust, united, and effective partner,” adding that “a brand-new country to spy on is the last thing we need right now.”

Speaking alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron at a G7 press conference, President Obama called the U.K. an “extraordinary partner to [the U.S.]” and said that “From the outside at least, it looks like things have worked pretty well, so why make us go through the trouble of keeping tabs on a government in Edinburgh as well as London?”

“Breaking Scotland away from the U.K. would just mean more busywork for the N.S.A., and let me tell you, morale there is not great at the moment,” Obama said. “They’ve got their hands full enough without a newfangled industrial democracy to keep tabs on.”

The president also expressed concerns that, once independent, the U.S. risks seeing Scotland develop into “[o]ne of those human rights-obsessed headaches like Iceland or Sweden.”

“Because a first-world country that gives Edward Snowden safe passage and asylum is at the top of my wish list,” Obama added sarcastically.

"http://politicot.com/oklahoma-gun-range-2/","Oklahoma Gun Range Owner Claims Howitzer Misfire Caused By Liberal Conspiracy Called 'Physics'","WYANDOTTE, Okla. – An artillery shell fired from a 105mm howitzer at the Oklahoma Full Auto Shoot and Trade Show last weekend crashed through the walls and ceiling of an Oklahoma home three miles away while homeowner Gene Kelley and his wife were in the house. The owner of historic, military-grade weapon insisted that the gun was fired properly, and blamed the damage to the Kelley’s home on what he termed ‘that damn liberal conspiracy they call physics.’

“As far as the safety end of everything, we drill every one of our shooters before it ever begins. We have [a] 30-45 minute drill,” said Mike Friend, Owner of Fast Machine Gun Shoot. “We teach them how to point the gun, how to fire the gun, all that. What the shell does after that is up to God.”

Friend claimed that the individual who paid him money for the treat of firing the deadly weapon in no way intended to destroy the Kelley’s home. “It was not on a level plane, but on a downward trend, pointed downhill in the bottom of a valley,” said Friend. “For that thing to rise and go far northwest of the range, it’s just unheard of.

“It was those damn anti-gun freaks putting their physics mumbo-jumbo on the shell. They’re the real criminals,” he added.

Friend said authorities should look for a way to better protect gun owners from the ‘liberal physics conspiracy. “That’s some seriously dangerous stuff,” he said. “I mean you shoot a gun in the air, and they make the bullet come right back down at you. Someone’s going to get hurt!”

The homeowners, in another room at the time, were unharmed when the 14.5 inch-long, 3.5 inch-across shell blasted the walls of their house into smithereens. “It’s unbelievable,” Kelley said. “Unless you were here to see it or see the pictures I’ve got, you would not believe how huge this thing is.” Kelley said things could have been even worse had the shell not struck a tree and the ground before smashing its way through his home.

Friend agreed that his 105mm howitzer has some serious kill power. “Oh yeah, pulverize a wall three miles out? No problem,” he said. “You should see what it does from, like, a couple hundred yards away!”","2014-06-29 11:26:33","1","29.0","9.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","53.0","31.0","0.0","79.0","1.0","35.0","8","387","88.24","83.70","20.34","1.00","16.12","14.73","81.40","49.61","13.70","6.20","0.52","1.03","1.29","2.07","1.29","7.49","10.59","13.70","6.20","2.58","4.39","1.29","11.63","3.62","2.33","2.07","2.07","1.81","5.43","1.03","4.39","0.00","1.81","0.26","11.63","0.26","1.29","0.26","2.07","6.46","0.52","1.29","1.29","1.03","1.03","1.55","3.88","1.55","1.81","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.53","2.58","0.52","3.62","1.03","1.29","4.65","6.20","0.26","16.80","1.55","12.14","3.88","2.33","0.26","1.81","0.78","0.26","0.26","1.29","0.78","0.00","0.26","0.26","0.00","22.74","5.43","6.20","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.52","1.55","5.94","2.33","0.00","0.52","1666","6.67","20.894736842105264","495","382","25","81.33","8.7","5.7","8.98","8.0","55","12.375","13.879162303664925","231","19.0","3","0.47","0","9","12","52","0","44","19","1","0","4","66","28","0","17","1","0","26","7","19","1","0","1","9","0","15","29","4","4","11","8","2","4","0","4"
"http://politicot.com/john-boehner-pisses-putin/","House Speaker John Boehner Pisses Off Vladimir Putin","“Iowa – John Boehner, R-Ohio, is on a mission to destroy the diplomatic relationships between the United States and Russian Federation, apparently! The Republican candidate in Iowa stated that Russia would have never invaded any other country if former president George W. Bush had anything to say in the matter.

” “Does anybody think that Vladimir Putin would have gone into Crimea had George W. Bush been the president of the United States? No! Even Putin is smart enough to know that Bush would have punched him in the nose”, Boehner stated, according to the Quad Cities Online.

On the other side of the world, the Russian President was said to have laughed his bear hide off upon hearing House Speaker Boehner’s words…initially. Putin, who is not a man of many words, was said to have been unusually quiet in the days following the statement of the US Republican candidate.

“I was never too fond of the West as such, but I’ve always attempted to maintain a certain sense of politics and respectable diplomacy when it comes to treating foreign dignitaries. However, statements like these do not do well for my temper. At the end of the day, maybe I should remind Mr. Boehner that I’m a black belt in judo”, Putin semi-jokingly said in an interview with Russia Today.

What’s even more interesting is the fact that another former US President, Bill Clinton, made an interesting addition to the “conversation”: I can tell you that I wouldn’t want to be in W’s shoes right about now. I mean, I know he’s had CIA training in his day and all, but the Russians are not to be underestimated, not even ones as small as the current Russian President.

But on the other hand, that is a fight I would very much like to see. No, scratch that: I would pay to see that one, actually.”","2014-10-29 17:29:19","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","316","73.50","37.58","29.23","49.32","19.75","19.94","78.48","53.80","11.71","5.70","3.48","0.63","0.32","1.27","0.00","6.01","9.18","13.92","11.39","5.06","3.80","2.85","16.46","3.80","2.53","0.95","0.32","1.90","3.16","2.22","0.95","0.00","0.95","0.00","6.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.58","12.66","2.22","0.32","2.85","1.90","1.90","4.11","4.75","0.95","2.53","0.63","0.95","0.95","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.43","1.27","0.00","2.85","0.00","0.32","5.06","10.76","0.00","12.03","0.95","6.65","4.43","3.16","0.00","0.32","0.63","0.00","0.00","0.63","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.32","0.00","18.35","4.75","6.33","0.63","0.00","0.32","0.63","0.63","2.85","2.22","0.00","0.00","1398","7.27","23.071428571428573","441","315","16","68.4","11.2","8.6","9.75","10.4","53","7.666666666666666","16.61015873015873","186","21.07","17","0.49","0","6","1","34","0","38","25","0","0","7","32","49","3","9","0","0","14","3","24","1","0","0","13","0","20","14","4","8","8","6","1","2","0","1"
"http://politicot.com/germany-authorizes-snowden-honorary-security-clearance/","Germany Authorizes Snowden for Honorary Security Clearance","BERLIN – Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who has found asylum in Russia, was recently granted honorary security clearance by the German government for his role in exposing surveillance practices of the United States.

“In our eyes, he is a friend, a hero, and an ally,” said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been the target of alleged NSA surveillance herself. “For his brave actions, he’ll have unfettered access to all government intel, which includes military strategy, economic planning, and the secret compounds where government officials watch the German national football team on TV while having access to unlimited Kolsch beer and mouth-watering schnitzel.”

“The strudel factory in Cologne will still be off limits to him,” continued Merkel, speaking of the anonymous, Michelin-rated pastry compound that is only open to high-ranking government officials. “It’s only honorary clearance, so we had to draw the line somewhere.”

The decision to grant Snowden clearance came after the University of Rostock awarded him an honorary doctorate for his “outstanding academic achievement” in shedding light on U.S. surveillance measures. She called the moment an “inspiring occasion.”

“Frankly, honorary degrees and security clearance aren’t enough for people like Edward,” said Merkel. “America has marginalized him, making him feel small, feeble, and insignificant. Yet he has withstood the pressure like any German would. He’s a champion.”

Merkel went on to say that while Snowden may “feel small” in Germany, it will be in a literal rather than figurative sense.

“It feels good to be welcomed,” said Snowden. “Everyone there might be tall and look like Leonardo DiCaprio with those piercing blue eyes and stunning cheek bones, and I may be a squirrely and smarmy dweeb, but I still feel like I’m one of them. Danke schoen, Deutschland.”

Snowden also said he’s excited to explore not only top-secret locations in Germany, but also its “verdant pastures and rolling hills.”

“It’s a beautiful place,” said Snowden. “Much prettier than bleak Russia. Speaking of which, I have to break the news to Putin. If he chastises me for abandoning him, which is a distinct possibility, I’ll just go ahead and share secrets about his surveillance practices. Sorry, Vlad.”

Snowden wouldn’t divulge what those secrets might be, but he did drop a hint, saying he had footage of “certain shirtless WWE wrestlers in rehearsal.”","2014-05-22 09:56:29","0","27.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","386","73.00","78.15","9.00","90.19","17.55","29.27","76.42","45.85","11.40","6.99","1.55","0.52","0.00","4.66","0.26","4.15","6.48","12.18","9.33","3.89","5.18","0.78","16.06","5.44","2.85","1.81","0.26","0.78","5.44","4.66","0.78","0.26","0.00","0.52","12.18","0.00","0.52","0.52","4.40","10.36","3.63","0.26","1.30","2.33","1.30","2.59","5.70","1.81","2.33","1.04","2.07","1.55","0.26","0.00","0.26","10.10","1.81","3.89","4.66","1.55","0.52","3.89","8.81","2.59","11.14","1.81","5.96","3.11","3.89","1.04","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","25.91","6.22","8.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.04","7.77","2.33","0.00","0.00","1943","8.78","26.466666666666665","579","384","21","61.36","11.9","9.2","13.87","13.0","103","15.166666666666666","20.049166666666668","241","24.2","12","0.43","0","14","1","29","0","39","41","1","0","7","62","43","1","19","0","0","27","6","15","0","0","1","11","0","16","19","9","9","6","12","4","3","0","1"
"http://politicot.com/give-gun-take-gun-jar-georgia-convenience-store-hit-run/","Give-a-Gun, Take-a-Gun Jar in Georgia Convenience Store a Hit-and-Run","VALDOSTA, Ga.—No longer is the most dangerous thing in the local Enmark convenience store the three-alarm chili dog that has been spinning on its warmer since 1991. Thanks to the state’s new “guns everywhere” law, customers are able to grab a complimentary firearm if they come up short at the register.

The Georgia Safe Carry Protection Act came into effect last week, just in time for residents to stock up on chips, dip, and pistol grips for Independence Day. The law permits Georgia’s licensed gun owners and visitors from nearly 30 other states to carry their weapons into bars, schools, churches, and “pretty much everywhere else.”

“People come to Enmark to pick up a pack of cigarettes or a gallon of milk,” explained night manager Bob Beckhart. “Oftentimes they’re in a rush and don’t have time to put on a shirt or shoes before entering the store, let alone remember their handgun.”

Beckhart decided to offer a a give-a-gun, take-a-gun jar on the checkout counter to “handle this transition period, when our customers are still getting into the habit of always packing heat.”

Like a give-a-penny, take-a-penny jar, patrons are encouraged to drop spare guns into the jar or to grab a gun to help them settle an outstanding charge.

“It’s a real convenience,” said Bridgett Silver, 21, who was asked to buy a loaf of bread for her mother before realizing she didn’t have enough change. So she grabbed a gun from the jar, pointed in the general direction of the clerk and then walked out of the store with the bread.

“Next time I’m here,” said Silver, “I’ll be sure to pop the pistol back in the jar, so someone else could use it in a similar squeeze.”

Others come to the store prepared to give as good as they get but still appreciate the offering, nonetheless.

Ronald Williams, 62, spotted a fellow customer with a holstered weapon in Enmark on July 1—the same day the new law went into effect. After the customer refused to show Williams his identification and a firearms license, Williams drew his own gun.

No shots were fired, but Williams was arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor. Nobody, not even police officers, are allowed to demand to see a firearms permit under the new law.

Fortunately for Williams, the “guns everywhere” law also abolishes a previous restriction preventing people convicted of certain misdemeanors from obtaining a gun permit.

“It’s plain to see the law is having its intended effect,” said Williams as he was preparing to leave the police station. He excused himself to go to the convenience store for a pack of gum, taking with him his pistol but leaving his wallet behind.","2014-07-08 22:04:34","0","29.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","54.0","1.0","35.0","3","465","97.34","66.65","29.96","45.52","24.47","19.78","78.92","46.67","6.88","4.09","0.43","0.22","0.00","2.37","1.08","2.80","11.83","16.34","5.38","3.44","4.52","1.29","13.55","4.73","2.58","0.43","1.29","0.43","3.66","2.37","1.29","0.22","0.43","0.22","8.60","0.22","0.22","0.86","1.94","9.46","1.94","2.80","0.65","1.72","1.29","2.80","2.58","0.65","0.65","1.29","1.72","0.43","0.22","0.00","1.29","8.39","1.08","0.43","4.73","1.51","1.08","3.66","7.10","0.86","15.70","3.44","7.10","5.38","3.66","0.22","0.22","2.58","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.35","4.30","6.88","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.94","4.30","1.94","0.00","0.00","2087","7.88","31.6","635","454","19","64.14","12.1","10.3","11.15","13.4","88","12.25","19.31330396475771","271","27.4","3","0.44","0","12","6","56","0","50","33","0","0","1","97","33","0","24","0","0","15","10","22","0","1","3","23","0","25","21","11","8","13","7","1","1","0","1"
"http://politicot.com/gop-criticizes-obamacare-ineffective-death-panels/","GOP Criticizes Obamacare for Ineffective Death Panels","BOSTON – Republican leaders attempted to debunk a recent study out of Massachusetts, which offered evidence that the state’s decreased death rate since 2006 is a result of its universal health care system, the same system that served as a model for integral parts of Obamacare.

“What it really comes down to is utterly incompetent death panels, not this mumbo jumbo about socialist health care proactively saving Grandma’s life,” said Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, who once claimed that Obamacare may “start [America] down a treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia.”

The term “death panel,” coined by Sarah Palin, is a euphemism for the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, according to the former Alaska Governor, is a group of bureaucrats who decide whether sick individuals are worthy of Obamacare coverage and thus survival.

“Obama wanted these panels to decide the fate of sick peoples’ lives,” said Palin when she learned of the study. “Your coverage is denied, you go home, and you die. Pretty simple formula. Yet, these Democrats have gone ahead and botched the whole darn thing.”

Palin went on to say that while deep down she is delighted that peoples’ lives have been saved as a result of Obamcare’s shortcomings, “the principle of the matter” has forced her to point out the glaring errors in the “lazy” death panels.

“Laziness is one thing I just can’t deal with,” continued Palin. “If you say you’re going to do something, you better do it.”

When informed that the IAPB is not in fact a “death panel,” but instead a 15-person board which ensures that Medicare costs remain reasonable under the Affordable Care Act scheme, Palin could only guffaw.

“Six of one, a dozen of the other,” continued Palin. “Last time I checked, sending Aunt Barbara to an early retirement in heaven rather than Florida is a pretty good way to cut Medicare costs.”

Palin, who does not currently hold political office, says she won’t say “no” to a presidential run in 2016.

“First things first, I’d try to get rid of this health care nonsense,” said Palin. “If that wasn’t successful, I’d at least try to make sure these death panels worked hard and did their jobs, because that’s the American way.”","2014-05-15 21:45:16","0","29.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","67.0","1.0","35.0","5","375","84.77","64.57","20.24","66.17","23.44","18.93","78.13","44.80","11.73","4.00","1.07","0.00","1.60","1.07","0.27","7.73","8.00","12.80","6.93","2.67","3.73","1.87","15.73","4.53","2.13","2.67","2.67","0.80","4.80","3.47","1.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.07","0.53","0.00","1.60","0.00","10.13","1.60","2.40","1.33","2.13","0.53","3.73","2.40","0.00","2.13","0.27","2.67","0.00","2.67","0.00","0.00","6.93","0.53","3.20","3.20","1.07","0.00","3.73","10.93","1.33","12.00","1.87","5.07","5.07","4.27","0.00","0.53","1.33","0.27","1.87","0.53","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","24.53","4.27","7.73","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.80","8.00","3.20","0.00","0.53","1758","8.52","32.083333333333336","529","373","16","64.75","11.9","10.0","12.07","13.8","88","16.5","20.756997319034852","240","28.5","7","0.43","0","5","5","38","0","44","35","1","1","3","56","44","1","17","0","0","14","4","18","0","0","2","12","0","14","18","5","8","12","18","4","4","0","2"
"http://politicot.com/wall-street-banker-urges-employees-cautious-screwing-counterparties/","Wall Street Banker Urges Employees To Be Cautious When Screwing Over Counterparties","NEW YORK – A leading investment banker at Deutsche Bank recently urged employees via a company video to clean up their vulgar, indiscreet, and boastful behavior when “screwing over their counterparties.”

“Some of you are falling way short of our established standards,” said Colin Fan, one of the heads of Deutsche Bank’s investment banking department, in the virally spread video. “When giving the shaft to those with whom we conduct business, we must remain mum on the issue so as not to raise any eyebrows, primarily within the SEC.”

The harsh-toned video was in response to the persisting exchange of unprofessional emails among Deutsche Bank employees, even after a 2013 internal investigation revealed that one company banker said of a 2007 interest-rate-swap deal with Indian firm Unitech, “No one likes to know he got screwed.”

“By continuing to broadcast our ‘transgressions’ to the world, we’re taking all the fun out of it,” continued Fan. “Trust me, I’ve been doing this for years, and there is no greater pleasure than swindling someone in a transaction, then playing dumb to the SEC and the court system. So please, exercise caution going forward.”

Sanjay Agarwal, the Deutsche Bank employee who sent the aforementioned 2007 email, said his co-workers would be wise to heed Fan’s directives.

“My bonus was cut in half as a result of my actions,” said Agarwal, who currently makes $680,000 per year. “It was exceptionally rough on me and family, and I certainly don’t wish the same on the guys at the firm.”

Agarwal went on to say that whenever his team manipulates an interest rate or sells damaged goods to a counterparty, they “simply move on, like it never happened.”

“Almost like a Jedi mind trick,” continued Agarwal. “And listen, if you seek catharsis and absolutely have to share your morally questionable activity with someone, be discreet. Tell your wife in private. Tell your brother over a beer. Or, if you really want to be cautious, share it on Myspace.”","2014-05-19 09:41:51","0","25.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","334","89.43","86.60","22.50","70.81","20.88","23.95","80.24","46.71","10.78","6.89","1.80","1.50","1.80","0.90","0.90","3.89","7.78","15.57","4.49","3.89","5.69","1.50","12.28","4.19","2.69","1.80","2.69","0.90","6.59","4.49","2.10","0.00","1.20","0.00","14.07","1.20","0.30","0.60","1.50","8.98","1.50","1.50","1.80","2.69","1.50","2.10","3.89","1.50","1.80","0.60","1.80","0.60","0.30","0.60","0.30","8.08","3.29","1.20","2.69","0.90","0.90","3.59","7.19","0.90","13.77","2.69","7.49","4.19","5.99","2.69","0.30","4.49","0.00","0.00","1.20","0.90","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","23.35","4.79","8.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.20","6.89","1.80","0.00","0.30","1572","8.29","34.0","486","331","16","58.92","13.0","10.2","11.89","12.6","76","12.0","19.464290030211483","228","30.1","7","0.44","0","9","7","30","0","42","18","1","0","2","60","31","0","15","1","0","16","11","16","0","0","2","13","0","13","16","10","6","9","5","0","3","0","3"
"http://usherald.com/al-sharpton-too-busy-stirring-the-pot-to-pay-huge-4-5m-tax-bill/","Al Sharpton too busy stirring the pot to pay HUGE 4.5m tax bill! ⋆ US Herald","Al Sharpton has recently denounced claims that he owes Millions in form of taxes to IRS, New York. This is following a report by the New York Times alleging his failure to pay taxes; apparently he faces state and federal tax liens amounting to more than $4.5 million. The report gives an in-depth account of his alleged history with tax evasion. He is allegedly liable for personal federal tax liens of a sum exceeding $3 million coupled with state liens of $777,657, while his companies owe another $717,329 on both state and federal tax liens.

Contradicting these allegations, Sharpton claims that there is no way he can be owing the same amount he owed back in 2008, since that would mean that he has paid none of the installments. However, he seems to be forgetting that taxpayers who have accrued tax debts over many years often owe just as much, or even more. This is due to the accrued interest and penalties. Further, Sharpton’s claims that he has been making regular payments as agreed. This is quite unconvincing since the balance has not reduced significantly. If any payments have been made, they were obviously not substantial.

Sharpton cites political motivation in the timing of the article, claiming that it is no coincidence that his tax woes are making news just as the nation prepares for the grand jury decision in the case of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

It is extremely convenient that Al Sharpton is not a Republican; otherwise his powerful democratic enablers would not protect him from being investigated. Although Sharpton vehemently denies the tax evasion allegations, claiming to have paid down the taxes to a great extent, and maintaining that the tax debt is not willful, one is left wondering, why is he not in jail yet?

"http://usherald.com/keystone-pipeline-defeated-despite-growing-public-support/","Keystone Pipeline Defeated, Despite Public Support. ⋆ US Herald","Failing to heed common sense and free market solutions is nothing new for Democrats, but in a recent lame duck Senate session, Democrats failed to listen to their constituents. A recent U.S Today poll revealed that 60% of Americans, democrats and republicans alike, are in favor of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Yet, approval for the Keystone XL Pipeline failed to pass in the Senate by one vote. The bill was defeated 59 - 41.

The proposed project would carry crude oil from the Canadian tar sands, through 1,179 miles of pipeline, to Gulf Coast oil refineries in Texas. Despite a landslide of public support for this energy project that would bring jobs, economic growth, and energy independence, a majority of Senate Democrats vowed to defeat the Keystone XL Pipeline bill and President Obama threatened to pull rank and veto.

Even the passionate pleas of Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu, from Louisiana, fell on the deaf ears of her Democrat colleagues. Landrieu, battling to retain her seat in a run-off next month, argued that the shovel-ready project would put thousands of people to work. Tree-hugging democrats opposed to the project, including Senator Barbara Boxer from California, seemed more worried about climate change than unemployed Americans struggling to put food on their table.

However, all hope is not lost for the Keystone XL Pipeline. Senate Republican Leader, Mitch McConnell, plans to make the pipeline bill one of the first orders of business in the next session. Republicans take control of both houses of Congress in January.","2014-11-20 19:42:21","1","9.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","31.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","257","99.00","56.19","13.55","10.88","21.42","27.63","75.49","36.58","3.50","1.95","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.78","0.78","1.56","7.78","18.29","2.72","1.56","2.72","0.78","8.95","4.28","1.95","0.00","3.50","1.56","8.95","3.89","5.06","1.17","1.17","1.95","3.89","0.00","0.39","0.78","0.00","7.78","1.95","1.95","1.56","0.78","0.78","1.95","3.11","0.39","1.17","0.39","1.56","0.39","0.39","0.39","0.39","11.67","0.78","4.67","8.56","0.39","1.56","1.56","5.84","0.78","12.84","3.89","4.67","3.89","7.39","0.00","0.39","2.72","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.79","5.06","7.78","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.39","1261","8.8","21.416666666666668","371","252","13","60.24","11.4","9.7","12.76","12.7","67","7.25","20.394920634920638","164","19.75","7","0.34","0","6","7","23","0","35","17","0","0","3","43","43","7","14","0","0","0","4","4","1","0","1","12","0","13","10","5","3","1","4","1","0","0","0"
"http://usherald.com/irs-recover-30k-missing-emails/","IRS has now ""recovered"" 30,000 missing Lerner emails. ⋆ US Herald","Federal investigators have told Congress staffers that they have recovered data that may include emails from one of the pivotal in the controversy over the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment tea party group. They said, the emails were found among hundreds of disaster recovery tapes that were used to back up the IRS email system. However, the investigators said the emails could include misleading information because it is not clear how many of them are duplicates or were already produced by Lerner to the congressional committee.

A lot of questions surround Lerner, she openly told a Congress committee that she had done nothing wrong and refused to answer the questions of lawmakers, citing her constitutional protection against self-incrimination. Though it is not clear whether the investigators found all the missing e-mails, there may be a significant information about this discovery. Let Lerner come out clearly and tell the oversight committee about her mindset and who she was communicating with outside the IRS during a critical period when the IRS was targeting conservative group.

Why did the IRS agency first fail to report the loss of e-mails to Congress and then misleadingly tried to declare the e-mails of Lerner ware gone and lost forever? Once again, it is apparent that IRS has not been transparent with the Americans and the Congress. The only sure way the emails of Lerner could be truly be missing is when the management information system staffs responsible for the daily operations conspired to misplace, hide, or physically delete the email server backup. An organization as large and important as the IRS must have more than one email server site and what has been reported just cannot happen.

It is becoming clear that the Obama Administration used the IRS and other enforcement agencies to silence conservative during the 2010 and 2012 election cycles. As a matter of fact, Lerner retired after acknowledging the agency’s inappropriate actions and invoked her Fifth Amendment Right at two separate congressional hearings on that matter. This is unfortunate and American are not ready to accept such a mega scandal.","2014-11-25 06:24:30","0","9.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","31.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","350","80.28","62.34","13.15","14.03","26.92","26.29","85.14","49.43","7.14","2.57","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.71","0.86","4.57","10.29","11.71","9.71","4.86","7.14","1.71","14.86","3.71","1.71","2.00","2.57","1.71","4.29","1.71","2.57","0.00","0.29","1.43","8.86","0.00","0.00","1.71","0.00","14.57","3.43","2.29","0.86","2.00","3.43","4.00","1.71","0.86","0.86","0.00","0.86","0.00","0.57","0.00","0.29","8.86","1.14","2.00","4.86","0.00","1.71","6.29","6.57","0.86","9.43","0.86","4.57","4.29","8.00","0.29","0.00","3.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.00","3.43","2.57","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.00","1.14","0.00","0.57","0.00","0.00","1776","8.74","27.076923076923077","551","346","13","44.48","14.6","13.7","13.35","16.5","83","12.75","22.235375722543353","209","24.31","8","0.45","0","14","5","39","0","37","31","1","0","5","50","26","1","23","2","0","10","3","17","0","0","2","9","0","17","17","7","12","5","10","3","1","0","4"
"http://usherald.com/more-radical-muslim-groups-are-converging-on-ferguson/","More Radical Muslim Groups are Converging on Ferguson. ⋆ US Herald","A report from the Center for Security Policy warns that a growing number of Muslim groups are gathering in Ferguson, Missouri in an attempt to co-opt protests related to the tragic shooting death of Michael Brown. These Muslim activists are intent on drawing a connection between Brown's killing and the 2009 FBI shooting of radical Islamist Imam Luqman Ameen Abdullah.

This latest Muslim led action comes in the wake of mounting concern over the prospect of violence erupting once the grand jury announces its decision regarding Darren Wilson, the officer who killed Brown. Reps for Muslims For Ferguson have already arrived in the Missouri town in preparation for the legal judgment. Local officials are worried that the the presence of these Muslim groups will result in increased violence and possible bloodshed.

Recently Dawud Walid, of the American-Islamic group, voiced his belief that U.S. police officers are guilty of operating under the belief that black people, and in turn Muslims, are threats. Walid even claimed that Brown, who was buried in a St. Louis Baptist Church, was a Muslim. The spokesman later backtracked and denied he'd made this controversial statement.





It's widely believed that Muslim groups are using the Ferguson case as a way to justify their efforts to curtail security monitoring of the American Muslim community. Kyle Shideler, director of CSP's Threat Information Office, asserts that Muslim groups are planning to align themselves with a number of civil rights organizations. This politically calculated move is seen as a means to cloak groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood within a broader patchwork of socio-political groups all of whom are intent on reforming government security measures and limiting terrorism related surveillance procedures. In this way these Muslim groups are trying to take the emphasis off members of their own community and re-frame the debate as being a fundamental civil rights issue. Their ultimate goal is to weaken U.S. anti-terrorism and counter-terrorism efforts.","2014-11-24 16:15:18","0","12.0","1.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","35.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","326","97.38","79.62","10.57","1.00","23.29","29.14","78.22","39.88","7.67","1.84","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.61","1.23","5.83","9.20","15.03","5.52","0.92","3.37","0.00","10.12","5.83","2.45","0.92","0.61","2.76","5.83","1.23","4.60","2.15","1.53","0.31","8.28","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.92","6.13","3.07","2.15","0.00","0.61","0.61","0.00","2.15","1.53","0.61","0.00","0.92","0.31","0.61","0.00","0.00","13.50","4.29","1.84","5.52","0.61","2.15","3.07","5.52","1.23","11.04","2.45","7.06","1.53","4.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.83","1.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.66","5.52","3.07","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.84","0.00","1.23","0.00","0.00","1679","9.56","25.53846153846154","522","320","16","51.18","13.1","11.1","14.04","14.0","100","11.5","22.5","205","23.31","7","0.41","0","7","1","38","1","47","23","1","1","1","49","53","0","23","0","0","3","5","7","0","0","0","8","0","8","9","15","9","12","8","0","3","0","0"

It is sad that the federal official couldn’t distinguish between the dental plan and medical plan, a shift from the previous practice they failed to publicize. This was a clear attempt to help the Obama administration to exceed its goal of 7 million sign-ups.

Blogger Lee Doren breaks it down in this video:



The White House falls below projections of 7 million sign-ups in 2014 without counting the dental plan sign-ups. The White House was trying to hide the actual enrollment numbers. Rep. Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said, ""Instead of offering the public an accurate accounting, the administration engaged in an effort to obscure and downplay the number of dropouts.""

Even before the oversight report, the Obama administration had already shown signs of lack of transparency around the enrollment numbers. Jonathan Gruber, the economist and Obamacare architect, publicly boasted about the intentional lack of transparency and deception of the Obama administration. It has become so usual that nobody is even surprised when disclosures of a new misrepresentation emerge.

The overstatement that Obamacare has hit 7.3 million people in September, which was more than the Congressional Budget Office estimate of 7 million, blackmailed the president and his team to boast that the Affordable Care Act was performing well. It is unclear why and how the department of health and human services mixed the two enrollment figures, and why investigators from the House Oversight and Government Reforms Committee didn’t report the error before Bloomberg News.

The 7 million thresholds appear to be important for the administration; they want to do everything to deceive the public that the health law is really performing. The number one most ineffective thing about the Affordable Care Act is: the administration lied to Americans to get it through. The problem is already with us, and they are doing nothing but worsen it.","2014-11-27 07:11:38","0","12.0","2.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","31.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","356","95.19","58.87","2.03","25.77","23.73","28.93","78.37","46.63","7.02","1.40","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.28","0.84","5.62","12.36","13.76","6.18","4.49","4.21","1.40","10.11","4.78","1.69","1.69","4.78","0.56","3.93","1.97","1.97","0.00","0.28","0.56","5.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","8.43","1.12","1.40","1.40","1.40","1.12","1.97","1.69","1.40","0.28","0.00","1.40","0.00","1.40","0.00","0.00","9.83","0.84","3.09","5.34","0.56","1.40","4.21","5.62","0.84","7.30","0.28","3.93","3.09","9.27","0.84","1.12","2.53","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","10.96","4.21","3.93","0.56","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.84","0.56","0.56","0.00","0.00","1842","8.76","25.714285714285715","572","352","16","49.15","14.1","11.9","13.92","14.9","90","8.2","21.027272727272727","199","22.5","0","0.43","0","12","19","46","0","42","23","0","0","0","63","41","1","14","0","0","10","2","10","1","1","1","12","0","11","17","6","5","5","11","2","1","0","4"
"http://usherald.com/its-lame-duck-hunting-season-for-the-gop/","It's ""Lame Duck"" Hunting Season for the GOP. ⋆ US Herald","On November 4th, Americans ousted the Democratic Senate in favor of anti-spending, anti-Obamacare Republicans. Unfortunately, fired Democrat Senators still hold voting power. No longer accountable to their constituents, these lame ducks still have the ability to pass bills Americans are vehemently against.

Lame duck senators shouldn't be allowed to anything, except keep the bare essentials of government running. But, loosing Democrat Senators aren't going to transition out of government quietly. They're going to try and spend your money. The federal government is poised to run out of money on December 11 and will shut down unless new funding is approved by Congress. But, instead of approving just enough money to get through a few more months, lame duck senators want to approve nearly a year's worth of spending.

Outgoing Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, is pushing a spending-spree omnibus bill that includes billions of dollars of funding for so-called Ebolacare, warfare against ISIS, and a global climate change fund. If the bill passes, the government will be locked into the spending until September 2015. Republicans need to say no. The GOP can't be tied to Democrat-style spending for another nine months. The omnibus is too expensive to pass, it's not what voters want, and it will cripple the Republican's bargaining power come January.

The GOP has serious work to do in January and they need all the bargaining chips they can get. Refusing the omnibus would empower republicans to finally take an axe to Obamacare and to stop funding for new Obamacare regulations.

Republicans need to send the same message to Democrats that voters did weeks ago: you're fired and you no longer have access to the company credit card. Spending season is over, but lame duck hunting season is open.","2014-11-24 15:55:44","1","11.0","1.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","31.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","296","91.80","47.30","19.68","12.37","17.41","28.38","80.74","42.57","4.73","2.03","0.00","0.00","1.01","0.00","1.01","2.70","6.76","15.20","8.45","2.70","4.73","2.36","18.92","3.38","1.35","0.34","1.35","1.69","5.07","2.03","3.04","0.00","0.34","1.35","4.73","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.45","0.00","0.68","2.70","1.35","0.34","4.05","0.68","0.00","0.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.81","0.34","1.35","7.77","1.35","0.34","1.01","13.85","1.69","14.53","3.72","4.73","6.08","4.05","0.68","0.00","8.11","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.88","5.74","5.41","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.69","0.00","2.70","0.00","0.00","1467","8.12","17.88235294117647","452","291","17","54.12","12.3","10.0","12.76","11.8","67","5.571428571428571","18.049621993127147","185","16.59","3","0.42","0","10","4","22","0","28","16","1","0","6","47","27","7","16","1","0","8","2","18","2","0","2","18","1","24","3","11","8","11","9","1","1","0","0"
"http://usherald.com/rick-perry-to-obama-texas-may-sue-in-wake-of-executive-order/","Rick Perry to Obama: Texas may sue in wake of executive order. ⋆ US Herald","Texas Governor, Rick Perry, spoke at the Republican Governor's Association annual meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, and he had strong words for President Obama! The State of Texas is prepared to sue President Obama if he takes executive action to change current immigration policies. According to Gov. Perry, the financial cost to the State of Texas is too devastating a threat. President Obama is expected to detail the Executive Action Plan during his address later this week.

President Obama has expressed his intention to halt plans to deport over 500 million non-Americans. The scope of this plan has Republican leaders perplexed and concerned. Perhaps the dramatic scope of the change is as shocking as the anticipated financial cost of making those executive changes and providing for those unexpected residents! The Governor of Wisconsin supports Gov. Perry's plan to sue the White House. Gov. Scott Walker, agrees that the financial cost of a decision like that will be too much, without an extraordinary plan to support what sounds like desperate measures taken without enough negotiation or explanation offered to Republican leaders and the American people. Gov. Walker calls Obama's plan outright ""illegal."" Not like that would stop him.

"http://usherald.com/us-dollar-poised-to-take-yet-another-major-blow-under-obama/","US Dollar poised to take yet another major blow under Obama. ⋆ US Herald","While President Obama continues to celebrate winning a toothless climate change agreement with China, he's hoping Americans don't notice that his environmental alliance with the Chinese puts America into a perilous financial situation.

The climate change agreement that President Obama worked so hard to solidify with the Chinese means huge repercussions for the U.S, including increased EPA regulations and higher fuel prices. Meanwhile, China offered only vague promises that will have little effect on their pollution levels.

While President Obama was distracted with trying to save the environment, instead of middle class families, China was striking an energy deal with Russia that will jeopardize the value of the American Dollar.

China agreed to buy 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually, for the next 30 years, from one of Russia’s oil producers. China will pay for all this fuel with Chinese Yuan, instead of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar has long been used for global trading and as the world's reserve currency. That global demand helps keep the dollar's value strong. But, it won't stay that way with dominant countries, like China and Russia, refusing to use it.

Deals like this energy agreement between Russia and China create uncertainty for the U.S. dollar. Economic matters on U.S. soil aren't helping the dollar either. President Obama has failed to reign-in borrowing and the national debt. Soon, the interest on the federal debt will be unsustainable. Both the domestic and foreign economic climates are problematic for the value of the U.S. dollar.

If the world, taking their cues from China and Russia, move away from the U.S dollar as their trading currency, Americans will face higher interest rates and higher prices. China is actively threatening the economic stability of the U.S. But, instead of condemning China for putting Americans at risk, President Obama was shaking hands with them.

"http://usherald.com/watch-out-the-irs-are-now-monitoring-conservative-comments/","WATCH OUT! The IRS are now monitoring Conservative comments. ⋆ US Herald","If you thought all the IRS did was hassle groups applying for tax-exempt status, then guess again. It turns out that the International Revenue Service also monitors conservative blogs and their subsequent comment threads.

Because what else would the ""understaffed"" organization want to use their manpower for, right?

Currently the IRS is using comments made on a reader poll from the conservative blog Legal Insurrection to defend their position on why the names and identities of IRS workers should remain private. The poll asked readers what they thought of media outlets confronting Lois Lerner near her home. While most of the comments are insightful, there are a few that have caught the IRS’s eye. And now they’ve even gone so far as to quote these commentators in their opposition to Judicial Watch’s Motion to Compel Discovery.

One individual, in response to authorities requesting Lerner’s records relating to her involvement with the IRS controversy last year, wrote that they’d like to see Lerner gripped by the same fear experienced by taxpayers when under investigation from the IRS. This includes being, ""paralyzed with fear,"" and ""seized with spontaneous diarrhea."" Another person wrote that a, ""public whipping with a buggy whip would not be that far out-of-line!""

The IRS is claiming that many of the federal workers who became involved in last year’s scandal have been harassed, and even followed home. They’re citing comments made on the conservative blog as proof of serious threats being made towards their employees.

It would seem that in addition to being unable to track down the billions owed to them in unpaid taxes, or being able to locate the bulk of emails implicating Lerner in the unfair scrutiny of political organizations, the IRS is also unable to tell the difference between sarcastic comments and legitimate security risks.","2014-11-24 17:47:47","1","11.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","31.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","303","91.08","81.35","9.70","1.70","23.31","25.08","84.49","47.85","8.91","3.96","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.66","2.97","4.95","7.92","16.50","7.92","3.30","5.61","0.33","15.18","3.96","1.98","1.65","0.66","1.98","3.63","0.33","3.30","1.32","1.32","0.00","10.56","0.00","0.00","0.66","0.00","10.23","2.31","3.30","1.98","1.65","0.66","1.65","1.32","0.66","0.00","0.33","0.99","0.33","0.66","0.00","0.00","6.27","0.33","1.98","3.63","0.33","1.32","4.95","6.27","0.33","11.88","1.65","6.93","3.30","4.29","0.99","0.66","3.96","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.86","3.63","3.63","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.33","0.99","2.64","2.31","0.00","0.00","1518","8.89","23.846153846153847","467","300","13","48.03","13.8","12.3","13.35","14.7","78","7.583333333333334","21.64","194","21.38","8","0.46","0","7","1","27","0","43","25","0","1","4","41","23","0","26","1","0","8","7","14","0","0","2","13","0","11","9","12","13","9","6","1","3","0","2"
"http://usherald.com/watch-video-proof-of-obamas-immigration-flip-flop/","WATCH: Video Proof of Obama's Immigration Flip-Flop. ⋆ US Herald","President Obama is adamant about fixing immigration all on his own - whether congress likes it or not. The President has announced that he will invoke executive power to enact immigration initiatives that Congress won't pass. What makes this drastic action even more concerning, is that just three years ago the President promised to never use executive action for immigration issues.

In 2011, President Obama said that bypassing Congress to reform immigration was tempting, but ultimately ""not how our democracy functions"". He's right. Democracy values the voices of the people over the voice of one person in power.

Democracy is what happened in the last mid-term election, when Americans decided that they didn't want Obama-style immigration reform and handed both houses of Congress over to the Republicans. But President Obama, unhappy with the will of the people he's paid to represent, is flip-flopping on himself and Americans. He didn't get the Congress he wanted, so he's going to use his executive privilege to circumvent democracy.

There's good reason for Congress to vote against President Obama's immigration reform. The President's policy would effectively grant amnesty to 5 million illegal immigrants. The policy ignores what America really needs and wants: enhanced border security and better immigration law enforcement. American's don't want amnesty and they said so when they voted earlier this month.

So, what was the President's justification for taking power from Congress? He said deporting illegal immigrants is, ""contrary to our character"". Surely someone who goes back on his word is the last person who should be talking about ""character"".","2014-11-22 16:33:19","1","11.0","1.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","33.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","261","58.13","67.71","2.87","69.12","16.31","28.74","77.39","44.83","11.88","6.13","0.00","0.77","0.00","4.21","1.15","5.75","5.36","11.49","8.43","5.75","5.75","2.68","17.62","1.15","1.15","3.83","1.92","1.15","3.83","3.07","0.77","0.00","0.00","0.38","10.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.21","12.64","1.53","3.45","2.68","1.15","1.53","3.83","1.92","0.00","1.92","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.41","0.77","0.77","10.34","1.53","0.38","5.36","9.58","1.92","11.11","1.92","4.98","4.60","8.05","0.00","0.38","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.39","5.75","3.45","0.38","0.00","0.38","0.00","1.53","2.30","4.60","0.00","0.00","1362","8.47","17.0625","432","258","15","45.56","13.7","11.2","14.32","13.1","65","10.6","18.957519379844964","155","16.25","0","0.46","0","8","5","19","0","26","21","1","0","5","42","23","2","11","0","0","12","5","15","2","0","0","10","0","12","15","8","2","4","15","0","6","0","3"
"http://usherald.com/pcu-college-president-apologizes-for-email-saying-all-lives-matter/","PCU: College President Apologizes For Email Saying 'All Lives Matter'. ⋆ US Herald","The president of Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts recently apologized for an email that she sent out. That's probably a good thing, right? Maybe the email contained a hateful message, or it was hurtful in some way... Maybe the email contained a message that was just wrong.

No, that isn't true at all. The email that the president of Smith College was apologizing for wasn't hurtful at all. Instead, the email had contained the subject line: ""all lives matter"". That was it. The email was supposed to be supportive of the Ferguson and New York protesters, and it really upset the masses.

The email that was sent out was not supposed to contain the message that ""all"" lives are important and valued, but rather that ""black"" lives matter. You see, it is black lives that the protesters are looking to protect, and they don't want anyone thinking differently. An unnamed student replied to the email with: “It minimizes the anti-blackness of this the current situation; yes, all lives matter, but not all lives are being targeted for police brutality.”.

Wow. What a big deal. What a big mistake. Right? Is it really so wrong that the president of a college wanted to share the message that all lives are important? In this time of violence and fights, are we really going to stand up only for black lives? Sophomore Cecelia Lim was very disturbed by the email, she said “It felt like she was invalidating the experience of black lives.”.

It seems that Smith College has a history of being progressive and not standing for anything but the progressive lifestyle and beliefs. Maybe those who received the email were afraid that the president of this college was actually standing up for the unborn, for the elderly, for the vulnerable. They wouldn't want such a school to stand up for those sorts of people, would they? At least one student tried to offer some support: “She acknowledged her mistake,” said sophomore Maria Lopez after a student vigil led by McCartney.

It is sad that someone would have to apologize for sending out the message that ""all lives matter"", no matter what school they are working for and no matter what group of people they were looking to support. It is sad that the focus right now is on standing up only for the blacks and not standing up for anyone who might be mistreated or need our support.","2014-12-14 17:32:29","1","10.0","0.0","3.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","30.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","408","76.17","71.36","5.72","10.35","16.32","21.32","88.97","55.15","13.73","3.19","0.00","0.49","0.25","1.23","1.23","10.54","9.80","13.24","9.31","4.17","3.68","2.70","17.40","3.43","0.98","1.47","0.25","2.94","6.62","2.70","3.92","0.98","0.74","0.98","12.01","0.00","0.00","1.23","0.00","13.73","1.23","0.25","2.45","4.17","2.21","4.41","3.19","1.72","0.49","0.74","2.45","0.00","2.45","0.00","0.00","8.82","2.21","0.49","5.15","0.25","0.74","5.88","9.56","0.49","9.56","1.47","6.37","1.96","4.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.00","17.40","5.88","4.41","0.74","0.25","1.23","0.00","0.25","3.43","1.23","0.00","0.00","1854","7.15","17.208333333333332","566","407","23","70.43","10.4","7.8","9.97","9.8","68","4.388888888888889","15.763046683046685","187","15.33","0","0.54","0","14","1","57","0","50","29","0","1","3","61","20","0","18","2","0","22","1","25","0","0","8","10","1","11","25","14","11","13","8","2","6","0","0"
"http://usherald.com/17-states-sue-in-attempt-to-block-obamas-immigration-overreach/","17 States Sue in Attempt to Block Obama's Immigration Overreach. ⋆ US Herald","In an effort to stop President Obama from enacting a unilateral immigration policy, 17 states have joined a lawsuit against the Obama administration. The suit, filed Wednesday, in the U.S. District Court in Texas names top immigration enforcement officials as defendants.

Headed by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican and Texas governor-elect, the lawsuit is seeking a ruling that declares the President’s executive action illegal. When the suit was filed, Abbott echoed what many Americans believe, that the immigration system needs to be fixed by Congress and not by ""presidential fiat"".

President Obama’s immigration plan would essentially grant amnesty to nearly 5 million illegal immigrants and save them from deportation. It's the same plan that Americans voted against in the last mid-term election when they ousted sitting Democrats. Americans were loud and clear about their disapproval of Obama-style immigration reform. Congress was also loud and clear when they refused to pass the President's plan. Why? Because it ignores what America really needs: better border security and better law enforcement. When President Obama didn't get his way, he declared executive power and decreed his plan the new law of the land.

Republicans have urged the President to consider the negative ramifications of his relaxed immigration policy. Republican Michael McCaul warns that the President’s irresponsibility will lead to a wave of illegal immigration.

But, unlike the President, Republicans are seeking a legal resolution to this problem. Republicans are vowing to uphold the will of the people and the Constitution.

The lawsuit filed argues that President Obama has violated the constitutional limits of Presidential power. The Constitution states in Article 2, Section 3 that the president ""shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed"". Using executive power to circumvent the law-makers in congress is not faithful execution. The Constitutional Convention specifically rejected this kind of dictator-style leadership and stated that the President could not institute laws all by himself.

Along with Texas, 16 other states have joined the lawsuit, including Alabama, Idaho, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Utah. But, if the courts won’t step in to stop the President’s illegal order, some Republicans are preparing to fight the upcoming budget. A new spending bill is required by December 11 to prevent a government shutdown and to keep government running until September 2015. It will need Republican support to pass. Republicans don’t want another shutdown, they simply want the President to obey the law.

In making up new laws as he sees fit, President Obama is not only shirking his responsibilities to protect and uphold the Constitution, but he is willfully ignoring American voters. He’s rendering Congress, and the voice of the people, powerless. President Obama is extending rights and privileges to illegal immigrants, through illegal means, at the expense of democracy and the rights of the American people.","2014-12-04 17:26:41","0","13.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","32.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","470","91.26","50.00","2.66","25.77","17.41","31.49","74.68","41.91","6.60","2.98","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.91","1.06","3.62","10.21","11.49","6.17","2.77","5.96","1.70","12.55","2.55","1.28","1.49","1.70","1.06","4.26","2.13","2.13","0.00","0.64","0.21","4.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.91","8.94","0.85","1.70","1.91","1.06","0.85","2.98","1.28","0.64","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.60","0.43","2.55","12.13","0.85","1.91","1.49","7.87","2.34","9.36","1.70","4.26","3.19","10.21","0.43","0.00","0.85","0.43","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.96","5.96","5.53","0.21","0.00","0.21","0.00","1.06","0.85","2.13","0.00","0.00","2505","8.93","17.85185185185185","816","466","27","37.0","14.6","12.4","14.73","13.4","131","8.583333333333334","20.164635193133048","254","16.63","3","0.41","0","18","8","52","0","44","33","1","0","6","80","62","9","24","0","0","12","5","14","1","0","1","17","0","23","17","12","10","12","13","1","2","0","5"
"http://usherald.com/benghazi-report-full-of-crap-says-sen-lindsey-graham/","Benghazi Report ""Full of Crap"" Says Sen. Lindsey Graham. ⋆ US Herald","In an almost imperceptible news release Friday November 21st, the latest in a series of Benghazi investigations was published by the U.S. House of Representatives' Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Headed by Republican Chairman Mike Rogers and Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat, the committee and its newest report mimic similar conclusions found previously. When asked about the report's findings, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) responded on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" ""I think the report is full of crap..."" before noting a new round of the political blame game had begun.

The Long Awaited Results

As the seventh investigation to look into the tragedy at Benghazi, the report did find that, though initial talking points were inaccurate, they were based on the latest intelligence available at the time. A document with conclusions some Republicans are calling wildly predictable, the report ultimately cleared the Obama administration and participating intelligence agencies from culpability in the death of four Americans in Libya by determining the following: The American public was not intentionally misled. Reports of withheld assistance for the four Americans were false. There was no secret operation to run weapons out of Libya.

Behind Graham's Response

Though often considered a ""RINO"" (Republican In Name Only), Sen. Lindsey Graham and his sentiments about the latest published report may not be far off the mark. After all, Chairman Rogers announced his intention to retire earlier this year and has a mere five weeks remaining until starting a new career in radio. Additionally, Rogers' wife and her influence as a security contractor has been scrutinized by Republicans, citing a conflict of interest in the outcome -- and implications -- of the report.

What Comes Next?

Fellow Republicans, like Sen. Jeff Flake, confirm beliefs that the administration's handling of the tragedy was flawed. However, party members on both sides of the line are urging peers to ""move on."" For Sen. Graham, moving on means starting a new investigation with a new committee.","2014-12-01 16:45:09","0","13.0","4.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","32.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","323","98.68","59.79","54.46","31.03","17.00","28.48","78.64","42.11","3.10","1.55","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.93","0.31","1.55","11.76","16.10","5.26","3.41","4.33","0.93","10.22","6.50","3.41","0.62","1.24","1.55","3.41","1.86","1.55","0.00","0.93","0.62","5.57","0.31","0.31","0.62","0.93","9.29","3.41","2.79","0.00","1.24","0.31","1.55","0.93","0.62","0.31","0.31","0.62","0.31","0.31","0.00","0.00","4.02","1.55","0.00","2.17","0.00","0.31","4.33","4.02","0.62","17.34","1.86","7.43","8.05","8.36","0.93","0.31","0.93","0.31","0.31","0.62","0.31","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.50","6.81","5.26","0.31","0.00","0.31","0.00","1.24","2.48","1.86","1.24","0.00","1697","9.32","23.428571428571427","545","323","19","45.76","12.8","11.1","14.27","12.9","99","7.0","21.060061919504644","210","21.21","7","0.41","0","7","4","43","0","50","21","0","4","1","47","54","6","15","0","0","2","4","10","1","0","0","4","0","6","17","13","10","3","3","0","1","0","1"

That's right. American citizen, Duy Tran, was informed it was not within his rights to display his American flag on his own balcony.

The management of the Lodge on El Dorado told Tran that the flag was not allowed and needed to be removed, but Tran said what really stunned him was the manager claiming his display was a ""Threat to the Muslim Community"". Our flag is harmful to Muslims? Wow. Let that sink in a bit.

The flag that many of our friends and family, including that of Tran, died to protect cannot be displayed by a citizen of our great land because it was found to be a threat to Muslims. The mystery part of this is when Tran's neighbors were interviewed not only were none of them Muslim but each of them said the flag should stay.

So then what is the real reason why the Lodge on El Dorado wants to deny an American citizen proudly displaying his American flag in the heart of Texas? When the news reporters went to get the management's side of the story, they were met with a typed response from the managements corporate headquarters and a not so nice invitation to be escorted off the property by a poor officer just doing his job.

The public outcry is strong and it is loud. If you were to check a few review sites on the property you will see a lot of great citizens making their voices heard against this out lash of Anti-American insanity from El Dorado.

You will also find the company giving themselves a 4 star review in response! How despicable is that? The only 'person' to defend a company like this is the company itself.

The final official reason, one the company unwittingly admitted to as it threw legal codes at the poor guy who was guilty of nothing but being a Proud American, isn't even about Muslims, but something maybe far worse.

The company, who shouldn't even have the right to fly the American flag on their entrance, said for the record, the flag was banned 'in order to maintain an aesthetically consistent image.'

That's right. They said they wanted the American flag to be removed because they found it wasn't 'aesthetically' pleasing. I'm not sure who that company thinks it is to say our flag, the American flag, is not good enough to be displayed in public.

If they hate the country that much, then they really should go back to whatever stone age village they are from. Maybe they can find an 'aesthetically' pleasing flag to fly outside of their hut and let a True American company take over their American soldier protected land so that a True American like Tran can fly his colors proud.","2014-12-14 18:29:23","1","16.0","1.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","32.0","33.0","0.0","94.0","0.0","14.0","9","476","79.78","80.54","7.10","49.21","20.70","18.49","84.03","54.62","12.18","6.51","0.21","0.84","0.63","1.68","3.15","5.67","10.92","13.66","9.87","3.99","4.83","2.52","16.81","3.36","0.84","2.10","0.42","1.68","5.67","3.36","2.10","0.63","0.84","0.00","13.66","0.21","0.63","0.00","1.89","10.50","1.89","2.10","1.68","1.47","0.84","3.78","3.36","1.68","1.68","0.00","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.61","1.89","0.63","3.99","1.26","1.26","6.30","7.98","1.05","9.66","1.89","6.51","1.47","3.99","0.21","0.63","0.42","1.05","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.97","3.99","3.15","0.00","0.00","0.63","0.21","0.21","0.42","3.36","0.00","0.00","2071","7.14","21.043478260869566","662","475","20","64.24","12.7","10.2","9.23","11.7","70","6.833333333333333","17.414736842105267","231","18.48","1","0.52","0","9","2","57","0","51","43","1","0","6","77","28","0","12","0","0","23","15","31","0","0","3","20","0","27","27","8","14","6","13","3","5","0","3"
"http://usherald.com/germany-wakes-up-to-growing-islamization-threat-record-numbers-rally-against-asylum-cheats/","Germany Wakes Up to Growing Islamization Threat. Record Numbers Rally Against ""Asylum Cheats"" ⋆ US Herald","While the bleeding heart liberals here wave an Islamic flag in surrender, the German people have woken up to the growing threat of militant Islam and other unwanted Muslims. There were a record number of people protesting the recent influx of 'political' asylum seekers in Germany recently. Some of their detractors wish to call the good citizens protesting 'Nazis' as a Liberal Media agenda to vilify the victims. What is missed by the so-called Main Stream Media is, as usual, the facts.

Fact #1: Almost 75% of the 'political' asylum seekers are nothing but Muslim deadbeats. This detail is often left out in the Liberal media. The Muslims aren't seeking asylum because they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs, but because they are being hounded for their bad debts! We think we have a moocher problem in the US, well wait until we see Obama importing more of them.

Fact #2: Germany is not alone. This Moocher/Radical Muslim infestation is not just a German problem. It is a world-wide problem. The ideal proof of this is spin off protests from this central protest. While St. Louis burns itself down because a cop did his job, the rest of the world is fighting a battle the US needs to get involved in.

Fact #3: The Ziet poll listed 3 out of 4 people were worried about radical Islam being imported and a large chunk has said Germany already accepted too many people. How many is too many people? It is enough for Germany actually to not have room for the ones they already granted asylum to. Those people are being put up in buildings that could be used for a lot of better purposes. Buildings like schools, barracks, and office blocks. Instead of being able to focus on their own people, the German people have to give up what little land they have to allow terrorist fueled Islamic into their borders.

Why is this protest important? Because Germany is only Number 2 in the world for the influx of Moocher Muslims Radicals. You know who the Number 1 country is? You won't find this in the Liberal Media, but it is the Good Ol' USA under Obama. Instead of taking care of our problems and our citizens, he is offering economic shelter to the very people trying to kill us.","2014-12-17 14:10:56","1","10.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","33.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","393","83.49","82.68","7.76","1.00","15.72","20.36","80.66","51.15","9.67","5.60","0.00","2.04","0.51","0.51","2.54","4.07","8.91","14.25","9.41","4.83","4.58","1.53","15.52","3.56","1.78","1.27","2.04","1.53","7.63","2.04","5.60","0.76","2.29","0.51","11.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.51","11.70","1.27","2.29","2.29","1.53","1.53","2.80","0.76","0.25","0.25","0.25","0.51","0.51","0.25","0.00","0.00","10.18","2.04","1.27","4.58","1.27","1.78","3.05","9.41","0.51","11.20","1.02","7.63","2.54","1.53","0.00","0.25","0.51","2.80","0.25","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","13.99","5.34","2.80","0.76","0.00","0.76","0.25","0.51","0.00","2.29","0.00","1.27","1745","7.72","16.458333333333332","567","390","24","63.39","9.6","8.5","9.34","8.5","81","7.0","16.82769230769231","223","15.08","3","0.49","0","7","8","43","0","44","35","2","0","1","42","36","0","31","0","0","16","8","22","0","0","6","11","0","10","8","15","11","14","19","1","3","0","1"
"http://usherald.com/all-time-low-obamas-approval-sinks-to-15-among-americas-armed-forces/","All Time Low: Obama's Approval Sinks to 15% Among America's Armed Forces. ⋆ US Herald","This Christmas, President Obama's approval ratings are dropping faster than the temperatures outside. According to a recent poll from Military Times the Commander in Chief's popularity is at an all time low with a whopping 15 % approval rating amongst the men and women in uniform, much lower than last year's 28%.

There are several theories for the reason of plummeting support for Obama amongst the troops, and many of them are rooted in his push for change. From Obama's lifting of ""don't ask, don't tell"" to changing the rules of women in combat situations, and new anti-sexual assault training he requires for service, he has changed the culture of the military. Another reason for his appalling approval ratings is that the troops feel a lack of leadership coming from the Oval Office, a criticism that has also been echoed amongst civilians.

The troops have been fighting in the Middle East for over a decade. Then Obama made it his mission to pull the troops from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, a plan he announced to the world. The once bright outlook of democracy existing in the Middle East quickly faded with the rise of ISIS's control of the desert. The rise of violence in Iraq and Afghanistan has made troops question their mission and wonder if their comrades died in vain. The lack of faith in a plan from the White House has hurt morale amongst troops and killed their support of their leadership. Army Lt. General Daniel Bolger said to Military Times, ""The junior folks have a right to question their leaders and say, 'Hey, you told me to do this U.S.-led counterinsurgency, and it didn't work. What the heck?' They want to know why they were told to do all the dumb stuff they were told do.""

Obama has also made the military a target of his budget cuts, resulting in pay and benefit decreases for the troops. There will be a housing cut for any troops living off base and for the second year in a row the troops will only be getting a 1% raise. These two hits are bound to make anyone calling the shots unpopular. Change often takes time to get used to, but it seems Obama doesn't allow time for anyone to adapt before he pushes more changes for the military. If there's one thing that Obama has illustrated in the past, it's that he doesn't care about his poll ratings. With two more years in office the American military and civilians alike will watch with great interest whether President Obama can work with the new Congress to mend his reputation or if he will continue his current course.

The report shows that former president Bush was lied on more than once on the nature and extent of the torture as well as the operation of remote secret prisons to hold terror suspects.

Meanwhile Obama knowingly lets US torture continue in places like Somalia, while his defenders turn a blind eye. This video shows exactly how and where this is happening.

On the surface Obama has taken steps to distance himself from so called ""black-ops"" projects, but reports from major news outlets have alluded to the CIA still operating by proxy with the various foreign governments. ""As part of its expanding counterterrorism program in Somalia, the CIA also uses a secret prison buried in the basement of Somalia's National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters, where prisoners suspected of being Shabab members or of having links to the group are held."" Reported The Nation.

The Democrats attempting to scapegoat prior administrations is nothing new, but perhaps if they are so concerned with the torture of terrorist suspects, maybe its time the senate democrats take a long hard look in the mirror instead of searching in vain to force blame on the Bush administration.","2014-12-10 23:48:03","0","10.0","2.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","31.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","223","96.75","62.33","41.63","1.00","27.88","26.46","83.41","47.09","4.93","2.24","0.00","0.90","0.00","0.90","0.45","2.69","11.21","16.59","4.93","5.38","6.73","0.45","10.31","6.73","4.04","1.79","1.35","1.79","7.17","0.90","5.83","1.35","3.14","0.45","5.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.90","8.97","2.69","1.35","0.90","1.79","1.35","2.69","4.04","3.59","0.00","0.45","1.79","0.45","1.35","0.00","0.00","10.31","1.79","0.00","6.73","0.90","0.90","3.14","5.83","0.00","16.14","0.90","9.87","5.38","6.28","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.45","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.45","0.00","10.31","3.59","2.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.45","1.79","0.45","0.90","0.45","1090","9.08","28.0","339","221","8","51.92","14.0","12.9","12.36","16.2","57","8.7","23.356742081447965","154","24.75","6","0.43","0","6","2","27","0","33","18","1","0","1","37","17","1","17","0","0","2","3","12","0","0","0","6","0","5","5","7","7","6","7","0","1","0","3"
"http://usherald.com/sharpton-turns-slain-nypd-officer-presser-into-damage-control-platform-for-his-movement/","Sharpton Turns Slain NYPD Officer Presser Into Damage Control Platform for His ""Movement"". ⋆ US Herald","Al Sharpton had a chance to do right during a press conference about the two New York police officers that were assassinated over the weekend. He had the chance to condemn the actions of the cop killer, and reflect on the lives of the slain officers, which he did, kind of. He even had the chance to admit that his vehement hostility and call for protests over the Eric Garner and Michael Brown cases had a hand in the deaths of the officers, and call off the protests since they're obviously getting out of hand and only fueling violence and the rise of racial tension in the country. But, he didn't.

While Sharpton did speak out against the deaths of Officers Ramos and Liu, he said, ""We are now under intense threat from those who are misguided – from those who are trying to blame everyone from civil rights leaders to the mayor rather than deal with an ugly spirit that all of us need to fight.""

His concern wasn't where it should have been. Instead of worrying that his movement had gotten out of hand and that perhaps his outspoken ways had a part in the shooting, he was worried about his protest movement. Because, somehow Sharpton managed to make this all about him. Of course he was right in thinking it was about him. It was about him in the fact that his calls for action and demonizing police officers across the country helped play a hand in these murders. Deep down, he seems to know he had part since he said, ""To blame the mayor and others is not what we need,"" he said. ""The blame game will only lead to further venom and further division.""

The problem with Sharpton and other protest leaders like him is that they have created a brand and image for themselves that is fueled by racial tension and protesting, and having people murdered in the name of their causes mars their reputation. If Sharpton's cause were to protest against completely innocent people being murdered (like the innocent NYPD officers that were doing their jobs trying to keep the public safe) that would be one thing. Instead, Sharpton has aligned himself to defend two people that were breaking the law when they were killed. Is it unfortunate that these deaths occurred? Absolutely. But, does fueling these protests that turned violent long before the officers were killed help anyone? Absolutely not. It only creates more tension in an already tense situation. And for Sharpton to play victim in the middle of this because his beloved protest movement is under threat is utterly detestable.","2014-12-22 15:32:00","1","9.0","1.0","3.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","31.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","438","73.11","84.25","2.00","1.00","20.86","21.23","91.55","58.45","15.07","7.31","0.00","0.68","0.00","5.25","1.37","7.76","8.22","15.98","10.05","4.79","5.25","0.91","15.75","2.97","1.83","1.37","0.68","1.14","9.82","1.83","7.99","1.83","5.25","0.00","13.70","0.00","0.23","0.00","5.25","11.87","1.14","2.28","1.60","2.51","1.83","3.42","4.11","0.46","0.91","2.74","1.14","0.91","0.23","0.00","0.00","8.90","1.14","1.60","5.71","0.46","1.37","7.31","5.94","0.23","10.96","1.83","7.08","2.28","2.28","0.91","0.00","0.00","0.23","2.51","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.00","10.96","4.34","3.42","0.00","0.00","0.46","0.00","0.00","1.37","0.91","0.46","0.00","1997","7.34","21.095238095238095","601","440","19","64.85","10.5","10.0","10.04","12.1","71","16.833333333333332","17.734545454545454","227","18.14","1","0.55","0","18","3","46","0","66","16","1","0","3","70","18","0","27","0","0","28","10","21","0","0","2","14","0","19","26","12","12","9","11","6","3","0","2"
"http://usherald.com/some-ferguson-protesters-real-goal-is-derailing-american-prosperity/","Ferguson Protesters REAL Goal is to Derail American Prosperity. ⋆ US Herald","The Mike Brown campaigners are simply driven by leftist ideas. These are people who do not understand that America was built on the philosophy of toil and sacrifice. The goal is to drive American prosperity and ideals down. But many of these people who mindlessly protest are just dupes of the left. No surprise that a closer look at the groups so vocal in the Mike Brown protest reveals a number of outside players with very unsavory ties.

Read Ben Carson's -""Ferguson destroyed itself at the urging of cruel-hearted outsiders"".

While the aim is to hit back at America for all the perceived wrongs it has committed, these radical groups will keep claiming that they only want justice for Mike Brown.

The Mike Brown protesters have gone a to the extreme now. The justification for protesting via ""rioting and looting"" is illogical. Why, for example, are the commercial banks, Collinsville Acquisitions Inc, Thompson Coburn, and virtually every church, company, government departments, legal firms, child care homes targeted by the protesters? You only have to look at the list of targets that the campaigners have released to understand that they only want to destroy basic societal infrastructure, not to pursue justice.

The protesters must understand that the St Louis companies are not related to the Mike Brown shooting. This is just but a situation of inconveniencing people and institutions in the name of protest, while truly doing the bidding of the leftists pulling their strings.

"http://usherald.com/federal-judge-calls-online-privacy-overvalued-suggests-nsa-have-full-access-to-your-data/","Federal Judge Calls Online Privacy ""Overvalued"". Suggests NSA Have Full Access to Your Data. ⋆ US Herald","It's not every day that an accomplished U.S. Judge publicly dismisses the Bill of Rights, but that's exactly what happened at a Cyber Crime conference in Washington, D.C. last week. Judge Richard Posner said that privacy is ""overvalued"" during a debate about digital privacy.

Posner, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, either forgot about the 4th Amendment that protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures, or he thinks that privacy has become an obsolete right in the digital age. Judge Posner continued on to say that the U.S. National Security Agency should have carte blanche to collect any information they want, for any reason, at any time.

Think you should have a reasonable expectation of privacy? Well, according to Judge Posner, you must be a bad person. At the Cyber Crime Conference, Posner added that privacy is only requested by people who want to conceal unsavory activities. That's less than comforting logic from a top legal mind.

Unfortunately, the judge's comments echo the kind of mismanagement and mistrust of the American public that's commonplace at the NSA under the Obama administration. Thomas Drake, a former NSA executive turned whistle-blower, released documents exposing financial waste, fraud, and abuse of privacy happening under President Obama's supervision. Drake confirmed that the NSA frequently searched and obtained data unconstitutionally, far exceeding the digital information searches that were criticized under the former Bush administration.

At the Cyber Crime Conference, Judge Posner openly supported increased government control. Not only did he suggest stripping citizens of their privacy rights, but he also stomped on American ingenuity and recommended banning businesses from producing technology products with encryption software. What's next? A ban on locking the door to our home?

"http://usherald.com/has-obama-normalizing-ties-with-cubas-dictatorship-allowed-the-castro-regime-to-hang-on-to-power-watch-senator-marco-rubio-break-it-down/","Has Obama Normalizing Ties With Cuba's Dictatorship Allowed The Castro Regime to Hang On to Power? Watch Senator Marco Rubio Break it Down. ⋆ US Herald","Obama has once again proven to the American people, and the world, that he and his administration don't hold true the principles of freedom. Obama has announced that the United States will start taking steps to lift the sanctions that have been in place against communist Cuba for over 50 years.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio pointed out in his interview with CNN that while the sanctions were in place, they served as real leverage to get the Cuban government to move towards democracy and giving the Cuban people a chance to live with real freedom. With the embargo lifted, that leverage no longer exists.

To start mending relations Obama once again showed poor negotiating skills, by striking a deal with Castro to have a prisoner swap, and agreeing to the Red Cross and United Nations monitor conditions in Cuba. The U.S. will release three Cuban spies, while Castro will release one unnamed Cuban national that worked as a spy for the U.S., as well as 53 political prisoners from Cuban prison. The problem with this, as Rubio pointed out, is that the 53 prisoners shouldn't have been in prison to begin with, and once released they will go back into prison if they start rallying for freedom and democracy in Cuba.

While it looks good on the surface to have these prisoners released, it does nothing for the United States, except galvanize Obama's reputation for loving socialism. From installing socialist health care policies to opening relations with a communist regime that is notorious for human rights violations Obama has shown that freedom for the people is not his concern. The only winner in this scenario are the brothers Castro and communism itself.

Republicans are already strategizing how to fight against the sanctions lift. Senator Marco Rubio and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham have both agreed to fight against funding for an embassy in Cuba. There is the threat of Obama using his coveted executive orders to try to bypass Congress to set up the embassy. However, the soon to be Republican controlled Congress does have the final word on how funds are spent and they will do everything in their power to keep the sanctions against Cuba in place.","2014-12-19 16:35:21","1","11.0","1.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","32.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","369","93.59","62.75","12.48","61.75","26.36","23.31","74.80","49.05","7.05","2.71","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.36","1.36","4.34","8.40","17.89","8.13","2.98","5.96","1.36","13.01","3.25","1.63","0.54","2.17","0.27","5.15","3.52","1.63","0.27","1.08","0.00","6.78","0.27","0.00","0.00","1.63","5.96","0.81","1.08","0.81","0.81","1.08","2.17","1.08","1.08","0.00","0.00","0.54","0.00","0.54","0.00","0.00","11.11","1.90","1.36","6.78","1.08","0.81","1.90","8.94","1.63","13.28","0.81","8.13","4.61","2.98","0.00","0.00","1.08","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","9.49","4.88","3.79","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.81","0.00","0.00","1771","8.07","26.714285714285715","544","369","15","54.97","12.6","11.7","11.55","14.0","75","11.875","19.970081300813007","197","23.64","5","0.48","0","10","5","35","0","52","18","0","0","5","48","46","3","26","0","0","8","5","15","0","0","3","18","0","22","9","12","7","9","11","4","0","0","2"
"http://usherald.com/if-texas-seceded-what-would-the-country-of-texas-look-like/","If Texas Seceded : What Would the Country of Texas Might Look Like. ⋆ US Herald","The United State of Texas or the Lone Star Republic of Texas are two popular names for Texas if it were to secede from the Union. There's no doubt that the thought of Texas becoming its own country is popular amongst many that hold true to conservative beliefs (and it's even popular amongst liberals, ""Let them have it! We'll take New York and California!""). But, if Texas were to secede, how would it fair? Would it be a prosperous nation or would it slowly fall into third world status?

If Texas were to secede and become its own nation, there would no doubt be growing pains. After all, Texas is the second largest state in the United States, that's a lot of land to defend and maintain. They would have to set up their own legal system, which we could assume would be a democracy, because freedom, they would have to set up their own infrastructure, including currency and defense systems, and they would have to figure out a way to make their economy stay afloat. But, if there's one thing Texas knows how to do, it's have a thriving economy. Their economy was ranked 14th in the world, and Houston on its own was 25th. In 2012 Texas had the 2nd strongest economy in the nation, and according to the Texas Comptroller's report, in 2013 the Texas GDP grew by 3.7% versus 1.8% for the whole U.S.

Texas is full of natural resources, from the oil in the ground to its fertile farmland, and since it's located along the Gulf of Mexico, it would be easy for them to do trade with nations in the Caribbean, as well as Central and South America. Assuming that the United States wouldn't put a trade embargo against the newly formed United State of Texas, they could continue to export beef and oil to the United States.

Companies are already attracted to setting up shop in Texas due to its lower taxes and and more relaxed regulations against corporations. There is no reason to believe that these would be changed. Also, Texas would be vying for more businesses to move there, so they would probably have a host of incentives for companies that moved their operations there.

The citizens of Texas would probably fare well with their new country as well. With the natural resources already at their disposal there wouldn't be much concern about getting food to the population. Getting power to the citizens would also be pretty easy, they already have their own power grid that covers a good portion of the state, and they could harness wind, solar, and even build nuclear power plants to allow more energy independence and a bonus export.

"http://usherald.com/violent-street-gang-issues-orders-to-shoot-white-cops/","Violent Street Gang Issues Orders to Shoot White Cops. ⋆ US Herald","Police officers in Cleveland are on high alert after a prison-related gang made threats against their lives. The Heartless Felons gang is ordering its members to kill white police officers. The Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office received the tip and reached out to local police departments, advising that they take extra precautions to protect themselves.

Formed in the juvenile prison system, the gang is rapidly expanding throughout the Cleveland area. The Heartless Felons are the second largest prison gang in Ohio and its members are connected to various prison disturbances, violent street crimes, and murders.

Emboldened by liberal media coverage that paints African-Americans as helpless victims and police officers as murderous villains, these dangerous gang members are seeking their criminal brand of street justice for the shooting of Tamir Rice last month. Watching all the protests and the outpouring of sympathy, these criminals probably feel they have public support to take to the streets and eliminate the enemy: white police officers who routinely risk their lives to protect and serve local communities.

The protests and the media coverage are a misrepresentation of facts and it’s now having dangerous, life-threatening results. Police officers are doing their jobs: investigating suspects for criminal wrongdoing and protecting themselves when those suspects didn’t comply with police commands. But, instead of empathizing with police officers, who should be touted as heroes for bravely doing one of the toughest jobs in America, they have been publicly demonized.

Trey Gowdy (R-SC) took Obamacare's chief architect Jonathan Gruber to task on Tuesday, with a fiery smackdown of every excuse brought forth during Gruber's attempt at half-answering, half-dodging, Rep. Gowdy's line of questions. This is Trey Gowdy doing what he does best: being tough when it matters and it shows in the video. For having a PhD. from MIT Mr. Gruber can't seem to offer any reasonable explanation to why he made the claim that Obamacare was passed due to the “stupidity of the American voter.”.

"http://usherald.com/obama-invents-bible-verses-to-push-immigration-amnesty-during-the-christmas-season/","Obama Invents Bible Verse to Push Immigration Amnesty During The Christmas Season. ⋆ US Herald","One can not simply make up verses and pretend that they are a part of the Bible. To most Americans, the Bible is a perfect document, inspired by God. The Bible cannot be added to, well... unless you are President Barack Obama. He seems to think that's OK.

Why would the president try to add to the Bible? Why would he feel the need to do something like that? Maybe he wasn't purposefully trying to add to it, maybe he just doesn't know it well enough to know what is in it and what isn't. Or... maybe he just doesn't care. Maybe he feels that he is a good enough person to add to such a special book.

When did the president add to the Bible? During a speech on immigration. Yes, he used the Bible to support his highly controversial immigration beliefs. Really? Is that right? Of course not.





During a speech on immigration, President Obama said that the Bible says ""don't throw stones at glass houses"". Okay... If the Bible really said that, what does it even mean? Could you be any more vague, Mr. President? Could you be any more confusing?

The president went on to use the Christmas story, the story of Jesus' birth, as an example of why we should allow just anyone and everyone into our country. Is there a relation between the Bible and immigration? Does it have anything to do with the Christmas story? Probably not.

No matter who you are, you can't take the Bible and make it into something that will support your cause. You just can't do that. If there is a verse in the Bible that naturally supports what you believe, then that is fine. If, however, you simply use the Bible to support your own beliefs - taking it out of context, or making up your own verses - that just shouldn't be done.

Even if you are the president, you can't add to the Bible. As president, Obama obviously feels very powerful. Powerful enough, even, to make up his own Bible verses. That is just not right. That is not something that should be done. And, to use those verses to support measures that so many have a problem with, that makes things all the worse.

It is time for the president to study the Bible. It is time for him to figure out what it really says and how that might apply to immigration. It is time for him to dig deep and discover the truth. No more making up Bible verses, it is time to read real ones. There are no glass houses mentioned in the Bible, and the Christmas story isn't exactly a story of immigration. If verses need to be made up to support a cause, maybe that cause isn't so great.","2014-12-18 11:04:01","0","15.0","2.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","32.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","468","44.51","60.13","3.70","82.96","11.14","12.39","91.45","61.75","15.60","5.98","0.00","0.43","2.78","2.56","0.21","9.62","8.33","13.25","11.32","7.48","5.34","4.27","19.44","2.99","1.71","2.35","0.21","3.21","4.49","3.85","0.64","0.21","0.00","0.00","8.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.56","20.51","3.42","4.27","3.21","5.77","1.28","5.34","1.92","0.00","1.28","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.91","0.64","1.07","3.85","2.35","0.43","2.14","17.09","0.64","7.26","0.43","4.27","2.56","2.78","0.21","0.43","0.00","5.13","0.00","1.07","0.00","0.00","0.64","0.43","0.00","19.23","8.33","5.13","0.00","0.00","2.14","0.00","0.43","0.43","2.78","0.00","0.00","1939","6.03","12.307692307692308","612","468","38","84.37","8.5","4.5","7.18","5.3","53","4.555555555555555","11.44991452991453","202","11.44","1","0.58","0","11","1","47","0","41","22","2","1","10","60","35","1","13","2","0","34","6","40","2","0","7","27","0","48","5","4","6","10","23","8","6","0","5"
"http://usherald.com/why-watts-riots-were-vastly-different-than-the-situation-in-ferguson/","Why Watts Riots Were VASTLY Different than the Situation in Ferguson. ⋆ US Herald","There are several news stories and opinion pieces aiming to find symmetry between the riots in Ferguson last week and the civil rights riots in Watts in 1965. While both were riots and both involved African Americans, they are not similar. And, any comparison between the two that results in the riots being equal, is insulting to the brave Americans who suffered in Watts.

In 1965, the town of Watts (a neighborhood of Los Angeles) was populated with African Americans who were largely confined to slum-like living conditions. There were no pre-school programs, no low-income housing options, no job training programs, limited health care, lack of public transportation, and many other inequities. In addition to their poor living conditions, African Americans were routinely subjected to violence, bombings, arson, and burning crosses.

On August 11, 1965, an African American man driving in Watts was pulled over and arrested by the LAPD for drunk driving. A crowd gathered as the arrest was happening and things turned violent. The violence and the riots lasted for six days, resulting in 34 deaths, thousands of injuries, and millions of dollars in damages. These protests were about equality - something that was severely lacking in Watts in 1965.

African Americans were publicly denied high-paying jobs, housing, and political opportunities in Watts in 1965. Today, African Americans have the equality to hold executive positions, live in any suburb they please, and run for elected office. The current President of the United States is an African American. How can some people still claim that nothing has changed in America since the 1960s?

The Watts riots are considered a significant turning point in the civil rights movement. On the other hand, the Ferguson riots are a disappointing turn backwards. The Ferguson riots aren't about social justice, equality, or overcoming a blatant barrier to freedom. The Ferguson riots are about giving voice to an invented injustice. Mike Brown committed a crime. He wasn't refused entry to school, or a restaurant, or a job. He robbed a store and assaulted a clerk. Let's not aggrandize one criminal act into an unnecessary national fight for equality.","2014-12-09 23:34:32","1","11.0","1.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","32.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","357","95.37","55.56","22.80","5.16","16.23","29.97","74.79","42.02","4.48","1.68","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.56","0.84","2.80","9.52","14.01","6.44","1.96","5.32","2.24","11.48","3.92","2.52","0.84","3.36","3.64","5.32","1.68","3.64","0.00","1.40","0.84","5.88","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.84","7.56","0.56","1.40","0.56","2.52","0.84","2.52","1.12","0.28","0.28","0.56","2.24","0.56","1.40","0.00","0.56","5.88","1.12","0.84","3.36","0.28","0.56","4.20","5.60","0.00","14.57","2.80","8.96","3.08","3.64","0.56","0.84","1.40","0.00","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.81","5.88","7.84","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","1.40","0.00","0.84","0.56","0.00","1788","8.68","16.363636363636363","553","353","22","55.24","12.5","9.5","12.93","11.4","95","8.3","19.16487252124646","211","15.27","2","0.42","0","16","11","42","0","42","37","0","0","1","55","24","7","36","0","0","5","1","7","0","0","1","9","0","6","19","12","8","11","4","2","2","0","0"
"http://usherald.com/columbia-law-students-demand-to-use-ferguson-verdict-as-an-excuse-to-skip-class/","Columbia Law Students Demand to Use Ferguson Verdict as an Excuse to Skip Class. ⋆ US Herald","There are real reasons for a student in the Law Faculty of Columbia to have an extension or reschedule of a final. Some of the past examples include the immediate death of a parent, hospitalization from a car accident, and even a case of having to rush to the hospital because the student went into early labor from stress of exams. This is the frame that one must view the current 'copy/paste' email claim for an excuse to skip an upcoming law exam: Students (plural) felt they were too traumatized by the Ferguson (which is close to 1,000 miles away from campus) shooting and riots.

It seems that the nation's 'best and brightest' are taking cue from the 'give me' generation and want to somehow become a lawyer and not put the work into it. The continued insistence by both the President and the Dean of Columbia University both key in on one crucial point: The letters demanding to be excused from the exams are all, almost to a fault, a copy/paste email chain. Not only were the letters a mass excuse pasted with 'insert name here' cleverness, but when the students received a reply from Columbia asking for further details on why that individual student felt he or she should be excluded from the exam, the responses were not forthcoming.

In other words, the students of Columbia--one of our great nation's top law schools--were too lazy to even respond with direct evidence as requested by their administration. Not only were they trying to get a day off by claiming something none of them were personally involved with or closer to than a TV screen in their dorms, but they didn't even have the honest to goodness work ethic to write their own letter as detailed by the rules that regulate their stay at Columbia. Furthermore, they ignored the request for full details on an individual basis.

This means that the students were so upset--so distraught--by the acts of Ferguson that they couldn't list one detail on how it affected them personally. Not one single shred of evidence was offered by these distraught students. If this complete lack of discipline, pride in work, and ethics is what 'the best' law school of the land has to offer then we are, indeed, doomed as a nation.","2014-12-10 17:29:27","1","10.0","1.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","31.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","392","94.21","62.99","16.06","15.08","32.67","19.90","86.48","53.32","8.42","4.08","0.26","0.51","0.00","0.51","2.81","4.34","11.48","17.09","6.63","4.34","5.61","2.04","10.97","4.59","2.55","1.28","2.04","1.53","3.83","1.53","2.30","1.02","0.00","0.26","8.93","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.26","10.71","2.04","1.79","1.53","2.55","1.02","3.83","1.28","0.77","0.00","0.51","0.51","0.00","0.51","0.00","0.00","9.95","0.77","2.30","6.12","1.28","0.77","3.83","6.63","0.77","10.97","1.53","7.14","2.81","8.16","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","14.29","3.06","3.57","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.04","0.00","3.57","1.02","0.51","1748","8.59","33.0","556","385","12","55.81","13.4","13.4","10.57","16.7","82","16.166666666666668","23.35948051948052","221","28.92","1","0.53","0","12","7","54","0","56","29","1","3","2","69","14","0","19","0","0","14","5","23","0","0","1","14","0","15","14","7","12","10","7","3","1","0","3"
"http://usherald.com/national-debt-hits-a-whopping-18-trillion/","National Debt Hits a WHOPPING 18 Trillion! ⋆ US Herald","Oh, where does the money go? Did you know that the national debt in this country has now passed the eighteen trillion dollar mark? Really? Just where is that money going, and what is anyone going to do about it? Is anyone going to step up and put a stop to the crazy borrowing and spending that is going on? What is going to happen to this country in the future if no one stops all the spending and starts paying off the debt?

It seems as if the liberals in Washington just don't care how much money this country owes. It seems as if they would rather continue to borrow and live a cushy life than try to pay off debt and live a more stable life. Maybe it is time that new politicians were brought in, politicians who care about looking out for the country, and who want to get the country out of debt.

Obama has worked hard for this country. He has worked hard to ensure that the debt has almost doubled since he took office. At the time of Obama's inauguration, the debt wasn't even to eleven trillion. Now, though, the debt has reached an amount that almost seems insurmountable. Obama doesn't seem to care about the debt problem that this country is facing, and he doesn't plan to do anything about it. What is going to happen to this county because of him?

One can only hope that the next president to take office cares a bit more about the country's debt problem. Though, it is a known fact that it will be tough work to pay off the debt that has been accumulated over the past six years. Debt is a scary thing, a big problem, and this country needs to get her debt under control - sooner rather than later - for the good of all of her citizens.","2014-12-04 16:44:18","1","9.0","0.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","30.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","315","71.90","47.46","26.00","31.17","17.50","11.43","95.87","56.83","13.02","2.54","0.00","0.00","0.32","1.90","0.32","10.48","8.89","15.56","9.52","6.98","5.71","1.59","21.59","6.03","2.54","2.54","2.54","2.54","3.81","1.90","1.59","0.32","0.00","0.00","4.13","0.00","0.00","0.63","1.27","12.06","1.90","1.27","3.81","4.76","0.95","3.49","0.95","0.32","0.00","0.63","1.27","0.00","1.27","0.00","0.00","7.62","0.00","1.59","2.54","1.90","1.59","3.49","16.19","3.49","17.46","3.49","8.89","5.08","3.49","0.00","0.00","7.62","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.00","11.75","3.49","3.49","0.00","0.00","2.22","0.00","0.63","0.00","1.90","0.00","0.00","1298","6.26","17.833333333333332","400","315","17","78.08","7.7","7.0","7.43","7.9","34","7.083333333333334","13.71746031746032","158","16.0","0","0.54","0","9","4","37","0","40","16","0","0","3","57","9","0","5","1","0","13","2","15","2","0","4","17","1","23","4","9","8","5","26","3","5","0","3"

Just after blasting President Obama and Al Sharpton over the recent NY shootings, Woods called out Sharpton again, when he took Sony to task over their dealings with the ""race racketeer"".



Sony's Amy Pascal has been working with Sharpton over Sony's so-called 'cultural blindness'. While the hack on Sony's email brought up some disturbing racial info, Sharpton is hardly an ideal person to clean up that PR disaster. Well, maybe he is and that's the problem.

Of course this is great news to everyone but if you're a kid forced to eat a lunch as mandated by Michelle Obamas school lunch program you may not have heard the latest good news. Republicans have insisted that as part of the agreement there is some hope for a common sense lunch program for our nations public school kids. According to CNN ""The talks also yielded a compromise on a school lunch program championed by first lady Michelle Obama. The spending bill includes a measure that gives local school districts some flexibility on how they enforce nutrition standards for whole grain items on menus.""

This should allow some school districts some leeway to make better choices than the current Michelle Obama plan. Not that Michelle seems too worried about what her kids are eating. The Obama kids menu from their $36,000 a year tuition school lunch looked amazing on Tuesday. The Daily Caller reports that they were served a choice of ""Potato Sausage Soup; Firecracker Slaw; California Chef's Salad; All Natural Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wings; Sweet Potato Black Bean Bake; Sautéed Local Greens; Gemelli Alfredo; Sliced Pineapple"". Oh, just to be clear that is just the menu for one day. Not for the week.

Should our countries school districts be able to choose how to feed our kids in public schools without needing the federal government to fight it our in Congress?

"http://usherald.com/make-sure-you-dont-miss-these-important-obamacare-deadlines-or-you-will-be-subject-to-some-considerable-fines/","Make Sure You Don't Miss These Important Obamacare Deadlines or You Will Be Subject to Some Considerable Fines. ⋆ US Herald","Obamacare may cost you a lot more than you originally thought. That is the new statement released as information from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). February 15, 2015 is the new deadline to have Obamacare coverage. If coverage is not met, then there will be a fine to pay per person (not per family).

How much bigger is the fine for 2015 than it already is? Currently, the fine would average $95 an adult. That is a big chunk to a lot of people. If that fine was assessed to a family of three (remember, the kids are on the insurance plans in college!) the fine would be $285. That is already a hefty fine for most middle class workers, but next year that fine is going to skyrocket to over $1,000 for the same family. To put this into perspective, it is now financially safer to have two DUIs in some states than it is for a lapse in mandatory Obamacare.

The changes to the fine itself comes from an increase to 2% of the income or $325 per adult--whichever is higher. The Liberals wanted to make sure the middle class paid more than their share of dues with this increase. Should a hard working parent have to shell out an extra $1000 at the end of the year because of a bloated mandatory noose that Obama peddled as health care? Even the snake oil salesmen didn't have the greed to make their product mandatory, but Obama sure seemed to be okay with lining his pockets with insurance company money.

Imagine a land where everyone had to give your rich uncle money just because you could make it a law against the people's will. Obama doesn't have to imagine that because that is just what he did. His Uncle Allstate is stuffing Obama's pockets with enough money to give him a good nest egg for retirement and we get to be the ones unwillingly giving to that fund.

How do we know that Obama's health care cronies are benefiting directly? A quick look at this CBO report will show that ""CBO and JCT Estimate That the Coverage Provisions of the ACA Will Have a Net Cost to the Federal Government of $1.5 Trillion Over the 2015–2024 Period"". Let's put that number into focus. $1.5 Trillion. That is your money. That is my money. That is the money that is not being used for education for our kids and money not used to protect our soldiers.

Obama has said the ACA was simple math. He was right, but if you looked at his scratch paper, you'd see: Your Childern's Future + Taking Care of our Vets < Making my Insurance industry cronies happy. Isn't it about time for someone to yell ""pencils down!"" to Mr. Obama and start getting our future back?

"http://usherald.com/anti-gun-psa-gone-horribly-wrong-kid-takes-gun-to-school-to-show-teacher/","Gun control PSA urges kids to steal parents' guns, carry them to school, and give them to teachers: Because apparently encouraging small children to carry guns unsupervised is safe? ⋆ US Herald","

Ever wonder how absolutely out of touch anti-gun nuts are with the very thing they want to ban? Wonder no further, as Rejina Sincic just put out a PSA that will make New York's gun policy seem sane.

Sincic, who goes by the name 'Queen Sincic' to her followers, put a video out that not only shows everything a responsible gun owner would never allow but anything a person with any common sense would avoid. She has a young teen walk past his mother (who is reading the paper) and enter her room. He then goes into her dresser drawer and finds an unlocked gun (no safe or gun lock) covered up by one of his mother's blouses.

Yes, the only thing that stands between an apparently loaded gun and a teenage boy are his mother's silk tops. I'm not sure where Sincic got her information from, but most gun owners fully support a safe and a gun lock for the weapon--not stuffing a loaded weapon into your underwear drawer.

The PSA gets weirder as the kid stuffs the gun into his backpack and goes to school. Yes, the anti-gun PSA just showed kids they should shove their mother's gun into their backpack, get on the school bus, and put the gun next to your lunch in your desk. This is dangerous to show kids. The gun wouldn't pass a security check in some schools and it has no place in a child's hands at school. I am a bit puzzled how the kid kept a loaded gun hidden from his teacher and friends for most of the school day while it rested near his lunch bag.

After all of the kids go to lunch, the teen then gets up and walks to his teacher. He pulls the loaded gun out of the bag, points it at her, and then slams the gun (still pointed at her) down on the desk. His message? 'I don't want this at my house.'

At what point would this PSA resemble anything real? At what point did 'Queen' Sincic do research on how guns are kept in homes or even the policy of bringing a loaded weapon to school. Her message is for the kids to sneak into their parent's bedroom, smuggle the loaded gun out in a school bag, and then give it to their teacher to dispose of. Except that would, in reality, have the kid expelled for school, given a weapons charge, and most likely shot either by himself for handling the gun so recklessly or by security. Not to mention the poor teacher whose job really is no where near 'gun disposal unit'.

Not only does the PSA miss the mark, but it is so far off from reality it is more of a liability that will cause damage when people try this out than a method of intelligent discourse. Then again, what else would we expect from a self-appointed liberal 'Queen'?","2014-12-24 14:55:07","1","12.0","0.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","0.0","30.0","33.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","13.0","8","496","84.91","77.21","11.88","12.43","21.57","12.10","83.47","53.23","11.90","6.65","0.81","0.20","0.60","3.83","1.21","5.24","9.88","14.92","5.44","4.64","6.45","2.42","12.50","4.44","2.22","2.42","0.20","1.81","3.83","1.41","2.42","0.20","0.81","0.20","13.10","1.01","0.40","3.02","2.42","11.29","1.21","1.21","2.22","3.43","1.21","3.23","1.81","1.01","0.00","0.60","0.81","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.60","8.27","1.01","0.81","4.84","0.81","1.41","1.41","7.86","1.61","14.72","2.82","8.27","3.43","4.03","0.20","1.01","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.60","0.00","0.00","0.60","0.00","0.00","14.52","3.83","3.83","0.00","0.00","0.81","0.00","1.01","0.00","3.83","1.21","0.00","2015","6.61","21.956521739130434","632","492","22","74.12","9.2","8.5","7.78","9.9","58","10.1","15.675447154471545","243","20.13","8","0.51","0","18","1","61","0","58","25","2","2","8","114","18","0","16","0","0","17","21","32","0","1","6","12","0","18","13","4","5","16","22","3","5","1","6"
"https://madworldnews.com/find-actor-said-paid-hypocrite-called-show-filth/","Which Actor Said ‘I Was A Paid Hypocrite’ & Called His Own Show ‘Filth’","It’s not often you hear an actor say, “I was a paid hypocrite,” and refer to their own show as ‘filth,’ but that’s exactly what Angus T. Jones, former “Two and a Half Men” star, had to say to the shock of fans. He surprised viewers in November 2012 when he announced that he had embraced Christianity and was struggling with the star television role he had played for almost a decade.

Jones has continued on his journey with Christianity and hasn’t stopped talking about the show that he left behind. While speaking out about his faith, Angus explains why he eventually left the comedy. He referred to himself as a “paid hypocrite” for continuing to work on the show even though he wasn’t comfortable with its content.

Jones played the character Jake Harper in the sitcom and was still an active “Two and a Half Men” cast member when he called the program “filth” and announced that he no longer wanted to be a part of it. Although he ended up apologizing over his comments, he later left the cast in 2013.

One year after his exit, The Blaze reports, Jones is going to school in Colorado and speaking to church audiences about his experience with getting closer to God and leaving Hollywood.

During an interview with Houston’s KHOU-TV, Jones elaborated on his career and the public comments he made about the show “Two and a Half Men” that had him making headlines and landed him in hot water:

“And it was making light of topics in our world that are really problems for a lot of people and I was a paid hypocrite because I wasn’t okay with it, but I was still doing it.”

Although Jones said his time away from the entertainment industry has offered up some perspective about his journey thus far, he isn’t opposed to performing in faith-based projects in the future.

“I really want to be able to come into the light, and because I know that’s where genuine healing is. And I’ve just seen God do amazing things.”

As far as regrets go, Jones was disappointed in his critique of show creator Chuck Lorre, offering this apology:

“That’s his like baby and I just totally insulted his baby and to that degree I am apologetic but otherwise I don’t regret saying what I said.”

In a video testimony of his faith, where Jones publicly critiqued “Two and a Half Men.” Jones went as far as to plead with others not to watch the show:

“‘Two and a Half Men’ — if you watch ‘Two and a Half Men,’ please stop watching [it]…I’m ​on ‘​Two and a Half Men’; I don’t want to be on it. Please stop watching it. Please stop filling your head with filth.” “Please — it’s, you know, people say it’s just ‘entertainment.’ The fact that it’s entertainment — do some research on the effects of television and your brain, and I promise you you’ll have a decision to make … it’s bad news.”

Watch that testimony below:

With the articles I’ve written on pornography, I feel that this brave young man is absolutely correct. Entertainment is not just entertainment. What we watch and tolerate plants seeds. Bravo to this strong, courageous young man for sticking to his values.

"https://madworldnews.com/msnbc-host-blame-ebola-nra/","MSNBC Host Points Finger Of Blame For Ebola Crisis… At The NRA?","MSNBC’s online video series, Krystal Clear, had host Krystal Ball pointing the finger of blame for the Ebola crisis. Somehow, Ball managed to find an unlikely culprit lurking behind the current health concern — the NRA.

Is the NRA making the Ebola crisis worse? According to Ball and her guests, Medical Ethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan and political insider former MO State Senator Jeff Smith, the answer is YES. In the clip below, the 3 discuss the impact of the NRA blocking President Barack Obama’s surgeon general nominee during the Ebola crisis.

Because of Dr. Vivek Murthy’s view that guns are a public safety concern, he has received opposition for his nomination to surgeon general by many, but most notably the NRA. Now that we find ourselves knee-deep in fears of Ebola in the U.S. without a surgeon general, the only liberal-logical conclusion is that the NRA is to blame for making the Ebola crisis worse.

Did you follow that?

I feel like the clip should come with a headache warning. See if you can make sense of this liberal lunacy:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_iWejbtpEs#t=316

“As the Ebola crisis continues, confusion and fear grows. So why are we still waiting on President Obama’s Surgeon General nominee to get to work? The answer: guns,” Ball said as she smugly introduced the segment. She adds, “The U.S. Surgeon General is supposed to be the nation’s leading spokesman on matters of public health, a trusted public health expert who helps us all of us understand what we need to be worried about, like, I don’t know, maybe Ebola to name a random example. But because Senate Democrats are afraid of the NRA, President Obama’s nominee Dr. Vivek Murthy has been sitting on the sidelines since February.”

The connection and conclusion the “experts” come to in the video is not only mind-boggling, it’s cringe worthy. We should not let it surprise us that the liberal-left, gun-grabbers wouldn’t let an opportunity to demonize guns and the NRA go to waste… But a viral health crisis, really?

It couldn’t be that they are utilizing America’s fear of Ebola to push their agenda and give Obama’s surgeon general nominee a helping hand in obtaining the position, could it? How many other times have we seen gun control supporters use human tragedy to advance their agendas? This is a play from their same, old, tired book.

Hmmm, you’d think if Dr. Murthy had anything useful to contribute to the Ebola situation, Obama’s media lapdogs would be gladly rubbing everyone’s nose in it, along with singing praises about Obama’s nomination. Since that doesn’t seem to be the case, they can’t miss the opportunity to attack and blame their opposition.

I guess when Bush can’t really be blamed, the NRA is the liberal left’s next fall guy.

"https://madworldnews.com/feinstein-proposes-common-sense-alcohol-control-bill/","Dianne Feinstein Proposes Common Sense Alcohol Control Bill With Huge Democrat Support","It is no wonder that many members of the Democratic party are crying out for immediate Alcohol Control due to the harm and cost our nation is seeing related to impaired driving. According to the CDC, “Every day, almost 30 people in the United States die in motor vehicle crashes that involve an alcohol-impaired driver. This amounts to one death every 48 minutes. The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totals more than $51 billion.”

Staggering statistics noted throughout our nation have made it obvious that common sense alcohol control is needed before more preventable deaths occur. With the country’s best interest and safety as her goal, Dianne Feinstein has proposed a needed common sense Alcohol Control bill.

A summary of Feinstein’s proposed Alcohol Control bill is as follows:

Limit all alcohol consumers to 1-3 drinks, to be no more than 6 ounces each and of no more alcohol content than 1% by volume. Anyone wishing to drink alcohol will be required to obtain a State Alcohol Consumption permit and pass a background check before purchasing any alcohol. With every alcohol purchase, an additional background check will be required and paid for by the consumer. Anyone with any type of criminal record or mental health history will be ineligible for purchasing, owning, or consuming alcohol. A waiting period for the purchase of alcohol will be determined by each state. All consumers of alcohol will be required to take a ‘Safe Alcohol Consumption’ class to be paid for by the consumer. Large capacity, high potency alcoholic beverages (often referred to as assault beverages) will be outlawed. Alcohol will only be able to be purchased in a 3-pack or less with a serving size as stated in item 1. Members of Congress and Senate will be excluded, as the bill is intended to remove large capacity, high potency alcoholic beverages from the hands of the average citizen. Alcoholic beverages will only be sold in bottles, as it has been determined, cans can be opened too rapidly. All alcohol purchases will be registered with the Federal Alcohol Registry. If at any time alcohol is being transported in a vehicle, it must be transported with the alcohol and the bottle opener in separate areas of the vehicle.

Feinstein and other supporters of the bill feel that by limiting the consumption and capacity of alcoholic beverages we could save many lives, especially those of innocent children. Referencing the frightening statistics where alcohol is involved in senseless deaths, Feinstein points out that the American public has the right to feel safe from the dangers of alcohol and what people could do with it. Additional supporters, the majority of which are Democrats, go on to argue that the government can not depend on its citizens to use alcohol safely and responsibly, stating further regulation is a must. According to Feinstein, the safety of all is more important than the freedom of those that choose to be alcohol consumers.

As expected, the constitutionality of the bill has been questioned. Feinstein states the Twenty First Amendment was never intended to give the average citizen the right to consume what has now been termed assault beverages. She further states, at the time of the amendment, Congress could not foresee the degree to which alcohol and impaired driving would evolve into what we have today.

Some of those that have opposed the bill state they use alcohol to relax after a stressful day; however, Feinstein counters their argument, stating Obamacare offers counseling services to assist with coping. Those stating that they use alcohol for recreational purposes have been assured that the regulations within the bill do not prevent the safe and responsible recreational use of alcohol.

"https://madworldnews.com/healthcare-reform-reality-check/","[WATCH] Health Insurance & Healthcare Reform Just Got A Reality Check","Health insurance and healthcare reform just got a reality check. In a presentation below, from January 30, 2014, AAPS (Association of American Physicians and Surgeons) Thrive, Not Just Survive XIX, in Louisville, KY, Josh Umbehr, MD of Atlas MD discusses working directly with his patients and cutting out the insurance and government bureaucrats to lower the costs for patients and increase the quality of care received.

Opening with this quote, “If you want a thing done don’t give it to the man familiar with the art, who knows that it can not be done, give to someone that does not know that it cannot be done and he will do it,” Dr. Umbehr explains that he began his initiative, straight out of residency, with a philosophy that insurance complicates more than it helps.

Built on a membership model, the program offers healthcare at a significantly lower costs, eliminating the insurance middle man and many of the tedious government regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid. With an ability to buy direct at wholesale, the medical professionals participating in the program are able to obtain medications and supplies at a reduced cost. Without the insurance company standing in the way, those savings can be passed directly on to the patient.

To try to put the program as simply as possible, the patient pays a monthly membership fee, instead of an insurance premium. This monthly fee is much lower than most insurance premiums, being just $10 for children and $50-$100 for adults, varying by age ranges. With their fee, they have membership to the healthcare program and the services it provides. Then, the physicians and administrators of the program buy directly from medical supply and pharmaceutical companies at reduced wholesale prices, always looking for the best deals and contracts to get the most out of the dollar, using the moneys obtained through the membership fee, rather than co-pays and insurance premiums. And the savings aren’t limited to just office visits. Prescriptions, lab tests, and other diagnostic testing are also available.

Dr. Umbehr refers to himself as the ‘token evil republican’ in med school, but his republican thinking proved successful for healthcare as he explains the savings his patients and members were able to receive on quality healthcare using his model.

It comes as no surprise to me that a doctor, fresh out of med school, can reform our healthcare better than the politicians in DC. Where the majority of politicians have no experience in the healthcare field, they also have no vested interest in the recent reform, being exempt from it themselves. Those in the trenches of today’s medical field not only have insight from their experience, but are also directly affected by the programs in place, not only as professionals, but as patients themselves.

Dr. Umbehr expresses the view that “business isn’t bad, money’s not bad, and the combination of medicine and business isn’t bad. It can be done wrong, but when done right, it creates a better product for our patients.” He goes on to say, “True doctor-patient advocacy is fighting for your patients, not being complacent in a broken insurance-based system when you know there’s a better way.” And a better way is exactly what Dr. Umbehr found as he quotes real savings of 90-95%, using his membership model for providing primary care and family medicine.

With increased convenience and decreased cost for patients, the program has proven successful, going from zero patients to over 1,500 in just over 3 years. Dr. Umbehr credits the value added for patients and the community for the success of his program model. Not only are patients experiencing savings themselves, many employers also saved money on the insurance premiums they provide their employees.

Another benefit of this model is more time for the doctors to spend with the patients because they are not forced to spend countless hours documenting, solely for insurance purposes, bringing the doctor’s attention back to the patient, rather than the chart. Although it is not directly mentioned in his presentation, the program as it is described would also provide for a streamlined billing process. Indeed, it sounds like this model simplifies many aspects of the healthcare process.

To drive home the point of how and why his membership program works, Dr. Umbehr uses the gas station analogy. Gas stations do not accept car insurance as payment for gasoline. If they did, the insurance would tell you where you can fill up, how often, and how much you can get. Not to mention, you would need pre-approval for a trip out of town. This begs the question, why are we using insurance for routine primary care?

Could this model be what it takes for doctors to turn out the lights on health insurance companies? As Dr. Umbehr asks, “Why stay in a broken system when you can make more money, seeing fewer patients, providing better care, that actually saves your patient money?” After 3 1/2 years, a better way has been proven through this model, and Dr. Umbehr encourages his colleagues to fight for it for their patients.

As a nurse with almost 20 years in healthcare, I’m shocked to hear the prices that this membership model has been able to obtain through buying direct at wholesale. What’s even more astonishing is comparing those prices to what is paid to healthcare professionals employed by insurance companies to review claims in an attempt to save the insurance company money. As someone that has worked on both sides of the fence, both as a provider in the field trying to get paid and as a reviewer for insurance, deciding if procedures will be paid, I’ve seen from the inside how broken the system has become.

Dr. Umbehr’s presentation filled me with hope and provided knowledge that has left me even more shocked and appalled with our current system. To know the number of healthcare professionals employed by insurance companies and what they are paid to review cases for approval, compared with the prices of services, medications, and supplies quoted in Dr. Umbehr’s presentation, I’m nauseated by the waste that is healthcare insurance.

Could a membership program be the way of the future? Could this be the healthcare reform we really need? Listen to Dr. Umbehr’s presentation and you decide.

What say you? Could this be the answer we desperately need? Even as a healthcare professional myself, I had never heard of healthcare offered quite like this. If you are as impressed as I am, don’t forget to share. We have other options. Obamacare, insurance, and copious government regulation are not the answer.","2014-09-09 08:55:52","0","38.0","26.0","4.0","1.0","19.0","0.0","77.0","26.0","0.0","132.0","0.0","12.0","0","1107","84.75","67.42","10.73","51.10","23.06","25.93","83.83","50.14","10.03","5.15","0.81","0.63","1.08","1.45","1.17","4.88","8.22","15.72","7.50","3.61","6.78","2.17","13.73","5.42","4.34","1.72","1.36","1.63","4.07","2.71","1.36","0.09","0.18","0.27","9.30","0.09","0.09","0.00","1.63","10.66","2.26","1.90","1.63","1.54","1.17","3.52","1.26","0.45","0.54","0.00","2.26","0.00","2.17","0.00","0.09","8.04","2.08","2.44","2.62","1.81","0.36","2.35","10.12","0.54","10.03","1.45","6.59","2.35","6.32","0.27","0.27","5.51","0.00","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.00","0.09","0.00","0.00","15.81","4.70","6.96","0.00","0.00","0.63","0.00","0.54","0.81","1.54","0.18","0.45","5323","7.74","24.955555555555556","1666","1099","54","59.23","12.1","10.1","11.89","12.4","215","16.333333333333332","17.985295723384894","445","21.8","11","0.48","0","38","15","111","0","146","66","11","2","15","200","49","1","79","0","1","52","19","54","3","1","3","35","0","46","14","27","40","30","41","5","7","0","11"
"https://madworldnews.com/nurse-treating-islamic-terrorists/","Nurse Speaks Out About Treating Islamic Terrorists “Who Chop Off Heads”","As a retired nurse with almost 20 years experience in healthcare, I have to admit that I’ve been in difficult situations. Many times, I cared for inmates from the local prison, hospitalized at the medical center, with guards at their door. It has always been expected, as a healthcare professional, I give care without personal bias, regardless of the patient’s history. This isn’t unique to me, as many nurses throughout time have had to care for perpetrators of crimes. However, one nurse is speaking out about a certain patient population she is tired of treating – the ISIS terrorists.

Working at a private hospital in Mersin, a city and province on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, a nurse only identified by the initials E.G. told Turkish authorities and Parliament she is sick and tired of treating members of the terrorist organization the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which now calls itself the ‘Islamic State.’

In a news story published by Taraf, E.G. said of ISIL militants, “We treat them, and they go on to decapitate people. I am sick of treating wounded ISIL militants.” According to TODAY’S ZAMAN, E.G. has also written a letter to Parliament and the National Police Department, saying she and her colleagues are extremely disturbed by the fact that they have to treat people “who chop off heads.”

Even though my training as a nurse would say I should feel otherwise and not hold prejudice toward a patient, I can’t help but agree with E.G. and her colleagues. I couldn’t imagine trying to rehabilitate such monsters, knowing that with the regained health I am helping them achieve, they will go on to violently slaughter others.

E.G. and her colleagues are not alone in their feelings on the issue. Other health workers in Mersin and other provinces close to the Syrian border are also uneasy about having to help wounded ISIL militants, who are responsible for extreme violence and bloodshed in northern Iraq and Syria per a Taraf report.

Allegedly, in the letter written to Parliament and the Police Department, E.G. said she has been employed at a private hospital in Mersin for a long time and this hospital has treated many wounded Syrians so far, who have introduced themselves as ‘opposition members;’ however, she also noted that she had found out most of the Syrians recently admitted to the hospital were ISIL members. According to Taraf’s report, E.G. wrote, “I was extremely distressed about this. I am very sorry about this situation. I am disturbed by the fact that these people are being treated in our hospitals while our people are being held by them.”

E.G.’s distress is warranted, as ISIL has held 46 Turks and three consulate staff, who are not Turkish citizens, as hostages for the past three months.

TODAY’S ZAMAN goes on to report that E.G. further wrote that she was “ashamed” to have played a role in the treatment of the militants. Adding that, according to E.G., the ISIL militants were checked into the hospital under fake names.

She said an ISIL commander was treated at the hospital where she works in August. “The ISIL commander named Muhammet Ali R. who was admitted to our hospital on Aug. 7 was treated at room number 323. Many of his bodyguards kept watch around the hospital. Many other ISIL commanders like him and soldiers have been treated at our hospital, and returned to war after the completion of their treatment. I don’t want to help these people. I want you to inspect these hospitals. And I am referring the owners of the hospital and its management to God.”

Who can blame her for her disgust, distress, and concern? While the job of a nurse is rarely if ever easy, this is a turbulent situation that I could not even begin to fathom being forced to partake in. While refusal to provide care could likely cost her job, complying could damage her soul. Should nurses in these areas affected by the horrific violence of this terrorist group – whether you call them IS, ISIL, or ISIS – be able to refuse to give care to those that may later kill them or their loved ones?

"https://madworldnews.com/student-sent-principals-office-citing-immigration-laws/","Student Sent To Principal’s Office For Citing Immigration Laws","I never thought one of my proudest “mom moments” would begin with a text from my high school daughter stating that she had been sent to the principal’s office at school, but that is how this story begins. Today, as I was finishing up a hectic day at work, I received what I initially thought was a dreaded text. My daughter, Hannah, sent me the text to let me know she had gotten into some trouble at school.

Hannah explained via text that she had gotten drawn into a classroom debate. The class was government, which gave all my co-workers a chuckle, since they know how verbal I can be about politics. The debate began over immigration and whether immigrants should learn English.

You see, in our state of Pennsylvania, Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Butler, wants English to be named the official language in the commonwealth, while Rep. Angel Cruz, D-Philadelphia, says it should be Spanish.

My daughter stated that it is already the expectation for anyone legally immigrating to the United States to have a basic understanding of English according to current immigration laws. Unfortunately, another female student become highly offended and took my daughter’s comment personally. You see, the other student has a boyfriend whose parents are illegal immigrants. This student argued with my daughter stating English is hard to learn and some immigrants just might not want to learn it. My daughter’s rebuttal was that anyone that has gained legal citizenship is already expected to have a knowledge of English, so those not learning it are those breaking the law and she shouldn’t be forced to learn Spanish to appease criminals. The other student became increasingly upset, telling my daughter she’s just lazy.

At that point, both girls were sent to the office. This is extremely disheartening to me. In a class on government, one child citing immigration law was sent to the principal’s office because the truth offended the other student who could not contain her emotional outburst.

What’s even more disheartening was the principal’s response. According to my daughter, she was told by the principal that she should not have said what she said because it was demeaning. Since when did stating the law become demeaning? If the school had become aware of other criminal activity, such as drugs or abuse, the reaction would have been quite different from the faculty.

Doesn’t it speak volumes about how far our society has fallen in regards to illegal immigration when the other student felt quite comfortable announcing publicly that her boyfriend’s parents were guilty of the crime?

I told my daughter to stand her ground and do not apologize for stating fact. Lucky for the school, they did not try to issue any punishment as of this time. I became aware of the issue at the end of the school day and was approximately an hour away at work. I decided this is an issue I’d rather address in person, so at this time, I will not identify the school by name. I will be requesting that the principal address the class, stating the law. I will also expect the teacher to apologize to my daughter in front of the class. The teacher is to be teaching government after all, not dismissing students to the principal’s office for stating fact.

As I told my daughter, “Just because the truth hurts doesn’t mean you are demeaning for speaking it.” Although this story isn’t over yet, I wanted to write it now for my daughter. I hope others will share it to show support of her actions. A mom’s praise and pride only goes so far with a teen – Let’s show her that she’s not alone in her beliefs and praise her bravery for taking a stand against misinformation and ignorance. Way to go, Hannah! We are proud of you!","2014-03-28 19:17:25","0","31.0","27.0","4.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","76.0","28.0","0.0","133.0","0.0","12.0","0","642","61.23","64.01","29.43","14.92","17.83","22.90","88.32","54.21","15.89","9.03","4.98","0.62","0.62","2.49","0.31","6.85","7.79","12.93","10.59","3.74","4.83","2.18","18.22","3.43","1.25","1.87","0.31","1.40","5.14","2.18","2.96","0.47","0.78","0.62","13.24","2.49","0.31","4.98","0.31","14.33","3.74","1.71","2.49","2.18","1.25","3.74","1.87","0.62","0.78","0.47","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","9.97","1.40","1.56","5.92","0.93","0.31","6.70","9.81","1.56","10.28","1.56","4.83","4.05","7.32","0.00","0.31","0.00","0.31","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.16","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.17","4.98","4.83","0.00","0.00","0.31","0.31","0.47","0.62","2.65","0.00","0.00","2967","7.43","20.0","921","641","36","70.33","10.8","7.9","10.26","10.1","118","8.7","16.483494539781592","297","18.27","18","0.52","0","11","2","67","0","73","39","0","1","12","123","29","1","18","0","0","43","20","38","1","0","1","25","0","35","42","24","17","10","16","2","4","1","5"
"https://madworldnews.com/read-find-bill-concealed-carry-permit-holders-excited/","[READ] Find Out What Bill Has Concealed Carry Permit Holders Excited","With gun laws and regulations being a hot topic in the news and among patriots, it is a relief to finally see a bill that makes sense. The National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2013, introduced last August, would treat concealed carry permits like driver’s licenses, allowing current permit holders to carry in any other state that issues permits. You read that right! The bill, currently in the U.S. House of Representatives, would do away with the patchwork of state reciprocity laws and establish a uniform right to carry concealed firearms across all fifty states.

As a Pennsylvania concealed carry permit holder that drives to and from Maryland on a regular basis, I cannot even begin to express how happy this would make me!

Rep. Richard Nugent, (R-FL), sponsor of the bill, explained, “If I have a driver’s license issued by the state of Florida and I drive all the way across the country to California, my driver’s license is valid the entire way. Even though the requirements for obtaining a driver’s license may vary from state to state, we have a system that recognizes the need for reciprocity. Currently, that sort of reciprocity does not extend to concealed carry licenses for firearms.”

Guns.com further explains Nugent’s bill:

Nugent’s bill, detailed as HR2959, would allow the holder of a valid concealed carry permit to carry a concealed handgun in any state that issues its own residents permits. Persons carrying as a non-resident in a state would be bound by whatever laws of the state they are visiting. This would end the confusing patchwork of reciprocity agreements that are currently in place across the country. Some states, like Utah, have very flexible reciprocity, recognizing concealed carry permits from as many as 35 states. While others, such as Illinois, recognizes none but their own. Under the Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act, this would change.

This is not the only bill drawing attention. A companion bill, S.1908, has been introduced into the Senate by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX). It should come as no surprise, both bills have been greeted with opposition from gun control advocacy groups.

Erika Soto Lamb, spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns gave the following criticism:

“Sen. Cornyn’s bill dangerously introduces a lowest common denominator when it comes to who can carry a concealed weapon. Each state sets its own standards and this legislation would undermine those laws.”

Unfortunately, we shouldn’t get our hopes up too quickly, as this is not the first time national right-to-carry reciprocity was tried. According to Guns.com:

In 2011, HR822 was introduced to the house by Rep. Clif Stearns (R-FL), it had much the same wording as the current HR2959. That bill passed the House with a wide measure of support on a 272-174 vote but was killed in the Senate. In 2004, the The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA), was signed into law which allows current and qualified retired police officers to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States, regardless of state laws, with certain exceptions. HR2959 is currently in the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. The bill has some 121 co-sponsors, including six House Democrats.

All I can say is, I hope Nugent was right when he said, “The previous version of this legislation passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in 2011 and I look forward to seeing it pass again during this Congress.” I would fully support and look forward to the passing of this bill.

"https://madworldnews.com/ongoing-turmoil-russia-ukraine-obama-may-shock/","With Ongoing Turmoil Between Russia & Ukraine, What Obama Is Doing May Shock You!","With the ongoing turmoil between Russia and Ukraine, it’s hard to believe that President Obama is focused on vacation – his third vacation this year! That’s right, less than 3 months into 2014 and the Obama’s are on their third vacation.

Apparently, it doesn’t matter that American’s have had enough of the Obama’s frivolous vacation spending, that many fear WWIII is looming in the near future, or that major economic issues are still plaguing the U.S. Obama doesn’t feel the need to stay at the White House and do his job. Instead, he’s heading to Key Largo, Florida for a long weekend with his family at the Ocean Reef Club, a five star resort on 2,500 tropical acres.

Unlike the Obama we’ve come to know, he isn’t even making any excuses for it. White House spokesman Josh Earnest released the following curt statement:

“The president over the course of a very busy week has maintained his schedule and his ability to monitor ongoing events in Ukraine. I would anticipate that he’ll do the same thing this weekend. And the fact of the matter is what the president is doing this weekend in Florida is essentially what the president will be doing if he stayed back at the White House. It’s just that the weather will be a little warmer.”

A vacation a month seems to be the president’s new routine. For January’s vacation American taxpayers were billed $4 million for a family retreat to Oahu, while First Lady Michelle Obama stayed for an extra week at Oprah Winfrey’s beach house in Maui to celebrate her 50th birthday.

February’s vacation included playing a round of golf when the president flew to Southern California to meet with the King Abdullah II of Jordan.

To add insult to injury, Michelle is also scheduled to take another multi-million dollar trip to China later this month with her daughters. The eight-day vacation has been disguised as business with a couple of “school visits.” Michelle and daughters will see Beijing, Chengdu, and Xian during their excursion.

We shouldn’t be surprised, as this seems to be the Obama way. As the American people are fed lines on the need for income equality, the Obama’s have enjoyed numerous multi-million dollar vacations on the taxpayer dime. Last year, Michelle spent $5 million on a two-day trip to Ireland, including a $3,300 per night suite in Dublin. She and Barack spent a staggering $11 million in December to travel to South Africa for Nelson Mandela’s funeral, despite only being in the country for a mere 13 hours. The Obamas also spent around $100 million for a trip to Africa last year and another several million for a vacation to Martha’s Vineyard.

Have you done the math? In total, the Obamas have spent well over $125 million on their lavish vacations since coming into office.

Vice President Biden seems to be joining in on the vacationing fun without concern for the intensifying crisis in Crimea and the rapidly changing situation in Ukraine. While Obama is in Florida, Biden will be in the Virgin Islands.

Meanwhile, the majority of the American citizens will be continuing the feel the crunch of the economic hardships that are snowballing for most since Obama took office, but have no fear, our leader is warm and comfortable during his Florida getaway that includes family time and many recreational amenities on the property, including workout facilities, tennis courts, and a couple of golf courses. Have you had enough yet, America?

"https://madworldnews.com/pornography-an-unpopular-opinion-or-a-harsh-reality/","Pornography: An Unpopular Opinion Or A Harsh Reality?","Pornography is coming under attack by many organizations and a somewhat unpopular opinion of its effects is being spotlighted. However, research is showing that the criticisms pornography is receiving isn’t just the opinion of a few Christian prudes, but a harsh reality that our society needs to soon face with the industry becoming more readily available and accepted by the majority than ever. It’s no surprise that the proven negative effects of pornography are trying to be dismissed when a vast majority of society have become porn users themselves. With so many partaking in pornography, it is only expected that those speaking against it will have an “unpopular” opinion.

The research and proof of the harms of pornography are becoming more and more evident. The number of groups rising against the porn industry is growing. Harsh realities of what was once thought to be harmless behavior are coming to light, thanks to organizations and groups willing to speak out.

ProjectKnow.com recently featured the THE NOFAP EXPERIMENT: A VOYAGE THROUGH PORN ADDICTION, SUPPORT, AND RECOVERY, an in-depth look at pornography addiction. NoFap is a non-religious community support group on Reddit.com, in which members have taken a stand against their own personal use of pornography. Participation has been for various reasons — usually because they recognize the negative effects it has had on their life. These Reddit users are voluntarily abstaining from using pornography and from masturbation.

A survey was taken of these Reddit users and mixed with other research data gathered from various sources, and compiled into an interesting infographic that is featured on ProjectKnow.com.

Using the data from ProjectKnow.com and the NoFap experiment, ChurchMag compiled the following list of five non-religious reasons to avoid pornography:

1. Disinterest in Marital Sex Viewing pornography creates the Coolidge Effect or novelty-seeking behavior. The effect is declined arousal with the same mate, and the only way to restore arousal, is by having different mates regularly. Porn trains the brain to continual newness. The effects, of course, often lead to infidelity or a complete lack of sexual interest towards ones spouse. 2. Lack of Control 1 in 5 people, who watch pornography regularly, admit they feel controlled by their sexual desires. Much like a drug user becomes powerless over their addiction, pornography seeps in and dominates every area of your life. 3. Never Satisfied 64% say the type of pornography they indulge in becomes increasingly extreme and deviant. When you consider these effects with the fact that people are viewing pornography at a younger age, the long-term results will only lead towards a broader spectrum of acceptable deviance — even within the Church. 4. Greater Risk of Sexual Dysfunction Ironically enough, the more you sexualize yourself the more likely you are to be unable to be sexual. Among the 27-31 year olds surveyed, 19 percent suffer from premature ejaculation, 25 percent are disinterested in sex with their partner, 31 percent have difficulty reaching orgasm, and 34 percent experience erectile dysfunction. These are young men with these problems! Of these men surveyed, 60% felt sexual function improved after committing to no pornography. 5. Less Energy Levels and Productivity 67% felt an energy increase and felt more productive after they stopped using pornography.

Although the article focuses on the non-religious reasons that pornography should be avoided, it does touch on the issues of pornography and Christian views, saying:

But We’re Christians I think it is easy for Christians to neatly place everything into a spiritual box and ignore the effects of the physical world. Sin leads to death, so the effects of sin will always have its deadly effects on those that indulge in it — no matter what that sin is. To learn about these natural negative effects of pornography should be no real surprise to believers, because Christians know that viewing pornography is sinful. However, I think that it is particularly powerful when a non-religious group, like this Reddit group, is taking such a pro-active stand against pornography, solely on its natural effects. This only amplifies the need for us to eradicate pornography from our life and the Church.

The criticisms of pornography do not stop with the effects the individual pornography user and those closest to them will face. An up and coming website StopTraffickingDemand.com, which focuses on negative consequences occurring in our society – specifically, Pornography & Sex Trafficking. As the site states:

The booming demand for trafficked women and children in recent years is due in part to the proliferation of pornography. The purpose of this site is to bring together research and personal accounts to help the public understand one of the major factors creating and driving the demand for trafficked women and children. Government officials, leaders, celebrities and the general public are calling for increased efforts to stop sex trafficking. However, it must be recognized that unless something is done to curb the demand, we will never solve the problem of this exploitation. Instead, the problem will continue to overwhelm our society. The different types of sexual exploitation are seamlessly intertwined. Pornography, sexually oriented businesses, strip clubs, prostitution and sex trafficking are all incontestably linked. It is time we stop ignoring the continuum of exploitation in order to start solving the problem.

The outcry against pornography is nothing new, but it is becoming louder with a grow generations of users, increased ease of use and access, undeniable research, and new data come to light every day. Morality In Media (MIM), a non-profit organization was founded in 1962 and is the leading national organization opposing pornography and indecency through public education and the application of the law. According to their site PornHarms.com, MIM currently “directs the War on Illegal Pornography Coalition, an effort with Congress to pressure the U.S. Department of Justice to enforce existing federal obscenity laws. MIM also maintains a research website about the harms of pornography and regularly directs national awareness campaigns to help the public understand the consequences of pornography and find resources to aid in their struggles.”

The question remains, will pornography users accept the research and proven data and give up their pleasure for the many benefits of a life free from pornography or has the need for self and instant gratification become so great that this heinous problem will continue to grow?

"https://madworldnews.com/the-truth-behind-paul-harveys-if-i-were-the-devil/","The Truth Behind Paul Harvey’s ‘If I Were The Devil’","Paul Harvey’s ‘If I Were The Devil’ has been heard by millions. One of my favorite essays, I now hear it often in my own mind as I am out and about observing our world. Harvey’s words have an undeniable truth; although, they may not be as prophetic as some would like to believe.

Paul Harvey, a conservative American radio broadcaster for the ABC Radio Networks, originally wrote ‘If I Were The Devil’ in 1964. A broadcast of the essay aired in 1965, but it is still popular today. However, the current rendition that circulates the internet was updated by Harvey to reflect current events throughout his life, which sadly ended in 2009.

The oldest genuine Paul Harvey version of this piece we’ve found thus far appeared in his newspaper column in 1964:

If I Were the Devil If I were the Prince of Darkness I would want to engulf the whole earth in darkness. I’d have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I would not be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree. So I should set about however necessary, to take over the United States. I would begin with a campaign of whispers. With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whispers to you as I whispered to Eve, “Do as you please.” To the young I would whisper “The Bible is a myth.” I would convince them that “man created God,” instead of the other way around. I would confide that “what is bad is good and what is good is square.” In the ears of the young married I would whisper that work is debasing, that cocktail parties are good for you. I would caution them not to be “extreme” in religion, in patriotism, in moral conduct. And the old I would teach to pray — to say after me — “Our father which are in Washington.” Then I’d get organized. I’d educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull, uninteresting. I’d threaten TV with dirtier movies, and vice-versa. I’d infiltrate unions and urge more loafing, less work. Idle hands usually work for me. I’d peddle narcotics to whom I could, I’d sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction, I’d tranquilize the rest with pills. If I were the Devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect to discipline emotions; let those run wild. I’d designate an atheist to front for me before the highest courts and I’d get preachers to say, “She’s right.” With flattery and promises of power I would get the courts to vote against God and in favor of pornography. Thus I would evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, then from the Houses of Congress. Then in his own churches I’d substitute psychology for religion and deify science. If I were Satan I’d make the symbol of Easter an egg And the symbol of Christmas a bottle. If I were the Devil I’d take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious. Then my police state would force everybody back to work. Then I would separate families, putting children in uniform, women in coal mines and objectors in slave-labor camps. If I were Satan I’d just keep doing what I’m doing and the whole world go to hell as sure as the Devil.

Harvey’s 1996 newspaper version kept the concept and structure of the essay, but evolved the content to include the current events of that time:

If I were the prince of darkness, I would want to engulf the whole world in darkness. I’d have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I would not be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree — thee. So, I would set about however necessary to take over the United States. I’d subvert the churches first, and I would begin with a campaign of whispers. With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve: “Do as you please.” To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth. I would convince the children that man created God instead of the other way around. I’d confide that what’s bad is good and what’s good is square. And the old, I would teach to pray after me, “Our Father, which are in Washington …” Then, I’d get organized, I’d educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting. I’d peddle narcotics to whom I could. I’d sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction. I’d tranquilize the rest with pills. If I were the devil, I’d soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves and nations at war with themselves until each, in its turn, was consumed. And with promises of higher ratings, I’d have mesmerizing media fanning the flames. If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellect but neglect to discipline emotions. I’d tell teachers to let those students run wild. And before you knew it, you’d have drug-sniffing dogs and metal detectors at every schoolhouse door. With a decade, I’d have prisons overflowing and judges promoting pornography. Soon, I would evict God from the courthouse and the schoolhouse and them from the houses of Congress. In his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion and deify science. I’d lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money. If I were the devil, I’d take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious. What’ll you bet I couldn’t get whole states to promote gambling as the way to get rich? I’d convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun and that what you see on television is the way to be. And thus, I could undress you in public and lure you into bed with diseases for which there are no cures. In other words, if I were the devil, I’d just keep right on doing what he’s doing.

Paul Harvey’s ‘If I Were The Devil’ was not intended to be prophetic, which is the mistake made by most when hearing the 1996 version and mistakenly believing it was from the 1965 broadcast. As the last line indicates, “I’d just keep right on doing what he’s doing,” Harvey was reflecting on the current state of our society, not predicting things to come, hence the reason for the present tense.

Although not prophetic, Harvey’s words are not any less powerful. It is a warning to our nation that we should heed.

"https://madworldnews.com/atheist-churches-are-on-the-rise/","Atheist “Churches” Are On The Rise","Maybe it’s because I am a Christian, but I was nothing short of dumbfounded to read about the growing atheist church in Tennessee and the plans of the “godless congregation” (their words, not mine) to create many more atheist churches worldwide.

First, let’s review the definition of church, shall we? Straight from Merriam-Webster, a church is defined as “a building that is used for Christian religious services, religious services held in a church, a particular Christian group.” Follow that up with the definition of atheist – “a person who believes that God does not exist, one who believes that there is no deity” – and you see my conundrum. The title “atheist church” seems to be quite an oxymoron, doesn’t it?

The purpose of the atheist church seems to align with what is found in most Christian churches with the exception of one thing. You guessed it, God. With no mention of God or religion, the congregation assembles on Sunday mornings for fellowship and a “celebration of life.” Like most Christian churches, the atheist church provides child care. According to its Facebook page, volunteers from the Nashville branch feed the homeless population. As you can see, the atheist church has similarities to the Christian church, with the obvious exception of the ultimate purpose.

With so many similarities to the traditional Christian church, I had to wonder, why? If an atheist believes in nothing, why copy one of the defining characteristics of Christianity – the church? Don’t get me wrong, fellowship, celebration, and charity are all great things, but it would seem the atheists are trying to fill a void created by their lack of religion. As Jerry Newcombe, a key archivist of the D. James Kennedy Legacy Library and a Christian TV producer, said in a column for The Christian Post, “The idea of atheists going to church brings home to me the notion that we are all hard-wired by the Creator to worship. The whole idea of organized atheism (especially the militant, full-time kind) seems contradictory: Because they spend all their energies fighting against God, whom they claim does not exist. If they really believed it, they wouldn’t care.”

According to The Christian Post, the Nashville, Tennessee congregation is increasing its Sunday service from one to two services due to the response they have received, causing the monthly service to be full and overcrowded. To celebrate the progress, services will be led by the co-founder of the London-based Sunday Assembly, Sanderson Jones, and an agnostic documentary filmmaker, Morgan Spurlock. Jones, a stand-up comedian, founded the U.K.’s Sunday Assembly, a godless church, along with his colleague Pippa Evans about a year ago. The group launched the East Nashville branch last November. Branches were also started in San Diego, New York and other U.S. cities.

What do Sunday services at the atheist church entail? “Each Assembly is about an hour of great sing-along songs, an address by someone also trying to figure out this world like you and me, some poetry and other ways to celebrate this one life together that we know we have,” the website says.

“I’m a recent transplant from South Florida, and the community here is based around church and religion. For me, with a young daughter, there wasn’t anything that provides a support system,” said organizer Kris Tyrrell of Hendersonville, Tenn. “Sunday Assembly is pretty new here, but we have ideas about who we want to be and where we want to go.”

The U.K.’s “godless congregation,” as they describe themselves, doesn’t plan to stop spreading their beliefs or lack thereof. The group said they plan to plant 40 atheist churches in a year, and as many as 1,000 worldwide within a decade. The two British comedian founders are making an effort to expand as a non-religious “megachurch.”

“We are born from nothing and go to nothing. Let’s enjoy it together,” says the Public Charter of the Assembly, which has “no doctrine… no set texts so we can make use of wisdom from all sources… no deity.” And I guess that would mean, rules, expectations, and values can change as needed with no compass or solid foundation to guide their teachings. Like their beliefs, it would seem their church is also based and built on nothing.

“We don’t do supernatural but we also won’t tell you you’re wrong if you do,” it adds. “Sometimes bad things happen to good people, we have moments of weakness or life just isn’t fair. We want The Sunday Assembly to be a house of love and compassion, where, no matter what your situation, you are welcomed, accepted and loved.” I can see the appeal – “do whatever you want and we will love you anyway.” It’s quite unfortunate that guidance, direction, and advice are seen as a lack of acceptance and love. For example, my brothers and sisters in Christ do show love and compassion, no matter my situation, and I am accepted and loved; however, because they love me, they also hold me accountable for my actions and teach me to live according to the Word. When did trying to teach what is best become a lack of love? I’d ask if scolding and correcting your children means you don’t love them, but after seeing some behaviors at my local Wal-Mart recently, I’m afraid of the answer I’d get.

Although the atheist church may seem “harmless,” this watered down, cheap imitation for Christianity may fill an atheist’s void, but it won’t save any souls. As a Christian with a true compassion for the salvation of others and the desire to share the gospel, I’m saddened and worried by this misguided growth. It causes me to wonder, how do we show care, love, and compassion to those that want nothing to do with any type of obedience to a higher power? While the phrase “Come as you are” is not found directly in scripture, the Bible does have a variety of verses that imply the same message, based on God’s amazing grace. However, we are called to ask forgiveness and repent for our sins – change our behavior. How do you appeal to those that want the benefits of congregation without any expectation of obedience or change in their own behavior? More importantly, how do we keep from losing more souls to these faithless teachings as their influence and presence becomes more pronounced in our society?","2014-02-12 17:16:19","0","32.0","27.0","4.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","78.0","28.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","12.0","0","1075","75.40","78.55","16.53","88.68","21.50","23.07","87.63","50.79","12.56","7.91","2.33","2.05","1.58","0.09","1.86","4.65","8.56","13.67","7.63","2.88","7.35","2.70","15.26","4.47","2.88","1.67","1.02","2.33","5.67","4.65","0.93","0.19","0.19","0.09","12.28","0.28","0.09","0.19","0.19","14.51","3.16","3.26","2.05","3.53","1.49","2.98","1.40","0.65","0.65","0.09","1.40","0.00","0.37","0.00","0.09","13.12","7.63","2.05","2.42","0.84","0.84","2.42","11.44","1.21","8.84","1.77","3.91","3.07","1.95","1.12","0.28","0.37","5.40","0.00","0.47","0.00","0.37","0.19","0.00","0.09","20.28","4.56","7.91","0.09","0.09","0.84","0.00","0.84","3.35","2.23","0.37","0.00","4954","7.87","27.45","1526","1066","52","67.59","11.5","8.9","11.02","11.8","217","13.5","18.342589118198873","477","24.27","19","0.5","0","45","10","117","0","121","77","3","2","12","175","83","0","49","0","0","73","22","31","3","1","5","39","0","60","21","19","23","49","33","7","8","0","8"
"https://madworldnews.com/is-your-facebook-use-funding-abortions/","Is Your Facebook Use Funding Abortions?","A recent disclosure of a donation made by Facebook co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife, pediatrician Priscilla Chan has the right cringing and the left celebrating, as they hope the information will make “right-wing Christians”stop using Facebook according to a comment on Liberals Unite.

Sources on both the right and the left of the issue report that Zuckerberg and wife have donated 18 million shares of Facebook valued at $992 million to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF) in Mountain View, California in 2013, in addition to the 19 million Facebook shares donated by the couple to the same foundation in 2012.

According to its mission, vision, and values, “Silicon Valley Community Foundation advances innovative philanthropic solutions to challenging problems, engaging donors to make our region and world a better place for all.” A visit to the SVCF website and you can see it describes itself as a “comprehensive center of philanthropy” that partners “with donors to strengthen the common good locally and throughout the world.” The collaboration and partnership raising concern is that with Planned Parenthood.

SVCF’s 2012 Public Disclosure, available for online viewing, reports that they donated over $480,000 to Planned Parenthood in 2012 alone. The donations benefited Planned Parenthood’s in multiple cities, including San Antonio, TX; New York, NY; San Jose, CA; Jacksonville, FL; and Burlington, VT. Donations ranged in amount from $5,000 to $361,750. These annual donations to Planned Parenthood, earmarked under broad terms such as “health,” “supporting families,” and “building community,” have almost doubled from 2011, when the SVCF report shows that SVCF gave close to $250,000.

Life News supports Zuckerberg’s right to donate his money as he wishes and praises his donations to charity, but hopes the money does not end up funding abortions. In their report, they also urge SVCF to cease collaboration with Planned Parenthood:

Although Zuckerberg hasn’t publicly commented on the programs their gift will support, he did saytheir philanthropy would focus on children. Zuckerberg and his wife have every right to spend their money as they see fit. I’m grateful that they are donating to assist children in need. I only hope none of their funds will end up in the big pockets of Planned Parenthood. As for Silicon Valley Community Foundation, they should cut ties with the taxpayer-funded abortion giant and funnel donations into the hundreds of Pregnancy Resource Centers, Crisis Pregnancy centers and homes for mothers. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation currently has assets of $2.9 billion, more than 1,600 philanthropic funds under management and over 60 local nonprofit partners. One can only dream of the impact those resources could have if directed into pro-life, pro-family, pro-women organizations. Perhaps someone should write Zuckerberg a letter.

Liberals Unite chastised Life News and its supporters, referring to them as the “anti-choice” crowd. Apparently, the only choice supported by the left is the choice to murder unborn children, not choose how and where funds are spent. The question on both sides remains, will those opposed to abortion boycott Facebook? As for Mad World News, we will continue to use social media to inform and educate, but will not pay any funds to Facebook in the form of advertising and promoting, as we do not care to fund programs such as Planned Parenthood.

It is our hope that our readers will share this article to inform those that do put money in Facebook’s pocket, so informed decisions and choices can be made about what your money is used to support. See, we’re not “anti-choice,” we’re anti-abortion.","2014-02-13 13:27:09","0","30.0","27.0","4.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","86.0","26.0","0.0","132.0","0.0","12.0","0","599","90.26","87.53","12.25","82.54","24.96","27.71","79.97","41.90","8.01","4.67","0.33","1.17","0.33","1.00","1.84","3.34","6.01","15.19","5.51","2.34","6.51","1.17","11.52","3.51","2.50","0.67","4.51","1.84","4.84","4.01","0.83","0.00","0.33","0.17","13.36","2.50","0.50","0.83","1.00","9.18","2.84","1.67","2.00","1.84","0.33","1.84","1.00","1.00","0.00","0.00","1.84","0.00","1.84","1.00","0.00","13.36","7.85","2.50","2.17","0.67","0.83","2.50","8.18","1.84","12.02","0.50","9.68","1.67","3.84","1.67","0.50","4.51","0.17","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.70","3.84","7.68","0.17","0.67","0.17","0.00","1.50","3.01","1.34","0.33","1.00","2998","9.1","27.636363636363637","907","584","25","47.72","13.8","12.4","14.1","15.5","159","25.25","22.25041095890411","324","24.27","15","0.42","0","23","26","45","0","70","32","2","0","14","87","82","3","45","1","0","19","14","16","0","0","2","27","0","33","8","12","15","15","12","1","1","0","3"

Ronald Miller: Suddenly took ill on October 3rd,1997 and steadily worsened until his death 9 days later. (This pattern fits Ricin poisoning.) Owing to the strangeness of the illness, doctors at the Integris Baptist Medical Center referred the matter to the Oklahoma State Medical Examiner’s Office. The Oklahoma State Medical Examiner’s Office promptly ran tests on samples of Ron Miller’s blood, but has refused to release the results or even to confirm that the tests were ever completed.

Had been investigated by authorities over the sale of his company, Gage Corp. to Dynamic Energy Resources, Inc. was the man who tape recorded Gene and Nora Lum and turned those tapes (and other records) over to congressional oversight investigators. The Lums were sentenced to prison for campaign finance violations, using “straw donors” to conceal the size of their contributions to various candidates.

Sandy Hume: On Sunday, February 22nd, 1998, Sandy Hume, the 28 year old son of journalist Britt Hume, was reportedly found dead in his Arlington, Virginia home. Aside from the statement that this was an “apparent” suicide, there remains in place a total media blackout on this story, possibly out of concern that the actual facts will not withstand public scrutiny. Worked for Hill magazine, about Congress for Congress.

Jim McDougal: Bill and Hillary Clinton friend, banker, and political ally, sent to prison for eighteen felony convictions. A key whitewater witness, dies of a heart attack on March, 8 1998. As of this writing allegations that he was given an injection of the diuretic lasix has not been denied or confirmed.

Died on March 8, 1998

Johnny Lawhon: 29, died March 29, 1998- The Arkansas transmission specialist who discovered a pile of Whitewater documents in the trunk of an abandoned car on his property and turned them over to Starr, was killed in a car wreck two weeks after the McDougal death.. Details of the “accident” have been sketchy — even from the local Little Rock newspaper.

Charles Wilbourne Miller: 63, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head on November 17, 1998 in a shallow pit about 300 yards from his ranch house near Little Rock. Police found a .410 gauge shotgun near Miller’s body and a Ruger .357-caliber revolver submerged in water. Investigators concluded the Ruger was the weapon used by Miller to kill himself. Yet, two rounds in the handgun’s cylinder had been spent.

He had long served as executive vice president and member of the board of directors for a company called Alltel and was deeply involved in his own software engineering company until the day he died. Alltel is the successor to Jackson Stephens’ Systematics, the company that provided the software for the White House’s “Big Brother” data base system and that was behind the administration’s plan to develop the secret computer “Clipper” chip to bug every phone, fax and email transmission in America.

Carlos Ghigliotti: 42, was found dead in his home just outside of Washington D.C. on April 28, 2000. There was no sign of a break-in or struggle at the firm of Infrared Technology where the badly decomposed body of Ghigliotti was found. Ghigliotti had not been seen for several weeks, commercial cleaning companies may have been contacted in order for the offices to be cleaned.

Ghigliotti, a thermal imaging analyst hired by the House Government Reform Committee to review tape of the siege, said he determined the FBI fired shots on April 19, 1993. The FBI has explained the light bursts on infrared footage as reflections of sun rays on shards of glass or other debris that littered the scene.

“I conclude this based on the groundview videotapes taken from several different angles simultaneously and based on the overhead thermal tape,” Ghigliotti told The Washington Post last October. “The gunfire from the ground is there, without a doubt.”

Ghigliotti said the tapes also confirm the Davidians fired repeatedly at FBI agents during the assault, which ended when flames raced through the compound. About 80 Branch Davidians perished that day, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds.

Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the congressional committee chaired by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said that police found the business cards of a committee investigator in Ghigliotti’s office. Corallo said Ghigliotti’s work for the committee ended some time ago.

Tony Moser: 41, was killed as he crossed a street in Pine Bluff, Ark on on June 10, 2000. Killed 10 days after being named a columnist for the Democrat-Gazette newspaper and two days after penning a stinging indictment of political corruption in Little Rock.

Police have concluded that no charges will be filed against the unnamed driver of a 1995 Chevrolet pickup, which hit Moser as he was walking alone in the middle of unlit Rhinehart Road about 10:10 p.m

Police say they have ruled out foul play and will file no charges against the driver because he was not intoxicated and there was no sign of excessive speed.

"https://madworldnews.com/living-wage-is-the-wage-the-problem/","“Living Wage” – Is The Wage The Problem?","I’ve heard a lot of talk about a “Living Wage” recently as an argument promoting the increase in minimum wage. Supporters of a minimum wage increase cry out, “Everyone deserves a living wage!” My question is, is the wage the problem or the definition of “living” the problem?

I’ve been poor. Dirt poor. We supported a family of 3 on a single income of $6 per hour without government assistance or bailouts from family. We lived in a 46×10 foot trailer. We ate cereal and Ramen noodles on a daily basis because they were cheap. Our other food consisted of items I could find at a local “bent & dent.” We did not have internet, cable, or cell phones. We had one car. We did not have central air, a dish washer, or a big screen tv.

Hunger was our motivation. I went to school to earn my nursing degree. Now, I’m told that everyone deserves to have the same standard of living I do without the sacrifice or the work that I went through to get here. You’ll have to forgive me if I don’t agree.

Simple math, economics, and history all prove that an increase in minimum wage only increases the cost of living. It’s called a budget. Businesses must maintain a budget. When the cost of labor increases, the cost of goods increase. When sharing my experience, I often hear, “But you paid less for a gallon of milk and a gallon of gas back then.” That’s correct and only proves that an increase in minimum wage does not improve the quality of life for those attempting to make a career of these entry level positions. I’ve seen minimum wage almost double in my work years. Those on minimum wage are no better off now than they were then. Why? Because as the supporters of minimum wage increase point out, things cost more now than they did then. Hmmm, coincidence? No. Cause and effect.

My favorite argument is that you need to look at the “average” cost of rent, groceries, and utilities. Those on minimum wage can’t afford the average. Do you know how to obtain an average? You take all the values from the minimum to the maximum and add them together, then divide by the count of those numbers you just added. So, why would a person making the minimum in this equation suddenly think they deserve the average living? Refer to my story above. The average two bedroom home at the time cost $400 – $600 per month in our area. Did we have the average home? No. We had the minimum, a trailer that wasn’t much more than a shack and cost $200 per month. You see how that works? Minimum wage meant minimum living, not average.

The problem we have here isn’t wage. It’s the definition of living. Too many include luxuries in that definition. How many minimum wage earners have smart phones, computers, internet, cable, big screen televisions, manicured nails, expensive salon hairstyles, new name brand clothes, gaming consoles, and the latest electronics? I lived without those things on a meager wage with a family. Was it easy? No. Since when is life guaranteed to be easy? A little struggle and sacrifice gave me things that can’t be bought – determination, character, and appreciation.

Pardon the old cliche, but life isn’t fair. If it were fair, I wouldn’t be working while able-bodied individuals receive handouts paid for by the working class and the top earners that they vehemently hate. Yes, the top earners that have ignorance spewed against them from those dependent on social programs are the very ones that are paying for those programs, but I digress.

Here is the simple, hard truth, even if the minimum wage is raised, those receiving it are and will remain on the bottom. No law or regulation will change that, but a new mindset will. Stop demanding “solutions” that do not solve the problem at hand and start prioritizing, budgeting, working, sacrificing, learning, and most importantly, accomplishing.","2014-01-03 18:02:30","0","29.0","26.0","4.0","0.0","18.0","0.0","73.0","26.0","0.0","130.0","0.0","12.0","0","673","69.09","49.41","48.68","47.77","12.02","20.21","86.92","50.67","12.33","6.98","3.12","1.78","1.04","0.00","1.04","5.35","9.51","11.00","8.32","3.86","6.54","2.97","14.86","5.94","2.38","1.19","1.63","3.12","4.46","2.82","1.63","0.15","0.45","0.15","7.73","0.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.33","2.82","2.53","1.78","2.08","1.49","4.61","1.78","0.74","0.59","0.30","3.57","0.59","1.93","0.00","1.04","8.77","2.67","2.82","2.23","1.19","0.74","4.31","8.92","1.19","12.04","2.08","5.79","4.61","6.39","0.89","1.04","5.65","0.45","0.00","0.45","0.00","0.15","0.30","0.15","0.00","20.21","6.69","6.69","0.00","0.00","1.49","0.15","0.15","2.08","2.23","0.00","0.74","2992","7.22","12.981132075471699","969","673","50","74.69","10.5","6.2","9.21","7.3","124","4.625","14.769985141158992","349","12.0","14","0.5","0","25","9","78","0","77","49","4","2","8","141","22","0","36","2","0","43","7","33","0","0","1","11","1","26","21","18","10","34","18","5","0","0","7"
"https://madworldnews.com/marriage-rate-decline-economy/","Shocking Study: Cause of Marriage Rate Decline, Threatens Economy & Society","A new study is sure to stir up controversy as it points to a possible cause for a decline in the rate of marriage and possible economic and social decline as a result.

The marriage rate is on the decline, and according to a recent article on the Washington Examiner, pornography may be to blame.

A report published by Germany’s Institute for the Study of Labor and co-authored by a West Chester University of Pennsylvania professor showed pornography as a cause of decline in the rate of marriage and “suggested the government crack down on porn access, especially as more and easier tools to tap into the Internet, such as smartphones, expand. Saving marriage, said the report, will help the economy and society,” according to the Washington Examiner, which further explained:

Pornography is replacing the desire among young men for marriage, according to a new study that finds males are chasing “low-cost sexual gratification” on the web over a wife and family. “Traditionally, one of the reasons to enter into a marriage was sexual gratification. But as options for sexual gratification outside of marriage have grown, the need for a marriage to serve this function is diminishing,” said the report.

The Washington Examiner goes on to detail how the study findings were determined, explaining that researchers analyzed data from 1,512 surveys completed by American men aged 18-35 between 2000-2004. The results were astounding.

“Since changes in the accessibility of pornography have occurred coincident to large changes in marital behavior, the causal relationship between the two is a natural question. Between 2000 and 2004, the General Social Survey (GSS) asked a series of detailed questions about Internet usage; it also records comprehensive demographic information, including marital status. Using these microdata we find that for young men there is a large degree of substitutability between Internet and pornography usage and marriage – heavy Internet usage generally, and use of pornography specifically, are associated with lower participation in marriages. We employ instrumental variables and a number of robustness checks, all of which suggest that this is a causal effect and not merely the endogenous relationship that married men are less likely to look at pornography, or some kind of unobserved selection issue that distinguishes men who use pornography from men who do not use pornography.”

The study titled “Are Pornography and Marriage Substitutes for Young Men?” found that porn use makes marriage unappealing. With marriage being found unappealing, rates of marriage decline with a detrimental impact on both the economy and society. The researchers explained, “stable marriages create substantial welfare improvements for society, especially to the degree that marital stability produces high-quality children.”

While some will want to argue whether porn is the causative agent to the destruction of the traditional family, vast research has shown that homes without a father are detrimental, both to the children and financially. Therefore, it is important to consider possible causative factors, such as the one suggested by this study.

According to the researchers, porn use can be credited with cutting the marriage rate, citing statistics that show men 25-34 are six times less likely to be married than the same age group was in 1970. Getting married isn’t the only problem, as the researchers also found divorce rates are twice what they were in 1950. Unarguably, pornography has become more readily available today than it was in those times, as the report indicates:

“Given the rapid decline in marital formation and stability in western countries, a natural question is how quickly this trend will proliferate in developing countries as their standards of living rise. Nowadays, widely available Internet access almost always accompanies rising living standards. Thus, the results in this paper suggest that technological proliferation and access to pornography specifically can be a causative factor that underlies these rapid demographic changes that occur concurrent to economic growth.”

Because the data is already over 10 years old, as the surveys were completed from 2000-2004, and leaps and bounds have been seen in technology in those years, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg in this problem.

With pornography becoming increasingly socially acceptable and adamantly defended by its users, many will quickly jump to disregard the findings of the report. However, such devastating implications, such as the loss of family and what that would indicate for our society as a whole, should always be thoroughly explored and considered. The report can be viewed in its entirety by clicking here for those wishing to make an informed opinion on the findings.

As the study concludes, “Researchers often talk about how rapidly social change is disrupting what were once traditional family arrangements. But this really is an unsatisfying explanation since it begs us to understand the fundamentals that underlie these rapid social changes in the first place. There is no question that technological change is at the root of many of these social dynamics.”

Do you agree that technological advances could be causing irreparable damage to the family unit as our society once knew it? With the declining rates of marriage formation and deteriorating stability of marriages that do form, bringing with them a multiplicity of demographic and socio-economic changes, is it time we explore which of society’s guilty pleasures may be contributing to the decay of the American family?","2014-12-26 16:42:31","0","40.0","29.0","4.0","1.0","20.0","0.0","77.0","26.0","0.0","132.0","0.0","12.0","0","890","93.87","80.96","20.55","27.64","27.81","30.67","82.81","45.96","6.74","1.24","0.00","0.79","0.11","0.00","0.34","5.51","9.33","15.62","7.42","3.15","5.96","0.56","12.13","4.83","2.92","1.35","2.58","1.69","3.03","1.57","1.46","0.11","0.34","0.45","9.89","3.37","0.00","0.11","1.12","14.16","4.04","4.61","1.01","2.47","1.35","1.46","1.01","0.56","0.34","0.11","2.58","0.11","0.22","2.25","0.00","9.21","5.51","0.67","2.13","0.79","0.45","3.03","7.42","0.90","11.57","3.03","5.73","3.15","4.49","0.67","0.79","1.01","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.00","0.00","12.47","3.26","5.28","0.22","0.11","0.34","0.00","0.90","1.80","0.34","0.22","0.00","4629","8.89","33.111111111111114","1463","883","32","35.0","16.2","15.2","14.34","17.8","217","16.5","22.87012457531144","410","28.93","3","0.44","0","30","19","102","0","123","83","3","0","13","155","38","0","63","0","1","15","5","32","3","0","2","26","0","31","21","29","23","27","29","11","5","0","3"
"https://madworldnews.com/marine-corps-obama-isis-strategy/","Former Head of Marine Corps: Obama’s ISIS Strategy Doesn’t Have ‘A Snowball’s Chance in Hell’","A former head of the Marine Corps had a blatant dose of reality for Obama and his ISIS strategy. According to those in attendance at the Maverick PAC Conference in Washington, D.C. Friday, retired Marine General James Conway, who served as the 34th Commandant of the Marine Corps during the end of the Bush administration and the beginning of the Obama administration, said, “I don’t think the president’s plan has a snowball’s chance in hell of succeeding.”

While this is a sentiment that most of us share, coming from a military commander with a résumé like the retired four-star General’s speaks volumes. As the top Marine general from 2006 until his retirement in 2010, hearing General Conway say President Barack Obama’s strategy to defeat the terrorist group the Islamic State is doomed to fail, should tell us something.

Not only was General Conway the top Marine general during the last years of his service, the Commandant of the Marine Corps also serves as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. During the 2003 Iraq War, Conway led the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force.

Sources say that the primary concern expressed by General Conway was that “the U.S. did not have a force on the ground in Syria it could rely on, like the Kurdish Peshmerga in Iraq. Though the Obama administration believes it can support what it says are moderate rebel forces in Syria to aid in the fight against ISIS, many critics warn that there may be no truly moderate force in the country of any significant strength.”

Obama’s strategy is no stranger to coming under fire. General Conway’s concerns are not the only reasons for the criticisms. In addition to the issue Conway addressed in his statement, Obama has also been recently criticized for preemptively taking off the table the possibility of using American combat troops to achieve the mission.

As reported by The Daily Caller:

“You just don’t take anything off the table up front, which it appears the administration has tried to do,” retired Gen. James Mattis, who served as head of Central Command from 2010 until his retirement in 2013, told the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. “Specifically, if this threat to our nation is determined to be as significant as I believe it is, we may not wish to reassure our enemies in advance that they will not see American ‘boots on the ground,’” he added. “If a brigade of our paratroopers or a battalion landing team of our Marines would strengthen our allies at a key juncture and create havoc/humiliation for our adversaries, then we should do what is necessary with our forces that exist for that very purpose.”

This is not the first time General Conway has criticized the White House. According to IJReview, in June, Conway blasted the exchange of five terrorism suspects being held at Guantanamo Bay for the suspected deserter and Taliban captive Bowe Bergdahl.

Coming under attack by American military leaders should be commonplace to Obama by now.

When Obama revealed to the world that “he didn’t have a strategy yet,” U.S. Army General Jack Keane said it was “an extraordinary and stunning admission coming from the leader of the world’s most powerful nation.” Former acting CIA Director Michael Morell bluntly told CBS that defeating ISIS leadership would come either by “capturing or killing them.” ~IJReview

With leading military and intelligence figures readily coming out against Obama’s ISIS tactics and the news that at least 40 Americans who fought for ISIS have returned to the U.S. with more Americans still being held hostage by the Islamic State, maybe it is time for President Obama to heed the advice of these leaders who actually have some military experience and have shaped United States foreign policy in the past. I’m sure if they needed some community organizing, Obama would come in handy. As for military strategy, let’s turn to those such as General Conway, who know a little about what they are talking about.

"https://madworldnews.com/read-else-hobby-lobby-forces-employees/","Read What Else Hobby Lobby Forces On Employees","Everyone is familiar with the current Supreme Court case involving the craft store giant, but there are many things about Hobby Lobby that are not being covered by the mainstream media. For example, did you know Hobby Lobby sets its own minimum wage, which currently exceeds the national by 93%? The facts covered here will shock you.

With the company being regularly vilified in the news due to their religious views and current conflict with the Affordable Care Act mandate for birth control, it’s time to set the record straight and give this company some of the positive publicity it deserves. In the brief article to follow are some details about Hobby Lobby and its founders that you probably haven’t heard on the news.

First, while the media continuously states Hobby Lobby does not want to offer birth control through its insurance plan, this is completely inaccurate. As previously reported, the company already covers 16 of the mandated 20 drugs under Obamacare. The controversy started when Hobby Lobby owners claimed it would be a “violation of conscience” to provide the remaining 4 drugs that cause “end of life” rather than standard contraception. Hobby Lobby doesn’t object to covering all contraception, only the emergency contraceptive pills Plan B and Ella and intrauterine devices (IUDs), which they believe are abortifacients. These abortifacient drugs are not what would typically come to mind when most people hear the words “birth control.”

What’s most amusing about the case and protests are that those most up in arms about Hobby Lobby contesting the mandate are not their employees. Hobby Lobby was founded by David Green on August 3, 1972, and as of August 2012 the chain has 561 stores nationwide. The Green’s founded and grew the company on Christian principles, which have been long standing. These principles were not an issue until the Obamacare mandate. This is not a movement of protest by the employees, as evidenced by the video at the end of this article. As a matter of fact, at this time the company has 4 out of 5 stars for employee satisfaction on indeed.com.

While reading the reviews on indeed.com, you will find that some of the benefits of employment at Hobby Lobby cited by their employees are those that are in place due to the Green’s Christian principles, such as Sunday’s off. The Green family are unarguably devout Christians who run the company based on biblical principles. Besides closing their stores on Sundays, other principles include starting staff meetings with Bible readings, paying above minimum wage, and using a Christian-based mediation practice to resolve employee disputes. With these practices and policies in place and long standing, the Christian-based values that the company was founded on and continues to run on are no secret to the employees, who choose to work there.

Let’s touch on the pay Hobby Lobby offers. While the news has been inundated with Hobby Lobby’s issue with the “birth control” mandate, why wasn’t their recent hike in wages equally reported? I think it would surprise most to know that in 2013, Hobby Lobby raised their minimum wage for full-time employees to $14. According to Charisma News in 2013:

Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc …. announced … a minimum-wage increase to $14 per hour for full-time hourly employees … The company also announced a minimum wage increase for all part-time employees to $9.50 per hour. This is the fifth year in a row that the company has raised wages for full-time hourly employees, who earned a minimum of $13 per hour in 2012. It’s the fourth year in a row for the company to increase the minimum wage for its part-time hourly employees, up from a minimum of $9 in 2012. This increase for full-time hourly and part-time hourly employees will raise the pay of more than 17,726 employees nationwide. Hobby Lobby’s new minimum wage for full-time hourly employees is 93 percent above the national minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In 2013, Hobby Lobby projects continued growth and plans to open 33 additional stores, which will create an additional 1,200 jobs across the country.

It’s safe to say that Hobby Lobby employees, who made 93% above the minimum wage paid at similar jobs would be able to afford to pay for the abortifacient drugs with the generous pay they receive should that need and desire arise for an individual. Arguably, Hobby Lobby gives their employees 93% more choices by providing them with stellar pay that they can spend as they choose.

Another interesting fact about the Greens is that they are even attempting to build a Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC. The Green Collection, assembled by the Green family, is the world’s largest private collection of rare biblical texts and artifacts. It is a compilation of more than 40,000 biblical antiquities currently featured via the worldwide traveling exhibition Passages and will eventually form the core of a permanent, national, non-sectarian Bible museum in Washington, D.C. This is just more evidence of the Green’s generosity and passion for the Word of God. Instead of keeping the private collection to themselves, they are making attempts to share it with the world.

The video below is evidence of the unfair propaganda that is being spread by the left. It’s time to set the record straight and share these facts that the left don’t want you to know. Give Hobby Lobby the publicity it deserves by making its contributions to its employees and community known through sharing this article.

While those in the video would have you believe corporations are not people (persons), under US Code they are:

The law continues to be exposed for the detrimental act it is, as more and more financial blows come down the line. With elections to come, 2014 may prove to be an interesting year for Democrats as the labor union Unite Here claims that Obamacare will lower their members’ wages by up to $5 an hour. When on the campaign trail, Obama presented himself as an advocate for the working class, winning over the votes of the unions. With the effects of Obamacare coming to light, the Democrat party is quickly losing union support.

"https://madworldnews.com/iraq-considers-allowing-marriage-girls-young-8-wives-must-submit-husbands-sexual-demands/","Iraq Considers Marrying Girls As Young As 8, Wives Must Submit To Husband’s Sexual Demands","Under current law, the legal age for marriage in Iraq is 18, or 15 with a guardian’s approval, but that could all change very soon. As reported by Daily Mail, a new law being considered in Iraq could lead to men marrying girls as young as eight and wives having to submit to sex at their husband’s every request.

While the proposed measure, known as the Jaafari Personal Status Law, actually does not have a stipulated minimum age for marriage, rules regarding divorce for girls as young as eight are included. Could this mean that men could marry girls even younger than 8 if the law comes to pass? Or did the authors of the bill slip the age into the divorce section as a backhanded way to allow marriages of girls that young?

Marriage of minors in Iraq has been steadily increasing over the last couple decades. According to government statistics, nearly 25 percent of the marriages in Iraq in 2011, involved someone under the age of 18. Compare this to 21 percent in 2001 and 15 percent in 1997, and one can see a rising trend.

Underage marriage is not the only concern with this proposed bill, as it also strips women of many rights. With the father being the only parent with the right to accept or refuse the marriage proposal, mothers will have no voice to protect their daughters. Another disturbing proponent of the proposed measure withdraws a wife’s ability to decide if she wants to have sex with her husband. Under the proposed measure, a husband can have sex with his wife without her consent.

The violations of women’s rights under the proposed measure don’t stop there. The bill also prevents women from leaving the house without their husband’s permission, would restrict women’s rights to parental custody after divorce, and makes it easier for men to take multiple wives.

As one would and should expect, the controversial proposals have provoked outrage from activists both within Iraq and around the globe, who see it as a huge step backwards for women’s rights. According to Iraqi human rights activist Hana Adwar, ‘That law represents a crime against humanity and childhood. Married underage girls are subjected to physical and psychological suffering.’

Unfortunately, the outrage, controversy, and criticisms have yet to stop this bill from moving forward. The law, based on the principles of a Shiite school of religious law founded by Jaafar al-Sadiq, was introduced to the Cabinet as a draft measure by Iraq’s Justice Ministry. It was approved despite strong opposition by human rights campaigners. Parliament must still ratify the bill before it becomes law.

With reported stories of 8-year-old child brides dying from internal bleeding on their wedding night after their adult husbands have intercourse with them, how can anyone in their right mind support this bill?","2014-03-16 14:19:21","0","29.0","26.0","4.0","0.0","21.0","0.0","78.0","26.0","0.0","132.0","0.0","12.0","0","474","95.43","83.41","13.37","22.50","21.55","25.32","83.97","47.05","6.12","2.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.84","1.48","3.80","8.44","18.57","7.17","2.95","6.33","1.27","10.34","5.70","3.80","0.42","3.16","2.32","2.95","1.27","1.48","0.21","0.84","0.21","13.92","5.70","0.00","4.22","2.11","9.07","1.27","1.69","2.53","1.69","0.63","2.95","0.63","0.42","0.21","0.00","1.05","0.21","0.42","0.63","0.00","13.71","4.43","0.63","7.38","0.21","1.27","1.48","6.12","0.84","13.50","2.53","5.91","5.70","3.16","0.00","0.21","1.27","0.63","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.66","4.01","5.06","0.00","0.00","0.63","0.00","0.63","0.21","2.11","0.00","0.00","2266","8.18","23.0","688","471","22","58.21","11.6","10.5","11.55","12.7","104","12.375","19.39227176220807","262","21.29","0","0.43","0","12","15","51","0","74","31","2","0","11","90","27","0","39","0","0","8","8","16","0","0","0","17","0","23","3","14","17","6","16","0","1","0","1"
"https://madworldnews.com/watch-judge-jeanine-pirros-chilling-warning-coming-us/","[WATCH] Judge Jeanine Pirro’s Chilling Warning, “They Are Coming For Us.”","While I always find the words of Judge Jeanine Pirro remarkably on target, her recent warning should give chills to anyone not aligned with the Muslim faith.

With a finger pointed at the screen, Pirro proclaims, “I told you, that you need to be afraid because they are coming for you!” She goes on to state recent events, signalling the beginning of a ‘reverse crusade.’

It is time Americans acknowledge the most important words Pirro poignantly speaks, “They are coming for us. To them, we are the infidels.”

This leaves us in the need of a resolution, and Pirro recommends a controversial one – “Airstrikes. Bomb them, bomb them, keep bombing them, bomb them again and again.”

While this recommendation will cause many to cringe, Pirro’s reason for such a reaction is for the self preservation of Americans. Judge Jeanine is not willing to watch one more American die or come home with fewer limbs from that part of the world. As she explains, “Americans have shed enough blood there.” Is this the answer?

American blood shed may be inevitable. With a Muslim Imam calling for the targeting of U.S. schools, restaurants, coffee shops, airplanes, and ships if even a single American plane flies over Iraq in order to strike at ISIS, we are quickly entering into a very volatile situation that will continue to escalate.

One thing is for certain, if you are not familiar with what the ISIS is, it’s time to learn. Below is the short 5 minute video from Judge Jeanine Pirro that will give you a clue and open your eyes to America’s involvement in this slaughtering, not only of ‘infidels,’ but of moderate Muslims not extremist enough for ISIS.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzdJw9r4Zhk#t=78]

With ISIS measuring performance by the number of deaths, every single red-blooded American needs to hear this chilling warning. A 60% increase in radical Islamist terrorism is stark evidence that Obama’s words, reassuring us that all is well, are nothing but lies. Share the truth.

The radical extremists of ISIS are brutally murdering their way across northern Iraq. This is not a rag-tag group of rebels. As the Western Free Press states, this is ‘a well-armed, well-organized, modern-day blitzkrieg’ that ‘has openly declared its goal to be an Islamic state explicitly dedicated to attacks against the West.’

They are coming for us with weapons funded by our very own taxes. Will we be ready? With most Americans oblivious and unarmed with necessary information due to a lack of truthful reporting by our own president and mainstream media, our chances are not looking good.

Raise awareness, starting with your own by watching the video, listen to and absorb Judge Jeanine Pirro’s chilling warning, and then share it. The first step in this battle is to turn the lights on the situation.","2014-06-23 23:27:55","0","34.0","29.0","4.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","78.0","29.0","0.0","133.0","0.0","12.0","0","480","87.83","79.76","13.47","32.94","18.46","21.46","78.96","47.29","11.04","6.46","0.42","2.08","1.46","0.62","1.88","4.58","7.50","14.38","7.08","2.29","3.96","1.67","12.71","4.17","1.67","0.21","1.88","2.29","5.62","2.92","2.50","0.42","1.46","0.00","9.58","0.00","0.00","0.62","0.00","9.79","2.50","0.83","1.46","1.46","2.08","2.71","3.33","2.08","0.83","0.42","1.46","0.83","0.21","0.00","0.42","7.08","2.71","0.42","2.71","0.62","0.83","0.62","10.62","1.88","10.83","2.50","4.38","3.96","1.67","1.88","0.21","0.83","1.67","0.83","0.83","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.62","0.00","20.21","5.62","6.67","0.00","0.00","0.62","0.21","1.04","2.50","1.88","0.00","1.67","2188","7.54","23.8","655","466","27","70.84","11.1","7.7","11.08","10.5","90","7.5","16.64532188841202","266","22.1","10","0.48","1","11","5","47","0","60","41","3","1","6","63","41","4","25","1","0","27","8","25","0","1","0","16","0","19","5","16","9","16","21","3","1","0","0"

"https://madworldnews.com/hillary-clinton-compares-hobby-lobby-ruling-sharia-law/","Hillary Clinton Compares Hobby Lobby Ruling To Sharia Law","The ruling by the Supreme Court involving Hobby Lobby has been a great motivator for the ignorant to spew nonsense. While Mad World News already debunked a few liberal lies in our recent article, The Three Biggest Lies Liberals Are Screaming About The Hobby Lobby Ruling, the untruths keep rolling in.

With most, I am able to simply shake my head and move on, but one inaccuracy has me reeling. I shouldn’t be surprised that the most insulting misconception being slung about the ruling is from none other than the queen of false information – Hillary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton has reached an all new low, denouncing the Hobby Lobby ruling as Sharia law. While speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, Clinton said:

“Part of the reason I was so adamant about including women and girls in our foreign policy, not as a luxury but as a central issue, is because they’re often the canaries in the mine. You watch women and girls being deprived of their rights, some of them never have them, some of them lose them. Among those rights is control over their bodies, control over their own health care, control over the size of their families. It is a disturbing trend that you see in a lot of societies that are very unstable, anti-democratic, and frankly prone to extremism. Where women and women’s bodies are used as the defining and unifying issue to bring together people — men — to get them to behave in ways that are disadvantageous to women but which prop up them because of their religion, their sect, their tribe, whatever.”

Hmmm, is it just me or does that sound a lot like the Islamic extremists that Hillary and her fellow Dems seem to buddy up with all too often? I mean, just take one look at the words in bold and tell me what comes to your mind? Furthermore, correct me if I’m wrong, but if we are at risk of anyone bringing Sharia law to the United States, it will be Hillary and her party.

For those thinking, “She couldn’t have really said that,” don’t take my word for it. Here it is, straight from the horse’s mouth:

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9tnAB_r9As]

To add to the irony of Hillary’s comments, it was her own husband that signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993. But, we all know, Hillary wasn’t too knowledgeable about her husband’s affairs while he was in office. (Pun intended.)

While I could write a novel on all ways the Supreme Court ruling on the Hobby Lobby case is not even close to being comparable to Sharia law, one particular Facebook post caught my eye and summed it up extremely well. From our friends at Armed Mommy:

Whether you agree with the Supreme Court ruling or not, likening it to Sharia law is just plain ignorant, as evidenced by all the points in the embedded post above. (Make sure you click on “See More” in the post above for the full list.) When the left spreads such nonsense and blatantly inaccurate comparisons, it’s no wonder they can’t be taken seriously. There’s a reason the phrase “liberal logic” has caught on so quickly. Here’s a hint to any liberals that might be reading this: It’s not a compliment.

All of which are “stupid” when it comes to my health. Each of us have our own list if we are honest with ourselves. We have our reasons too, and no legislation would change it unless we wanted to and decided to change it.

Laws do not stop stupid and/or unhealthy behavior. If it did, prohibition would have worked, illegal drugs wouldn’t be an issue, and we wouldn’t need traffic cops. We would all live healthy, safe lives without a need for policing. In reality, we all break laws or rules and do things that may not be in our best interest to some degree.

The phrase “a patient’s right to refuse” has been heard and used many times in my career. This is freedom and a right. One example I personally experienced in the beginning of my career involved a patient during her last days as she died from lung cancer. As I sat with her, I asked if she had any last thoughts or wishes and she said, “If I knew I was going to die anyway, I probably would have kept smoking. I could really use a cigarette right now.” We discussed this for a bit, and I did my nursing duty to educate her and ensure she was making an informed decision. She wanted that last cigarette. So, being the young, rebel that I was at the time, I wheeled her bed out to the “smoker’s patio” at the facility and let her have the cigarette that she wanted. The point of this example is that patients have a right and freedom to make choices that would go against medical advice.

With the regulatory changes occurring with Obamacare and Medicare, the patient’s right to refuse is becoming a dilemma for healthcare facilities. With Medicare’s new paid for performance model, outcome measures determine reimbursement, meaning that the patient that is non-compliant and isn’t doing as instructed to improve their health are costing those that provide the healthcare services money.

Couple this with reimbursement being further decided by patient satisfaction, and you can see that we’ve created a double-edged sword for providers. To receive full reimbursement, you must show improvement in the patient’s health status without upsetting the patient and causing them to give you bad reviews. This is significantly difficult when you are attempting to promote lifestyle changes that the patient may not be ready or willing to make at the time. Patients have and will state it is their right to decide and they are correct. How are facilities suppose to improve outcomes without upsetting the unwilling patient?

Obamacare is the ultimate demonstration of “You can’t fix stupid,” which is the true problem with our healthcare system. While people proclaim they want or need free healthcare, they want it to also come with no responsibility to them – No responsibility to attempt to be healthy and no responsibility to even sign up! While politicians claimed that anywhere from 30 – 50 million Americans who didn’t have health insurance and were clamoring to get it in order to avoid everything from bankruptcy to death, only 400,000 people have bothered to sign up thus far. What’s even more shocking is that A McKinsey Report estimates that just 10 percent of the enrollees in the ACA are people that did not previously have health insurance. This is evidence that no matter how much we spend and how hard we try, millions of Americans will still smoke, drink to excess, drink and drive, eat unhealthy food, and refuse to be responsible enough to tend to their health and health coverage.

Jake Novak said it best in his recent commentary on CNBC:

Our Constitutionally guaranteed freedom in this country isn’t just a slogan. It means the freedom to succeed and the freedom to fail. The freedom to be smart, and the freedom to be stupid. And just because you can’t fix stupid, it doesn’t mean we should try to fix or amend freedom. Unfortunately, that’s just what Obamacare does by taking money from the responsible portion of society in an attempt to force feed responsibility to another. That’s the thing about responsibility: It can’t be imposed or transferred from one to another. President Obama has unilaterally changed the rules of the ACA several times in the past 12 months. There will be more changes to come, including a possible long delay or outright abolition of the entire individual mandate. When — and if — that happens, don’t pay attention to all the inevitable excuses that will address everything from blaming bad websites to anti-tea party conspiracy theories. The real reason will be that the government can’t fix stupid without killing freedom. And, as far to the left as America has drifted lately, we haven’t quite gone off the deep end.

There is no legislation that can eliminate cause and effect. Attempts to reduce or destroy the cause will violate freedom. The patient deserves the right to refuse. With this comes consequences. What Obamacare and many other government programs attempt to do is try to lighten the burden of the consequences that result from poor choices by redistributing the financial implications onto those that have been responsible, violating our freedoms in a weak, poorly thought out attempt to fix stupid.","2014-03-15 12:30:05","0","34.0","28.0","4.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","80.0","29.0","0.0","133.0","0.0","12.0","0","961","57.38","59.45","17.09","24.12","20.02","23.10","87.72","53.49","14.05","7.70","2.50","2.08","1.04","1.25","0.83","6.35","6.56","13.22","10.51","3.64","6.66","2.81","16.65","4.79","1.25","1.35","1.35","2.60","6.66","3.23","3.33","0.31","1.77","0.10","8.22","0.00","0.00","1.14","0.10","13.94","2.50","3.33","2.60","2.91","1.35","3.64","0.94","0.21","0.42","0.10","3.54","0.10","2.29","0.00","1.56","7.80","2.19","1.46","3.12","0.83","1.04","3.95","10.93","1.14","10.51","1.87","4.68","3.85","3.54","0.42","0.31","1.77","0.00","0.42","0.10","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.10","14.46","4.68","4.58","0.21","0.00","0.21","0.10","0.31","1.46","2.81","0.00","0.10","4463","7.7","21.47826086956522","1399","962","48","59.64","11.5","9.9","10.62","11.2","187","7.166666666666666","17.775467775467774","450","19.37","21","0.52","0","41","10","86","0","95","85","0","2","24","151","25","2","43","1","0","66","21","48","2","0","4","48","0","69","29","21","20","41","30","12","5","0","5"

When given a chance at life after a botched abortion that caused him the loss of limbs, Nik became quite the athlete.

Nik’s high school wrestling career is worthy of news coverage all by itself, but his story of triumph is far greater than the average teen. Nik has overcome the kind of obstacles very few encounter. Because his biological parents, an unknown couple from Russia, attempted to abort Nik, he is missing parts of both legs and doesn’t have a fully developed set of fingers. However, his disability hasn’t stopped him from making state wrestling championships.

Thanks to his adoptive parents Marvin and Apryl, residents of Woodburn, Indiana, Nik has not only been given a chance at life, but a chance to excel. His mother discussed their decision to adopt Nik with LifeNews:

“We made the decision to adopt him after knowing about him for six weeks on Respect Life Sunday at church when we heard the priest say we have to respect all forms of life, even those with disabilities.”

Now known as “Woodlan’s warrior,” listen to the local news coverage on Nik Hoot from WANE NewsChannel 15:","2014-02-23 10:21:10","0","1.0","13.0","4.0","0.0","3.0","0.0","35.0","26.0","0.0","43.0","0.0","0.0","0","207","91.31","82.07","4.21","71.16","23.00","21.74","80.19","44.93","8.70","7.25","0.00","1.45","0.00","5.31","0.48","1.45","7.25","16.43","5.31","4.35","5.31","1.45","12.56","5.31","2.90","0.97","1.45","2.90","5.31","3.86","1.45","0.00","0.00","1.45","12.56","1.45","0.00","0.48","5.31","11.59","2.42","1.93","0.00","2.90","0.97","3.38","1.93","0.00","1.45","0.48","4.83","0.97","3.38","0.97","0.00","9.18","2.90","3.38","3.38","0.97","1.45","3.86","7.73","0.00","10.14","0.00","5.80","4.35","3.86","0.48","0.48","0.00","0.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.46","3.86","6.28","0.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.93","2.42","0.00","0.00","952","8.27","26.625","287","208","9","64.95","10.5","9.9","10.68","12.6","46","8.9","20.08615384615385","136","23.75","1","0.46","0","4","3","19","0","30","15","1","1","0","37","22","0","13","0","0","9","7","9","0","0","0","7","0","5","8","4","6","3","7","1","0","0","2"
"https://madworldnews.com/details-hobby-lobby-case-matter/","Why The Details Of The Hobby Lobby Case Do NOT Matter","With the Supreme Court case involving Hobby Lobby and the Obamacare contraceptive mandate in full force, details are coming to light and mud is being slung in every way possible. From the investments made by Hobby Lobby’s retirement plan and purchasing of products from China to the definition of abortifacient, attempts to discredit Hobby Lobby’s stance are occurring at every turn. But here’s the truth: The details don’t matter.

If you value America as a Constitutional Republic, the details of the Hobby Lobby case shouldn’t matter in determining on which side you stand. Here’s why: The only earthly entity that can take away the people’s freedom is their own government, either by being too weak to protect them from external threats or by becoming too powerful and taking over every aspect of their life. The latter is what we are flirting with in the Hobby Lobby case.

The government should not be involved! One thing I can agree with the left on in this case is that it is a waste of tax payer money. What benefits an employer offers should be left up to the employer and the decision to accept employment on those terms left up to the employee. Notice, I stress benefits. What is a benefit? From our trusty friend Merriam-Webster:

ben·e·fit noun \ˈbe-nə-ˌfit\ : a good or helpful result or effect : money that is paid by a company (such as an insurance company) or by a government when someone dies, becomes sick, stops working, etc. : something extra (such as vacation time or health insurance) that is given by an employer to workers in addition to their regular pay

A benefit is not mandatory. It is not an entitlement. When you use a Google search, words such as gift, advantage, profit, and gain are used to define benefit. Should the government legislate the “something extra” or “gift?” Sounds ridiculous, doesn’t it? But it’s not only ridiculous, it’s dangerous.

It is that danger the progressives are pushing this free country towards that matters in this case, so forget the Hobby Lobby details you’ve picked up on social media, on the news, or in conversation. Instead, hear this warning, remember it, and pass it along.There is definitely a difference of opinion at hand and one side of the argument is attempting to use the government as a weapon against the other. I can’t put it in any better words than Dana Loesch did in her dire warning on her Blaze TV program earlier this month: “When progressives meet a divergent opinion, they want the boot of government to stamp it out. This is dangerous.”

This case is not about women’s rights. Is it a woman’s right to have things offered to her for free by the forced expense of another? Does that sound very American? Does that sound like a woman’s right or the violation of another’s rights for her to be given something for free? What we need to ask ourselves is this, do we really want to give the government the opportunity to establish a precedent which would allow the state to abridge civil liberties?

Regardless of which side you stand on at this time, watch Dana’s video below and ask yourself if this is this the power we want our government to have over private corporations and over our lives in general. Don’t forget to spread the warning by sharing this article!","2014-04-01 19:33:32","1","36.0","32.0","4.0","1.0","19.0","0.0","77.0","26.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","12.0","0","571","82.93","65.66","11.63","62.30","19.69","20.84","85.29","53.94","12.78","4.55","0.53","1.40","1.05","0.70","0.88","8.23","8.93","15.94","8.58","3.50","5.43","1.75","15.24","4.20","1.93","1.93","0.35","1.40","7.18","4.55","2.63","0.35","1.05","0.00","8.23","0.00","0.18","1.23","0.00","12.08","1.75","2.10","2.10","3.15","0.88","4.38","1.58","0.70","0.70","0.18","1.05","0.18","0.88","0.00","0.00","11.56","2.63","1.40","4.73","2.28","1.75","2.28","11.03","0.35","9.98","0.88","7.53","1.58","4.90","1.58","0.00","2.63","0.00","0.18","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","16.29","3.68","4.03","1.23","0.00","1.23","0.35","0.53","1.05","3.15","0.70","0.35","2576","7.64","21.814814814814813","824","565","30","60.85","12.0","9.4","10.39","10.5","110","10.2","17.307610619469028","293","19.37","5","0.53","0","20","2","70","0","67","40","1","0","7","122","33","0","28","0","0","27","10","16","1","0","7","21","0","29","5","14","11","16","25","8","4","0","4"
"https://madworldnews.com/home-health-agencies-suffer-devastating-blow-obamacare/","Home Health Agencies To Suffer Devastating Blow With Obamacare.","It’s becoming increasingly difficult to deny the fact that Obamacare’s purpose has nothing to do with “affordable” or “healthcare.” The detriment this law is causing to individuals and healthcare companies alike continues to rapidly roll in day after day. Home health agencies are suffering a devastating blow nationally. With the history of home health being a forerunner for saving healthcare costs, it is really hard to understand why a law meant to improve healthcare and cost would harm such an important component such as home health.

Not only are the agencies that provide these services taking a hit, their patients are too. Uniquely, home health patients are the most frail, as they are usually aged, homebound, sick, and low income. Because the home health patient population is so fragile, losing services will not only negatively effect their health, but also increase the cost to the community, as this population is forced to seek out care at the hospital or nursing home level.

Losing these benefits is exactly what happened to many beneficiaries on January 1, 2014, when Medicare’s home health care services, formerly serving 3.5 million elderly beneficiaries across the country, were cut under Obamacare. The cut deleted exactly 14 percent, or an estimated $22 billion, from these lowest-income Americans over four years, which also caused a significant decrease in the census and revenue for the agencies that had been providing these services.

In the past, home health has been paramount in providing skilled care to homebound Medicare beneficiaries. These services saved tax payers a tremendous amount of money, while allowing patients to remain in their home.

The Washington Times explains:

Using 2009 as a reference year, Medicare’s average Part A and Part B payment for a home health care visit was $145, compared to $373 per day in a skilled nursing facility or a whopping $1,805 per day in a hospital. In addition, according to one leading expert, skilled home health care services saved the Medicare program $2.8 billion during the most recent three-year period. Approximately $670 million of that savings is attributable to 20,000 fewer hospital readmissions.

With the value of home health in driving down Medicare costs being so evident, one has to wonder, why are the beneficiaries and agencies being stripped of funding for these services? Why is a critical, working system being driven into the ground with this Obamacare monstrosity? And what will happen to the agencies that played a vital part in communities for so long? The Washington Times describes exactly what this will achieve:

It will hit the small businesses that provide home health care nationwide, and is already doing so. More than 90 percent of those providing home health care are small businesses. According to the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 40 percent of these companies will be operating “at a loss” — that is, they will likely fold or end up in bankruptcy — by 2017 as a result of the cut. What does that mean? It means nearly 5,000 more Medicare home health care providers may go out of business, and nearly 500,000 more jobs within this flogged industry may be wiped out to fund Obamacare.

Unfortunately, they are right on the money. As a home health employee, I’ve seen our agency slowly failing to sustain financial stability. Within months, services once offered have been eliminated and our work force has been reduced by over 20%. For the first time in my 15 year healthcare career, I am seeing “reduction in force” used because of reimbursement cuts from the government.

When I became a nurse, I was told, “You’ll always be able to find a job!” … Then along came Obamacare.

"https://madworldnews.com/endless-supply-heroin-needles-paid-tax-money/","Endless Supply Of Heroin Needles Paid For With Your Tax Money","Social media is going nuts with news of a bill in Maryland that will provide an endless supply of heroin needles to drug users, using tax dollars. Residents are outraged to see their hard earned money used to facilitate a lifestyle of bad choices. Rewarding failure seems to be a new trend, not only in Maryland, but nationwide.

The House bill passed in the Maryland House of Delegates, and the Senate bill passed in the Maryland Senate. The bills now go to the opposite chamber. If the bill passes Maryland General Assembly, tax dollars will be paying for the endless supply of free needles for heroin addicts. While those that would use the needles applaud, the sober public is fuming.

Although the bill is limited to Maryland, it could set a precedent for other states to follow. This should fuel public outcry across the nation and not limit the disdain for the bill to Maryland residents only.

Opponents of the bill state it will help reduce HIV rates, while critics point out the obvious – hard working tax payers want their tax dollars to go to things like roads and schools, not perpetuating a problem of dependent, unproductive members of society.

“I thought this was outrageous. My constituents work very hard for their taxpayer dollars that they pay to the state, and they expect it to go to things like roads and schools, not to facilitating and subsidizing illegal drug use.” – Del. Michael Hough, (R) -Frederick/Washington Counties.

Heroin use is an epidemic in Maryland with fatalities from heroin overdoses up 54 percent across the state. With such staggering statistics, one must ask why law makers would condone such illegal behavior with this bill?

If approved, this bill will have costly consequences. Although the increase in fatal overdoses cannot adequately be predicted, it is estimated that the cost for Baltimore city alone will be a quarter of a million tax dollars. The snowball effect of increased use and life altering consequences that cause many addicts to become dependent on further government assistance can also not be determined at this time, but it is evident to most sound minded individuals that this kind of bill will only perpetuate problems on many levels.

Surprisingly, providing needles to drug users is not a new concept in Maryland. Currently, heroin users in Baltimore City can bring back a used needle to exchange it for a new one. Under the bill, they could receive several needles at a time. It seems Maryland is continuously striving to make it easier on the addicts at the cost of the hard working tax payer.","2014-03-20 14:24:08","0","30.0","27.0","4.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","75.0","26.0","0.0","132.0","0.0","12.0","0","434","93.69","44.51","14.86","13.33","18.87","26.04","82.95","45.16","7.37","1.84","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.38","5.53","8.76","14.52","7.37","2.30","3.69","1.61","12.67","3.69","1.15","0.23","1.15","1.15","3.69","1.38","2.30","0.00","0.69","0.46","4.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.29","1.61","3.23","2.76","1.38","0.69","3.46","1.38","0.23","0.23","0.92","2.07","0.00","2.07","0.23","0.00","6.91","0.69","2.76","2.76","0.46","1.61","1.38","8.99","2.07","11.98","3.00","6.68","2.76","5.07","0.00","0.92","7.83","0.00","0.69","0.23","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.29","5.07","4.61","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.23","0.46","0.00","0.46","0.23","2075","8.38","19.772727272727273","651","436","23","60.65","11.6","9.5","11.2","11.2","105","7.083333333333334","19.23302752293578","222","17.95","3","0.42","0","9","4","45","0","53","31","1","1","14","65","31","2","43","0","0","12","3","17","0","0","3","19","0","27","3","14","12","9","13","3","0","0","1"
"https://madworldnews.com/think-know-marriage-divorce-wrong/","What You Think You Know About Marriage & Divorce Is Wrong","It should come as no surprise that certain sobering statistics, widely accepted by society and pushed as hard truth by the media are indeed false or misleading. What we may not realize is how these falsehoods, accepted as statistical facts can become self-fulfilling prophecies that strip one of any hope for success when involved in what appears like a losing battle – based on the statistics anyway.

There’s a 50% divorce rate, right? And second marriages are even more doomed than the first, right? What if I told you this was wrong? If you are like me, you have probably recited these statistics at one point or another, not realizing how these things can snatch the hope right out of someone. Well, here’s the good news – those stats aren’t facts! What they are is a discouragement of marriage, and what we need is the truth, which is much more encouraging.

Do 50% of marriages end in divorce? Not even close. According to the Census Bureau, 72% of those who have ever been married are still married to their first spouse. As for the remaining 28% who aren’t, widowed spouses are included! The average first-marriage divorce rate is unknown; however, using the rate of widowhood and other factors, it can be estimated to be closer to 20-25%, while all marriages (including those “doomed” second marriages) are in the 31-35% range, depending on the study. In summary, the odds are not against you, but actually in your favor!

Another myth that runs rampant is that the divorce rate is the same within the church. While some will quote The Barna group studies as supporting this myth, George Barna himself has corrected this misunderstanding. You see, Barna was not studying people “in the church.”

Shaunti Feldhahn, author of The Good News About Marriage, explains:

The Barna Group studies were focusing specifically on the divorce rates of those with Christian and non-Christian belief systems and didn’t take worship attendance into account. So I partnered with the Barna Group and we re-ran the numbers: and if the person was in church last week, their divorce rate dropped by 27%. And that is one of the smallest drops found in recent studies: overall, regular church attendance lowers the divorce rate anywhere from 25-50%, depending on the study you look at.

The implications of this information is huge, and I’ve witnessed it first hand myself. First, marriage is not doomed and equally as likely to fail from the beginning as it is to succeed. You don’t have to go into marriage with the belief that you have a 50/50 shot at “getting it right.” You also don’t have to hinge your decisions on the myth that most people are getting a divorce. The fact is, most are not. While projections by expert demographers continue to project a divorce rate of 40-50%, they are only projections and real life scenarios are proving otherwise. Take the baby boomers for example, where 7 in 10 are still married to their first spouse. As Feldhaln states, “Most of them have had 30 years’ worth of chances to get divorced… and they are still together.”

Second, you have a weapon to increase the likelihood of a successful marriage at your disposal – the church. This is where I can attest to success. While I am shamefully part of the unpleasant divorce statistics, with not one, but two failed marriages under my belt, I have seen the difference the church makes in my third marriage. Unfortunately, I did not have a relationship with Christ until recent years, when I found myself once again struggling to maintain a marriage. Not willing to add a third divorce to my list of failures, I turned to scripture to find my way. In doing so, I came to not only develop a stronger relationship with Christ and my husband, but with many brothers and sisters in Christ – the church.

The benefit of that church family has been priceless in the good it has done for my current marriage. In my previous marriages, I had close confidants that I could call on when my relationship was struggling. Meaning well, these friends often cheered me on and sided with me against my spouse. Little did I know that this was driving the wedge of separation deeper into my marriage. Now, when I find myself discouraged and still in need of sound advice after consulting scripture, I call on my sisters in Christ. The message I receive from these women is much different than what I had heard before. The focus isn’t on who is right and who is wrong, but how to be successful in my marriage. I’ve never been encouraged to just walk away as I was in the past. My church family has a sincere desire to see my marriage strengthen – not dissipate because it’s easier or socially acceptable.

Although I did not succeed in my first two marriages, I am now armed with better information – the two things this article focuses on. When struggling, I can remember, most people get through this, and I will too.

We can equip couples with knowledge to counter the cynical statements that tell us “marriages fail” and “why bother” with the solid truth that most marriages actually last a lifetime.

What marriages need today is hope. And of all people, we in the Body of Christ should be the most ready to offer hope – not just for our spiritual life but for our marriages. And now, we can. – Shaunti Feldhahn

Please spread the hope by sharing this article as readily as we tend to share the false, yet discouraging statistics that have stripped so many couples of the hope for a successful, lifelong, happy marriage.

"https://madworldnews.com/atheists-demand-bible-verse-removed-social-media-accounts/","Atheists Demand Bible Verse Be Removed From Social Media Accounts","Atheist are once again showing they have no understanding of what “separation of Church and State” means. It’s important to note that “separation of Church and State” is nowhere found in the Constitution or any other founding legislation. Contrary to Atheists’ popular misunderstanding, public displays of faith are not prohibited by our Constitution. However, that doesn’t stop groups such as the Freedom From Religion Foundation from demanding religion be annihilated from public view.

In their most resent display of ignorance, the Freedom From Religion Foundation wrote a letter asking Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker delete a message, which read simply, “Philippians 4:13,” from his official Facebook and Twitter accounts. The popular New Testament Bible verse Walker referenced in his post reads, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”

Philippians 4:13 — Governor Walker (@GovWalker) March 16, 2014

Walker’s spokeswoman told The Blaze that he will not comply with the atheist group’s request to remove the Bible verse from his his accounts. In an email, Walker spokeswoman press secretary Laurel Patrick said:

“Governor Walker will not remove the post on his social media. The verse was part of a devotional he read that morning, which inspired him, and he chose to share it.”

Spokeswoman Patrick further explained, Walker’s social media accounts are frequently used “to engage with Wisconsinites on matters of public policy,” as well as to give constituents “a sense of who he is” and that the scripture reference he posted on March 16 was simply “a reflection of his thoughts for the day.”

The response did not please the Freedom From Religion Foundation and their reasoning for their request is enough to give the reader a headache. According to The Blaze, Freedom From Religion Foundation co-president Dan Barker stated that while he finds the posting of the Bible verse both “rude” and “arrogant,” his group likely won’t sue over it. Barker continued, “We’re still complaining about it, but we can’t do anything more than complain. We think it’s inappropriate for him to use his official page to promote his view.”

When did it become “rude” and “arrogant” to share an inspiring quote from a favorite book? Personally, I’d rather have a politician that is honest with his views than one that hides his true beliefs or worse, doesn’t have any conviction in his thought. I’m certain even Atheist would agree that an excerpt from a book that moved you is highly appropriate… Unless that book is the bible.

Barker referred to Walker’s post as an abuse, stating, “We’re not going to take any legal action on one abuse. And it is an abuse — and he should know it’s one.” He went on to threaten that the Freedom From Religion Foundation might take definitive action if Walker decided to post Bible messages on a more regular basis, but that in this case they will likely “look the other way.”

Pardon the confusion, but while Atheist do not want Christians to dictate what they should believe, why do they feel justified in deciding what others should be allowed to post on a social media site designed for users to openly express themselves and share their thoughts, feelings, and beliefs with others? Doesn’t that sound a bit hypocritical, not to mention, completely un-American?

"https://madworldnews.com/another-delay-obama-continues-change-law-obamacare/","Another Delay. Obama Continues To Change The Law For Obamacare.","With Obamacare’s rapidly changing regulations, mandates, and deadlines, this law becomes more confusing everyday. Most recently, a “hardship extension” has been extended. Now, don’t get excited, even though we are all feeling hardships with Obamanomics, this extension for the individual mandate under Obamacare is for those that experienced a hardship at the hands of Obamacare. Can we not see how ridiculous this is becoming? Instead of admitting that the law is unworkable, it is being adjusted repeatedly in a weak attempt to make it work, all because it is the very thing that is causing the problems.

The report on The Heritage Network clarifies the newest change due to the disaster of Obamacare quite well:

It’s getting difficult to take any part of Obamacare seriously. The Obama administration has altered or delayed it so many times—who can be sure what the law is at this point? The individual mandate stating that every American has to purchase government-approved health coverage or pay a fine is supposed to kick in on March 31. That’s the deadline to sign up for coverage, supposedly to avoid this year’s penalty. But Obamacare is never “settled law,” as the president and others have called it, because Health and Human Services (HHS) keeps writing more regulations. Most recently, the administration extended the “hardship exemption” from the individual mandate for those who had their previous policies canceled because of Obamacare until October 2016. To qualify, your plan must have been canceled because it wasn’t compliant with Obamacare, and you just have to tell the government you “believe” that other insurance policies are unaffordable. The exemption means people who meet these criteria are free from the individual mandate. But if they want to buy coverage, they are given the special option to buy a “catastrophic” health insurance plan, which is not eligible for subsidies and typically would be available only to those under age 30. When the exemption was first announced in December, Heritage experts Alyene Senger and Robert Moffit said this “is not going to simplify anything. Rest assured it is going to create even greater confusion for health insurers trying to sell these products. Also, don’t expect the unhappy consumers who’ve just lost their previous coverage to understand clearly which plan they can pick and be legally qualified to pick it.” Due to the utter confusion and the underperforming signups on HealthCare.gov, reporters asked HHS this week whether the agency would simply extend the deadline for people to buy coverage. An HHS official responded that, “In fact, we don’t actually have the statutory authority to extend the open enrollment period in 2014.” This administration hasn’t let a detail like legal authority stop it from overstepping its boundsmultiple times. And as Heritage’s Senger and Moffit put it, “issuing more government rules to correct the consequences of their unworkable government rules is the only thing they seem to know how to do.”

This is only one of many issues with Obamacare. The following is just a sampling of other issues with the law that we have already covered:

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/do-you-have-the-right-to-resist-an-unlawful-arrest-2","Do You Have the Right to Resist an Unlawful Arrest?","Often when people discuss “the law,” rather than operating from a fact-based vantage point they are instead pontificating based upon hearsay, rumor or simply an emotional reaction.

During a recent school board meeting in Gilford, New Hampshire an irate father was removed from the meeting and arrested for “disorderly conduct” based upon his exceeding the “two minute rule.” Many have said that this arrest was illegal.

The reason for this man’s outrage is a topic for another piece, but the video of the arrest, that went viral almost immediately, has sparked yet another debate nationwide.

In one camp you have those who assert that the officer in question had no grounds to actually arrest the angry father and subsequently transport him to jail. Others offered that, while perhaps handcuffs were unnecessary, the man was in the wrong for speaking out of turn and the officer was justified in removing him from the school.

Whichever Internet link you happen upon, if there is an open comment section, chances are high that at least one person posted their opinion that the man in question had the absolute right to resist an unlawful arrest. In response to such comments others have stated that resisting arrest is the worst possible course of action.

Street-corner lawyers and Internet pundits aside, we need to ask ourselves a serious question in this regard: does the American Citizen have the legal right to resist an unlawful arrest?

Thanks to the miracle of the World Wide Web, you need not drive to you local county courthouse and spend hours wading though law books and legal journals. The precedent has long been established and there are numerous findings and legal opinions that can be found online.

In what would seem to be the original test of the U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights, Amendment 5, specifically “..deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” we have the case of Plummer v. State 135 Ind. 308, 34 N.E. 968 (1893). The Indiana Supreme Court after considering the original case, overturned a manslaughter conviction against Plummer and issued the following opinion: “Citizens may resist unlawful arrest to the point of taking an arresting officer’s life if necessary.”

Several years later, the Plummer decision was used as precedent during the appeals trial of one, John Bad Elk. Bad Elk, a tribal police officer in South Dakota, had killed another tribal policeman. Three policemen had attempted to arrest Bad Elk without a warrant or charges.

Bad Elk was originally convicted of murder, however, his conviction was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court who issued this opinion:

“Where the officer is killed in the course of the disorder which naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law looks with very different eyes upon the transaction, when the officer had the right to make the arrest, from what it does if the officer had no right. What may be murder in the first case might be nothing more than manslaughter in the other, or the facts might show that no offense had been committed.”

To the modern, enlightened man these legal opinions would seem to be taken straight out of the pages of the Anarchists Cookbook. Some readers may be shocked to see them for the first time and consider that the old courts were sanctioning lawful murder of policemen.

More than two decades ago when I attended the police academy, I recall one of our instructors advising us that a citizen had the right to resist an unlawful arrest. The purpose of that lesson was to impress upon we young bucks the seriousness of the act of arresting a person and that our actions would indeed be put under scrutiny. We cadets were warned about the career ending perils of a “false arrest” charge and advised against the tendency to resort to handcuffs just because we could.

During my time behind the badge there were definitely times when handcuffs and detention were absolutely the order of the day. Nonetheless, there were also times during a non-violent confrontation that the introduction of cuffs would have only exacerbated the situation.

My first police chief taught me that as long as no one was throwing punches, sometimes it was good just to let people “blow off some steam.” Back then new officers were taught the art of mediation. The choice to arrest, or not to arrest, was left to the officer’s on scene discretion.

Those boisterous people would often vent a bit and then regain control. More than once I was able to calm an irate individual by not reacting the way they thought I would. Many blowhards were ready to fight, but when I did not offer physical combat they took the cue and changed their tune. Some even apologized to me for losing their cool.

My impetus for putting pen to paper on this subject is the disturbing trend I am witnessing nationwide. In case after case, we see policemen who seem to view handcuffs as their first and only resort to a non-violent altercation. What is even more troubling to me are the scores of timid apologists who reason that any public display of anger or outrage is rightfully silenced by officers of the state.

This nation was born of dissent not acquiescence. Our founders fought for the rights of man. If Adams, Jefferson and Madison had listened to the voices of timidity and complicity their only path would have been the return to the life of comfortable tax slaves.

Rather than accept that they were sanctioning murder, we could view the legal opinions of the courts in both the Plummer and Bad Elk cases as a message sent by the Judicial Branch to the Executive. Firearms and handcuffs, while often legitimately called for in a crisis, should not be the default for every situation encountered. When the state seeks to rule by the sword, the peasants have a choice to make: submit or resist.

My favorite character on Seinfeld, Cosmo Kramer, once wondered, “Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries?”

Who knows. But perhaps more importantly we might wonder why schools need to collect some 400 bits of data on students, including things that have nothing to do with education, like family income range, religious affiliation, number of hours worked per weekend and even medical laboratory procedure results.

A group of New York superintendents, school board members and other school officials said the massive amount of data collection “serves no real purpose and seems like an unnecessary risk to students’ privacy.”

Then why do it? In a single word: control.

With a large amount of data, the controllists can pigeonhole our kids into post-graduate options that best meet the controllists’ desires.

From “Conform”:

“The Pearson company, one of Common Core’s key advocates, produced a promotional video that hints at what the future of education could look like once the standards and the technology are all in place. In the video, a mother is seen reviewing her son’s academic progress, while on the side of the screen is her son’s “career projection” and “college projection.” It’s touching to see the mother nearly tear up when she sees that her son’s on track to become a mechanical engineer.”

Is that what the student wants to do with his life, or is that merely what the corporation’s algorithm tabulated, which could have factored in a potential shortage of mechanical engineers? It all just has such a Soviet flavor to it.

But who am I to think critically when there’s data to be gathered and cogs in the corporate wheel to be filled?

Conservatives rightly point out the incompetence of the bureaucracy.

Even one of the most ardent proponents of Common Core, Jeb Bush, is a skeptic of the government system.

“We can’t just outsource public education to bureaucracies and public education unions and hope for the best,” he said in a speech, in reference to charter schools.

And yet he is comfortable with forcing students and parents to hand over social security numbers, behavioral information and medical procedure results to the bureaucracy?

What a man-made disaster that is going to be. Just consider what has happened so far, and the bureaucrats haven’t even been collecting it for very long.

Last year, a Minnesota legislative auditor discovered the state’s education department’s “mammoth computer systems … lacked ‘adequate internal controls’ and comprehensive security plans,” and that bureaucrats had “failed to document where private (student) data was held or the internal controls to secure it,” according to EAGnews.

These kids are sitting ducks for hackers, and trust me, the bureaucrats will just shrug their shoulders when it happens. They’ll probably blame a lack of funding, too.

Or consider the incompetence of administrators in Chicago Public Schools. It was reported in December 2013 that the medical information of about 2,000 students was posted on the school’s website. It had been there since the summer and no bureaucrat had realized it.

“Oops, sorry,” we’ll hear.

“Conform” details another disturbing story:

“Last fall, a teenage hacker was arrested and charged with felony computer trespass after he allegedly “accessed and downloaded the records of thousands in 2012 and 2013.” The hacker allegedly posted the information, which “included student identification numbers and information on free lunch plans,” to online message boards.”

He also posted the names of students who received “instructional services in an alternative setting.”

“Whoops, guess our security wasn’t good enough,” they’ll tell us.

But instead of concluding that government schools don’t have the proper security and personnel to handle such sensitive information, progressives like Bill Gates, Arne Duncan and Jeb Bush forge ahead into their brave new world of collecting the data to use to decide what the future holds for our children. Even if they don’t care about helping plan the economy, they will personally profit politically and/or economically from developing such a system.

But despite the strength of these interests, parents are making headway.

In New York, the fierce backlash caused politicians to pull the plug on the inBloom database, which was funded by Gates’s foundation.

That’s a victory, but as we’ve seen with the Common Core rebranding campaign around the country, the data collection effort will likely be rebranded, too. Progressives don’t surrender in their war on personal liberty willingly – it’s an incremental campaign of control and we must fight them every step of the way.

That’s why parents cannot relent in their effort to root Common Core and its tentacles out of education.

As the old saying goes, “When something is deleted from the Internet, it never really goes away” (except maybe in Europe).

That adage proves true when we consider the rhetoric of Common Core proponents. In their effort to prep for prime time, they wanted to make sure everything was just right: every wrinkle was ironed from their crisp white shirt, every hair was in place and every word of the talking points was just so.

When people began tuning into the Common Core initiative and questioning the Obama administration’s ardent support of it, CoreStandards.org, archived by the Wayback Machine on March 5, 2010, read, “The Common Core State Standards Initiative is a state-led effort coordinated by the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices (NGA Center) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO).”

“State-led.” That sounds nice. It must be true, right? After all, it’s the education “experts” telling us that.

Before the stage lights were on – while the central planners were still plotting – the very same page of CoreStandards.org read, “The Common Core State Standards Initiative is a joint effort by the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices (NGA Center) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) in partnership with Achieve, ACT and the College Board.”

That’s strange. I thought it was state-led. Oh, that’s right – it became state-led after it was all put together. After all, outspoken politicians like Mike Huckabee and Jeb Bush were upset about their lackluster government school system results – state-level reform was imperative.

Have you ever heard of the states named “Achieve, ACT and the College Board”? Me neither. Maybe those are some of the 57 states Barack Obama said he visited during the campaign.

Achieve, Inc.’s involvement, in particular, undermines the “state-led” narrative.

From “Conform”:

“The Common Core State Standards Initiative, as it’s officially known, is the product of three private organizations, two of which have official-sounding names: the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO). The third private group is Achieve, Inc., which boasts on its Web page that it helped take the idea of nationalized learning standards from ‘a radical proposal into a national agenda.'”

Common Core got a major shot in the arm when the Obama administration dangled nearly $800 million in front of states if they would just adopt the various tentacles of the beast, like “common” standards, assessments, data systems and teacher evaluations. This promise “If you like your “state-led” plan you can keep your “state-led” plan,” seems awfully familiar.

“Big deal. So maybe it wasn’t state-led. But it’s rigorous,” progressive proponents will counter.

It’s so rigorous, in fact, that our progressive education system has moved beyond teaching our kids how to think.

“Conform” reads:

“The Oregon Department of Education website describes Common Core as “21st century skills for 21st century jobs,” and assures parents that the standards “will prepare our students for career success in the rapidly changing world of work.” I included that quote because it gets to the heart of what this Common Core experiment is really about: creating workers, not thinkers.”

Leaving aside the merits of fundamentally transforming the purpose of education, is the new system more rigorous?

“If you want to take calculus your freshman year in college, you will need more mathematics than is in the Common Core,” Jason Zimba, a professor at Bennington College and the lead writer of the math standards said. He also said students learning the Common Core way would likely be precluded from “attending elite colleges” since the Core is “not aligned with the expectations at the collegiate level.”

https://twitter.com/louisck/status/460765469746929664/

Does that sound more “rigorous” to you?

The English standards aren’t any better.

From “Conform”:

“Common Core instructs teachers to present “information texts”—such as Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address—without any background information or context. So while students will still read some important material, they’ll read it “cold,” which will strip the texts of their historical power and instead allow students to interpret the documents however they choose. Common Core proponents call this technique ‘discovering content.'”

Sadly, I think the only thing we’ll discover is that we’ve been sold a bill of goods by controllists who want more power and the ability to dumb down the next generation to more easily manipulate them. Tragically, 44 states are willingly going along and setting up untold millions of children for failure.

Americans deserve better than this – we must demand it.

Go to any school employee union protest and you’re sure to find they’ve shrouded themselves in the protective shields of warm and cuddly children.

“Students are OUR Priority,” read the signs at a Michigan Education Association capitol protest. They wanted more money for raises and benefits – you know, because those are good for kids.

But in moments of candor, when the progressive activists stray from the carefully crafted talking points, the true union positions slip out.

“Conform” tells of four such instances.

Perhaps the most egregious has been virtually wiped from the annals of history, and the American Federation of Teachers even tries to dispute it. Albert Shanker, the late president of the AFT, was quoted in 1985 by the Meridian (Miss.) Star newspaper as saying, “When schoolchildren start paying dues, that’s when I’ll start representing the interests of schoolchildren.”

Whoops! In TV and documentary filmmaking, that’s what you call a “money quote.” No wonder the union does its best to marginalize it.

In 2009, National Education Association lawyer Bob Chanin was going to retire. The NEA wanted to play it up nice and gave him a plum speaking position at its annual convention. Instead of a gold watch, the NEA gave Chanin a soap box. He let ‘er rip.

Chanin stated:

“NEA and its affiliates are effective advocates because we have power and we have power because there are more than 3.2 million people who are willing to pay us hundreds of millions of dollars in dues each year because they believe we are the unions that can most effectively represent them, the unions that can protect their rights and advance their interests as education employees.”

“Willing” might be a bit of a stretch. When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker gave his state’s teachers the choice about whether or not to join the union – which had previously been a job requirement – the NEA lost an estimated 40,000 of those so-called “willing” members.

Or consider this from the California Teachers Association:

“[A]s we celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the CTA, we must remember that we were founded for one reason—and one reason only—and that was to engage in politics.”

Wow. Teacher quality? Nope. Having more highly-educated students? Nah. More graduates can read? Who has time to waste on that – there’s politicking to be done!

Another damning admission came from Mary Hatwood Futrell in 1982, when she was president of the NEA:

“The major purpose of our organization is not the education of children. It is or ought to be the extension and/or preservation of our members’ rights. We earnestly care about the kids learning but that is secondary to the other goals.”

It’s incredible we as a society have given these people so much control over public schools. What have they done with that trust?

They have – for the first time ever – produced a generation of graduates less learned than their parents.

It is shameful and the blame lies at the feet of the people more interested in power, politics and money than they’ve historically been in educating children.

But is it reasonable to expect them to see the error of their ways and take corrective action?

Likely not – looking out for themselves is the very nature and purpose of Big Labor. While they’ll do their best to position themselves to appear otherwise, their primary motivations are to gain power and control.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/how-vested-interests-may-trump-efforts-to-end-the-war-on-drugs","How Vested Interests May Trump Efforts to End the War on Drugs","Good news from the Obama administration is very rare. And when there is one, someone spoils the fun.

Indeed, Michele Leonhart, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, recently said before Congress that she would ignore her boss’ wish to ease federal repression of pot laws in states that legalized it.

Beyond this blatant act of insubordination, Ms. Leonhart’s reaction shouldn’t surprise anyone. The War on Drugs, like so many other government policies, has entrenched many interests. For the DEA, it means more budgets and more high-tech tools and vehicles. So be ready for more resistance from this government agency.

Also be ready for more resistance from police forces in general. After all, as much as 30 percent of law enforcement revolves just around pot prohibition. This can explain why the police lobby was very active against Proposition 19 in California, which would have legalized marijuana. In addition, there are numerous cases of cops using drug operations to steal from people; some even pretend that people have drugs and let them get away if they agree to pay a bribe. Justice Quarterly even reported that some drug bust operations were delayed in order to seize the maximal amount of money.

Alcohol and tobacco producers are also opposed to ending the War on Drugs. They too funded the anti-Prop 19 campaign. Alcohol producers also lobbied against Proposition 5, which would have put minor drug offenders in rehab rather than prisons. The reason is simple: marijuana is a substitute for both products, according to a University of California-Berkeley study.

It is also a substitute for drugs. Big Pharma is fighting tooth and nail to keep the War on Drugs alive, and could even be behind pot busts. Since pot seems to be more effective than prescription drugs to relieve symptoms from certain diseases – and is substantially cheaper – it’s no surprise Big Pharma is lobbying to keep the advantage it has. Indeed, they were able to patent things like Marinol, a drug that contains an artificial version of THC, the active ingredient in pot. However, it’s deemed less effective and yields more side effects like feeling “high” than the natural plant. But thanks to the arbitrarily illegal status of pot, inferior products like Marinol can stay on the market.

Other inferior products are still on the market because of the War on Drugs. Every-day paper, for example, would have been surpassed by hemp (which is extracted from cannabis, a pot derivative) because it uses only 25 percent the land area of regular forests. This means that DuPont would have lost a handsome sum of money, as it had developed a new process to treat wood pulp, used to make paper, in the 1930s.

Fortunately, according to Jack Herer’s “The Emperor Wears No Clothes,” DuPont had the means to suppress this undesirable competitor. Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury under Herbert Hoover and DuPont’s chief financial backer, was able to get Harry Anslinger, who married Mellon’s niece, to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. He used his powers to blackmail the American Medical Association so they would produce a report faking the facts about the dangers of marijuana. This “report” completely buried another one commanded by former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, which concluded that the anti-marijuana hysteria was completely blown out of proportion.

As you can see the War on Drugs has absolutely nothing to do with keeping drugs out of the streets, unlike what the DEA claims – besides it’s a miserable failure. Nor does it have anything to do with health concerns, as there is no report ever of a pot overdose and as tobacco is more deadly than every other drug-related death combined. Rather, it has everything to do with a convergence of special interests that want to keep their business afloat or want to increase their power as can be shown by law-enforcement lobby against pot legalization.

President Obama’s great achievements can be counted on one hand; let the relaxation of the War on Drugs be another one.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/facts-are-racist-physical-descriptions-of-criminal-suspects-censored-to-eliminate-skin-color","Facts are Racist: Physical Descriptions of Criminal Suspects Censored to Eliminate Skin Color","“Breaking news, the First National Bank of Springfield has been robbed. Police say the robbers are armed and extremely dangerous. Citizens should be on the lookout for two persons of average height; one was wearing a dark colored sweatshirt, possibly navy blue and the other a light jacket that appeared to be some shade of green. Citizens with any information regarding the whereabouts of these two suspects should contact the Springfield Police immediately.”

I would guess that right now you are thinking “That is the lamest description of wanted criminals I have ever read.” And you would be right. How in the world are citizens expected to “be on the lookout” for anyone when equipped with such a vague description?

Here in the United States of America, the idea that suspected criminals should not be singled out by race has been put forth as recently as January 2014.

According to Pamela Wheelock, Vice President of University Services at the University Minnesota, several students, staff and faulty groups petitioned university officials in writing. The petition stated that these groups “unanimously agree that campus safety should be of the UMPD’s utmost importance; however, efforts to reduce crime should never be at the expense of our Black men, or any specific group of people likely to be targeted.”

The letter, sent to UM President Eric Kaler, demanded that the campus crime alert and crime response protocols be reconsidered. To reinforce their standpoint, the letter stated, “In addition to causing Black men to feel unsafe and distrusted, racial profiling is proven to inflict negative psychological effects on its victims.”

When this story first appeared it was easy enough to dismiss it as the rant of a bunch of disaffected radicals. Surely, no one in their right mind would consider actually removing the physical description of suspects sought by police officers.

It would seem in our modern upside down world, the idea that it is racist to use the actual physical description has caught on, and it even being implemented. Consider the story of the Mother’s Day beating attack in Savannah, Georgia.

The original story simply reported the facts that a family from Atlanta, Georgia was out for a walk the evening of Mother’s Day in the Rousakis Plaza in Savannah. An altercation ensued and two men and one of their wives were savagely beaten on the street by members from another group.

When police arrived, only the victims of the beating remained and the attackers had fled. As you would expect, police were seeking the other parties involved for questioning.

The follow up story from WSBTV.com listed the suspects in the beating attack in the following manner:

“One male was wearing a yellow shirt, the other a red shirt and later took it off and was wearing a white tank top. A younger female was wearing a white skirt or shorts and a beige or yellow top. The elder male was wearing all white and a white hat.”

That is the complete description given in the “news” story.

No hair color, skin color, race or even estimated ages. I suppose it is amazing that they used the terms “male” and “female” as opposed to using “person” in order to be gender-neutral.

Ladies and gentleman, do you believe that the victims of the beatings saw their attackers and gave complete physical descriptions of them to the police? Do you believe that those descriptions were made available to the reporter(s) from WSBTV?

Upon deeper investigation we learned that police had indeed discovered security camera footage that captured the incident and the images of all the people involved, including those who dished out the beatings. This footage was available and even referenced by the news source and yet they could not find the words to describe those suspects at large, save to offer clothing descriptions.

Is this the kind of self-censored journalism that we can look forward to seeing? Can we now expect that reporters and/or copy-editors will remove, or simply fail to document, physical descriptions of suspects in the interest of being politically correct or racially sensitive?

Perhaps the use of detailed descriptions of “suspects at large” has become an outdated concept. Genuine probable cause, based upon detailed information gathered by law enforcement, seems to be hindrance to the state. Consider the case of Yale University last autumn.

In November 2013, Yale University was put into a state of lockdown and SWAT teams were dispatched based on an anonymous telephone call that stated there was a man with a gun headed to the campus. The best description the local news stories could muster was “man with a gun.”

Hundreds of local, state and federal law enforcement officials conducted warrantless searches of innumerable buildings and dorm rooms, not to mention holding the innocent people present prisoner for four hours based upon an arbitrary description from an anonymous source.

There was no gunfire, no corroborating witness reports and no evidence of a crime in progress.

In his initial statement, the Chief of Police indicated that he believed it was a false alarm. Indeed, the incident was later discovered to be a hoax and a 50-year-old man was arrested and charged with making a false 911 call.

What we are witnessing in modern America is the effort to deem any physical description of a suspected criminal to be racist, and therefore off the table. At the same time, we see instances where detailed descriptions of suspects and genuine evidence of crimes are no longer needed for the state to hold the citizens hostage and conduct any kind of arbitrary searches or seizures they deem necessary.

Censorship and an unhindered state are a deadly combination for the weary body of civil liberty.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/creating-gun-criminals-where-there-were-none-2","Creating Gun Criminals Where There Were None","“Because it’s the law, that’s why.”

How many times have you heard that excuse or justification for some regulation or statute that seems to be prima facie punitive or unjust? Notice how I dropped a bit of Latin legalese on you? Prima Facie means “on the face of it” or obvious, or at first glance.

Latin terminology is strewn throughout “the law.” Some argue that it holds with timeless tradition. Others contend that use of Latin words keeps the layman from understanding the law and keeps attorneys in business. Regardless of your take on the situation, there are a few Latin terms used in the legal system of which you would do well to acquaint yourself.

Malum in se is a Latin phrase used to describe an act that is wrong or evil in and of itself. This would be an action that by its very nature is sinful or wrong. Murder, rape, robbery, theft would all be acts classified as malum in se; we do not require an elaborate explanation to tell us why they are wrong.

Converse to malum in se is malum prohibitum, an act that is wrong because someone told you it was wrong. This is an act that has been prohibited by some authority. The statutory wrong of exceeding a 55mph speed limit is malum prohibitum as speed limits are not part of natural law and they also vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Hunting without a state-issued license or permit is malum prohibitum, as are age restrictions on purchasing alcohol or tobacco.

Burden of Proof

In the judicial system, in order to convict a person of a crime that is malum in se the prosecution needs to establish the elements of the crime. One element is the demonstrated intent to commit said act. Culpable mental states are broken down into the sub-categories of purposeful, knowledgeable, reckless and negligent. The Latin term for a “guilty mind” is mens rea.

To be convicted of the First Degree Murder or Capital Murder, the prosecution must not only establish the fact that A killed B. They must convince the jury that A purposefully killed B and that said killing was either premeditated or committed while A was engaged in other criminal activity. Culpable mental state is the determining factor between First Degree Murder and Justifiable Homicide. If you chat with an attorney they will tell you that most every felonious act or specifically the statutes prohibiting these acts require the establishment of culpable mental state.

Think about it like this, a FedEx driver arrives at your house with a medium-sized box that requires your signature. The package is signed for and you set it down on the table. As you are opening the box your front door is broken down and a police raid team enters. You are shoved to the floor and handcuffed. The detective on scene enters, looks in the box and determines that it contains a kilo of cocaine. You are arrested and charged with felony possession and intent to distribute a controlled narcotic substance.

Your defense is that you did not request, order or purchase the drugs. The prosecution claims that you signed for the package and it was in your home, ergo possession, when an anonymous tip led them to your house. Without the requirement to demonstrate culpable mental state all the prosecution would have to determine was that you were in possession, not how, when, and why. Minus the need to prove “purposeful” and “knowledgeable” mental states you could be convicted and sentenced.

Malum Prohibitum sans Mens Rea

Are there unlawful acts or statutes that do not require mens rea for conviction?

Yes, there are. When I went through the police academy we were taught that traffic violations and most “minor misdemeanors” did not include culpable mental state. We didn’t need to prove that you intended to drive 79mph in a 55mph zone, only that you did.

Why exclude mens rea from a statute? Minor misdemeanors do not have accompanying jail time, just a monetary fine. Is it much easier for the state to get a conviction when mens rea is not required? Most certainly it is.

What about felonies minus mens rea? Is possession of an object in and of itself sufficient evidence to convict a person of a felony charge and incarcerate them for a period greater than one year?

Consider the Connecticut prohibition against certain types of firearms and firearm accessories. Is mere possession, without demonstrated intent, sufficient to convict a person of a felony?

Is malum prohibitum law being used to create criminals where there previously were none? Is the possession of an inanimate object a greater crime that the malum in se crime of murder, robbery or rape?

Colorado’s recent malum prohibitum laws prohibit the ownership of certain type of firearms accessories. On June 30, 2013 you were a lawful citizen. On July 1, 2013 you are a potential criminal. We have nearly the same situation with New York State and their fraudulently named “Safe Act.”

Again, are the states using malum prohibitum to create crime where none existed?

Return to Tyranny

While most Americans can quote you the term “innocent until proven guilty,” few understand that such a concept is not universal. We accept that the “burden of proof” lies squarely with the prosecution and that the state must prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the crime occurred.

Considering the state of affairs here in the colonies, it appears that we are on a fast track back to the day when mere possession equates guilt. The rampant use of malum prohibitum statutes puts the citizen on the defensive and creates “gun criminals” that have no mens rea.

Do the current crop of “gun crime” laws violate the United States Constitution’s protection against ex post facto, or “retroactive” prosecution as laid out in Article 1, Section 9? Are we creating criminals where there were none?

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/definitive-proof-we-need-term-limits-2","Definitive Proof We Need Term Limits","I once moderated a candidate forum in Illinois for a state representative seat where the incumbent was running for his eighth consecutive term and had five challengers.

A question came up asking the candidates whether they supported term limits. The only person who said they didn’t support term limits was the incumbent, stating, “We have term limits, they’re called elections.”

The most recent Pew Research Poll (July 14, 2014) shows that only 28 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of Congress. A recent CNN/ORC International Poll shows that 83 percent disapprove of the job Congress has been doing and 65 percent say this is the “worst Congress of their lifetime.”

With numbers like that one would assume members of Congress would be voted out in droves, right? Wrong.

The best chance to vote out a member of Congress would be in the primaries. Afterall, when the general election comes around Republicans vote Republican and Democrats vote Democrat even if they don’t like the incumbent.

So now that we’ve completed the primaries for this year, how many incumbents were voted out? Suprisingly many of them were unchallenged, but the overall results are as follows:

U.S. Senate: Zero out of 25 races.

U.S. House of Representatives: Four out of 75 races.

The losses were U.S. Reps. John Tierney (D-Mass.), Kerry Bentivolio (R-Mich.), Ralph Hall (R-Texas), Eric Cantor (R-Va.).

That’s right. America thinks Congress is doing a terrible job, yet we voted a whopping 4 percent of the incumbents, who ran, back in. With so much discord, disappointment and dissattisfaction for Congress, how can all of the incuments have been re-elected?

It’s now left up to the swing voters in the general election to do what the political parties didn’t do in the primaries: Vote the bums out. But history also shows that isn’t likely to happen, at least not in droves.

It’s the same story every year and the reason we need term limits. The idea that “elections are term limits” is ridiculous considering this much animosity towards the incumbents yet they all get voted back in.

The only way incumbents get voted back in is if Americans just aren’t paying attention at the polls. Term limits would at least provide turnover which is a start.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/firearm-registration-bill-introduced-in-illinois","Firearm Registration Bill Introduced in Illinois","Illinois State Rep. Kelly M. Cassidy (D-14) introduced a bill on Feb. 5 that would require gun owners to register every gun they own. According to the bill, called the Firearms Registration Act (HB4715), this would not just apply to new purchases but Illinoisans would also need to register guns they already own.

The bill’s synopsis explains [emphasis added]:

“Creates the Firearms Registration Act. Provides that every person in the State must register each firearm he or she owns or possesses in accordance with the Act.”

The bill also takes aim at ammunition ownership and purchases. Illinois residents would have to show proof of firearm registration in order to buy

ammunition [emphasis added]:

“Provides that a person shall not purchase or possess ammunition within this State without having first obtained a registration certificate identifying a firearm that is suitable for use with that ammunition, or a receipt demonstrating that the person has applied to register a suitable firearm under the Act and that the application is pending.”

Failure to comply with the bill would be a Class 2 felony. The penalty for Class 2 felonies in Illinois is three to seven years imprisonment and not more than a $200,000 fine.

In order to own a gun in Illinois, residents already have to apply for and possess a state issued “Firearm Owner’s Identification Card” (FOID). Illinois also just became the last state in the union to pass a concealed carry law. Residents must have a FOID card before they can apply for a concealed carry permit.

Since the concealed carry law passed last summer, the Illinois State Police have been bogged down by FOID card applications and concealed carry applications and even though the law went in to effect in January, the first licenses aren’t expected to be issued until March or April of this year.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/gun-owners-and-the-delusion-of-neutrality-3","Gun Owners and the Delusion of Neutrality","“I’m not right-wing or left-wing, I consider myself more of a centrist,” so said one of my acquaintances during a recent conversation.

That’s not the first time I’ve heard such a statement or similar expression. The truth is that it is far more common for people to say they are a moderate than it is for them to pick a definitive side. We’ve seen this play out for decades as people publicly declare themselves to be “undecided,” “centrist” or “neutral.”

It’s not all that big of a surprise that when pressed to take sides most folks will squirm around and try to stay in the middle or remain neutral. During the last several years I’ve penned articles that discussed the “reasonableness disease.”

People want to be seen as reasonable by their peers so they deliberately avoid choosing sides or they will temper their beliefs with blanket statements such as “well, I can see both sides” or “I’m not saying you’re right or wrong” and the famous “…not that there’s anything wrong with that.”

It’s easy to fall into the moderate or centrist trap. No one wants to be disliked, not even by strangers. People by their very nature crave acceptance and seek to be well-liked. When you pick a side you automatically set yourself up for scorn or ridicule from the opposing faction.

Consider the birth of our nation. Analysts have said that during the years of the American Revolution less than 50 percent of the population embodied outspoken patriots who favored complete separation from Mother England. The vast majority were considered “fence-sitters”. After April 19, 1775, with the bloodshed at Lexington and Concord, there were still members of the Continental Congress who wished to make peace with King George and come to some kind of power-sharing agreement.

It is no secret that the hottest topic on the minds of gun owners across the United States is Second Amendment rights. When the topic of the Second Amendment comes up, I want to reply that I am fond of that entire Bill of Rights, the United States Constitution and the principles upon which this nation was founded, not simply one amendment.

Signs of the “reasonableness disease” have crept into the modern gun culture conversation.

Noted Outdoor Life writer, Jim Zumbo, committed career hari-kari in print a few years ago by referring to the AR-15 as a “terrorist rifle” that had no business in the hunting field. Zumbo went so far as to call for state officials to actively seek to ban the use of certain types of rifles for hunting. Apparently, in Jim’s mind certain guns were acceptable and others were not.

More recently, Dick Metcalf, longtime columnist for Guns & Ammo magazine staged his own public career suicide when he penned a piece detailing the case for “reasonable” restrictions on Second Amendment rights. Many readers were legitimately shocked when Metcalf trotted out the tired, old gun control reasoning that Americans have to get a license to drive a car and compared that to possessing arms. It was not surprising to anyone in the shooting sports community that both Dick and the editor of Guns & Ammo, Jim Bequette, were quickly shown the door. Bequette was allowed to resign.

Both the Zumbo and Metcalf incidents are excellent public examples of gun owners attempting to “fence-sit” or maintain some spurious type of neutrality. Neither man came out as “anti-gun,” they simply tempered their comments to seem reasonable. Both writers were ostensibly stunned at the backlash they received from the community. Predictably, anti-gun politicians and elitists were quick to jump on the comments made by Zumbo and Metcalf to bolster their “reasonable restrictions” arguments.

Many in the gun owning choir have fallen for the simple trap of supporting the ownership of an object as proof of purpose. These people view gun ownership as testimony that they support the Second Amendment. If the ownership of firearms somehow indicated an allegiance to the founding principles of the United States, a strict adherence to the Bill of Rights and U.S. Constitution, there would be no arguments over magazine capacity, pistol grips and folding stocks, government-issued handgun permits, firearms registration, etc.

If 80 million American gun owners stood on purpose and demanded a strict faithfulness to the principles of individual liberty, limited government, and a true republican form of representation, the words “gun control” and “reasonable restrictions” would not exist in our modern political discourse.

For those who might place themselves in the liberal gun-owner camp, and have had the courage to have read this far in the article, I’d offer the following observation.

Claiming to support the Second Amendment while continuing to lend your support and money to parties, politicians and organizations who favor the “collective” and “the state” over the individual liberties of the citizen is the height of intellectual dishonesty. Every election cycle liberal gun owner swallow the lies of “hunting purposes” and “legitimate sporting use.” Those are the moral excuses they use to cover their nose and mask the stench of elitist politicians and the party of ever-expanding government. It is selfish and dishonest, but it makes them sleep a bit better at night.

It is far beyond time to choose a side. You are either on the side of limited government, personal responsibility and individual liberty or you are on the side of unlimited government, the collective mindset and strict limitations on the rights of the citizen, ownership of an object notwithstanding.

The choice of personal liberty is the most difficult as it requires that one accept responsibility for their failures as well as successes. That same path also requires that difficult choices be faced and sacrifices be made. The role of the peasant or comfortable slave is far simpler; declare allegiance to the state and fall in line for the promise of “safety and security.” The choice is currently yours to make, but that may not always be true.

Fence-sitters and those who attempt to appease both sides by being reasonable are of little use in the struggle to maintain God-given rights and liberty. Failing to choose a side does not make you enlightened; it makes you unreliable to either cause.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/your-home-has-been-invaded-and-youve-defended-yourself-heres-what-not-to-do-next","Your Home Has Been Invaded and You’ve Defended Yourself – Here’s What Not To Do Next","Thanks in large part to recent events in Sanford, Florida, the terms “Stand your Ground” and “Castle-Doctrine” have become buzzwords for news stories all across the nation.

It seems that every time there is a self-defense shooting in the United States, writers and editors are quick to pull out the Castle-Doctrine ruler and see if the case measures up.

As with most pop-culture media drives, the more a topic is discussed, the less people seem to understand it. Ask the average person on the street to explain the meaning of “Stand your Ground” or the “Castle-Doctrine” and some will go so far as to tell you the rules give a person license to kill anyone who makes them afraid or nervous, all without consequences.

Some opportunistic anti-gun politicians have used controversial events to try and push for the repeal of “Stand your Ground” statutes, claiming that they promote murder as opposed to saving the life of the innocent.

Other lawmakers, such as Missouri State Rep. Randy Dunn, have even gone so far as to propose bills that would require the victim of an attack to attempt or demonstrate an attempt to retreat before they could lawfully use a firearm to defend themselves.

Yet another high profile self-defense shooting incident has come to the attention of the national media. In Little Falls, Minnesota a retiree, Byron Smith, 65, is on trial for premeditated murder after a shooting incident at his home on Thanksgiving Day 2012.

Smith, the victim of previous break-ins at his home, had armed himself and, in a truly bizarre fashion, had set up recording devices to capture the audio of intruders. On the day in question, Smith used his gun to kill two home invaders; Nick Brady, 17, and Halie Kifer, 18.

In a normal world, when a frightened, elderly homeowner uses a firearm to stop two teenage home invaders from robbing them, the community has a tendency to rally around the victim of the crime. The actions Smith took after he pulled the trigger have all but assured that no member of the Little Falls Community will be rallying to his cause.

A stunned and silent courtroom sat and listened to the audio of Smith firing his gun at Brady and then stating “You’re dead” after the sound of the teen hitting the floor. The next sounds seemed to come straight out of a Hollywood psycho film as Smith moved Brady’s body to a tarp and groaned as he moved it to a work shop to “keep the blood from staining the carpet.”

Kifer came looking for her accomplice and was shot. The recording captured the sound of her body hitting the floor and then Smith saying “Oh, sorry about that.” There were more gun shots and Smith is heard to say “You’re dying” followed by a derogatory name for a woman. Then there was more dragging noise and a final gunshot.

At present, in the United States of America, there are more gun owners than at any time in our history. Of first time gun owners, the vast majority stated the reason for their purchase was either “home defense” or “self-defense.” Of these millions of firearms owners, how many of them truly understand what is required of a citizen in a justifiable self-defense shooting?

Unfortunately, for the vast majority of firearms owners, their training goes no farther than the television or movie screen. Having watched hundreds, if not thousands, of cop dramas or action movies, new gun owners fall into the trap of thinking that Hollywood fiction somehow translates to the real world.

In the firearms training world it has been said that anyone can teach you “how” to shoot. Some instructors will teach you “when” to shoot. However, almost no one talks about the “what now” of a lethal force incident. It is the “what now” part of the equation that can turn a justifiable shooting into a murder charge.

The investigation that follows any lethal force incident will focus on three very important questions. Did the person on the receiving end of the deadly force have the “ability” to do lethal harm to the first party? Did said party have the “opportunity” to do lethal harm? And lastly, but most importantly, did the person demonstrate “intent” to use lethal force?

In short, the justifiable deadly force checklist must include ability, opportunity, and intent on the part of the attacker. Without all three components it is not possible to demonstrate a justifiable use of deadly force.

During the previously discussed Smith case, we have a home owner who is aged and alone versus two young and presumably physically fit attackers. Two young people against one old person is a disparity of force issue in favor of the home invaders. That checks off the “ability” box. The opportunity and intent factors were addressed when the two teenagers forced their way into someone’s home to commit an aggravated burglary (forcibly enter an occupied dwelling in order to commit a theft offense).

The train left the tracks the moment that Smith could no longer demonstrate “fear of death or serious bodily harm.” If Smith had shot Brady and then continued to seek cover from any criminal accomplices he would have remained within the law. Smith’s actions to move the body off of the carpet to prevent blood stains, in addition to being bizarre, does not appear consistent with a person in fear for their life.

The killing of Kifer could only be seen as justified, again, if Smith could testify to being in fear of his life from the second home invader. Smith’s comments after shooting Kifer, and then the follow up shots after Kifer had been heard to hit the floor, do not seem to support the claim of fear for one’s life.

What can be learned from the Little Falls, Minnesota incident? First and foremost, I would offer that any person arming themselves, especially for the first time, should seek out professional training.

Making it up as you go or relying on action movies as your guide are recipes for disaster. Deadly force is only justified if a person can claim fear of death or serious bodily harm from the attacker and the three point ability, opportunity, intent checklist is met.

When the person or persons attacking you cease to be a threat you must stop shooting. “Coup de grace” follow up shots will invariably turn a justifiable shooting into a murder charge.

Lastly, NEVER alter a crime scene. Any deliberate altering of a crime shooting scene that is not done for the purpose of self-defense or survival will be viewed as “tampering” or attempting to conceal the evidence of a crime. For the name of all that is holy, you can buy new carpeting.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/reading-between-the-numbers-where-liberal-policies-fail","Reading Between the Numbers: Where Liberal Policies Fail","The state of Illinois is in a fiscal mess.

Recent reports show that Illinois leads the nation in out-migration of residents, leads the nation in having the most taxing districts, ranks second with the highest property taxes, consistently ranks in the top 10 for the most tax burden, and the Mercatus Center at George Mason University have Illinois’ fiscal condition rank as 48th in the nation.

The rankings are justified considering Illinois is the state with the lowest credit rating and over $5 billion in unpaid bills.

On Jan. 1, 2011 a 67 percent state income tax increase went in to affect for Illinois residents. The tax increase was meant to pay down the backlog of unpaid bills (then over $6 billion) and help pay nearly $4 billion in missed payments for the underfunded state pension system. The 67 percent tax increase was also meant to be temporary and should expire at the end of 2014.

Many are speculating that legislators will extend the tax increase because bills are still high. At the same time, there is also a push by independent groups within the state to change the state income tax rate from its current “flat tax” to a “progressive tax” that would set a higher tax rate for those with higher incomes.

Advocates for both extending the tax increase and for the progressive income tax both say that Illinois doesn’t have enough revenue to fix the state’s financial problems. “More revenue,” of course, is a non-threatening way to say “raise taxes.” Other liberal states like California, New York and New Jersey have similar storylines as Illinois with similar groups advocating for more revenue.

Using data from census.gov, we can clearly see how liberal-leaning states are not only the ones failing but also the ones already leading in revenue. This chart was color coded to show the most liberal-leaning states highlighted in “red” and the states with no state personal income tax highlighted in “green.”

When you look at the chart you can see that the “population” of the liberal-leaning states varies, so this isn’t an issue only affecting the most populated states. The next column for “fiscal score,” which comes from the Mercatus Center, is heavily “red” at the bottom, showing that most of the liberal-leaning states rank poorly with fiscal issues.

The next two columns show that the liberal-leaning states also pay the most taxes per person. When you look at the state revenue per person and compare it to their fiscal score it’s interesting to see that the green states (those with no state personal income tax) have the lowest state revenue per person, but at the same time they have top fiscal scores!

The one area where the liberal-leaning states aren’t at the bottom is in sales tax revenue per person. Yet these states don’t have lower sales tax rates, they just don’t have as many people buying products. Their economies are not moving as much as states that don’t have personal income tax!

An extra column was added to show where the states rank as it pertains to state legislator pay. This was based on salaries only as reported on Ballotpedia.com and does not include per diem. Interestingly the liberal-leaning states (that have more revenue per person, that pay more taxes per person, that have less people buying products, and have poor financial conditions) have the highest paid legislators!

The one exception is with the state of New Hampshire. New Hampshire is a liberal-leaning state as far as their voting record, however, the state doesn’t have state personal income tax and the legislature only gets paid $200 per two year term. They broke the liberal mold and consistently rank along with more conservative states in all areas.

Unfortunately, the liberal policies that have plagued Illinois and other liberal-leaning states are continually being implemented on the national level. How long before the entire nation begins to feel the full brunt of these policies? How long can we go without paying attention to the numbers?

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/one-self-deportation-policy-that-could-help-border-crisis","One Self-Deportation Policy That Could Help Border Crisis","When we consider the concerns with immigrants entering into the country illegally, the most urgent is preventing terrorists from entering the country undetected.

The vast majority of illegal immigrants are not coming here with malicious intent. However, despite their good intentions they are indeed putting a burden on the country. More importantly, the overwhelming volume crossing the border illegally makes it nearly impossible to find, catch and deal with the few malicious terrorists.

Whenever solutions are discussed, many Americans believe that increasing border security will stem or even stop the flow of migrants illegally entering the country. Although increasing border security would indeed help, it is not an end-all solution. Even the Berlin Wall, possibly the most secure border of our modern day, still had an estimated 5,000 people who illegally crossed the border and official records show 136 people died attempting to cross.

Sure, 5,000 people over a 29-year span sounds like a relief compared to our problem today, but the Berlin Wall was only 96 miles compared to our southern border of nearly 2,000 miles!

We do need more border security, but is there a more efficient way to stem the tide of migrants flowing in to the country? The answer is yes, and the good news is we already have the system in place: E-Verify.

E-Verify originated in 1997 and is a free system where employers can verify through the internet that their new employees are indeed citizens or legal workers. Although initially set up as a voluntary system, individual states have passed legislation requiring employers to use it.

The program has been effective in preventing companies from hiring illegal immigrants, but many migrants work around E-Verify by working as independent contractors, running their own business or even by working out a deal to get paid in cash under the table.

Using E-Verify for hiring – by itself – is not a big enough deterrent. If we expanded this system to include those enrolling in our publicly funded schools, those who want to buy houses, rent houses or buy cars from car dealerships, then how many people would still be willing to risk coming here illegally?

When E-Verify began, many companies were hesitant to participate in the program because a 2009 audit showed that it only had a 58 percent accuracy rating. However, the 2012 audit showed vast improvement with a 90 percent accuracy rating. Even more important to note than the accuracy rating is the effectiveness a policy like this would have as a deterrent.

A few years ago, the state of Alabama attempted to pass a law that would only allow legal residents to be able to enroll in public schools. Before the law was blocked by a federal judge, a mass exodus began of illegal immigrants from Alabama.

What parent would seriously consider coming to America if their children couldn’t attend public schools? How many people would risk coming here if they couldn’t buy a house, rent property or buy reliable transportation?

Overall, E-Verify expansion would address two issues: It would slow down the massive influx of illegal immigrants coming into the country and it would be the answer for identifying the millions of those that already here. If E-Verify expanded, many illegal immigrants already here in America would start looking for coyotes to help them get back to their country of origin.

Expanding E-Verify in this manner would still have the MAJOR obstacle of overcoming the oft-cited Supreme Court ruling Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982). This ruling has been used recently by the Obama Administration to support illegals attending our public schools.

Assuming this ruling could be addressed, a “comprehensive immigration plan” would still need to prioritize rebuilding our legal immigration system and would need to include revised procedures pertaining to border security. Revising those procedures would be easier considering Border Patrol agents would now know that those attempting to cross the border would either be adults only coming here for work without their children, drug dealers or terrorists.

No more unaccompanied minors, no more families making excuses to break the law because they “just want a better life for their kids,” no more breaking up families, no more excessive burden on Border Patrol, and no more tax dollars paying for the schooling of non-legal residents.

Like border security, expanding E-Verify is also not the end-all solution. It would make it easier to address border security, allow us to concentrate on improving our legal immigration system and make it easier to stop terrorists from entering the country.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/pennsylvania-supreme-court-clears-the-way-for-police-to-search-vehicles-without-warrant","Pennsylvania Supreme Court Clears the Way for Police to Search Vehicles Without Warrant","“If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear” are some of the most chilling words ever spoken. Those words, having been uttered in German, Russian, Spanish, and various Chinese dialects, are finding their way into our modern English conversation.

Throughout history the “nothing to hide, nothing to fear” reasoning was used in the Grossdeutsches Reich (Greater German Reich), the United Soviet Socialist Republic, and numerous totalitarian states to make a reasonable argument for the arbitrary invasion of home and privacy committed by the state.

The idea that the state would put forth the reasonable excuse of “if you have nothing to hide you should have nothing to fear” is not a product of modern times. The founders of the United States understood the tendency of the government to cloak their tyrannical actions in that seeming innocuous rationale.

In the Virginia Declaration of Rights, June 12, 1776, the author, George Mason, warns in Section 10:

“That general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted.”

For those who went to public school during the last 20 years, June 12, 1776 pre-dates the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.

On April 29, 2014 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in a 4-2 decision, ruled that police officers no longer need to obtain a warrant to search a motor vehicle and that only an officer’s “probable cause” was needed.

Justice Seamus McCaffery supported the decision by stating Pennsylvania will now follow a “uniform standard for a warrantless search of a motor vehicle, applicable in federal and state court, to avoid unnecessary confusion, conflict and inconsistency in this often-litigated area.”

McCaffery’s opinion of the case was not shared by all of the justices. While offering a dissenting opinion, Justice Debra McCloskey-Todd stated that the court’s decision “heedlessly contravenes over 225 years of unyielding protection against unreasonable search and seizure which our people have enjoyed as their birthright.”

Apparently Todd and the other justice who voted against the decision have read the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Section Eight of the Pennsylvania Constitution is entitled Security from Searches and Seizures and reads as follows:

“The people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation subscribed by the affiant.”

As for the United States Constitution, Amendment 4 specifically states:

“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”

I believe we can see a distinct pattern here when considering the Virginia Declaration of Rights, and both the Pennsylvania and United State Constitutions. The founders of this nation understood that for the people to maintain individual liberty a bulwark had to be put into place to restrict the government from searching and seizing persons and property at merely at their will.

The current situation in Pennsylvania brings us right back to the original concept that those who are not guilty should have nothing to hide. When confronted by a headline such as “Pennsylvania Cops No Longer Need a Warrant to Search Citizen’s Vehicles,” many Americans will cling to the justification that if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear. Some would even go so far as to imply that the existence of a criminal element in our society justifies ignoring or circumventing the Constitution. That a sitting judge would lean in such a direction is a direct cause for concern.

To that previous way of thinking I would pose the question; “How have we managed to charge, arrest, try and convict law-breakers for the last 200 years with that pesky Bill of Rights in place?” If the laws restricting the actions of the state are such an impediment, how have we survived as a nation without devolving to a condition of criminal anarchy?

As to the specific question of vehicle searches during a traffic stop, when I attended the police academy in 1991 we underwent 40 hours of state and constitutional law education. We learned all about probable cause and reasonable articulable suspicion and how to express those in spoken or written form.

During a traffic stop, an officer was allowed to search the area of a vehicle that came under direct control of the driver if they had probable cause to believe that a crime may have occurred. The trunk/storage area, passenger compartment, engine compartment, etc. could not be searched unless A) consent was given by the owner/operator of the vehicle or B) a search warrant was issued by a judge or magistrate.

That standard has been in place for decades and police officers have managed to arrest thousands of criminals as a of lawful traffic stops.

For those who are still living in the “nothing to hide, nothing to fear” camp, I’d offer the example of Boston, Massachusetts in April 2013 in the aftermath of the terrorist bombing at the Marathon.

Scores of armed employees of the state violated their oaths to the Constitution of Massachusetts, specifically Article 14, and the U.S. Constitution when they forcibly conducted hundreds, if not thousands, of warrantless searches of private homes to hunt for a “suspect at large.”

Folks, there will always be a criminal element in society. At this very moment in time, as you read this article, there are unsolved thefts, rapes, robberies and/or murders in your community. That means there are “suspects at large” who have not yet been arrested.

If you support the current trend in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts then we might as well discard the laws that hinder the state and put our lives and our liberty squarely into the hands of those in power.

Surely if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. Papers, please.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/the-anti-gun-anti-violence-approach-isnt-working","The Anti-Gun, Anti-Violence Approach Isn’t Working","Evil abounds in this world. It always has and always will. The great question for those who oppose evil has ever been the method of that opposition.

On Friday April 25, 2014 the rampant evil of out-of-control gang violence took the life of Leonore Draper in the West Pullman area of Chicago, Illinois In a city that measures bloodshed by the barrel, the names of the dead rarely receive any national attention.

The Draper killing has garnered interest outside of “Chicagoland” due to the extreme irony of her murder. Draper, a community activist, was heavily involved in the “anti-violence” group Project Orange Tree.

Members of CeaseFire, a similar “anti-violence” group spoke out about the killing and went door-to-door in Draper’s neighborhood. CeaseFire Illinois has a questionable success record according to Chicago Police. The group closed some offices last year after the leader of the organization was arrested and charged with domestic violence and they had spent the $1 million grant given them by the city of Chicago.

Draper was just returning home from a fund raiser to fight gun violence when she was apparently caught in the crossfire of a gang dispute. She was shot while sitting in her car and pronounced dead at the hospital soon after.

Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy stated that the police were still searching for suspects in the killing. McCarthy is an outspoken proponent of strict gun control and has spoken out against Illinois recently enacted concealed carry permit law. After yet another rash of violence in Chicago on Easter weekend, McCarthy took to the local airwaves and called for increased gun control measures in addition to those already in place.

There are numerous stories on the newswire detailing the Draper murder. What is missing in each and every one is the cold, hard truth that despite the fact that Cook County, Illinois and by extension Chicago already have the strictest gun control laws in the United States (the only city to come close is Washington, D.C.) last year Chicago took the crown for Murder Capital of the United States.

Gun control proponents like Garry McCarthy and Michael Bloomberg bolster their arguments with unsupported affirmations that the answer to violent behavior is gun prohibition. The inconvenient truth is that gun control does indeed have a definite affect on violence. It ensures that it will increase.

In his book “More Guns, Less Crime” economist John R. Lott, Jr. conducted exhaustive research that showed a definitive link between the number of lawful concealed carry permit holders and the reduction of violent crime in the areas studied. Lott’s book has been available to the public, which includes McCarthy and Bloomberg, since 1998.

A thoughtful person might consider the fact that both Chicago and Washington, D.C. have vied against each other for the titles of “Most Gun Control” and “Murder Capital” simultaneously. How can it be that seemingly educated adults cannot see the writing on the wall? Are “anti-violence” groups and organizations deliberately missing the point in order to promote the prohibition of an inanimate object as the answer to the problem?

Superintendent McCarthy has made much of the fact that Chicago Police has taken more “illegal guns” off the streets than any other city. One might wonder what makes a gun “illegal.” Does the gun have a predisposition toward malice or bad behavior? Can we follow on this type of thinking and make the case that drunk driving could be reduced if we could just remove more “illegal automobiles” or “illegal alcohol” from the streets?

If we accept that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result, we can clearly see that the Chicago is held in a death grip of insanity.

Anti-gun and anti-violence groups have fallen for the progressive liberal trap of exempting human beings from their own actions. It would seems that “violence” is some abstract concept, not at all the responsibility of human criminals. For many, the term “violence” is offered as you would the words “cancer” or “virus,” as though the host has been infected through no fault of their own.

Anti-violence groups are quick to point out that socio-economic factors are to blame for out-of-control violence in their communities. Oddly enough, those responsible for the economy, progressive liberal politicians, are given a free pass.

Consider Detroit, Michigan, a city that makes 1980s Beirut seem tame by comparison. For four decades the voters of Detroit went to the polls and elected progressive liberal Democrats. Though the Motor City had been in steady decline since the late 1970s, losing manufacturing jobs by the thousands, a steady rise in crime and rampant drug use, voters continued to do the same thing expecting a different result. Kwame Kilpatrick, mayor from 2002 to 2008 is currently serving a 28-year prison sentence on multiple corruption charges.

Apparently 40 years was enough for the remaining good people of Detroit. The voters of Detroit elected Mike Duggan, a successful business man, as a write-in candidate in 2013. Detroit’s citizens have also stood firmly behind their new Chief of Police, James Craig. Craig, in a departure from most every other large city police chief, has come out in favor of the armed citizen. Craig publicly recommended that the best solution to violent crime in Detroit was for the people to arm themselves.

When it comes to addressing the reality of evil in our world we have two examples of how to deal with it. The Chicago model for dealing with evil seems to be demonize an inanimate object, issue public grant to community organizers and disassociate “violence” from the criminal vermin responsible for it.

Detroit has altered its previous path by embracing a pro-business mayor who is seeking to return the city to some semblance of normalcy. The Motor City, once the murder capital of America, has no intention of retaking the crown. Members of the Detroit Police Department, rather than seek guns bans or make excuses for the criminal element have boldly stated to them that “your time is up.”

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/taking-on-the-future-with-a-gun-in-hand","Taking on the Future With a Gun in Hand","At 6 a.m. the camp starts to come to life. The adult instructors move quietly and deliberately toward the lodge where coffee is sure to be found. Campers roll out of their beds and shuffle to the showers before the call to breakfast.

Take a casual glance at the morning routine at Canter’s Cave 4-H Camp and you would think it is no different than the hundreds of other summer camps operating throughout the United States. Traditional camp activities abound; leather crafts, swimming, nature hikes, and basketball.

The illusion of the ordinary is shattered sometime around 9 a.m. when the sound of gunfire begins to echo through the valley. Nearly 200 young people from Ohio and a few surrounding states take to the numerous ranges to learn safe and effective use of pistols, rifles, shotguns and the quieter bows and arrows.

Participants in the Shooting Education Camp are growing up not simply with guns in their homes, they are fully immersed in the firearms culture and they learn to excel at the various shooting sports. These fortunate teens spend an entire week under the professional tutelage of volunteer adult mentors. They talk about shells and gauges, caliber and actions, arrows and fletching, but the 4-H Shooting Education Camp is not just about guns and targets, it is about youth development.

Were you to acquiesce to left-wing hysteria you might believe that these teens would grow into dangerous sociopaths. Through this article I would like to present solid evidence to the contrary.

The 4-H Shooting Education Camp in Ohio has been ongoing for 17 years and the young people who took part in the first few camps are all grown up, graduated from college, many are married and most all are well into their careers.

For this piece we took the time to catch up with several young adults who are 4-H Shooting Sports alumnus, one of whom was even at the very first camp held in 1998. We posed the question to them: How did the 4H Shooting Sports program benefit you as you transitioned from youth to adulthood?

Here is what they had to say:

“4-H Shooting Sports has not only taught me about responsibility – a great life skill – but also caused me to meet many great people. I learned solid communication skills from meeting and socializing with these people which I believe has helped me excel in college and now my career.” – Benjamin Harris, 24, Engineer “I am the person I am today because of the life skills that I learned through 4-H Shooting Sports. I have learned to become a responsible, hardworking and confident young lady which has allowed me to succeed in starting my own business. The people that I have met along the way have inspired me to branch out and try new things, reach for my dreams and enjoy life to the fullest. They are not only my friends but my family.” – Stacy Moore, 27, Owner of Swift Manufacturing “4-H Shooting Sports taught me many important traits they have helped me in my life. I learned about persevering through adversity and dealing with failure. I learned about the importance of dedication to a craft. I also learned how a caring adult can interact with children in a positive way.” – Scott Elliott, 27, Scholastic Sports Supervisor “My transition from youth to adulthood was immeasurably influenced by my involvement in the 4-H Shooting Sports program. No other program I could find in my community could come close to giving me the opportunities I had for close mentorship with adult volunteers, the chance to take on leadership roles and develop public speaking skills. I learned persistence, hard work, problem solving, patience, determination, concentration, mental toughness… and the courage to confront problems head on instead of giving up. I first saw the benefits of that in college and they have been following me ever since.” – Meredith Briski, 32, Human Resources Manager

It was not all that difficult to catch up with some 4-H Shooting Sport alumnus. The annual Shooting Education Camp is not just an event; it is a kind of family reunion. The dedication of the young people now grown and the older volunteers would be the envy of any Fortune 500 company.

All of the young adults who were gracious enough to provide insight into their Shooting Sports experience were at the 2014 Senior Shooting Education Camp volunteering as instructors and mentors. They have come full circle from pupil to teacher.

Many of the adult volunteer instructors who initially got involved with the program over 15 years ago to get their kids interested are still active in the program despite the fact that their own kids have long since outgrown it.

From boys and girls to men and women, these 4-H Shooting Sports alumni grew up with guns in their hands and fulfilled the goal of the program by becoming productive and responsible citizens. Sorry, mainstream media: There is not one sociopath among them.

Taking an honest assessment of the state of the union, we could use a million more young people just like these.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/immigration-the-lefts-fundamental-transformation-of-the-nation","Immigration: The Left’s ‘Fundamental Transformation of the Nation’","So. The Democrats are in freefall. Their “landmark” legislation, Obamacare, rammed through without a single Republican vote, is in collapse. The president has been exposed as a liar (see: “If you like your health plan, you can keep it. Period.”) His poll numbers are tanking, from job approval to competency to trustworthiness to personal likeability.

The poll numbers for the Democrat party are in the gutter as well, with the Republican party now pulling ahead on the generic ballot. Democrats are fleeing the scene of their own accident, refusing to be seen with the president and distancing themselves from the wreck that is Obamacare.

In other words, the Democrats are on the run, vulnerable, weak, and poised for a major defeat.

[sharequote align=”center”]Are they going for the jugular, attacking nonstop until the election? Of course not.[/sharequote]

So what are the Republicans doing? Are they going for the jugular, attacking nonstop until the election, and showing no mercy? In other words, acting like Democrats…

Of course not. They’re Republicans. They are stepping in to help the Dems out.

Instead of pounding Obamacare, the president, and the Democrats with the facts of an atrocious stab at socialized medicine and the lies they’ve used to push it, the GOP appears ready to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by switching gears to the highly polarizing issue of immigration. Never mind that immigration doesn’t even score more than 2 percent in polls asking what the most important issue is to the country. Rather than let this sleeping dog lie (at least through November), the Republican leadership is jumping to the assistance of the Democrats by supporting amnesty.

Remember this CRITICAL POINT: For Obama and the Left, no issue is about the stated issue. It’s ALWAYS about something bigger and more profound….namely, as Obama put it in 2008, “the fundamental transformation of the nation.”

So, for the Left, health care “reform” was never about health care or health insurance. It was only and always about using the huge health care sector (one-sixth of the U.S. economy) as a lever to transform the broader economy into a European-style socialist model.

For one simple reason: if the government controls your health care, the government controls you. Obamacare was never about your health care. It was about government power and control.

And so it is with immigration “reform.” For Obama and the Left, it’s not about actually dealing forcefully and effectively with the immigration issue. If that were the case, the administration would be faithfully enforcing the laws we have on the books. It is not. They seek this “reform” for one simple reason: because immigration is the final missing piece of the “fundamental transformation of the nation.”

If they can get amnesty for 12 million (who knows what the real number is? 12 million? 18 million? 30 million?) illegals, they know they’ve got the country in a headlock.

Most Hispanics are natural Democrat voters. Not all, obviously. Many believe in hard work, individual liberty, economic liberty, and obeying the law. But the majority vote Democrat, and the party has been working hard to lock them into government dependency.

If amnesty goes through, the Democrats will flood the zone with millions of more Democrat voters, possibly flip Texas blue, and get their long sought-after permanent Democrat voting majority. If that happens, you will never again see a Ronald Reagan or a George W. Bush. You may never again see a GOP majority in Congress. The Republicans will be relegated to permanent minority status. And a shrinking one at that.

This is the goal of the Democrats.

Why on earth would Republicans want to help them achieve it? Because they think they’ll be “rewarded” by Hispanic voters? That didn’t happen after the 1986 amnesty. In fact, the percentage of Hispanics voting GOP actually went DOWN after that amnesty. To take the issue off the table? Forget it. As soon as the path to amnesty is in place, Democrats will accelerate the process to get them voting as fast as possible, so the “issue” will never be off the table for Republicans.

Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, Organizing for Action, George Soros, Eva Longoria and everyone else on the extreme Left must be laughing out loud at the pure, destructive stupidity of the Republicans. They’ve got the Democrats on the ropes, and they’re throwing them a lifeline.

While strangling themselves right out of existence.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/dude-benghazi-is-so-yesterday-3","Dude, Benghazi is . . . so Yesterday.","Once upon a time, there was a country of decent and hardworking people who trusted their elected politicians. Sometimes this turned out to be not-such-a-good idea.

Case in point: when Prince Hope-n-Change (with his charming smile and adorable Dumbo ears) was elected to the presidency of his country. Accompanied by his lovely wife (who had just become proud of her country for the first time) he moved into our White House with his fellow travelers: radical-progressive-hoops shooting-hem kissers who constantly fed his Chicago-sized ego.

Prince Hope-n-Change’s minions knew that, to protect their cushy White House jobs, they would be required to protect the Prince and his job. No leadership failure was ever to be his fault . . . even when it was.

Then, a national tragedy occurred on Sept. 11, 2012. The American consulate in Libya was attacked by Al Qaeda affiliated terrorists. Four brave Americans were killed. Was this the fault of incompetency in the White House or the Department of State? No! It was nobody’s fault, it just happened.

A spontaneous evening stroll turned into a spontaneous protest which turned into a spontaneous rocket attack and the spontaneous deaths of four Americans.

The hem kissers in the White House immediately realized that if the truth was revealed about how four Americans’ were abandoned and murdered, this could cause Prince Hope-n-Change to lose his bid for reelection.

As a result, they, along with all the overpaid and underqualified advisors, speech writers, photographers, secretaries, makeup artists, dog walkers, and food tasters would lose their cushy jobs and be forced to work in the real world. Worst of all, their goal of shoving America toward fundamental transformation (destruction) would be delayed or possibly thwarted.

As the facts from the ground came rolling in, it became obvious that cleverly written talking points were needed to divert negative attention away from the Prince. Who better for this creative writing task than Lil’ Tommy, official spokesman for the National Security Council?

Drawing on hours of political experience and his college training in fiction writing, Lil’ Tommy rewrote the events of Benghazi. White House spokespeople echoed his fictional scenario, word for word, on multiple radio, television, and press outlets. Pretty soon it became old news, ignored by the media lapdogs.

However, a small but dogged core of reporters and Judicial Watchdogs knew that Americans were being bamboozled, big time. They began to dig for the truth, and thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, they received (after 18 months) a few of the governmental emails transmitted during and immediately after the attack.

These exposed Lil’ Tommy’s involvement in the creation of monumentally false and misleading talking points.

A well-respected reporter conducted a revealing video interview with Lil’ Tommy. The video was supposed to have been destroyed . . . but, instead, it was leaked to the press.

REPORTER: As spokesperson for the National Security Council, you were responsible for the revised talking points regarding the Benghazi tragedy. Is that correct? For example, you substituted the word “protest” for the word “attack.” Is that correct? And then, you helped rewrite the entire scenario to blame a YouTube video for causing the protest in the first place. Is that correct?

LIL’ TOMMY: Like Dude, my job was to provide clarity for everybody who speaks for the White House. Accurate, clear and upbeat. Gotta’ make sure all Americans know the president’s team is workin’ 24/7 to serve, protect, and inform.

REPORTER: Nice slogan, did you write it?

LIL’ TOMMY: Yuppidy doo dah, I did.

REPORTER: Any others we might remember?

LIL’ TOMMY: My personal favorite was “Bin Laden is dead. GM is alive. Al Qaeda’s on the run.” One. Two. Three. All happy news.

REPORTER: We lost four brave Americans in an attack on our consulate in Benghazi. And, so far, nobody has been held responsible for the gross leadership failures that allowed this to occur.

LIL’ TOMMY: Dude, those are down, down, downer words.

REPORTER: Truth is not always happy news. The loved ones left behind, as well as the American people, want to know why four Americans died. Don’t we owe them the truth?

LIL’ TOMMY: Dude, it’s like, ancient history, right? What difference does it make if a bunch of guys were out walking and decided to blow off a little steam to celebrate the anniversary of 9/11. Since MacDonald’s was closed, they headed for the consulate. It just got out of hand, that’s all.

REPORTER: Guys out for a walk carry rocket launchers?

LIL’ TOMMY: Hey, Libya’s a dangerous country, you know. Lions, tigers, and bears and all that. Well, maybe not bears. Everybody carries weapons.

REPORTER: There were real time reports from the ground while the consulate was under attack. Despite repeated requests for assistance, no one responded. Where was the president? In the situation room?

LIL’ TOMMY: Ah, no, not really.

REPORTER: Where was he?

LIL’ TOMMY: Don’t know. I wasn’t his baby sitter. It’s a big building. He wasn’t wearing a tracker. Maybe he was, like, rehearsing teleprompter speeches for his campaign trip to Vegas.

REPORTER: Was Secretary of State Clinton in the situation room?

LIL’ TOMMY: Ah, no, not really.

REPORTER: Where was she?

LIL’ TOMMY: Don’t know. For sure, I didn’t baby sit her. Geez! She’s older than my grandmother.

REPORTER: So, to clarify. After the Benghazi consulate attack by mortar and rocket fire, you were called in to make “stylistic adjustments” to the talking points that were presented live on five Sunday morning TV talk shows. Is that correct?

LIL’ TOMMY: Dude, I guess. It’s been two years, I don’t remember the exact flow of events.

REPORTER: Actually, it’s been 20 months. Who requested you to make stylistic adjustments to the talking points?

LIL’ TOMMY: Sorry dude, can’t remember exactly who.

REPORTER: Hmmm. One more thing. Writing factual talking points on behalf of the President of the United States is an important job for an experienced communicator. You graduated college with a degree in . . . political science?

LIL’ TOMMY: Ah no, not really. Fiction. I earned a Master’s Degree in fiction. But . . . but . . . I learned tons of stuff about press releases and talking points from listening to the reporters when I drove the Obama press bus in 2008.

REPORTER: Interesting. Your training and background is in writing fiction, which by definition, has no basis in fact.

LIL’ TOMMY: Aw c’mon Dude. Don’t go there.

REPORTER: Just to clarify. In this situation where an American consulate was attacked and four Americans were killed, you revised the reality of the situation to divert blame away from the president and the Secretary of State. And, your words of fiction, which had no resemblance to the truth of the situation, grossly misled the public.

LIL’ TOMMY: That’s harsh Dude. You’re hurting my feelings.

REPORTER: Cut it out. Stop crying. Take your thumb out of your mouth. We’re on camera.

CUT. CUT. CUT.

The end of this story, but perhaps the beginning of another one: the true story about Benghazi.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/its-the-climate-of-propaganda-that-should-worry-americans-2","It’s the Climate of Propaganda That Should Worry Americans","“Global Warming.” “Climate change.” “Global weirding.” “Climate disruption.”

The terms are unavoidable as news stories that deploy them. The American media love nothing more than claiming weather events are part of some greater pattern – whether they are or not.

With President Barack Obama’s latest climate push, journalists are once more linking every random weather happening they can find and saying, “See!” with a giant I-told-you-so look on their faces.

They aren’t covering the story, they are acting like the bearded lunatic on the street corner holding a sign saying, “The End Is Near!” Instead, they parrot the White House saying: “It is already happening.” It sounds almost like a bad movie trailer.

The broadcast networks helped the White House climate push leading up to the release of the report, as the report was released and after it. No analysis. No journalist sat there and tried to poke holes in the assessments. No one was pointing out that the previous predictions have been wrong. And the only criticism came from liberal journalists wondering what took Obama so long.

They aren’t news people, they are propagandists.

Leading up to the event, CBS “This Morning” co-host Norah O’Donnell dwelled on “the potential risk to Americans.” Co-host Gayle King warned: “The Obama administration says climate change is hurting Americans and the pain will get worse.”

As the saying goes, “no pain, no gain.” The gain for the White House is obvious. It gets a crisis – one of those you can’t let go to waste. It gets tons of totally supportive media attention on something that doesn’t involve dead ambassadors or the IRS treating the Constitution like it, too, is dead and gone. The Obama administration gets an issue it can run on, complete with a pre-gift from Democrat funder Tom Steyer of $100 million or more.

What it doesn’t get are pesky questions. It gets days of press releases.

The night of May 6, when the report was released, ABC, CBS and NBC treated the story like it was the greatest story ever told. CBS included three separate segments on the tragedy of climate change from droughts to flooding.

“No region of the country will be spared,” said Major Garrett. Sadly, that’s true about the media coverage, as well.

ABC correspondent Ginger Zee bragged that Obama had asked her a question. Like Ohmagawd! He spoke to her!

“The President actually asked me a question. He wanted to know which storm was the worst that I had ever covered.”

That would have to be the current snow job she and others are giving the American public on climate.

NBC was the worst. Correspondent Peter Alexander did a region-by-region breakdown for the whole country. Only NBC, which loves manipulating important video, spun what it reported. The network interviewed Vermont maple producer Burr Morse and quoted him complaining about how warm it had been at night and how that made it tough to get the syrup.

Only that wasn’t what he said. Morse actually complained it had been so cold (remember the polar vortex?) that he couldn’t tap the trees until April. By then, it was too warm. Morse was livid, saying NBC had selected a short sample of his full remarks to “support their point which was global warming.”

Morse’s anecdote was telling because it showed how far journalists will go to twist an event into an agenda. We’ve been told for years that no single weather event can be linked to climate. Now that’s out the window as networks grab news clips from random events to create an entirely bogus trend.

Remember this? The World Meteorological Organisation was quoted by Greenpeace’s Energydesk: “No single weather episode can prove or disprove global climate change.”

OK, if that wasn’t good enough, there’s this, from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. It’s run by the liberal Pew Center’s founder and former president Eileen Claussen. They say the same thing, “no single weather event can be linked directly to a long-term driver, such as global warming.”

Now none of that matters. Journalists are on the climate beat, so named because it’s the issue they and the liberals intend to beat the American public with till we scream, “Uncle Al.”

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/atheists-call-for-booing-public-mockery-and-ridicule-of-prayer-2","Atheists Call for ‘Booing, Public Mockery and Ridicule’ of Prayer","In an unhinged response to Monday’s Supreme Court decision in Greece v. Galloway – which reaffirmed Americans’ First Amendment right to public prayer, to include sectarian prayer – the always entertaining Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) has announced its retaliatory “path forward” for Christ-haters.

Saul Alinsky would be proud.

On its website, the Christophobic FFRF, headquarter in Madison, Wisconsin, posted a member essay calling the High Court’s decision, “disastrous for state-church separation,” and frantically warned, “This decision could be the equivalent of Dred Scott or Plessy for our [anti-Christian] cause.”

The Supreme Court’s infamous Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson decisions, of course, upheld slavery and racial segregation respectively. This is richly ironic considering that groups like the FFRF, the ACLU, People for the American Way and others, are simply anti-Christian segregationist organizations that exist for the sole purpose of segregating Christians and Christianity from any public forum.

“In light of yesterday’s dreadful ruling, we, and all activists, will have to fight harder and smarter,” declared the screed. “We will need to lodge more complaints, write more letters, conduct more protests, and bring more lawsuits. No matter how long it takes, Greece v. Galloway must be overturned.”

The essay brazenly called for “mockery” of God, summoning atheists to infiltrate any public forum that might open in prayer, and to then “voice disapproval…by booing, making thumbs down gestures, blowing a raspberry, or by making other audible sounds signifying disapproval. …”

“Citizens may also abruptly walk out of government proceedings and then make an auspicious re-entry as soon as the prayer has ended,” suggested the group.

The stated goal? “Public mockery and ridicule” of Jesus Christ and all Christians.

The FFRF post concluded:

“If after the above actions have been taken, the government continues to insult atheists and/or religious minorities with sectarian prayers, activists may turn to public mockery and ridicule. One example is the ‘prayer mockery hat.’ Activist can easily make a brightly colored hat with large ear muffs and dark sunglasses. Wording on the cap could say: ‘I OBJECT TO PRAYER!’ Then, as soon as the pastor or chaplain has been introduced, activists can put on their ‘prayer mockery hat’ with exaggeration and then remain seated throughout the prayer, completely ignoring the pastor until finished. Activists can also mount a small GoPro-style camera to their cap to record the response for posting on Facebook or Youtube.com. “In spite of the disastrous ruling, the fight is not over. We must not submit to this subjugation of our constitutional right to be free FROM unwanted religious intrusion by government. Indeed, ‘Nothing Fails Like Prayer.'”

Still think there’s no left-wing war on Christianity?

Think again.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/have-you-noticed-the-lefts-destruction-of-freedom-of-speech","Have You Noticed the Left’s Destruction of Freedom of Speech?","Conservative viewpoints are being framed as out of the mainstream, out of touch and at worst hate-speech in Obama’s America. The American left, with a good deal of help from the biased press, is succeeding at almost criminalizing speech.

Have you noticed how successful Christian business-building brothers were denied a TV show on HGTV for believing that marriage is between a man and a woman?

Did you notice how Tim Tebow was savaged by the sports and mainstream press for his Christian beliefs? Yet, the Michael Sam pick by the Saint Louis Rams was heralded by ESPN as the most memorable moment of the 2014 draft? With apologies to the others who were drafted of course.

I thought the goal was for our fellow citizens in the gay community to be treated like everyone else, not set apart for special adulation because they are gay.

Have you noticed that if one embraces the THEORY that man is the driving force behind changing global temperatures, one is considered a hero? But if one embraces the THEORY that the sun has more to do with global temperatures, the left-wing biased press labels one an idiot?

Have you noticed how the Catholic church’s teaching that abortion is immoral is now considered torture by the United Nations? At the same time however, Harvard was ready to host a “Black Mass,” and few “tolerant” liberals batted an eye.

I’m forced to wonder if a slap in the face to Islam would be tolerated on college campuses as readily as this slight to Catholics was embraced by Godless progressives.

Have you noticed that Brandeis University denied an honorary degree to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman who underwent genital mutilation under Islamic doctrine? All the while The Council on American-Islamic Relations insists that the terms “Jihadist” and “Islamist Extremism” be removed from the Sept. 11 museum?

Have you noticed that the left’s agenda really isn’t equality? Have you noticed that in Obama’s liberal utopia that more and more of us are not allowed to have differing views? Have you noticed that the collectivist mind-set has trickled down from government into the culture?

It’s this liberal creep that has inspired liberal columnist Kathleen Parker to conclude, “Speaking one’s mind isn’t really all it’s cracked up to be.”

The statement, as it was pointed out by fellow liberal Bill Maher, is pretty incredible since Ms. Parker makes her living speaking her mind. (Cue to 2:45 for the good part).

But you see, that’s different. She’s an extremist liberal. And if one is an extremist liberal one gets a, “get out of jail,” free card to utter all sorts of nonsense about one’s thoughts.

It’s clear to any objective observer that the left’s goal is preserve tolerance, freedom of speech and accommodation in the press ONLY if one agrees with liberal ideology.

For we conservatives, in the “Extremist Left-Wing Era of Obama,” the goal is the destruction of individual thought and inalienable rights.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/mr-president-its-going-to-take-more-than-a-visit","Mr. President: It’s Going to Take More Than a Visit","My mother was just 24 years old when she had decided she’d had enough. Without telling anyone else (including my father) about what she planned to do, she picked up a pen and went to work… writing the President of the United States, that is.

In short, she was tired of watching the exclusively-liberal (no TheBlaze or Fox News, et al, in those days) media harpoon President Ronald Reagan for the tragic 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 Marines.

She wrote to him hoping to encourage the leader. In part, she wrote to express that as a young, newly-married (and just starting out on her own) American, she and my father felt safe knowing the nation was in the hands of someone who had never wavered in his resolve to protect the nation from its enemies.

My mother got the surprise of her life when Reagan wrote her back.

Personally.

He briefly thanked her for her kind works of appreciation and encouragement in so sad a period. Leading the nation during what had been dark economic times as well, Reagan noted that it was my mother’s positive outlook that must be emulated if the nation were to successfully fight evil in the world and stave off other problems.

President Barack Obama went a step further than Reagan did in my mother’s case. He made a visit to my home state a few days ago (sadly for me, I was out of the country) in order to personally respond to Rebekah Erler, a woman who penned a letter to Obama about the struggles she faces. She spoke of the cost of living, of mortgages and of daycare costs – the burden of most Americans.

Specifically, Erler wrote, “I’m writing you to let you know what it’s like for us out here in the middle of the country, and I hope you will listen.”

The president made the trek to the Land of 10,000 Lakes and did what he’s done for the last six years: Talk about how great the “recovery” is and how much better everyone is under his leadership – while simultaneously blaming Republicans for how bad everybody has it.

When does someone raise a hand and point out that none of this has worked? In six . . . long . . . years?

It’s going to take a lot more than a visit and old rhetoric to bring our nation back to the glory it once knew.

So, I’m writing the president a letter.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/rachel-maddows-tax-and-deficit-doubletalk","Rachel Maddow’s Tax and Deficit Doubletalk","In a recent segment of her Emmy-Award winning television show, Rachel Maddow, an MSNBC host with a doctorate in political science from Oxford University, claimed that:

State government budget deficits in Kansas, North Carolina, and New Jersey are “huge,” because their Republican governors have cut tax rates.

Cutting tax rates invariably leads to lower tax revenues.

The federal deficit is “plummeting,” because President Barack Obama raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans.

All of those assertions are false or misleading, and data from the federal government and the same sources cited by Maddow show that:

The federal deficit she applauded is 4.8 to 6.7 times larger than the state shortfalls she derided.

Tax revenues sometimes stay level and even increase when tax rates are cut.

The federal deficit naturally declines after a recession, but it is still larger than Bush-era deficits that Obama condemned as “reckless.”

Below is the documentation of these facts, along with the details of how Maddow has distorted the truth.

The Federal Deficit Far Exceeds the “Huge Deficits” Cited by Maddow

While criticizing Republican governors and tax cuts, Maddow flashed the following snippets of news stories about projected state budget shortfalls:

Kansas: “a shortfall of about $900 million by fiscal year 2019”

New Jersey: “$807-million-revenue shortfall”

North Carolina: “Analysts expect $445M NC shortfall”

Maddow provided no sense of scale for these figures, which is vital to understanding their significance. Instead of providing some basic context, such as how large these shortfalls are compared to the size of the budgets, Maddow simply exclaimed that they are “huge.” She said this four times in less than three minutes while declaring that these budgets had “blown up” and were going “kablooey.”

However, compared to the size of their budgets, the projected budget shortfalls of these states are far smaller than that of the federal government. The projected 2014 fiscal year shortfall for Kanas is 3.0 percent of the budget; for Jersey, it is 3.0 percent; and for North Carolina, it is 2.2 percent. In comparison, the projected shortfall for the federal government is 14.5 percent of the budget.

In other words, the federal deficit that Maddow celebrated is 4.8 to 6.7 times larger than the state shortfalls she decried.

Higher Taxes Reduce the Incentive to Work

Throughout the segment, Maddow repeatedly used sarcasm to assert that reductions in tax rates inevitably produce lower tax revenues. In her words: “One thing that happens when you cut taxes is that taxes get cut!” That claim may seem intuitive, but it is not true in all cases.

As shown in the graph below, federal income tax revenues often do not correspond with top federal income tax rates (which lawmakers tend to raise and lower simultaneously with and more dramatically than the rates for lower brackets):

The reason that tax revenues don’t always mirror tax rates is because there are a host of other variables that affect revenues, one of which is that lower tax rates boost people’s incentives to work, thereby generating more taxable income.

As explained by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), “a lower marginal tax rate on labor income increases the incentive to work, raising the number of hours people work and therefore the amount of output and income.”

The strength of this effect is debatable, and not every cut in tax rates leads to higher revenues. However, even prominent liberal economist Paul Krugman wrote in his 2009 textbook, “Economics,” that higher tax rates diminish the incentive to earn more income:

Any income tax system will tax away part of the gain an individual gets by moving up the income scale, reducing the incentive to earn more. But a progressive tax takes away a larger share of the gain than a proportional tax, creating a more adverse effect on incentives.

The Decline in Deficits Since 2009 is Nothing to Brag About

Just two weeks before President Obama was inaugurated in January 2009, CBO projected the path of the U.S. economy and federal budget for the next 10 years based upon current law. These projections showed rapidly improving economic conditions coupled with rapidly declining budget deficits after 2009, as is typical after a recession.

In the words of Krugman, “rapid growth is normal when an economy is bouncing back from a deep slump.” Economic growth, in turn, boosts tax revenues and lessens spending on government assistance programs, all of which serves to shrink deficits.

Before going further, it is important to note that CBO’s current law projections for the federal deficit are not directly comparable to actual outcomes, because such projections often use unrealistic assumptions.

However, they do show that just before Obama took office, the laws already in place coupled with the economic growth that regularly follows recessions were expected to progressively reduce the federal deficit, as shown in this graph:

Nevertheless, Obama and supporters like Maddow routinely crow about the declining deficit, using the refrain that it has fallen at the fastest pace since World War II. What they neglect to mention is that every deficit from 2009 to 2012 was larger than any deficit since the World War II era. Thus, there was enormous potential and natural impetus for the deficit to fall.

Yet, even in 2013, four years after the recession ended, the deficit was still 72 percent higher than the average deficits that occurred solely during the presidency of George W. Bush (without overlap with Clinton or Obama). Obama denounced these Bush-era deficits on the floor of the U.S. Senate in 2006 when he stated that “reckless fiscal policies” had driven federal deficits to “historically high levels.” Now, he and others are bragging about deficits that are significantly worse.

More importantly, the national debt provides a much clearer picture of the financial health of the federal government than the deficit in any given year or string of years. As such, during the same Senate speech, Obama warned that “America’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally,” “America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership,” and “Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.”

On the day Obama gave that speech, the national debt was $8.3 trillion or 61 percent of the nation’s economy. The national debt now stands at $17.5 trillion or 102 percent of the economy. Hence, even after adjusting for economic growth (which accounts for population increases and inflation), our national debt is now 67 percent larger than the debt Obama railed against in 2006.

Finally, linking deficits to any particular president or governor fails to account for the actions of congresses, the impacts of preexisting laws, and many other variables that impact government spending and revenues. Hence, to attribute these deficits purely to presidents or governors, as Maddow and many others have done, oversimplifies and misrepresents the facts of these matters.

Recently, Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) introduced the “State Marriage Defense Act of 2014.” Shortly thereafter, Sens. Mike Lee and Ted Cruz introduced its companion bill in the United States Senate.

The bill is simple. In short, it states that for the purposes of federal benefits, federal agencies will determine whether a marriage qualifies for those benefits based upon the domicile of the person filing for marriage benefits, not the state in which the marriage ceremony was celebrated.

Before I explain further, let me preface by saying that I appreciate and commend the intent of these legislators. Without question, these men are dedicated to protecting the Constitution and defending the institution of marriage.

However, the State Marriage Defense Act of 2014 is not the answer.

The Natural Law

The institution of marriage is intertwined within the very fabric of the Natural Law. Shortly after the Court’s decision in United States v. Windsor, where the Court held that Section Three of the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional, more than 200 leaders signed a coalition statement that explains the relationship between marriage and the Natural Law.

Among the signatories are pastors, university presidents and deans, chairmen, authors, activists, editors, presidents of nonprofit organizations, journalists, and even a former governor. The statement reads:

We affirm that marriage and family have been inscribed by the Divine Architect into the order of creation. Marriage is ontologically between one man and one woman, ordered toward the union of the spouses, open to children and formative of family… Marriage as existing solely between one man and one woman was not an idea manufactured by religion or civil government. It precedes both. Though affirmed, fulfilled, and elevated by our faith, the truth that marriage can exist only between one man and one woman is not based on religion or revelation alone, but on the Natural Moral Law, written on the human heart and discernible through the exercise of reason.

As a component of the Natural Law, authored by God, the institution of marriage is beyond the ability of mankind to change. Simply put, it is a law given to us by God and since God’s ways are justice (Deuteronomy 32:4) and His ways are higher than our ways (Isaiah 55:9). God’s law is, as Alexander Hamilton wrote, “superior in obligation to any other.”

Our nation was founded upon the idea that there are certain rights and laws that man receives from God, not government. It was this idea that “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” that served as the foundation for our independence as a nation. These “unalienable Rights” that are “endowed by their Creator” are recognition of the Natural Law authored by God. If that were not the case, then there would not have been any basis for the American Revolution.

The Tenth Amendment

Here, with regard to the State Marriage Defense Act of 2014, proponents of the bill claim that the states have the authority to define marriage as they see fit or by the majority vote of a state’s electorate.

In his press release, dated Jan. 9, 2014, Rep. Weber stated, “I drafted the ‘State Marriage Defense Act of 2014’ to help restore the 10th Amendment, affirm the authority of states to define and regulate marriage, as well as, provide clarity to federal agencies seeking to determine who qualifies as a spouse for the purpose of federal law.”

In what to me looks to be identical press releases offered by Sens. Lee and Cruz, Sen. Lee (R-Utah) writes, “How a state should define marriage should be left up to the citizens of each state.” Sen. Cruz (R-Texas) stated, “We should respect the states, and the definition of marriage should be left to democratically elected legislatures, not dictated from Washington.”

The Tenth Amendment, which Rep. Weber expressly references, states “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.”

Logically, to delegate or reserve something for someone or something else, one must first possess what one desires to delegate or reserve. In other words, I cannot give someone a gift if I do not first possess what I intend to give away.

Here, in regard to the State Marriage Defense Act of 2014, the same truth applies.

The Constitution only can reserve for the states what it owns or has authority to convey. As such, the Constitution reserves for individual states what it has not delegated to the United States. For one to state that the Tenth Amendment reserves the authority for states to define marriage according to the will of the citizens of that state is to say that the Constitution had authority over the Natural Law.

Such a conclusion is contrary to the essence of the Natural Law and is contrary to Scripture. It is to say that a document, the Constitution, which was created by the Founding Fathers, had authority over the Bible. The logical conclusion then would be that our jurisprudence is based on moral relativism, which cannot be true.

Endorses Windsor

Whether intentional or not, the State Marriage Defense Act of 2014 endorses the Court’s decision in Windsor, which makes it even more unbelievable that even the most conservative members of Congress are endorsing this bill.

In Windsor, the Court cited to Federalism, Due Process, and Equal Protection in its rationale for declaring Section Three of DOMA unconstitutional. As such, the Court stated that issues of domestic relations are a matter for state law.

The State Marriage Defense Act of 2014 perpetuates the falsehood that marriage is exclusively a state issue, as evidenced by citing the Tenth Amendment as authority. By codifying a state’s ability to define marriage according to the popular vote, and then use that voter-defined marriage definition for purposes of federal benefits, the State Marriage Defense Act of 2014 advances same-sex marriage.

Additionally, because the State Marriage Defense Act of 2014 codifies Windsor, it stands in juxtaposition to the Federal Marriage Amendment, which was introduced by Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan).

The Federal Marriage Amendment is a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution, the highest level of federal law. As previously discussed, proponents of the State Marriage Defense Act, by citing authority under the Tenth Amendment, believe, in accordance with the Supreme Court in Windsor, that marriage policy is a matter exclusively for states to determine. It is inconsistent to support both the State Marriage Defense Act and the Federal Marriage Amendment because these bills represent opposite philosophies pertaining to marriage policy.

Conclusion

The State Marriage Defense Act of 2014 does not reconcile with the Natural Law. Because the definition of marriage is a component of the Natural Law, and the Natural Law is of higher obligation than man-made law (Ex: federal law, state law, etc.) then the statement that marriage should be “left up to the citizens of each state” or “left to democratically elected legislatures” is in stark contradiction to the Natural Law.

Bottom line, the Tenth Amendment doesn’t give states the jurisdiction to amend the Natural Law.

Ultimately, citing a Tenth Amendment right for citizens or elected legislatures to redefine marriage is harming marriage, not defending it, because such a statement endorses moral relativism.

If our jurisprudence is based on moral relativism, and under the Tenth Amendment a state can redefine marriage by popular vote, then marriage can be anything so long as enough people vote for it.

Taken a step further, if moral relativism were the basis of our jurisprudence, then anything that is illegal today could be legal tomorrow, provided that it is the collective will of the electorate. Although the State Marriage Defense Act of 2014 seems simple, the ramifications of it are wide-reaching and ghastly.

Tune in to “For The Record” Wednesday at 8 p.m. EST, only on TheBlaze.

–

During the 1980s and 1990s, federal law enforcement authorities considered Jamaat al-Fuqra to be one of the most active domestic terrorist groups in the country.

Operating in the U.S. as “Muslims of America,” annual State Department terrorism reports up until Sept. 11, 2001 described the group as “an Islamic sect that seeks to purify Islam through violence.” Dozens of Fuqra members have been arrested for more than a dozen murders, firebombings, gun running, drug trafficking, defrauding government agencies, amongst other crimes. In 1993, the Anti-Defamation League published a report chronicling the group’s continuing terror campaign.

But an ongoing “For The Record” investigation has discovered that the FBI and other government agencies have been playing a longstanding double-game with Jamaat al-Fuqra.

Documents obtained from the FBI on al-Fuqra by national security analyst Ryan Mauro, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and first made public in this week’s episode of “For the Record,” show that at the same time that FBI special agents were picnicking and hosting award ceremonies with members of the group at their Hancock, N.Y. headquarters, internally the FBI continued to acknowledge that the group remained an active terrorist threat.

Back in 2009, Mauro also received from a law enforcement source a video showing women at that same Hancock compound conducting training sessions on martial arts, weapons handling and military movements.

I showed this video and the internal FBI documents describing al-Fuqra’s past terrorist activities to a nationally-recognized law enforcement expert on Neo-Nazi groups, who told me:

If we were handed a video like this showing this kind of training by any group, regardless of whether it was skinheads or militia groups, we would be opening an active investigation, conducting regular surveillance and trying to recruit sources to gather intel about what was happening inside. If the group had a history of hate crimes or terrorist acts, we would actively look for parole violations by members of the group and look for possible RICO predicates. You sure wouldn’t find us sitting down and having a picnic with them.

But that’s in fact what representatives from the Binghamton, N.Y. FBI field office did in June 2005.

Following the FBI’s picnic, Agent Irizarry sent a note of thanks to the group, which was quickly posted, along with photos of the event, on the group’s website.

And yet just a few months before, the Department of Homeland Security had identified Jamaat al-Fuqra in an internal report as possible sponsors of terror attacks targeting the U.S. As the New York Times reported [emphasis added]:

This is the first time the two-year-old department has prepared what will now be an annual Integrated Planning Guidance Report, a document that is listed as “sensitive” but not classified, meaning it was not intended to be released publicly… Al Qaeda, not unexpectedly, tops a list of adversaries in the report, although the authors question if the group can still pull off attacks similar in scale to those of Sept. 11, 2001. Other predicted possible sponsors of attacks include Jamaat ul-Fuqra, a Pakistani-based group that has been linked to Muslims of America; Jamaat al Tabligh, an Islamic missionary organization that has a presence in the United States; and the American Dar Al Islam Movement. Representatives for the organizations could not be reached Wednesday for comment or did not respond to telephone or e-mail messages.

Internal FBI documents obtained by “For the Record” show that as late as September 2007, more than two years after the Hancock picnic, the bureau was still identifying Jamaat al-Fuqra as a terrorist group.

The FBI’s lackluster response to domestic terrorism was highlighted in last week’s episode of “For The Record” reporting new details in the Fort Hood terrorist attack in November 2009. Just days after the event, the FBI put out a press release claiming no international terrorist connections to the attack after reports emerged that the FBI knew about Major Nidal Hasan as far back as December 2008.

The FBI had been monitoring the email communications between Hasan and Al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, but the investigation was shut down by FBI headquarters stating that the communications were purely religious. That contradicted later findings by the William Webster Commission, which found that Hasan and Awlaki emails discussions should have alerted investigators to Hasan’s intentions.

The more recent example of the Boston bombing in April 2013 proved not to be the FBI’s finest hour. As “For The Record” reported last September, not only had Russian intelligence alerted the FBI of the terror contacts of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, but local Boston groups had briefed the local FBI office about the radical activities and terrorist ties of the mosque attended by the Tsarnaev brothers.

Congressman Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) questioned FBI Director Robert Mueller about how the bureau dropped the ball in the Boston bombing case, where Mueller not only admitted that they had waited four days after the bombing to canvas the Islamic Center of Boston, but that he was not even aware that the mosque had been founded by currently imprisoned Al-Qaeda financier Abdurahman Alamoudi:

So if the FBI is well aware of Jamaat al-Fuqra’s past terror history and internally admits they remain a terrorist threat, why does it publicly dismiss domestic terror threats like al-Fuqra?

Here are at least three reasons:

Politics: Beginning with the Clinton administration, continuing through the Bush administration, and accelerated by the Obama administration, the U.S. government has embraced a policy of engaging “moderate” Islamists under the guise that these groups serve as a bulwark against extremism to court Muslim-American voters.

But as I outlined in a comprehensive review last year, these outreach efforts have been a complete disaster. Not only have these outreach programs ended up mainstreaming radical leaders and organizations, they have repeatedly compromised active terror investigations. And as demonstrated by the FBI’s picnic at Jamaat al-Fuqra’s headquarters in 2005, the FBI’s outreach has fared no better than any other agencies programs.

Media: While many establishment media outlets in the past have covered al-Fuqra’s terrorist activity, many of these same media outlets are now openly hostile of the investigative efforts by law enforcement to keep track of the activities of these groups.

Even after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, media outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today and the Associated Press covered these issues with some sense of balance. But the current treatment by the media is exemplified by Nashville Newschannel 5’s February 2010 coverage of a Jamaat al-Fuqra compound in Dover, Tenn. that amounted to reporter Nick Beres driving up to the rural compound, taking a look around and declaring that there was no terrorist activity to be seen. This all while completely ignoring what the FBI and other law enforcement agencies had said about al-Fuqra’s past terror activity.

In this media atmosphere, law enforcement officials are wary of conducting investigations that the media is quick to characterize as “Islamophobic” or even racist.

Policy: One of the most disturbing changes to counter-terrorism training and investigations under the Obama administration was a policy announced by the FBI in March 2012 and outlined in a document titled “FBI’s Guiding Principles.” This policy said that “associating or membership with a terrorist group, if that same group also engages in ‘advocacy’ activity, should mean that support for investigative or training purposes does not mean that individual should be considered as supporting the group’s violent ends.”

This was adopted to specifically address a number of U.S.-based Islamic groups that have previously been identified as supporting foreign terrorist organizations in terrorism trials, but continue to serve as outreach partners to the FBI. An extrapolation of the FBI’s Guiding Principles was announced earlier this month by the Obama administration that asylum seekers who had previously given “limited material support” to terrorist groups overseas will not count against their asylum claims.

With these three factors in mind, it is unlikely that the FBI or any other law enforcement agency will make any serious efforts to combat the threat posed by Jamaat al-Fuqra, despite their lengthy history of terrorist activity and repeated public statements and classified assessments by U.S. government agencies and the FBI that Jamaat al-Fuqra remains a threat to the American homeland.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/the-founders-were-hypocrites-or-were-they-2","The Founders Were Hypocrites. Or Were They?","Russia’s Vladimir Putin, global strong man and rising power player, has a record of which many are unaware.

In a nation that for decades was steeped in the anti-Christianity that the Bolsheviks brought with them as they squeezed the life out of the last Czar, Putin has overseen the reconstruction and revitalizing of the Russian Orthodox Church. In fact, 23,000 churches have been rebuilt under Putin’s watch. Given the former Soviet Union’s history of persecution towards this faith, many would agree that this is technically a good thing.

All this doesn’t change the fact that Putin is still guilty of heinous human rights violations as part of the KGB and as Russia’s leader—including the infamous Pytochnye kolonii (torture colonies) where thousands have been and continue to be subjected to unspeakable treatment.

In other words, the so called good Putin has done for a once-persecuted group is grossly overshadowed by the hypocrisy of the behavior he has sanctioned for years.

Some say that here in the United States, we’re no different. We continue to cling to the words and precepts of men who—despite all their talk about inalienable rights—owned their fellow human beings as if they were livestock.

It is because of this perceived hypocrisy that today, their vital role in establishing the freest nation on earth is quickly discredited by those who remind us of their transgression.

After all, how can we speak of the genius of our founding, and the greatness of men like Thomas Jefferson, when we know that human beings were enslaved at his hand?

It’s an entirely reasonable reaction.

Or is it?

Maybe the problem is that we simply don’t know our own history.

Today, we rightly see slavery as the abomination that it is. In the early days of our nation, people were only beginning to wake up to its injustice. As wrong as it was, it was an integral part of society at that time. Societies had operated on a system of forced or indentured human service for centuries; for millennia, really, in all corners of the world. The fact that the Founders and those who followed them were able to eradicate it entirely from this nation in just 89 years (from the Declaration in 1776 to the 13th Amendment in 1865) is quite remarkable.

Before we look at what they did to get there, it is imperative that we understand what they were up against.

To be certain, the Founders weren’t perfect. Some of them still struggled with their own possession of slaves. Not all wanted to end slavery, yet what so often goes unrecognized is that so many of them did.

Contrary to what many may believe, slavery’s end did not begin with the 13th Amendment which, in 1865, formally abolished slavery in the United States. It actually began with the Three-Fifths compromise in 1787.

Just 11 years after the Declaration, Congress ratified the Constitution in 1787. With it, the Three-Fifths compromise was born, a concept that has endlessly served as the one of the lynchpins for the argument that the Constitution was flawed from the start.

Critics contend that counting slaves as “three-fifths” of a person was intended to qualify them as less than human, and furthered the institution of slavery. In reality, counting slaves in this manner actually helped, not hindered, the push to end slavery. Few realize that if the Constitution had counted all slaves for census purposes and tax liability as one rather than three-fifths, the states with large slave populations would have held a perpetual majority in Congress, and would have never voted against the institution of slavery.

Furthermore, had the compromise been the proslavery anthem many claim it to be, why did Congress attach personhood to the slaves? In doing what they did, they formally recognized that these slaves were truly humans. After all, if the Founders believed otherwise . . . the slaves would have been regarded as no more than property; something that never would have been considered as part of a census in the first place.

Moreover, certain southern delegates refused to support the Constitution without restrictions on Congress’ power to ban the slave trade. In another compromise, it was agreed that Congress wouldn’t touch the subject for 20 years, at which point it could be brought up again. For many, this day couldn’t come soon enough to end this “nefarious practice” and “barbarism of modern policy.”

In other words, there was enough time to begin shifting the debate in the country. And shift it did, as the nation watched a battle back and forth between compromises, eventually culminating in the Civil War, and the amendment that finally ended slavery.

Still, many will argue that these points too are moot, given the fact that throughout many of these debates, certain Founders owned slaves. To understand this, we must also understand the legal framework under which they lived.

Perhaps just as difficult as restructuring the way things were “always done,” was facing the “laws of manumission;” that is, each state’s protocol as to how slaves could be released, often dictated whether or not this was easily possible. Depending on the state (some weren’t as difficult), it meant financial support of the slave, significant legal petition on the part of the slave owner on behalf of the slave, etc. In other words, it often was no easy task a person could just carry out from one day to the next.

Instead some, like Jefferson, actively worked toward and looked forward to the day in which slavery could be eradicated from our society, and attempted to set plans in place to ensure that they would be educated. He believed national emancipation could be achieved, and he wanted them to be ready to live, work and prosper outside of slavery.

In Jefferson’s case, provisions existed which allowed him to free slaves at his death, which he did. His indebtedness (some $2.5 million in today’s currency) would have prevented him from doing so beforehand, because, as “The Jefferson Lies” author David Barton notes, “emancipated slaves could thus be seized by creditors to pay off any debt owed by the owner.”

In sum, before we can sit and talk about what the Founders crafted and the impact it has on our nation today, we must understand their true history. If they’re the guilty hypocrites many paint them to be, then yes … their guidance of our nation is to be questioned. But given the context history lays out for us, this certainly doesn’t seem to be the case.

Instead of using slavery as the cornerstone of a thinly-veiled attempt to disregard our Founding principles in favor of something far more progressive, its eradication ought to be viewed as one of our Founders’ greatest accomplishments.

After all, slavery didn’t occur in a vacuum. It was something our world had struggled with for ages, and still does in certain countries. How amazing it is that we, thanks to the guidance of our Founders, were able to eradicate it from ours in just one lifetime?

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/linder-letter-not-a-smidgeon-how-could-the-president-know","Linder Letter: ‘Not A Smidgeon,’ How Could the President Know?","In last Sunday’s interview with “Fox News” anchor Bill O’Reilly, President Obama assured us that there was no corruption at all in the IRS.

“Not a smidgeon.” He went on to say “these kinds of things keep on surfacing in part because you and your TV station will promote them.”

The “Associated Press“ took the president’s spin a step further by reporting that the president was confronted with “Republican criticism.” Did they call the questions fired at Gov. Chris Christie during his two-hour press conference regarding the traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge as “Democrat criticism?” Of course not.

President Obama was entirely relaxed in responding to O’Reilly’s questions about the IRS. He knows that, much like the AP, the rest of the media will disregard any concerns about abuse as Republican criticisms. They are pretty busy with more important matters such as bridge closings and Justin Bieber.

The IRS saga began when Lois Lerner, the head of the Tax Division on Exempt Organizations, spoke to the American Bar Association. She was aware of a report coming out from the IRS Inspector General that would disclose a pattern of harassment of Tea Party groups that were applying for tax-exempt status. She pre-empted the IG report and blamed a few “rogue agents” in Cincinnati.

Holly Paz was the former director of exempt organizations in Cincinnati. She made it very clear that she was not a “rogue agent” and that her superiors in Washington demanded control of the process on the Tea Party applications. She was placed on paid administrative leave.

Carter Hull worked for the IRS for 48 years and approved the first application from a Tea Party affiliated organization. Lois Lerner overruled his approval and he was ordered to send Tea Party applications through a multi-layer review that included the Chief Counsel’s office.

Hull disagreed with the new procedure for approval of the applications, which included information on the applicant’s political activity. He was removed from that responsibility and replaced by a woman who had been with the IRS for less than a year. He is now retired.

Chief Counsel William Wilkins was one of only two political appointees in the IRS. Wilkins met with President Obama in the Roosevelt Room of the White House two days before the new protocol for approval of applicants went into effect.

In sworn testimony to Congress he used the old “I do not recall” line 80 times. Even when asked if he discussed the protocol with Treasury Department officials and the Inspector General, he did not recall. He is still the Chief Counsel.

We recently learned that the IRS has issued a new proposed rule that would codify the very abuses that have been reported. The planning for this new rule was undertaken in secret. The leader of the new rules change was none other than Lois Lerner.

When Lois Lerner was called to testify before Congress she asserted her right not to incriminate herself under the Fifth Amendment. She was asked by the Treasury Secretary to resign and refused. She went on paid administrative leave for several months and then retired last fall with full benefits.

The acting IRS Commissioner at the time, Steven Miller, was asked to resign by the Secretary of the Treasury.

If there was, as the president said, “not a smidgeon” of corruption, why all of the retirements and resignations? Why the Fifth Amendment?

[sharequote align=”center”]If there was “not a smidgeon” of corruption, why all of the retirements and resignations? [/sharequote]

On January 13 the “Wall Street Journal“ reported that the FBI has decided that there would be no indictments. Two weeks later the Department of Justice informed Congress that they couldn’t testify on the matter because the investigation is not finished.

If the investigation is not finished how could the FBI know that there would be no indictments? How could the president know there was no corruption?

If Chris Christie were president the press would get to the bottom of this.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/will-aclu-stand-guard-over-college-admissions-offices-to-prevent-racial-profiling-2","Will ACLU Stand Guard Over College Admissions Offices to Prevent Racial Profiling?","If the U.S. Supreme Court rules to uphold the Michigan Civil Rights Act (MCRI) in its current term, voters across the country will be in a stronger position to outlaw race and gender preferences.

That’s the good news.

The bad news is that college admissions officials can continue to play games at the expense of qualified applicants in an effort to boost “diversity” on campus.

That much was evident last year when the high court ruled in favor of a female plaintiff who sued the University of Texas at Austin for using racial considerations in its admissions process that ran counter to the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.

The 7-1 ruling in Fisher v. University of Texas demonstrates that a majority of justices maintain a jaundiced view toward preferential policies and will very likely uphold the MCRI, which amends the Michigan state constitution to say: “The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.”

That’s the kind of language a broad cross-section of Americans has embraced in state ballot initiatives beginning with California’s Proposition 209 in 1996. Since then, Washington State, Arizona, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Michigan have passed their own version of constitutional amendments banning discriminatory practices. Other states, including Tennessee, are poised to move forward with their ballot proposals.

But the momentum in favor of race and gender neutral policies was disrupted in July 2011 when a three-judge panel on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the MCRI actually violated the 14th Amendment.

The panel accepted the argument advanced by a well-funded, far left group that essentially said in order to treat people equally in college admissions and government hiring they must be treated unequally. That group describes itself as the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary, or BAMN for short. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette’s appeal of the Sixth Circuit ruling is the case now before the Supreme Court.

Assuming the Court reverses the Sixth Circuit and restores the MCRI, and it is reasonable to make that assumption based on recent rulings, the BAMN mentality will continue to find expression in college admissions.

Jennifer Gratz, CEO of the XIV (14th) Amendment Foundation puts it very well.

“Racial discrimination will not end simply by passing a law or by receiving a favorable legal decision,” she has observed. “It takes a determined, unrelenting movement to bring about such lasting change. The Supreme Court won’t do it for us.”

So how should civil rights activists respond if college admissions officials proceed to violate the rule of law, as they did at the University of Texas, despite the clear language of the 14th Amendment and existing U.S. Supreme Court precedents that outlaw quotas and set asides?

Here’s an idea, why not recruit the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to keep tabs on college admission officials so as to ensure that they do not engage in racial profiling?

It’s a fair question since the ACLU has been aiming its legal arrows against police departments and border security officials who confront suspected illegal aliens. As The Washington Times recently reported, The ACLU branch in Arizona has filed a complaint against the Tucson Police Department accusing it of violating the civil liberties of two Hispanic men. Police officers detained the two men after pulling over their van, which had a broken license plate. The suspects were turned over to the U.S. border security and later released on bond.

“This is racial profiling pure and simple,” Christine P. Sun, an ACLU attorney, is quoted as saying.

The police department denies the ACLU allegations and it may have the better argument. For starters, the ACLU is challenging a part of the Arizona immigration enforcement law, SB 1070, the U.S. Supreme Court has already upheld. The police are permitted to ask about the legal status of individuals they encounter as part of their routine duties; such as traffic stops. It would seem the ACLU would only have a case if a suspected illegal alien was pulled over or confronted at random. SB 1070 does not become active unless an individual stands accused of committing another crime such as a traffic violation.

Still, the ACLU is convinced that border security activities in Arizona and other states lead into racial profiling. That’s why the ACLU has set up its own checkpoints in close proximity to where the Border Patrol operates along the U.S.-Mexican border so individuals can be advised of their rights. To the extent the ACLU protects the rights of legal citizens, it is performing a valuable service. To the extent its attorneys are intruding upon legitimate border security exercises, it is doing a great disservice to all Americans.

There’s a better way.

If the ACLU is genuinely concerned about racial profiling and how this practice impacts the 14th Amendment, why not set up checkpoints in front of the admissions offices at say the University of Texas, the University of Michigan, and other institutions of higher learning that have been called out for profiling and discriminating against Americans who are denied opportunity because of their skin color? How about it?

Gratz, the civil rights activist who heads up the XIV Foundation, was also the plaintiff in Gratz v. Bollinger, a 2003 Supreme Court ruling that overturned racial quotas at the University of Michigan’s undergraduate program. She knows how duplicitious and misleading the opposing side can be.

This is how she reacted to oral arguments before the Supreme Court concerning the MCRI.

“Supporters of race preferences now have conflicting arguments,” she said in a press release. “First they argued before the Supreme Court that race preferences were for the benefit of everyone. And now argue in front of the same court that race preferences are for the benefit of minorities. This conflict means that either proponents lied in front of the court before, or they are lying to the court now. This is a sign of just how willing proponents of race preferences are to shoe-horn any argument in order to hold onto the unpopular discriminatory policies.”

That’s why the ACLU’s services are needed where colleges admissions are concerned. In a few months, the high court will very likely give the green light to the MCRI and other state initiatives. But will university officials honor a ruling in favor of equal rights?

The ACLU attorneys can help make sure that they do.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/its-time-for-israel-to-defend-itself","It’s Time For Israel To Defend Itself","The world hates Israel; plain and simple.

America (the current government) hates Israel. The media (CNN, MSNBC, BBC) hates Israel. If Israel does nothing, they are hated. If they have a “moderate” response, they are hated. If they have a serious response (Operation Cast Lead, Operation Grapes of Wrath, Operation Defensive Shield, etc) they are hated.

It is only logical for Israel to understand that no matter what they do, the result is the same, so they should do what will be MOST beneficial to them.

I’ve said it before, and I will say it again: After 60 years of hell, with no sign of it going away, Israel has a responsibility to protect her citizens. Their danger zone lies in Hamas and the West Bank. Peace talks have failed not because of the “agreement” terms, but because one side has zero desire for a walking, breathing Jew to exist. This simply is something that is non-negotiable. You can NOT negotiate with cancer under any terms.

A look back at history – documenting all the terrorist attacks in Israel at the hands of a group hell-bent on destroying Israel – would require chapters which I think might turn this article into a book. However, just to look at a few makes my conclusion a justifiable and acceptable point of view.

One of countless attacks documented in 2001 included a double suicide bombing at the Ben-Yehuda pedestrian mall in Jerusalem that killed 11 people, aged 12 to 21, and injured 188 people. A car bomb exploded 20 minutes later. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack.

The very next day, on Dec. 2, 2001, a suicide bombing on a bus in Haifa killed 15 people and injured about 40 people. Hamas claimed responsibility for the Haifa blast, while Hezbullah’s radio and television stations expressed support for the attacks.

Ten years later, on Aug. 31, 2010, four Israelis, including a pregnant woman, were murdered when terrorists ambushed their car as they were driving near Kiryat Arba in the West Bank. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, which coincided with the restarting of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Washington, D.C.

As you can see, the hate remains the same, the devastation remains the same, the only thing that changes is the decade.

Why can’t the world understand – or Israel for that matter – that these monsters are not doing this to push Israel into declaring a two-state solution? They are doing this to push Israel into the second holocaust. It scares me half to death that this reality is so hard to comprehend by civilized nations, for if it were to happen to them or their territories, they would be involved in a full state of war. However, they are first to tell Israel to never mind the past, and just give up, something they would never do themselves.

The irony is that most of the technologies which all these nations enjoy were started by Israeli companies. Of course, you would never hear these words of praise, nor would you expect these opinionated nations to live without the cell phones, voice-over internet, medications, the first electric hair remover, the steel security door, and the Intel Chip and Sandisk USB flash memory drive. You won’t hear about these things; only that Israel should allow itself to be pushed into extinction. Disgusting.

I wish we had an American president that would get up on the world stage and demand that this twilight zone we live in is banished and allow the reality to sink in. Instead we have a man who blamed the security fence Israel erected around the West Bank to keep terrorists out as the cause for their frustrations which leads to more hate and instability. (Instability somehow means terrorism to President Barack Obama). He criticized the security fence built by Israel to prevent terror attacks: “The creation of a wall dividing the two nations is yet another example of the neglect of this administration in brokering peace.”

The ONLY solution after 60 years of hell, 60 years of terrorism, 60 years of lies and innocent slaughter, is for Israel to stand up with their air force, like America did to end World War II. Load their planes with non-nuclear bombs of the highest grade, size, potency, and effectiveness. Graph out Gaza and the West Bank. Go on TV and give the terrorists one final chance to put their weapons down. Make it clear that the next incursion will result in complete and total annihilation… and then wait.

Hopefully, the Palestinians will understand what it means to love their children more than they hate the Jews. On that day there can be peace. If they don’t understand this – and take one more life, shoot one more rocket, lob one more stone at the Israel Defense Forces – you move forward with “Operation Final Battle” and drop the bombs. Not one, not two, but as many as it takes to reduce the ENTIRE two cities to the ground. America did it to Japan and the results saved millions of lives. It also made the Soviets know we meant business and were not going to tolerate injustice or confrontation. In Israel’s case, they would be sending a clear message to those willing to launch attcks, and in today’s day, with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria on the move, it would be a good method of demonstrating air superiority.

After the debate stops, and the anger has died down, if Israel wants to negotiate with Hamas – they will, but at their own risk of peril. History has proven before that sometimes, negotiations just don’t cut it, as seen when British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain tried to make peace with Adolf Hitler. Sometimes – as much as you hate to admit it or agree with me – the only solution is to introduce your enemy to Satan himself.

In the Hebrew language, there is something everyone should learn. There is a noted difference in how we refer to animals. There are “Chayot” and there are “Behemoth.” Chayot (pronounced HAH YOT) are domesticated, trained animals such as dogs, cats, a parakeet, perhaps pets living in the family house who you love and cherish because of their loving characteristics and traits. On the flip side, there are Behemoth, also animals by definition, but categorized as untamed beasts who you can’t trust to act in a dignified fashion, such as a lion or elephant or rhinoceros. You can usually manage a sweet group of Chayot, but if you attempt to dominate Behemoth, you are going to regret it later. Hamas has demonstrated this quality, and nothing short of a miracle is going to change that.

May God bless Israel, their The Prime Minister of Israel, and their Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel, Avigdor Liberman – אביגדור ליברמן and give them the courage to come to the same solution as millions of Americans including myself feel is the only way to preserve our Jewish homeland should the rest of the world fall apart.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/white-house-hired-sham-foreign-company-for-obamacare-employees-do-nothing","White House Hired Sham Foreign Company for Obamacare, Employees ‘Do Nothing’","Just when you thought the unfolding saga of Obamacare couldn’t get any stranger, it does. Witness last week’s bombshell – a whistleblower alleges American taxpayers are paying workers “to do nothing but sit at their computers.”

First reported by KMOV News 4, the whistleblower painted a picture reminiscent of the cult classic “Office Space,” telling the St. Louis station that employees went weeks literally doing nothing. What were they supposed to be doing? Processing ObamaCare paper applications.

Instead, they were sitting around playing games – all on the American taxpayer’s dime.

Lavonne Takatz worked from October to April at the Wentzville, Missouri facility where the transgressions occurred. She told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: “We played Pictionary. We played 20 Questions. We played Trivial Pursuit.”

Another former employee told KMOV management told them to “act like we were working” and “look at the screen as if we were reading things.” Employees were banned from speaking to the media, even after they left the company. The company is called Serco, a British firm awarded a $1.2 billion contract to manage paper applications for President Obama’s health care law.

[sharequote align=”center”]Instead, they were sitting around playing games – all on the American taxpayer’s dime.[/sharequote]

Serco was a boondoggle of its own amidst Obamacare’s disastrous rollout. The former Serco employee explained that there were 1,800 people waiting to get one out of 20 applications that came through.

Since the workload was so light, they were told “to sit at their computers and hit the refresh button…no more than every 10 minutes.” If they refreshed more than that, they were called into a supervisor’s office and told to stop, reported the Post-Dispatch. Takatz says that Serco even provided books to read.

According to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data, throughout October and November only 17 percent of exchange applications were on paper – far below the one-third rate the Congressional Budget Office projected. And yet at the same time there was a backlog of 50,000 to 60,000 paper applications – each representing a customer left in the dark about their status.

The Obama Administration awarded Serco with the contract last summer. Of course, as has been the case with so many recipients of this administration’s generosity, a cloud of insider politics hangs over the award.

Serco spent more than $1 million on lobbying and other political activities, including a donation to the Obama campaign – presumably common practice for a company that does 90 percent of its business with the federal government.

Interestingly, one of Serco’s hired lobbyists, Mark Hayes, was the central subject of an insider-trading investigation. But Serco’s dark history goes far beyond one lobbyist – it appears to stretch across the Atlantic Ocean.

Just days after Serco was awarded the Obamacare contract, they came under investigation from Britain’s Serious Fraud Office. An audit discovered that Serco and another company had been overbilling the government by over $80 billion (USD). Serco, Inc. in the United States did not alert the government that their parent company was under foreign investigation, despite being required by law to do so.

In August, London police investigated allegations that Serco falsified documents on a British government contract. In 2006, they were contracted to provide certain healthcare services in England, but the Guardian found that quality of service had declined drastically as a result. Another contract in 2011 resulted in 400 “clinical incidents.” In March of 2013, Britain’s National Audit Office found that Serco had made “unauthorized changes to performance data” 252 times in six months.

However, ineptitude and employee boredom have not been Serco’s only problems. Multiple reports have surfaced of staff being physically and sexually violent at another Serco-run facility, leading the Australian government to join the British in their suspicion of the worldwide corporation.

Given the seriousness of the various allegations against Serco, the Obama administration must have known about the company’s troubling past, and yet they were awarded the enormous taxpayer-funded contract anyway.

As Jillian Kay Melchior wrote for National Review, “Any one of these scandals would have been troubling enough, but taken together they make you wonder what the U.S. government was thinking — as with so much of the rest of Obamacare.”

Now, members of Congress want CMS to respond to questions that should have been answered long ago – before the rollout, before Serco was awarded the gigantic contract, before Obamacare was passed and signed into law.

Unfortunately, as with many of Obamacare’s expensive consequences, it is too little too late.

Lavonne Takatz told the Post-Dispatch she feels like she “was stealing money from people.” If only the Obama administration shared her concern.

"https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/todays-affirmative-action-is-racism-2","Today’s Affirmative Action is Racism","In an effort to pave a well-planned roadmap for its future, Western Washington University recently decided to send out a simple, six question survey. From meeting off-campus needs, to discovering the role of liberal arts and sciences at WWU, the university sought to improve on the basis of these answers. Two of the questions focused in on race. One read:

“How do we make sure that in future years ‘we are not as black as we are today?’”

Not as “black” as we are today? In other words, the insinuation is that the university’s student body is comprised of far too many people of African American descent, and that in future years WWU must take steps to reduce this disproportionate ethnic majority.

This happened nearly two weeks ago, and yet, where was the national outrage? Where was the national outcry? It’s hard to believe anyone would read such an atrocity and not loudly disagree.

The lack of national outcry to this racist assertion is simple.

Here’s the actual question:

“How do we make sure that in future years ‘we are not as white as we are today?’”

This is affirmative action, in action.

Affirmative action as practiced today doesn’t, as Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotamayor recently wrote, prevent so-called “selective barriers against racial minorities” from being erected. It erects barriers and prejudices against those whose accident of birth didn’t make them a minority.

This wasn’t always the case. In fact, affirmative action was originally a good idea. It was meant to rectify ills that racial discrimination had perpetrated; chiefly, as the Heritage Foundation notes, it “authorized courts to take ‘affirmative action’ to uproot racially discriminatory practices. That objective was, and remains, morally right. But that same statute forbade race preference; it is morally wrong.”

The concept of affirmative action has since been shanghaied, re-branded and re-launched into something just as bad as the racial discrimination that brought the Civil Rights Act into fruition in the first place. Indeed, instead of simply eradicating the horrors of segregation and racial superiority, today’s affirmative action has forced the concept of “racial proportionality” to such an extent that openly discriminating (like the WWU questionnaire) against non-minorities has become perfectly acceptable.

Voters in the state of Michigan rightly saw the ills of this approach, and sought to rectify it. They voted to usher in a constitutional change that bans “using race as a factor in college admissions.” In other words, that all prospective students—regardless of race—would be considered on the basis of their merits and achievements alone . . . and not on a perceived need to fill some kind of racial void.

A radical idea, indeed.

Not surprisingly, this was quickly labeled as discriminatory—prompting a series of court cases that eventually culminated in Tuesday’s Supreme Court decision which allowed Michigan to do as it pleases with its constitution.

Also not surprisingly, this decision prompted a 58 page dissent from Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotamayor in which she exclaimed that [emphasis added]:

“The Constitution does not protect racial minorities from political defeat. But neither does it give the majority free rein to erect selective barriers against racial minorities . . . The court ought not sit back and wish away, rather than confront, the racial inequality that exists in our society. It is this view that works harm, by perpetuating the facile notion that what makes race matter is acknowledging the simple truth that race does matter.”

Doesn’t this statement openly imply that minorities aren’t smart enough to get into college without the aid of racial preferencing? After all, Michigan wants to admit college students based on academic merit and not race . . . so what else are we to infer?

Indeed, this probably isn’t the platform upon which Sotamayor and other dissenters are operating. They are, as Sotamayor made clear in the latter half of that statement, operating on the tired premise that the United States is still full of racists; the majority of whom are white. Or African Americans like Justice Clarence Thomas, who apparently “hate their own race.” Per people like Sotamayor, Affirmative Action (or, racial preferencing) is the only way to rectify this.

If Michigan’s choosing to accept students on a completely color-blind basis isn’t honorable in the eyes of Sonia Sotamayor, what IS? What is the ultimate end in this struggle if not to curtail all racial discrimination?

The question in this debate is simple: is it acceptable to discriminate against a certain race because of the ills a former generation perpetrated?

We can play this game both ways, if it is the right of every person to seek reparations from—and even discriminate against—those whose ethnicity once did them wrong, then I should be allowed to discriminate against Germans for the way the Nazis treated the Jews, for I am part Jewish. I should be allowed to discriminate against our government officials for the way their predecessors treated the Cherokee Indians, for I am part Cherokee. I should be allowed to discriminate against the English for the way that they massacred the Irish at Wexford and Drogheda, for I am part Irish. The list goes on in perpetuity.

Where does it end?

The fact is that it can’t. Not down this path, at least.

It ends when people—especially our leaders—stop making everything about race.

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/most-severely-wounded-soldier-in-us-history-told-to-repay-thousands-of-dollars-to-va/","Most Severely Wounded Airman In US history Told To Repay Thousands Of Dollars To VA ⋆ Dc Gazette","Senior Airman Brian Kolfage JR., The most severely wounded Airman in US history, a man who lost three limbs, was recently contacted by the Veterans Administration Debt Management Center stating the he would be back charged $4,825 for over payment. Now, if being a triple amputee for Uncle Sam wasnâ€™t bad enough, now debt collectors are being sent after a decorated combat veteran.

Brian sustained his life changing injuries on Sept. 11 2004 when a 107 mm rocket exploded 3 feet from Airman Kolfage while on his second deployment in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Brian survived and carried on after he spent the 11 months at Walter Reed Medical Center he returned to the Air Force at Davis Monthan AFB in Tucson, Arizona. He is no longer active duty and receives monthly VA benefits.

Senior Airman Kolfage received notification on Sept. 12 2013 that file was being pulled and investigated by the VA for over payment by the VA. After an investigation, Brian found that the VA had over paid him for several years. Airman Kolfage must now repay the debt of $4,825 in monthly payments of $105 from his benefits until his debt is paid off. The VA claims the records state since he was not married at the time, he was not entitled to the full amount of benefits he had been receiving. Since Brian is married now, he provided legal documents to the VA , from there Brian was told an error has been made and the problem would be rectified and no debt would exist.

On Oct. 29th 2013, Kolfage received a letter from the Department of Veteran Affairs, Debt Management Center, and Operations Division Chief stating that his indebtedness balance of $4,825 has been reduced by $105 through the reduction of his monthly benefits. After several attempts in contacting the VA, Airman Kolfage has yet to hear back from anyone.



Three limbs, an arm and both his legs apparently arenâ€™t enough to give, they want bloodâ€¦ money. The less than 5 grand is petty money to be harassing a wounded combat veteran. The government seems to forget he was wounded because of their political agenda, if the government doesnâ€™t want to pay for veterans, MAYBE THEY SHOULDNâ€™T CREATE THEM. Maybe they want their money because Brian Kolfage is the most outspoken, highly decorated and most severely wounded Airman in US history? No need to make his life any harder by this ordeal by running his pockets.","2014-06-09 09:09:37","0","85.0","8.0","16.0","0.0","53.0","0.0","110.0","84.0","0.0","265.0","0.0","5.0","3","417","91.59","80.59","2.88","29.79","20.85","22.54","74.82","43.88","7.91","6.47","0.00","0.48","0.00","4.56","1.44","1.44","7.43","14.15","7.19","2.88","3.60","1.20","12.47","4.08","2.88","0.48","4.80","2.40","3.60","1.92","1.68","0.00","0.48","0.24","10.55","0.72","0.00","0.00","5.04","7.91","0.48","2.16","2.64","2.64","0.24","1.20","0.48","0.00","0.24","0.24","3.36","0.96","2.64","0.00","0.00","7.43","0.96","0.72","4.32","0.96","0.48","5.28","6.00","0.00","15.11","2.16","6.47","7.91","5.52","0.72","0.00","4.32","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.24","0.00","12.23","4.80","5.28","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","1.44","1873","7.97","26.0625","609","410","20","59.13","11.9","10.1","10.62","11.5","86","7.166666666666666","18.590243902439024","224","23.62","17","0.42","0","8","19","35","0","57","24","2","1","4","44","73","2","15","0","0","12","11","18","1","2","1","9","0","10","22","10","18","4","12","0","1","0","1"
"https://dcgazette.com/2014/sterling-the-deal-is-off-the-lawsuit-is-on/","Sterling: 'The deal is off. The Lawsuit is on' ⋆ Dc Gazette","Billionaire Clippers owner Donald Sterling is removing his support for the sale of his team and has asked his lawyer to go ahead with a $1 billion lawsuit against the NBA, according to several media reports.

“From the onset, I did not want to sell the Los Angeles Clippers,” Sterling said in a letter obtained by ESPN.com.

Talking about the NBA commissioner, Sterling added, “I believe that Adam Silver acted in haste by illegally ordering the forced sale of the Clippers, banning me for life from the NBA and imposing the fine. … The action taken by Adam Silver and the NBA constitutes a violation of my rights and fly in the face of the freedoms that are afforded to all Americans.”

DcGazette has reached out to both the Sterling camp and the NBA for comment.

“He’s unsold his club several times over the years,” Silver told CNN’s Rachel Nichols in an exclusive interview this week.

“There’s well-noted incidents in the league when he was right there at a closing and at the last minute decided not to sell.”

Sterling, 80, has been buried in controversy since a recording of a conversation with friend V. Stiviano revealed he made a series of racist comments.

The comments sparked outrage among NBA players, executives and fans. The commissioner fined Sterling $2.5 million and pushed to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise.

Sterling has seemingly changed his mind multiple times about what he wants to happen to the team.

In late May, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer laid down a $2 billion offer to buy the Clippers. Sterling’s estranged wife and co-owner of team, Shelly, agreed to sell the franchise to Ballmer.

Sterling initially indicated he would fight that sale. He also filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the NBA for its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise.

But his attorneys said last week that Sterling supported the team’s sale to Ballmer. The attorneys said last Wednesday that the lawsuit had yet to be withdrawn, but said that would likely happen in the coming days.

Now, it appears, the Sterling’s fight is back on.","2014-06-10 08:04:25","1","41.0","14.0","16.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","62.0","35.0","0.0","78.0","0.0","5.0","3","363","97.66","77.98","6.95","40.65","19.11","24.52","76.58","45.45","7.99","5.23","1.10","0.00","0.00","4.13","0.00","2.75","11.29","15.98","4.68","2.75","3.86","0.55","12.40","0.83","0.28","0.55","2.75","2.20","3.03","1.93","1.10","0.00","1.10","0.00","11.02","0.28","0.28","0.28","4.13","6.61","1.38","1.38","1.10","0.83","0.55","1.65","1.65","0.55","1.10","0.00","0.83","0.28","0.55","0.00","0.00","7.16","2.48","1.65","3.58","0.83","0.00","5.23","6.34","1.10","13.22","2.20","5.23","6.06","4.13","1.65","0.00","3.31","0.00","0.28","0.28","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.28","0.00","15.70","5.79","4.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.55","2.20","1.65","0.00","1.10","1665","7.73","23.125","502","361","20","70.02","10.8","8.0","10.5","10.4","73","12.5","17.32864265927978","199","20.81","13","0.44","0","12","10","46","0","43","15","0","0","2","57","45","2","17","0","0","12","9","16","0","0","1","16","0","14","21","6","10","2","10","1","1","0","1"
"https://dcgazette.com/2014/are-disabled-americans-rights-being-violated/","Are Disabled American's Rights being Violated? ⋆ Dc Gazette","Have you ever seen someone park in a handicap space, with a handicapÂ tag,Â and you know they are by no means disabled? Maybe they’re some young teens that might be borrowing grandma’s car for a bit. Or have you ever heard someone laughing about the fact that they are using a loved one’s placard that has passed on? Well states across the country are catching on to these illegally used handicap placards and they are putting a stop to it.

Many cities across the country do not charge people with handicap stickers for parking at parking meters, but that is coming to an end in several major cities. Chicago, San Francisco, Portland, and many other cities are changing their free parking policy for the disabled. The reason for this change is because of the outrageous number of handicap stickers that are being doled out and so many people are misusing this privilege when they are not truly disabled. The Chicago Police Department found that about 2 out of every 10 handicap placard was illegal in a police sting over the last year.Â This doesn’t include the ones given out by doctors when there is no medical necessity for it.

Many people will be up in arms about this, but this fraud is costing these cities millions of dollars in taxpayer money for refunds being processedÂ to disabled drivers for parking, most of whom are not really disabled. Not only is it costingÂ money, but parkingÂ problems because people who carry these placards are allowed to park as long as they want. They can park forÂ hours, days, or even weeks with no consequences, hogging up parking spaces.

“In the ’70s, when these programs were developed, it was never the notion that people with disabilities are poor. It was that the meters were not accessible. You had to get from the space to the sidewalk, and you remember in some cases you had to put a coin in and turn a handle,” says SFMTA Director Ed Reiskin. So, the argument isÂ now that meters are handicap accessible, there is no reason for the free parking.

Although this seems unfair, some states are still trying to help the disabled by giving them special meter-exempt placards that make them exempt from paying at meters if their doctor will attest to the fact that the person cannot physically pay the meter. In doing this, Chicago has decreased their meter-exempt disabled by 92%. As well, they are ensuring that parking meters are becoming easier to pay. Some cities have installed meters that you can pay withÂ your phone.

In changing this policy, many states are seeing positive changes. Parking revenue is up and parking has opened up (although not much in some of the more populated cities) and people with illegal placards are easier to identify because of the new placards being distributed for those who are physically unable to pay the meters.

There will probably be backlash from activists, but with the positive changes in these cities, they probably won’t be going back to the old ways.","2014-12-15 21:43:29","0","39.0","9.0","16.0","0.0","9.0","0.0","62.0","39.0","0.0","90.0","0.0","5.0","3","518","65.65","63.60","37.64","58.64","23.55","20.66","80.50","54.05","11.39","4.05","0.00","0.00","1.54","0.00","2.51","7.34","6.56","14.48","11.39","5.02","5.41","2.70","15.44","3.09","1.35","1.16","0.77","3.09","3.67","2.70","0.97","0.00","0.39","0.00","8.11","0.19","0.00","0.19","0.00","12.36","1.74","2.90","0.58","3.28","1.74","3.47","1.16","0.39","0.77","0.00","1.35","0.19","0.97","0.00","0.00","5.21","0.39","0.39","3.09","0.97","0.58","2.70","10.04","1.35","14.48","2.51","8.49","3.67","2.90","0.00","0.00","3.09","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.00","11.58","4.05","4.63","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.39","0.39","1.16","0.39","0.19","2321","7.54","23.772727272727273","728","514","23","65.76","11.2","9.6","10.57","12.1","91","8.9","18.00171206225681","254","21.55","3","0.51","0","14","5","59","0","68","37","2","1","6","61","13","0","52","0","0","23","4","29","1","0","5","14","0","20","13","28","13","29","13","4","3","0","3"

Recently on Morning Joe, when asked about Hillary’s “dead broke” blunder, Brzezinski slammed Hillary defenders Jeremy Peters [NYT], left wingers Thomas Roberts, Eugene Robinson and Joe Scarborough. Mika accused them of being “afraid” of the Clintons, of tiptoeing around them, and of holding their fire in hopes of being granted an interview with Hillary. View the startling video at the bottom of the page.

JEREMY PETERS: Are these comments a little tone deaf? Perhaps. But it’s very hard to connect them politically to her policies. Obviously as you were alluding to, the Clintons are known for their economic populism. This is very different from, say, Mitt Romney asking to — making a $10,000 bet during a debate, right? Because his business interests became a much bigger issue in the campaign because you could link them to policies that Democrats said hurt working class people. I don’t think you’ll hear those same types of arguments used against the Clintons.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: It’s not just a little tone deaf. I don’t think it gets a pass. Everybody stop. Everybody stop giving passes hoping you’re going get some sort of interview. Stop. All of you. It is not good. Okay? Seriously. These are — these people when you were watching them leave the White House, it was being reported over the video of the inauguration how much they would make during speeches. And for her to do a book and to have a section on this saying we were did dead broke, it was hard. Let me just tell you, that shows just how contrived the book is. Because that is a huge mistake. And you would think everything else is planned out so perfectly, it does enough to say nothing, but say something —

THOMAS ROBERTS: Isn’t that a way to explain away the money they have been able to make because people want to chastise them for living the American dream, and going out there —

BRZEZINSKI: No!

HALPERIN: They would be eviscerated. To me what this is about, if she decides to run, she becomes President of the United States unless she stops herself. And the level of tone deafness of I think not just these comments, but some of the other things in the book, to me, it’s a huge —

BRZEZINSKI: If I were a middle-class American having trouble paying my mortgage and wondering how my kid is going handle the student debt —

ROBERTS: She’s not your candidate.

BRZEZINSKI: I would not be excited about this candidate.

ROBERTS: So the guy from Home Springs [sic], Arkansas, Bill Clinton, you wouldn’t still find him relatable?

BRZEZINSKI: You guys get over it. By the way: Bill Clinton–he’s not running.

ROBERTS: They’re a couple. They have a relationship.

PETERS: She’s certainly not the first wealthy American to run for president, too. Let’s not forget that. It’s not like the public doesn’t have a history of electing people who are extremely wealthy.

BRZEZINSKI: Jeremy, we’re not judging wealthy Americans, OK, but when Mitt Romney had an elevator inside his second house, we he went on for hours about it.

EUGENE ROBINSON: A car elevator.

BRZEZINSKI: A car elevator, you’re right. And for Hillary Clinton to talk about being dead broke upon leaving eight years of the White House when it was all but obvious that they would be making hundreds of millions of dollars.

PETERS: But they were dead broke; they were $12 million in debt.

BRZEZINSKI: And it was hard. Should we move on?

JOE SCARBOROUGH: This dead horse has officially been beaten.

BRZEZINSKI: Why am I the only one who knows the truth here? You all are afraid.

SCARBOROUGH: I mean, Mika, you can put the stick away. You’ve been hitting this horse now for what, for 19 minutes?

BRZEZINSKI: Joe, if we’re going to talk about Hillary Clinton, let’s have an honest conversation.

SCARBOROUGH: I think we just did.

BRZEZINSKI: I think we, Halperin and I, just did.

A map released by AEI-Ideas, consisting of U.S. states and correlating countries gives insight on just how much wealth America packs.

The map was created by pairing economic output in the U.S. in 2012 to foreign countries with comparable gross domestic products, using Beta data and Wikipedia for GDP by country. The states were matched with the country closest in economic size since 2012.

Americaâ€™s total GDP of $16.2 trillion in 2012 is represented in the map by an astounding compilation of countries, also noting that the U.S. produced 22.3% of world GDP in 2012, while only making up 4.4% of the worldâ€™s population.

According to AEI-Ideas:

1. Americaâ€™s largest state economy is California, which produced $2.003 trillion of economic output in 2012, just slightly below Italyâ€™s GDP in the same year of $2.013 trillion. In 2012, California would have been tied with Italy as the 9th largest economy in the world. And Californiaâ€™s population is only 38 million compared to Italyâ€™s population of 61 million, which means California produces the same economic output as Italy with 37% fewer people. Thatâ€™s a testament to the superior, world-class productivity of the American worker.

2. Americaâ€™s second largest state economy â€“ Texas â€“produced $1.4 trillion of economic output in 2012, placing it just slightly behind the worldâ€™s 13th largest country by GDP â€“ Australia â€“ with $1.56 trillion of economic output.

3. Even with all of its oil wealth, Saudi Arabiaâ€™s GDP in 2012 at $711 billion was less than GDP in Florida ($777 billion) and just slightly more than the GDP in Illinois ($695 billion).

4. New Yorkâ€™s GDP in 2012 of $1.205 trillion was slightly more than Mexicoâ€™s GDP of $1.18 trillion, even though Mexicoâ€™s population of 120.8 million people is 6.2 times larger than the number of people living in New York (19.6 million). Another example of the world-class productivity of the American workforce.

5. Washington state produces almost as much economic output ($375.7 billion) as Venezuela ($382 billion), even though Venezuelaâ€™s population (30 million) is more than four times larger than Washingtonâ€™s (6.9 million).

6. Likewise, capitalist West Virginia produces about the same GDP as communist Cuba, even though Cubaâ€™s population is more than six times larger than West Virginiaâ€™s.","2014-06-09 07:50:51","0","40.0","8.0","16.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","62.0","37.0","0.0","82.0","0.0","5.0","3","396","98.68","43.98","27.57","39.30","19.80","27.02","61.62","33.84","1.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.52","5.56","18.18","3.28","4.29","3.79","0.00","5.05","9.34","8.08","0.76","14.65","2.78","1.26","1.01","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.59","1.26","3.54","0.25","0.25","0.51","2.78","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.25","0.51","0.00","4.55","0.25","0.51","4.04","0.00","0.00","1.52","2.27","0.00","13.64","0.00","11.62","2.02","5.05","0.00","0.25","3.03","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.20","6.82","3.79","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","1.01","0.00","3.54","3.79","1722","7.53","20.75","571","376","28","66.33","10.8","7.3","13.04","10.4","77","5.375","15.551489361702128","186","17.5","20","0.36","0","4","73","23","0","71","27","9","5","1","51","68","0","13","0","0","1","1","18","0","0","1","4","0","1","12","9","7","1","12","2","0","0","1"
"https://dcgazette.com/2014/when-calling-a-holocaust-a-holocaust-is-just-not-allowed/","When Calling A Holocaust A Holocaust Is Just Not Allowed ⋆ Dc Gazette","Jessa Duggar probably did not understand what sort of can of worms would open once she published her heartfelt words after visiting the Holocaust Museum. Â Here is what she said:

I walked through the Holocaust Museum again today… very sobering. Millions of innocents denied the most basic and fundamental of all rights–their right to life. One human destroying the life of another deemed “less than human.” Racism, stemming from the evolutionary idea that man came from something less than human; that some people groups are “more evolved” and others “less evolved.” A denying that our Creator–GOD–made us human from the beginning, all of ONE BLOOD and ONE RACE, descendants of Adam. The belief that some human beings are “not fit to live.” So they’re murdered. Slaughtered. Kids with Down syndrome or other disabilities. The sickly. The elderly. The sanctity of human life varies not in sickness or health, poverty or wealth, elderly or pre-born, little or lots of melanin [making you darker or lighter skinned], or any other factor. “If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain; If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not He that pondereth the heart consider it? and He that keepeth thy soul, doth not He know it? and shall not He render to every man according to his works?” (Proverbs 24:10-12) May we never sit idly by and allow such an atrocity to happen again. Not this generation. We must be a voice for those who cannot speak up for themselves. Because EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS. #ProLifeFollow

Somehow, this statement was taken to be a comparison of THE Holocaust, an atrocious event in history, with the holocaustic, as is in the dictionary definition of the word, slaughter of innocent humans in the form of abortion. Â Ms. Duggar is not shy about her pro-life stance and understands that all human life is sacred no matter how large or small, productive or past prime, and in every color, shape and size. Â For some reason, it took the left a few days to notice the statement and she’s taken a beating from the pro-abortion forces for their leap to a conclusion that does not seem to be ther. Â She should not be afraid of being the victim of this mistake. Â The same thing happened to Pope Saint John Paul II.

Having walked through the Holocaust Museum in Paris, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam and having visited Dachau outside of Munich in Germany, there are no words strong enough to describe the horror of man’s inhumanity to man when a movement like The Holocaust takes hold. Â 13-14 million people were slaughtered by a murderous regime. Â We all know the 6 million Jews number, but they were by no means alone:

Jews 5.9 million

Soviet prisoners of war 2â€“3 million

Ethnic Poles 1.8â€“2 million

Romani (gypsies) 220,000â€“1,500,000

Disabled 200,000â€“250,000

Freemasons 80,000

Slovenes 20,000â€“25,000

Homosexuals 5,000â€“15,000

Jehovah’s Witnesses 2,500â€“5,000

Eyewitness accounts state that the Romani were treated particularly badly. Â There were prisoners at each of the camps from every major religion. Â The only faithful that were allowed to practice were Catholics as there were so many priests and bishops held for dissenting the Nazis. Â These are the details that Americans only learn when they visit the work and concentration camps. Â The information is available, but for some reason not completely presented.

The event of the 20th century we call The Holocaust, in the case of Ms. Duggar and Pope John Paul II, is being used to score political points against those who revere life and believe that all human life is to be treated equally as it comes from our Creator. Â It is being used as a tool to further the goals of people who believe that killing children in the womb is more a matter of preference than killing innocent life – the very meaning of the word “holocaust.” Â In one of the great ironies of over politicized American life today, we are not allowed at all to equate the two, or in the words of the pro-abortion sorts “compare” them.

There is no comparison of the Nazi regime killing 13-14 million people in an effort to cleanse the European population of “undesirables” and killing babies in the womb. Â They are ultimately the same. Â A holocaust. Â A systematic killing of innocent humans. Â And no, people who believe in the sanctity of life cannot just stand by and watch it happen.","2014-10-01 15:44:46","0","47.0","10.0","16.0","0.0","8.0","0.0","68.0","37.0","0.0","87.0","0.0","5.0","3","804","85.65","62.22","9.65","13.88","19.61","19.03","78.98","46.64","9.45","4.35","0.12","1.12","0.75","1.37","1.00","5.10","8.21","13.18","6.34","3.11","5.47","2.61","11.82","4.85","2.99","1.12","5.35","3.48","3.86","1.49","2.36","0.37","1.12","0.12","8.58","0.12","0.00","0.75","1.12","13.56","3.36","1.74","1.12","3.48","1.99","4.60","0.87","0.50","0.37","0.00","3.23","0.62","2.49","0.75","0.00","6.09","1.24","0.62","3.36","0.87","0.12","3.48","7.34","0.25","7.59","1.12","4.10","2.36","1.24","0.37","0.12","0.37","1.74","2.74","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.54","5.10","5.22","0.37","0.37","0.37","0.00","0.87","2.86","0.50","0.50","0.37","3498","7.51","22.47222222222222","1069","774","41","69.21","10.4","8.3","10.56","10.6","144","7.25","17.001860465116277","407","19.17","33","0.46","0","31","48","91","0","99","61","3","1","5","111","63","4","44","0","0","32","6","36","2","1","1","20","0","28","23","14","19","25","21","7","6","0","3"
"https://dcgazette.com/2014/watch-obamas-a-ceo-who-should-resign-and-a-long-list-of-reasons-why/","[Watch] Obama's a CEO Who Should Resign and a Long List of Reasons Why ⋆ Dc Gazette","Judge Jeanine Pirro makes the point that if the United States were a corporation (which some say it actually is) that the board members would be asking for the CEOâ€™s resignation.

She puts it bluntly saying, â€œThe world is going to Hell in a hand basket and Barack Obama doesnâ€™t have the leadership, the instincts or even the interest to get America back on track.â€

To support her assertions, Judge Pirro points out how 60% of Americans disapprove of his handling of the Israel/Hamas conflict while 57% similarly disapprove of his handling of the situations in Ukraine, Iraq and Afghanistan. Even worse, 68% percent disapprove of his actions on the southern border and consider it to be a very serious problem.

Obamaâ€™s response is to a House bill that thwarts his unconstitutional invasion from the south was to chastise those who want to correct the problem and mock them for going out on vacation. He, the king of recreation and fundraising during crises, has no room to talk.

The socialist in the White House labels the common-sense House response to his tyranny as â€œmost extreme and unworkable,â€ and he may be right, it is extremely patriotic and unworkable in the face of socialist tyranny.

Judge Pirro asks Obama why the Border Patrol agents arenâ€™t on the border, and points out that most of the so-called children are teens or older and most of those are males. She asks, â€œOther countries close their borders, why donâ€™t we?â€

Pirro points out how many Border Patrol officers are stationed inland, offering the opportunity for illegals to enter and then be apprehended and put into the induction into Democrat voter system. She asks if this is really a humanitarian crisis, where is the UN and its emergency relief coordinator.

She mentions the recent shipment of 1,000 illegals to Obamaâ€™s hometown of Chicago, the murder capital of America and too many inconsistencies and constitutional violations to enumerate. She also points out his many foreign policy mistakes, all of which points to that demand for a resignation she opened her open with.

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/rinos-mccain-and-graham-say-america-should-surrender-to-central-american-children/","RINO's McCain and Graham Say America Should Surrender to Central American Children ⋆ Dc Gazette","More proof that the so-called crisis at the southern border is a premeditated political ploy. Itâ€™s complete with Obamaprops, this time they are pathetic children, guaranteed to show him as the caring â€œdear leaderâ€ who just wants to help those in desperate need. Most Americans don’t realize he’s the one who put them there.

Right on cue, two of the â€œgang of eightâ€ RINOs have come out in support of giving in to the â€œinevitabilityâ€ that America, the last great superpower, is incapable of defending its border from invading children. White flag in hand, Lindsey Graham and John McCain offered surrender; their version of a solution to the chaos is to simply remove the laws.

McCain wants to set up local offices in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, so the kids can border crash from home, and then be transferred to the United States. We transport them on our dime and we hold the gun to our own collective heads for them.

Lindsey Graham, who is as usual joined with McCain at the pelvis or hip, told Reuters, â€œWeâ€™d be able to make a more intelligent decision about whatâ€™s legitimate and you wouldnâ€™t have the problem of people showing up, dropped off at the door. That makes sense to me.â€

In keeping with Obamaâ€™s plan to go around Congress on the issue of amnesty, U.S. Rep Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) said of that type of plan, â€œI think itâ€™s something we need to discuss,â€ adding, â€œYou donâ€™t need legislation to do that.â€

Obama can act unilaterally to establish an emergency refugee program. There is his amnesty, here comes his pen.

There is not a free for all abandonment of reason and common sense among lawmakers, though. Alabama Senator Richard Shelby said, â€œI wouldnâ€™t do that, the more they come, the more will come. There will be hundreds of thousands.â€

A typical refugee program provides legal work status and expedited green card as well as citizenship.

Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies said, â€œCreating a new â€œrefugeeâ€ program would only exacerbate the problem and inspire even more families and kids to abandon their homes for a free pass to live in America.â€

â€œSuch a response also would make a mockery of our legitimate refugee program intended to aid those who are persecuted, and would strain its resources unnecessarily,â€ she said, adding that the administration should instead ramp up their efforts to reunite the immigrants with their families back home.

â€œInstead of looking for ways to whitewash this self-inflicted policy disaster by characterizing it as a humanitarian crisis, the lawmakers who favor mass migration should concede that their talk ofÂ amnestyÂ and neglect of enforcement were a mistake, and work to reverse the damage.â€

The creaking sounds you hear are the flood gates opening, and the nation collapsing under the unsupportable weight of the populations of these three nations plus Mexico being relocated to America.

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/president-muslim-faith-quran-ok-lie/","A President, His Muslim Faith, And His Quran... Is It Ok For Him To Lie? ⋆ Dc Gazette","Barack Obama has made it clear he stands with Islam. He has declared that America has never, and never will be at war with Islam. In his book “Audacity of Hope, ” he writes, “I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction” He said the call to prayer is the prettiest sound on earth. Can you recall any president standing with a religion? Every president before Obama has stood with this country and its principles. Not on the principles of Islam or any other religion. On numerous occasions, President Obama has mentioned the Holy Quran. Well, let’s take a little time to discuss “Satans little black book.”

Quran 65:4 states you can rape, marry, and divorce pre-pubescent girls. Quran 4:3, 4:24, 5:89, 33:50, 58:3 states you can enslave for sex and work. Quran 4:34 You can beat your slaves to include your wife. Quran 9:29 kill Jews and Christians if they don’t convert or pay Jizya tax. Quran 8:12, 47:4 crucify and amputate non-Muslims. This is one that we should really pay attention to. Quran 9:111 you will kill non-Muslims to receive 72 virgins in heaven. They flew those planes on that day and were shocked to find out Muhammad had lied to them. There are more, but I want to cover just one more. Quran 3:26, 3:54, 9:3, 16:106, and 40:28 tell Muslims to lie to strengthen Islam.

Does anyone believe the president has lied to the American people. He said we are not at war with Islam, which is a lie. This country is at war with anyone who thinks it’s ok to beat your wife. I don’t care if you’re Muslim, Christian, or Jew, it’s not OK to cut the heads off of babies because their parents are of a different religion. We stand against anyone who thinks it’s ok to take women and children as sex slaves by those claiming spoils of war. We stand against any pedophile who thinks he can force marriage on a nine-year old little girl. We are at war with anyone who controls others with fear. ISIS is Islam and like it or not we are at war. So if the president stands with Islam, then it’s clear he doesn’t stand with us. I am asking you America to stand with me and the Marines4Truth. Please like our page and help spread the truth. The truth can only hurt if we allow them to keep us from it.

The American people are sick and tired of being misrepresented by someone we are not. The president has said we are not a Nation of Christianity. I don’t know what history book he has been reading, but he should have a talk with his history teacher. This is One Nation Under God and founded by men who were Christians. No matter what your religious beliefs you cannot rewrite history. Washington we have been lied to, which is ok by the Quran 16:106. It’s not ok for the American people and we cannot have a president who thinks it is.

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/parting-words-isis-leader-and-most-dangerous-man-in-the-world-said-when-released-from-u-s-detention/","Parting Words ""ISIS"" Leader And Most Dangerous Man In The World Said, When Released From U.S.Detention. ⋆ Dc Gazette","When Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi left from a U.S. detention camp in 2009, the leader now of ISIS issued some chilling words to reservists from Long Island. The Islam extremist some are now calling the up most dangerous man in the world had a few parting words to his captors as he was released from the biggest U.S. detention camp in Iraq in 2009. “He said, â€˜I will see you guys in New York,‘” recalls Army Col. Kenneth King, then the commanding officer of Camp Bucca. King didn’t take these words from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as a threat. Al-Baghdadi knew that many of his captors were from New York, reservists with the 306 Military Police Battalion, a unit based on Long Island that includes many members of the NYPD and the FDNY. The camp is named after FDNY Fire Marshal Ronald Bucca, who died at the World Trade Center in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. King figured that al-Baghdadi was just saying that he had known all along that it was all essentially a joke, that he had to wait and he will be free to go back to what he was doing “Like, â€˜This is no big thing, I will see you on the block,'” King says. King had not imagined that in fewer that five years he would see news reports that al-Baghdadi was the leader of ISIS, the ultra-extremist army that was sweeping through Iraq toward Baghdad. “I’m not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but I’m a little surprised it was him,” King says. “He was a bad dude, but he wasn’t the worst of the worst.” King allows that along with being surprised and frustrated on an absolute personal level. “We spent how many missions and how many soldiers put at risk when we caught this Man and we just released him,” King says. During the four years that al-Baghdadi was in custody, there had been no way for the Americans to predict what a danger he will become. Al-Baghdadi has not even been assigned to Compound 14, that was for the most virulently extremist Sunnis. “A lot of times, the really bad guys tended to work behind the scenes because each one would like being invisible,” the other officer says. “The worst of the worst were kept in One area” King says. “I do not recall him being in that group.” Al-Baghdadi was also apparently not one of the extremists who presided over Sharia courts that sought to enforce fundamentalist Islamic law among their fellow prisoners. One extremist made himself known after the guards put TV sets outside the 16-foot chain-link fence that surrounded each compound. An American officer saw a big crowd form in front of one, but came back a short time later to see not a soul. “Some guy came up and shooed them all away because TV was Western,” recalls the officer, who asked to stay anonymous. “So we identified who that guy was, put a report in his file, kept him under observation for other behaviors.” The officer says the guards kept constant watch for clues among the prisoners for coalescing groups and ascending leaders. “You can tell when somebody is eliciting leadership skills, flag him, watch him further, how much leadership they’re excerpting and with whom,” the other officer says. “You have to constantly stay after it because it constantly changes, sometimes day by day.” The guards would seek to disrupt the courts along with and any nascent organizations and hierarchies by moving inmates to different compounds, though keeping the Sunnis and the Shiites separate. “The Bloods with the Bloods and the Crips with the Crips, that kind of thing,” King says. The guards would then move the prisoners again and again. That would also keep the prisoners from spotting any possible weaknesses in security. “The detainees have nothing but time,” King says. “They’re looking at patterns, they’re looking at routines, they’re looking for opportunities.” As al-Baghdadi and the 26,000 other prisoners were learning the need for patience in studying the enemy, the guards would be constantly searching for home-made weapons made from what the prisoners dug up, the camp having been built on a former junkyard. “People think of a detainee operation, they think it’s a sleepy Hogan’s Heroes-type camp,” the other officer says.

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/obama-mafia-style-extortion-politics-loaded-immigration-gun-held-to-republican-heads/","Loaded Immigration Gun Held to Republican Heads ⋆ Dc Gazette","The open border Obama surrogates are out pressing their case as their full-frontal assault on American sovereignty enters the home stretch. The next month will see strong pressure being exerted upon House members to cave to pressure and take the easy way out. Fitting the perfect stereotypical caricature of New Jersey, Chicago or New York crime bosses, the Obama family representatives are threatening House Republicans, in another blatant abuse of power, to accept their offers that canâ€™t be refused. The leadership of the Democrat thugocracy declared on Thursday that neither they nor Obama are bluffing. Either House Representatives do as the Senate demands or Obama will act dictatorially. They have until the end of July. Beyond that, a failure to act as the Senate and Obama regime see fit in granting amnesty will bring out the imperial pen, according to the Democrats. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) said on Thursday that, â€œWe’re at the end of the line. We’re notÂ bluffingÂ by setting a legislative deadline for them to act. Their first job is to govern, and in the absence of governing, then you see executive actions.” Menendez is describing an absence of governing â€œto his satisfaction,â€ not an absence of governing, there is a huge difference. What heâ€™s establishing is a false premise for subversion of our Constitution. Fellow turncoat, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) chimed in, saying, “I don’t know how much more time he thinks he needs, but I hope that Speaker Boehner will speak up today, and if he does not, the president will borrow the power that is needed to solve the problems of immigration.” Heâ€™s going to â€œborrow the power?â€ Is borrowing something without being granted permission also known as stealing, and is that not a violation of the law, Mr. Durbin? Who is he borrowing the power from, the people or the House that is telling him no? Is every Democrat a treasonous scofflaw? The family member from New York, Sen. Chuck Schumer exposed their extortionist tactics for all to see. He said that if Republicans fear Obamaâ€™s dictatorial acts, they have at their disposal â€œa very good antidote.â€ They can â€œput a bill on the floor.â€ These Senators and the Executive Branch feel right at home commanding action to the House of Representatives. Separation of powers, it would appear, no longer applies in their minds and we no longer have three co-equal branches of government. Schumer had some disparaging words for House Speaker Boehner, saying, â€œHe’s, like, shooting his parents and then throwing himself on the mercy of the court as an orphan.â€ Schumerâ€™s solution is political extortion. â€œPass a bill, and that won’t happen. If they don’t bring any bill to the floor, the president has no choice â€” on a humanitarian basis and on a policy basis â€” to act where he can on his own.â€ Boehner staked out the House position on Tuesday, saying, “The president’s making this harder and harder every day for us to try to deal with this in a responsible way. We’ve got a humanitarian disaster on the border. Most of it, at the president’s own making, in my opinion, and so it makes our jobs much more difficult because of the actions he’s taken or not taken with regard to the border.” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) is working House leadership from within as well, attempting to persuade the new Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy to bring a bill to the floor. McCarthy indicated that the current border mess has made that impossible. House members do have another option. They could make it clear to Obama and his mob bosses that if they are willing to launch an immediate investigation into the usurperâ€™s background. Everybody knows heâ€™s a criminal fraud. Maybe now theyâ€™ll be motivated to prove it.

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/note-to-republican-leadership-repeal-obamacare-in-its-entirety-please/","Note To Republican Leadership: Repeal ObamaCare In Its Entirety","Now that the dust is settling after Tuesday’s tidal wave election, and the messages of what incoming Republican leadership’s agenda is when it comes to job creation and getting many Americans back to work is coming into focus, the one law that a cross section of Americans would like to see repealed in its entirety is the Affordable Care Act, the not so affectionately nicknamed “ObamaCare” that was far more than just a takeover of the American healthcare system. Â In the face of this, the hesitation on the part of the chiefs of the Republican Party to plainly state the vote for repeal of ObamaCare is in the plan is alarming.

Many Americans discovered the hard way that “If you like your plan, you can keep your plan” was a bold faced lie, but what was also discovered AFTER the bill was passed was the rest of what was in it that had far more impact on people’s lives than just a change in who provided health insurance. Â (Nancy Pelosi, you sly, sneaky witch.)

The full time work week was defined down from 40 hours to 30.

A medical device tax was levied on all medical equipment, increasing expenses and chilling innovations that keep people alive and comfortable.

The fine to employers who do not provide health insurance to their employees is cheaper than providing the insurance. Â Any business person with an eye on the bottom line is going to go the less expensive route.

ObamaCare is chock full of this sort of crap. Â In addition, with the increase in paperwork and coding to be done at the doctor’s office level and the low reimbursements from ObamaCare insurance plans, physicians are dropping out of the plans themselves and the medical profession at alarming rates that make any discussion of “affordability” a pale concern behind service provider availability. Â Actually being able to find a doctor is going to be a lot harder.

While the specific line items targeted for repeal are the low hanging fruit to which many Democrats agree need to go, why not shoot for the whole enchilada and be bold about it? Â After all, many of their constituents don’t like the law any more than conservatives do. Â Every poll published asking Americans if they approve of ObamaCare pans it. Â All of the newly elected Republican senators campaigned on the law’s repeal. Â It’s obvious that the people want it to just go away.

In a subscription only op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, House Speaker John Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell renewed their “commitment” to repealing ObamaCare. Â They were more specific about repealing the pieces that will be easy to pass. Â Well, sirs, with all due respect from the people who put you back in your jobs, we the people want ObamaCare to go away. Â All of it, not just the easy parts. Â Yes, if an immediate repeal is blocked, by all means go for the line items, but an overall goal should be an outright repeal of the law.","2014-11-06 14:09:50","1","35.0","8.0","16.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","63.0","39.0","0.0","83.0","0.0","5.0","3","518","94.98","65.04","15.32","62.38","24.67","21.04","80.31","46.33","7.72","2.70","0.00","0.19","1.35","0.00","1.16","5.02","10.23","14.86","7.34","3.09","3.47","0.97","12.36","5.41","2.90","1.74","0.58","5.02","4.63","3.28","1.35","0.58","0.19","0.39","6.18","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","9.07","0.77","0.77","1.54","1.93","2.51","2.70","1.16","0.39","0.19","0.39","2.70","0.58","1.93","0.00","0.19","8.11","0.58","2.32","4.05","0.77","0.97","2.51","8.69","1.74","12.93","3.09","7.34","2.90","4.25","0.58","0.19","2.32","0.00","0.19","0.97","0.19","0.19","0.39","0.19","0.00","11.78","3.86","4.05","0.00","0.00","0.19","0.00","0.19","1.54","1.54","0.39","0.00","2309","7.88","25.0","723","517","21","63.43","12.3","10.5","9.87","12.7","99","25.75","19.49957446808511","273","21.67","15","0.48","0","11","3","60","0","66","39","5","0","4","90","43","5","28","0","0","15","7","20","2","0","2","17","0","18","16","16","10","17","17","6","6","0","2"

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/watch-the-simple-lecture-on-islam-obama-skipped/","[Watch] The Simple Lecture On Islam Obama Skipped ⋆ Dc Gazette","Wednesday night, somewhere buried in that speech that not many people watched outside of political junkies not following the pennant races, was an Alinsky-ism if there ever was one: “ISIL” (or ISIS or IS) has nothing to do with Islam. Â Calling something the opposite of what it is, or refuting the definition of “is”. Â Classic trying to make the audience fall for a falsehood.

One problem: the first letter in all three of ISIS, ISIL and IS stands for “Islamic”. Â If the group is calling itself part of Islam and invoking the “religion” as the motivation for their deeds, then the group is part of Islam. Â Sorry, Charlie.

Where this gets interesting, is that “Christian” Barack Obama cannot bring himself to tell the truth about the “religion of peace”. Â Thankfully, a convert to Christianity FROM Islamic Morocco who has studied Islam, posted a relatively short lecture/sermon on Islam and how ISIS-ISIL-IS is following Muhammad’s methods to the letter:

http://youtu.be/QxzOVSMUrGM

Talk about getting an education fast. Â It looks like Lt. Col. Ralph Peters was on the mark when he said we need to kill all the ISIS people and their pet goats. Â Otherwise, this is going to turn into what the Crusaders discovered long ago – a never ending cycle of advances and retreats on both sides. Â The less violent among the Islamic peoples may not actively try to blow things up, but they aren’t going to speak out against the violence in large enough numbers to make much of a difference to passionate terrorists who sacrifice everything to get to their 72 virgins and have no problem using anything and everything they can steal to do it. Â As ISIS-ISIL-IS proves, Islamic terrorism is a real, live version of Hydra – cut off one head and several others spawn. Â With over a billion followers on the planet, there’s plenty of fertile grounds for recruiting, too.

As much of a horrific gauntlet thrown the videos of James Foley and Steven Sotloff being beheaded may be, perhaps now the American people are waking up to the fact that President George W. Bush was not kidding when he said this is going to be a long, drawn out fight. Â As far as the Islamists are concerned, those of us who are not, must be converted or die – and they are willing to martyr themselves for the cause.

This is what Barack Obama will not admit, at least not in public. Â We Christians or Jews or atheists or members of any other faith are in the crosshairs of ISIS because we are not Islamists.

It's Corrupt Politicians That Are The Issue! ⋆ Dc Gazette","The enemy believes by attacking us they can make us turn on one another. Blame one another based on whether we have a green card or not. I know there are enemies from within and I pray they read this message. I wish they didn’t believe what they see on the news. They watch our news and it supports their beliefs. In a city of five million people, reporters flock to a few having a bad day. The more doom and gloom the more reporters show up. People think we are all out robbing banks and murdering one another. When they get here they see it’s not the case. They never see the kindness and the love that most of us share.

Once they get here some change their mind. They begin to get a taste of the American dream. They live like kings and queens compared to where they once lived. They see their children happy, and with that there is hope. The only problem is they are controlled with fear. They are told if they talk their lives are over. They believe they will die, go to jail, or face deportation. They have to know that no matter what they are planning, it’s not too late to change their minds. There will be no mercy for anyone involved in harming a child. They are stuck in the middle and see no way out. Well, if they are reading this there is a way out. Go to the authorities and save your kid’s life.

If Timothy Mcveigh would have driven that Ryder truck to a police station and told the cops of his plans. If he had changed his mind, he would be a free man today. Instead, he is six feet under in his own grave. If attacked the enemy believes that we will take it out on people for not having a green card. There are over 11 million undocumented people in this country. Over 90% love this country and all it provides. It provides opportunity for a better life for our kids. It’s not guaranteed and we are not entitled. These people work, providing food and shelter for their kids. They know we have to close the border to protect our country. They also know they have to follow our laws. Like it or not these people are here.

The most important thing is to seal our borders, and document everyone here. I hear people say put them all on trains and deport them. Well, you will spend 100 years rounding them up. You will go all that time having people here we don’t know. This issue has been ignored for fifty years. Now you have Kerry advertising free rides to America. They have taken a broken system and broken our laws to make it worse. My biggest concern is we continue to do nothing as this situation gets worse. Kerry and Obama have increased the illegal numbers entering the country. They have paid our hard-earned money to finance their crime. We need to focus on the source of our problem. That’s the criminals at the top who created this mess.

Nancy Pelosi has the nerve to insult God by comparing this to Jesus. Jesus would never put these kids in danger like they have. If they cared so much why haven’t they opened their own doors. Tell me Washington how many of these children have you tucked into your own bed. You provide free housing, food, and clothing coming out of our pocket. Everything our people work for is given to those who never earned it. The eleven million people already here are not even being discussed by politicians. Every four years we hear about plans to create jobs. The unemployment numbers are more than high enough. Why has Obama and Kerry opened our doors for more unemployment.

This country is represented by every race color and religion. This war is not with Mexicans. It is with anyone who brings harm to our home. We will seek out every snake in the grass. We know there are many in this country, and it’s never to late to change your mind. It’s only a crime if you don’t change your mind. The mistakes of yesterday are behind us. Washington what are you doing for the success of tomorrow? Seal our border to protect everyone that’s here. Stop the illegal import of anyone, until we know everyone in our home. So to all of you enemies from within. The people of this country will not turn on each other. We will all be turning on you… God Bless each and everyone… Semper Fi, Shep","2014-08-01 07:12:55","0","59.0","10.0","16.0","0.0","30.0","0.0","80.0","60.0","0.0","174.0","0.0","5.0","3","778","40.38","95.97","19.36","18.21","11.28","13.24","90.87","56.68","19.79","12.47","0.77","3.98","1.67","0.77","5.27","7.33","5.27","12.60","9.51","4.50","5.14","2.83","17.74","3.86","2.44","1.54","2.06","3.21","5.91","2.70","3.21","0.13","1.29","0.39","18.77","0.00","0.00","0.13","1.03","11.83","1.67","1.93","2.06","2.57","2.57","3.34","2.06","1.41","0.39","0.13","1.67","0.39","0.64","0.00","0.39","12.08","4.50","1.93","3.73","1.41","1.41","2.31","14.40","2.06","12.85","2.44","7.46","2.96","2.31","0.13","0.77","1.29","1.29","0.51","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","12.85","8.87","2.06","0.00","0.00","0.13","0.00","0.13","0.00","1.54","0.00","0.13","3260","6.11","11.44927536231884","1007","777","69","85.39","7.7","4.2","6.71","4.6","94","4.9375","11.359124839124839","343","11.14","4","0.55","0","25","12","77","0","79","31","7","2","12","98","28","0","47","0","0","80","29","35","0","1","5","26","0","38","11","18","22","64","24","2","6","0","5"

Â There’s still hope for change, but back to what we had before, not change that has been a disaster.

John Jordan, head of Americans for Shared Prosperity, wants to change the way Republicans speak to their constituents:

â€œThe goal here is to communicate with women voters in a way that outside groups and campaigns havenâ€™t,â€ Jordan said. â€œWomen voters care as much about the economy, jobs, death and spending as do other groups â€” but certainly on the Republican side thereâ€™s been no effort to reach that group,â€ he said.

Turley says that while this process didnâ€™t begin with Obama, it has certainly accelerated under his administration and he has taken it to new levels in terms of the rhetoric. He has, in Turleyâ€™s opinion, embraced the concept of going it alone, and defying the other branches of government.

He notes how, unlike most other presidents, Obama has not avoided court fights. He says most presidents have a tendency to do so out of deference to those that would follow them, future presidents. He notes how â€œthis administration has really shown very little restraint in litigating these issues and losing.â€

Asked how Obama compares to other presidents, Turley calls the Obama regime a perfect storm of sorts, in that the politics are aligning with the common tendency to become power-drunk while in office.

He describes a toxic political environment, in which this type of confrontation is popular. He reminds us that gridlock is not an excuse for unilateral action, that â€œthere is no license within our system to go it alone.â€

He continues, â€œYou have to convince Congress, and if you canâ€™t, then things donâ€™t get done.â€

Turley says what we are seeing and what worries him is the rise of the uber presidency, the presidency that can govern alone. Turley says, â€œThat is exactly what the framers were afraid of; they wanted to avoid the concentration of power.â€

Â Interestingly enough, the statements in the “new” clips sound a lot like the “off the cuff remarks” from the first video. Â Take a listen.

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRj8OsgfqEk]

And then there was this from Megyn Kelly last night on Fox News.

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_XSUFyNA-I&]

Let’s see:

The law would not have passed if the Congressional Budget Office had scored the individual mandate as a tax.

ObamaCare would not have been passed if the law and the process were transparent which is why the law had to be passed to find out what was in it.

This lack of transparency is a “good” thing as it is a HUGE political advantage.

“If you are a state and if you don’t set up an exchange, that means that your citizens don’t get their tax credits.” Â This little loophole is now described as a “typo.” Â (The Supreme Court took a case on this very issue just last week.)

“The vast majority of Americans aren’t affected.” Â Tell that to the people who not only are paying a fortune for health insurance, but the ones who may not be able to find a doctor because physicians are leaving the profession in droves.

And Gruber said these things over and over and over again. Â Off the cuff and spontaneous…or WAY too honest.

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/listen-obama-spits-on-us-when-do-we-get-our-government-back-michael-savage/","When Do We Get Our Government Back?""","Michael Savage begins his remarks by comparing the tardiness of Obama to orate his latest scripted lie to that of another infamous figure in political history. That other person, Adolph Hitler, would regularly show up late to give his frenzied speeches and it was part of his methodology of working the crowd.

Savage wonders who is advising Obama, that he feels Obama is becoming increasingly insane, that his behavior is that of a madman. Savage says, â€œI think he is unhinged from reality. The border is overrun with diseased, third world individuals who are infecting the country, and he has the nerve to get up there and talk about a unity government in Iraq.â€

Savage contrasts Obamaâ€™s hypocritical words about unity in Iraq with the reality of how he â€œspits onâ€ his political opposition in America. Savage continues, saying, â€œYeah weâ€™d like a unity government, Mr. Obama, once weâ€™d like you to listen to those of us who are fed up with your left-wing fanaticism.â€

Savage says Obama is so out of touch with reality that he â€œfears he may be a madman.â€

Savage states his strong belief that the liberals are doubling down on their plan to decimate our borders, language and culture, destroying our country forever. He asks, â€œWho is going to save the people from these diseased third-worlders raging across our border?â€

Savage thinks this is the beginning of Vietnam all over again.

He says there seems to be madness everywhere and starts listing the numerous examples and compares America to Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/rush-limbaugh-threatens-lawsuit-democrats-give-obnoxious-response/","Rush Limbaugh threatens lawsuit, Democrats give OBNOXIOUS response ⋆ Dc Gazette","If there isÂ one area where Democrats excel, it is using selective editing to misinform low information voters. Democrats have perfected the ability to manipulate words and take phrases out of context. Rush Limbaugh, is not a stranger to this of course, but after democrats are claiming that he condones rape, Rush has said ENOUGH!

The topic of Rush’s September 15th show was Ohio State University’s revised guidelines instructing students to adhere to a behavioral code requiring verbal consent before having sex. Rush read a section of the guidelines aloud, â€œConsent must be freely given, can be withdrawn at any time, and the absence of â€˜noâ€™ does not mean â€˜yes’.” Rush then posed a question to his listeners,”How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that â€˜noâ€™ means â€˜yesâ€™ if you know how to spot it?” He followed that question with, “Let me tell you something. In this modern world, that is simply not tolerated.â€ Rush even went as far as saying “we need to reprogram the way we raise our men.” That didn’t matter though, the damage was done. Â Democrats blocked out everything after the words ” â€˜noâ€™ means â€˜yesâ€™.” They had their soundbite, and they were going to use it. Watch a full clip of his comments here:Â https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR61a1lSJsY

Within one day, Representative Steve Israel, the DCCC chairman, made the following statement:

“There’s simply no excusing comments of this offensive nature, especially at a time where our country is having a long-overdue conversation about violence against women. Plain and simpleâ€”Rush Limbaugh is advocating for the tolerance of sexual assault and should be taken off the air immediately,”

Within two days,the DCCC sent out an e-mail that read:

â€œWe knew we had to take action after Limbaughâ€™s reprehensible rant excusing rape on college campuses. In case you missed it, Limbaugh actually said, â€˜No means yes, if you know how to spot it.”

Limbaugh’s lawyers sent a letter to the DCCC demanding it issue a public apology and retraction, or face a lawsuit. Spokeswoman Emily Bittner responded by calling it all a bluster.

â€œWhile Rush Limbaugh is an expert in outrageous, inaccurate and defamatory speech, this attack on the DCCC is as outlandish as his original statement about women,â€ She went on further to say, â€œThe DCCC has not received any correspondence from Mr. Limbaugh or his attorney. If they actually send such a letter, rather than a press release, we will review it and respond accordingly.â€

If Rush Limbaugh is the man I think he is, he will go through with this lawsuit. It’s time that conservatives take a stand against liberals twisting their words. This type of dishonest behavior has become so out of control, people like Jon Stewert and Stephen Colbert have made it their career. Enough is enough. If conservatives ever want to get our message out there, we need to take a stand against this manipulation. We may not ever be able to stop liberals from manipulating weak minds, but we CAN stop them from manipulating our words.","2014-11-12 05:00:34","1","41.0","7.0","16.0","0.0","8.0","0.0","57.0","38.0","0.0","86.0","0.0","5.0","3","535","72.89","82.98","24.30","11.31","23.26","22.24","77.01","46.73","11.40","6.54","0.37","2.06","1.12","1.68","1.31","4.86","5.98","12.71","7.85","4.49","5.42","1.50","15.51","3.18","2.06","0.93","0.56","0.93","2.99","0.93","2.06","0.00","1.12","0.37","12.71","0.00","0.19","0.75","2.06","12.34","2.80","2.24","2.24","2.62","1.31","4.49","2.43","0.56","1.50","0.19","1.12","0.19","0.19","0.75","0.00","7.85","2.43","0.75","3.18","1.31","0.37","4.30","9.16","0.93","13.08","4.30","5.61","3.36","3.55","0.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.19","0.37","0.00","0.00","16.82","4.86","6.36","0.56","0.00","0.37","0.19","0.37","2.24","1.31","0.00","0.56","2330","7.93","29.666666666666668","741","508","26","60.14","11.5","9.7","11.72","11.9","107","8.9","18.2251968503937","299","26.5","10","0.45","1","13","4","43","0","59","35","0","0","6","80","53","3","26","1","0","34","12","26","0","0","3","16","0","25","24","16","10","19","19","1","0","0","4"
"https://dcgazette.com/2014/1-million-what-would-you-do/","$1 Million...What Would YOU Do? ⋆ Dc Gazette","Just about everyone has thought about it: What would you do with $1 million?

Now think about this: What would you do if youÂ didn’t have $1 million but were charged that amount?

For Jennifer Huculak and Darren Kimmel of Saskatchewan, Canada, the latter is all too real. It began last year in October when the couple took a vacation to Hawaii. Jennifer, six months pregnant at the time, was cleared by her doctor to make the trip. Just in case of emergencies, the couple purchased travel insurance from Blue Cross. Two days into the vacation, Jennifer’s water broke. She was airlifted to a hospital in Honolulu, where she had to remain on bedrest for six weeks. Thankfully, baby Reese was delivered December 10 after a C-section. Baby Reese is healthy now, but had to spend the first two months of her life in NICU. All good news, and good thing they got that travel insuranceâ€¦right?

Wrong. Tales of outrageous hospital bills are all too commonplace these days, and this couple was no exception. After returning to Canada with their precious bundle, it was life as usual. Until the day they got the hospital bill for $950,000. The couple was charged $160,000 for Jennifer’s hospital stay, $40,000 for the medical evacuation, and the rest? $750,000 for the baby’s care. Blue Cross sent a letter soon after stating that the family was not actually eligible for coverage because Jennifer had been “treated for high-risk pregnancy in the six months prior to departure.” Jennifer’s doctor sent a reply, telling the company she was not a high-risk pregnancy, she had been treated for an unrelated bladder infection.

The couple tried to explain to the company that their broker had not explained anything about a pre-existing condition provision, and that there was actually not a pre-existing condition at all, citing references from her doctors in both Canada and the U.S. that the bladder infection had nothing to do with her premature labor.

Blue Cross still refused to work with them. A statement from Blue Cross read: “Ms. Huculak was diagnosed and treated for a high-risk pregnancy in the six months prior to departure. As Ms. Huculak is currently hospitalized and being treated for this high-risk pregnancy, any expenses on the basis that her medical emergency is excluded from coverage under the terms of her pre-existing condition provision, her baby is also not eligible for coverage,” adding that her policy had expired November 9, 2013.

Though having a baby should be one of a couple’s most exciting life events, for this couple, it brings mixed feelings.

“It makes you sick to your stomach. Who can pay a million-dollar medical bill? Who can afford that?”

Jennifer told local news reporters.

The Saskatchewan government is paying $20,000 of the bill to help this family out, but the couple says they will still have to file for bankruptcy because they can’t pay the entire bill.

Though many have probably been screwed over by outrageous medical bills (like the stroke patients that have been harassed and stressed by debt collectors over a hospital bill to the point of having ANOTHER stroke) and reluctance of insurance companies to cover the expenses, it’s sad to see such a happy event be darkened by such an ordeal.","2014-11-20 19:56:46","0","44.0","10.0","16.0","0.0","9.0","0.0","70.0","40.0","0.0","89.0","0.0","5.0","3","560","85.46","68.51","14.47","11.79","18.67","22.14","83.04","48.75","9.46","4.11","0.00","0.00","0.71","2.14","1.25","5.36","8.39","14.29","8.93","4.29","4.11","1.61","13.04","3.93","1.25","1.07","4.64","3.57","3.93","1.43","2.50","1.07","0.71","0.36","8.93","1.96","0.00","2.14","0.00","8.04","1.61","0.89","0.71","0.89","1.25","3.04","1.79","1.07","0.18","0.54","5.71","0.54","4.82","1.07","0.18","6.07","0.54","0.54","2.50","1.25","1.43","6.43","6.61","0.36","12.86","1.79","5.54","5.71","3.04","1.07","0.36","3.57","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.04","5.00","5.54","0.54","0.00","1.07","0.00","1.61","1.07","1.43","0.36","1.43","2567","7.38","19.620689655172413","805","545","31","62.07","12.4","9.0","11.19","10.7","99","5.642857142857143","16.306055045871563","273","17.24","6","0.48","0","13","25","61","0","71","37","0","0","7","102","45","0","22","0","0","19","10","22","0","1","1","18","0","22","33","12","23","6","10","2","4","0","2"
"https://dcgazette.com/2014/bag-man-biden-point-man-in-the-deliberate-creation-of-todays-border-crisis/","Point Man in The Deliberate Creation of Today's Border Crisis ⋆ Dc Gazette","Iâ€™ve said it ever since this â€œborder crisisâ€ started heating up that there was simply too much coincidental and unlikely occurrences taking place for this to be anything other than an orchestrated event.

The money that is required for these people to pay to smugglers, I have proposed, is being provided to the Central American government officials in the form of U.S. Aid.

Joe Biden, now Vice-President, made a trip to the nations exporting their citizens to our country, and promised hundreds ofÂ millionsÂ of dollars in â€œforeign aid,â€ which the leaders can spend as they see fit.

It seems that much of that money is being used to pay the traffickers who are bringing the illegals to the United States, that it is a payment for services rendered to the Obama socialists. They want to degrade our country and a flood of illegal border-crashers is an important part of their plan.

It turns out that Joe Biden also played a role in establishing the law which set up the legalÂ requirementÂ that these people be brought into the United States and processed.

The extension of previously existing legislation, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, intended to deal with the rather small number of child victims of sexual trafficking. It included a stipulation which required the victims be processed in the United States prior to being repatriated to their home countries.

A subsequent version passed in 2013, theÂ Violence Against Women Act, introduced similar protections for women who were victims of domestic violence.

Both of these protections, which are now being exploited by the administration as loopholes for their lawlessness were placed into the legislation by the current Vice-President, Joe Biden.

It was there, ready to be utilized when needed, as a backup plan to the failed Democrat amnesty. Who knows, maybe the amnesty was a ruse all along, the socialists are masters at diversion.

In his short six month tenure at DHS, Secretary Jeh Johnson has been workingÂ tirelesslyÂ on centralizing his power, focusing on reducing the independence and effectiveness of the Border Patrol. They have gone from border protection to little more than a collection and processing agency for inductees.

Their function is increasingly more administrative, providing a paper trail and a means of identification in the U.S. for those who will eventually be released into our society. They will have to be tracked, taxed and most importantly, registered to vote.

Now the Obama regime is seeking billions of dollars to â€œdeal with the crisis,â€ though not to send people back and not to secure the border. They need the money to absorb the border-crashers, to process, transport, and support them. Of course, there will have to be more â€œforeign aidâ€ as well. They canâ€™t afford to let the pipeline dry up.

Obama made the announcements beginning in December of last year that this was going to be a year of action. His proclamations that he would act on his own were undoubtedly made in part with this process in mind.

This is not an accidental or spontaneous event. The necessary components were clearly put into place in advance of implementation and made this situation not only possible, but deliberately created the inevitability.

The crisis is now being managed by the regime officials in order to maximize the return on their investment of time and our tax dollars. It will continue, uncorrected, for as long as Americans permit them to exploit it.

What the heck has gotten into Joe Scarborough. Â That’s twice this week he’s gone off on the Democrats for not telling the complete truth and misrepresenting facts before giving the straight skinny to the audience. Â And this time he calls out Harry Reid, chief sorcerer of the Senate, for calling the Koch Brothers “un-American” for donating cash to the political causes of their choice when so many liberal billionaires are doing the same thing.

No one wants billionaires to by and pay for the United States in any fashion in politics. Â In that, conservatives are the same as liberals. Â At the same time, it is not just hypocritical, but rude to call out members of the opposition as being guilty of affecting elections when your own political action committee is the biggest spender in the current election cycle. Â Scarborough is very correct in pointing that out.

Claim Racial Discrimination In Lawsuit Against Cleveland Police Department ⋆ Dc Gazette","Nine non-African American Cleveland police officers involved in a deadly 2012 police shooting that killed two people are accusing the police department of racial discrimination in a federal lawsuit against the city.

The lawsuit was filed by eight white officers and one Hispanic officer. The suit claims the department treats non-black officers involved in shootings of blacks more harshly than black officers.

The legal action is in response to a November 2012 high-speed chase that ended in the shooting death of an unarmed black couple. Reports say over a dozen officers fired more than 100 shots at the suspects at the end of a 23-minute car chase. Six police officers have been indicted over the incident. A grand jury indicted a patrol officer on two charges of manslaughter and five supervisors on charges of dereliction of duty for failing to control the chase. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty said, based on the law, he didn’t seek charges against the other 12 officers who fired shots that night. Patrol officer Michael Brelo is the officer indicted on manslaughter charges. Reports claim Officer Brelo fired at least 15 shots, including fatal shots while standing on the hood of the couple’s car. He allegedly kept firing after the vehicle was trapped by police cruisers and other officers had stopped firing. McGinty claims, “The driver was fully stopped. Escape was no longer even a remote possibility. The flight was over.”A Supreme Court ruling clearly states that officers are prohibited from firing on suspects after a threat to public safety has ended.

The prosecutor said, “They ignored their own training. They put the public at risk. They put the officers under their command at risk.”

No weapon was found on the driver Timothy Russell or the passenger Malissa Williams. Police don’t know why Russell, refused to stop. Russell, 43, had a criminal record including convictions for receiving stolen property and robbery. Williams, 30, had convictions for drug-related charges and attempted abduction.

The police union has defended the officers’ actions and said the driver was trying to ram them. A review of the chase led to suspensions for 63 patrol officers who the city said violated orders and department rules. Critics are claiming it was a racially motivated execution. The lawsuit was filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Cleveland. It will be interesting to see how this turns out. Something tells me Eric Holder won’t be concerned about the racial discrimination of these officers.","2014-12-01 06:42:40","0","37.0","7.0","16.0","0.0","8.0","0.0","58.0","37.0","0.0","83.0","0.0","5.0","3","415","97.77","59.52","27.15","4.16","15.37","28.19","74.46","40.24","5.30","2.17","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.48","1.45","3.13","10.84","13.73","6.51","1.45","2.41","1.20","11.57","2.65","1.93","0.96","4.10","0.96","4.34","0.96","3.13","0.72","0.96","0.24","5.78","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.48","5.78","1.45","1.69","0.00","0.96","0.24","1.93","2.41","1.20","1.20","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","13.25","0.24","0.72","10.60","0.00","2.41","6.27","3.86","0.48","14.22","2.89","7.71","3.86","6.75","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.45","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.01","7.23","2.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.20","0.96","1.20","0.00","0.00","2057","7.96","16.153846153846153","634","409","29","57.16","11.3","8.8","12.23","10.1","94","8.1","16.833154034229832","231","15.19","5","0.4","0","8","14","46","0","49","30","1","1","1","75","38","0","39","0","0","9","2","8","1","0","1","7","0","7","30","14","18","5","9","3","2","0","2"

The issue has quickly escalated from being about police brutality to being about race. Liberals and civil rights leaders are pushing the narrative that white police officers do not care about black lives. Apparently, the fact that three times as many white people are killed by police than black people makes no difference to them. This race issue has now become so polarizing that certain groups are asking white people to follow rules if they wish to join their cause. A Toronto protest held earlier this week boasted a list of guidelines for white and non-black allies who chose to take part. From the event Face Book page:



The event organizers requested that white people â€œrefrain from taking up space in all ways possible.â€ They were told to â€œnever be at the center of anything,â€ and to â€œrefrain from speaking to the media.â€

Next white people must â€œstand behind black folks or between us and the police.â€

one social media user asked,â€œWow, is this an anti-racist rally or a pro-segregation one?â€

The same type of racism was displayed again this week when an online invitation went out to protest solidarity with Ferguson demonstrators. The creators of the event gave some specific rules of behavior for whites interested in joining. White folks were told to not participate in the hands up gesture that has become the symbol of the protests. Susanna Holmstrom, a woman who coordinated the event wrote â€œI understand wanting to show up and support, but white people need to understand that this symbolic act of raising your hands in a position of surrender is meant to illustrate how black people are violently targeted by police because of their race.â€

â€œIf you donâ€™t experience that, you should not mimic the gesture in an attempt at â€˜solidarity,â€™â€ she cautioned. â€œIt is centering yourself in a narrative that you cannot tell because of the protection your white privilege gives you.â€

It amazes me that people like this have the nerve to protest racism when it is them who are being racist. It seems that we are becoming more divided as a nation, and we are only hurting ourselves.","2014-12-05 23:40:46","0","44.0","7.0","16.0","0.0","15.0","0.0","66.0","44.0","0.0","110.0","0.0","5.0","3","396","86.12","84.98","8.80","15.17","33.00","18.94","79.55","46.21","10.61","4.80","0.25","1.01","1.77","0.25","1.52","5.81","7.32","14.39","7.83","2.78","4.55","1.26","15.15","4.80","2.02","1.52","1.01","1.52","3.79","1.52","2.27","0.00","2.02","0.25","11.62","0.51","0.00","0.51","0.25","8.84","1.77","1.26","1.52","2.02","1.26","2.53","5.81","4.55","0.25","0.76","1.26","1.01","0.25","0.00","0.00","7.83","2.27","0.25","4.55","0.51","0.51","3.28","8.84","0.25","10.10","2.02","4.80","3.54","2.53","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.51","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.83","4.29","2.27","0.25","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1720","7.84","33.0","544","373","18","58.92","12.0","10.2","11.6","12.4","75","7.666666666666666","18.32289544235925","219","28.17","1","0.45","0","9","4","38","0","53","35","0","0","2","57","20","0","34","0","0","18","4","11","2","0","3","14","0","17","14","14","10","18","12","1","3","0","3"

Sarah Palin Makes Joke About Looters, Liberals Lose Their Minds! ⋆ Dc Gazette","If there is one name that will make any liberal foam at the mouth, it is Sarah Palin. The liberal media is obsessed with her. She is still relevant, and she will always be relevant because she says it like it is. You will seldom find a political figure who speaks the truth like Sarah Palin. Leftwing sites post articles about her because they get a HUGE response every time, and this time is no different. Sarah Palin posted this pic on her Facebook page, and every liberal that saw the post immediately obtained a soggy bottom.

The image originated from the Facebook page of Mad World News.

Liberals posted comments saying, ” Sarah Palin is the troll in chief. The closest she will and should ever get to the White House is (to quote Nucky Thompson) a guided fvck!ng tour.”

Another classy liberal said, “Palin has the depth & appeal of a toilet filled with diarrhea!”

Ummm war on women anyone?

Mediaite even wrote an article attacking her for using the pic to make a statement about Ferguson. The ridiculous part is, she wasn’t even really talking about Ferguson. Well, maybe a little, but the main point of the post was about Obama’s politically correct support of illegal immigrants. Obama calling illegal immigrants ” undocumented” is about as ludicrous as calling looters “undocumented shoppers. ” Â It seems when Sarah Palin is the one pointing out how laughable political correctness has become; liberals are NOT laughing.","2014-12-02 02:32:52","1","55.0","8.0","16.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","80.0","53.0","0.0","141.0","0.0","5.0","3","244","74.05","75.71","3.68","19.64","15.25","21.72","78.69","46.72","9.02","4.51","0.00","0.00","0.41","3.69","0.41","4.51","9.43","10.25","9.43","6.56","4.92","1.23","16.80","4.92","2.87","1.23","0.82","2.05","4.51","2.05","2.46","0.41","2.05","0.00","10.25","0.00","0.00","4.10","0.00","12.30","2.05","3.28","0.82","2.05","2.87","2.46","4.51","2.05","2.46","0.00","0.82","0.41","0.41","0.00","0.00","5.33","0.82","0.41","3.28","1.23","0.00","3.28","10.25","1.64","10.25","0.00","5.74","3.28","1.64","1.23","0.41","0.41","0.00","0.41","1.64","0.00","0.82","0.00","0.82","0.00","16.39","5.74","3.69","0.00","0.41","0.41","0.82","0.00","3.28","0.82","0.82","0.41","1143","8.19","17.571428571428573","365","246","16","64.3","11.1","8.1","10.26","9.1","59","6.214285714285714","17.75349593495935","154","16.57","3","0.42","0","5","2","30","0","23","24","0","1","5","31","31","0","9","0","0","11","4","11","0","0","1","3","0","7","10","8","3","3","18","2","1","0","2"

Yelling At A Politician Might... ⋆ Dc Gazette","Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We all have ideas and opinions about the problems facing this Nation. We need to start sharing them and we can find the solution. Ronald Reagan talked about immigration reform in 1980. Why are we still talking about it 34 years later? Every four years it’s the same old dance. Promises made during every campaign, followed by three years of no action. Well, what would You do if You were President?

Americans we need your ideas, I will give you mine, so here is what I would do. After becoming President, Seal our borders on the first day. The border patrol and military can do that. Don’t tell me we can’t afford it, because We can’t afford not to. The Presidents number one Job is to protect the American People.

Next You have to untie the hands of Justice. Every Man, Woman and Child must abide by the laws written to protect them. Decisions need to be made in the interest of the American People. Not in the interest of special interest groups. There are those that think Politicians can be bought. The American People can not be bought, nor can this Country!

No talk of a balanced budget while figuring out ways to spend more money. If You are going to trim a tree, You never cut on the Roots. You have to start at the top and that’s what we should do. Do not accept nor approve a pay raise for yourself or cabinet. Every penny of your salary should be donated to the American People. Pick families at random and send them a check. Tell them you know times are hard but believe things will get better. Let’s face it most politicians are millionaires, and never leave office broke. Until we are out of the red, and back in black, this should continue. This Country owes us nothing while We owe this Country everything. Don’t worry your rent will be paid for, it’s a house on the hill. You will make plenty of money when your term is up. Bonuses for federal employees can not happen.

Our Men and Women of the military not only serve but work for the American People. They put food on their tables with the tax payer money. If our Military doesn’t receive annual bonuses neither can You.

If any Politician mentions a pay raise for themselves, you should fight it with a vengeance. No company in the world allows its employees to decide its salary and raises. Why should Washington be any different?Any Country that receives financial aid has to agree to audits. We have to ensure taxpayer Money is going where it’s suppose to. People don’t pay taxes, to buy homes, for another countries politicians. After the first Gulf War this Country poured billions in humanitarian aid to Iraq. That money ended up on pallets, right into the hands of its leaders. They never miss a meal while their people go hungry.

Foreign policy in this country hasn’t worked for years. It’s because foreigners are people and should be treated as such. You can’t win the hearts and minds of others. It requires respect by giving and demanding it in return. The moment You look down on someone is the moment they stop looking up to You. “This Country is Our Home” and “We must protect it”. It provides so much for so many. This World depends on us just like every other Country.

This Country is only as strong as its weakest link. We don’t wish to fight but will protect it at all cost. Never tell People what they want to hear just tell them like it is. We have borders that must be protected. We have Laws that must be followed. Not to hurt anyone, but to protect everyone. If you come into this country enjoy every moment.

Please respect “Our People” and they will respect You. Everyone in this world understands that. If they don’t they should be asked to leave. These are just a few issues that We all have to face. If We put our heads together, This world will be a better place. I don’t care what color of skin, the church you attend, or what secrets are in your closet. You are all important to God, and important to this country. Please share your advice, write it down, or simply leave a comment. I believe in this country, and it’s people. Somewhere out there is more than one answer. They say if it were easy everyone would do it! Well I say if everyone would do it, it would be easy………….

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/patriotic-ice-agents-frustrated-forced-to-violate-their-oaths-to-keep-their-jobs/","Patriotic ICE Agents Frustrated, Forced To Violate Their Oaths to Keep Their Jobs ⋆ Dc Gazette","A contact of mine who works for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, recently contacted me, asking me to help him tell his story. He expressed his concerns as well as those of his fellow agents are becoming overwhelming and that the public needs to know what is going on. Not the least troubling to him is the fact that agents are required on a daily basis to violate their oaths. That is something which my contact takes very seriously and is very disturbed by. For obvious reasons, he hasÂ chosen to remain anonymous and the photo in this article is not of him.

In addition to the security concerns, he says there is massive and rampant waste, saying, as bad as the things we know about are, the things we donâ€™t know are even worse.

His regular assignment isnâ€™t on the southern border, or any border for that matter. In many ways the location makes little difference, he says. The problem exists in every state nationwide, including his in the liberal northeast.

He describes how the job he used to love is now absolutely â€œhorrible.â€ Full planeloads of illegals are dumped in their laps every week, with all of the diseases that go along with them. Rather than deport them, which, as a deportation officer, is a major component of his job description, the illegals are coddled and provided for.

They are seen by asylum officers, but regardless of their recommendations a judge still makes a ruling in every case. Those judges invariably rule that the illegals be released, he says. The agents are frustrated that they put their lives on the line every day, with nothing coming as a result. They feel they on their own, fighting an unsupported, losing battle.

Many of the agents are now being temporarily reassigned to â€œbabysitting dutyâ€ in Artesia NM, Texas and other locations, sometimes with as little as two daysâ€™ notice. They work six day weeks, in 45 day blocs, receiving overtime pay and per diem. Add that to the travel expenses and we are paying an extremely high price for the socialist Democratsâ€™ new illegal voters.

Artesia NM has been converted to an illegal alien induction center. It used to be a training facility, but that was when immigration law meant something. Itâ€™s all about getting illegals safely into the shadows now.

My contact told me he noticed things started to go downhill about the time Obamaâ€™s aunt, Zeituni Onyango, got arrested for being an illegal alien. There must be something about the Obamaâ€™s and immigration law that just doesnâ€™t mix. The law started being overlooked and a trend towards automatic parole and non-prosecution seemed to develop.

He says that even permanent residents who were guilty of serious crimes, including drug dealers, gang members and child abusers, were and still are routinely given relief.

It is agency policy not to arrest any illegals unless they have a criminal history. Even those who have previously been deported are being released under the new Obama guidelines.

He spoke of two of his fellow agents, who are assigned to Atesia, who recently informed him that at that particular location, the agents have been instructed not to use the word â€œalien.â€ Â They must now refer to the illegals as â€œcustomers.â€ Theyâ€™re non-paying customers at that.

He spoke of another agent who, on the first day of mandatory relocation to Artesia, was given a credit card and a mission; buy diapers and other sanitary supplies. He hasnâ€™t done much enforcement or anything else since.

In the communities from which the officers have been relocated another problem has developed. Nobody has taken the place of the reassigned agents. What enforcement work the regime still permits is just simply not being done.

He relates how once the illegals are released into the U.S. population, they immediately start applying for every welfare, assistance and entitlement program they can qualify for. The claims that they donâ€™t qualify, at least in his community, are untrue. WIC and other agencies donâ€™t verify citizenship. As usual, they say itâ€™s about the children, so Americans pay up.

He also mentioned the threat of disease, including a chicken pox outbreak and verified that reports of scabies, head lice, TB and Swine Flu are all accurate.

He touched upon the granting of automatic Prosecutorial Discretion and a backlogged court calendar that extends into 2016 as additional frustrations to their enforcement efforts.

His recommendation, which he claims to share with many of his colleagues, is a return to the rule of law. He also feels the position of Asylum Officer is dysfunctional and should be eliminated, with more immigration judges hired in their place.

He reports that the moral within ICE and the Border Patrol is at the lowest itâ€™s ever been.

These brave patriots want to serve their country, they want to protect it. To do so they need the support of those in positions of power and leadership. They cannot do it on their own.

"https://dcgazette.com/2014/will-harry-reid-make-a-deal-with-republicans-on-obama-appointees/","Will Harry Reid Make A Deal With Republicans On Obama Appointees? ⋆ Dc Gazette","Between now and the seating of the next Congress, the Senate has a lot of work to do. Â Among the many tasks left hanging from when Harry Reid was in block and obstruction mode is the confirmation of multiple Obama Administration appointees.

This week, Reid, the outgoing Senate Majority Leader, signaled that he would be willing to make a deal with the incoming Republican leadership to hold off on debate and confirmation of a short list of those nominees. Â If Reid does make a deal, it will undoubtedly put him in conflict with his party as members maintain that Republicans are not really interested in confirming all that many of Obama’s appointments.

While that might be true (okay, probably is), the reality is that confirming cabinet appointments and ambassadors is a time consuming process and to try to get all of the pending cases through it in a compressed duration – as was done last year – is just not healthy.

The idea Reid is floating is that they clear the list out a bit later. Â After the breaks. Â When there is more time. Â And the White House is not happy about this. Â Among the nominees yet to be cleared, are 16 federal judges who would have lifelong seats on the federal bench, 34 ambassadors, and two cabinet appointments. Â Lower level appointments are likely to be confirmed in a group. Â It’s just the big boys that are on the table.

Members of the Democratic caucus are already lining up on either side of the argument and making public statements. Â The hard lefties want to go for it and the more moderates are willing to deal taking the chance that Republicans are going to make life difficult when debate comes to the floor of the Senate.

Stay tuned. Â This may well be Dingy Harry’s last stand.

"http://politicops.com/leafs-losing-revealed-rigged/","Leafs Losing Revealed to be Rigged","CANADA- The famous failure of the Toronto Maple Leafs has been revealed to be a dirty game.

On Wednesday night, following the Leafs 4-3 defeat to Montreal, Toronto team captain Dion Phaneuf broke the ice by addressing the team’s constant failure to associated press.

“I can’t stand it any longer,” Phanuef raged. “We do not suck. Our scores are rigged by higher powers. Our losing is rigged!”

The team’s general manager, Dave Nonis, confirmed this rumour to be true.

“I’ve been skating around the idea of going public about this for years,” Nonis said in an interview Friday. “It’s true- our game is controlled by the gods of the seasons. We’re always walking on thin ice.”

Nonis went on to explain that the Seasons dictate the team’s losses. For example, he said, in winter time, the team’s abilities are frozen, whereas in spring, they being to bloom.

“Too bad for us we’re usually eliminated by the time spring rolls around,” Nonis added.

When asked for comment, the Seasons politely declined.

The Leafs play next on Saturday at 7pm against Pittsburgh. Captain Phaneuf reported that while his teammates have been putting in an exceptional amount of ice time and mental work to prepare for this game, he still doesn’t feel optimistic about the outcome.

“It’s autumn, after all,” he said. “And the Seasons say that in autumn, the Leafs must fall.”","2014-10-11 15:19:32","0","26.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","8.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","60.0","1.0","34.0","5","231","92.84","89.52","57.14","6.50","12.83","20.35","83.98","45.45","9.96","6.06","0.87","3.03","0.00","1.73","0.43","3.90","9.09","15.58","7.79","3.46","2.16","1.30","14.72","4.76","1.30","0.43","0.87","1.73","6.06","2.16","3.90","0.00","0.87","2.16","13.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.73","7.36","1.73","0.87","0.43","0.87","2.16","1.73","3.46","0.43","1.73","1.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.15","6.93","5.63","4.76","1.30","2.16","4.33","9.09","0.87","19.91","2.60","6.49","10.82","5.63","4.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.43","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","27.27","7.36","7.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.43","1.30","6.06","4.76","0.00","0.00","1056","7.5","15.125","315","230","18","75.4","9.2","5.9","10.48","8.2","47","5.0","15.293913043478263","153","14.56","3","0.46","0","2","3","26","0","33","15","1","0","2","39","26","0","11","0","0","13","4","6","1","0","0","7","0","10","12","7","9","9","5","0","0","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/gop-rep-isis-will-force-nfl-play-burqas-dont-act/","GOP Rep.: ‘ISIS Will Force the NFL to Play in Burqas If We Don't Act’","HOUSTON—Representative Ted Poe, R-Texas, warned the Obama administration Wednesday that “ISIS will force the NFL to wear burqas and other forms of Islamic dress if we don’t act immediately.

“ISIS’s inevitable takeover of the NFL is a horrific vision. Burqas provide no head or body protection whatsoever. And by dressing all teams identically, ISIS will make it extremely difficult for NFL players to distinguish between their team members and opponents. How we will determine the true winner of this year’s Superbowl!” Mr. Poe added.

While ISIS has not specifically threatened to dress NFL players in Islamic garb during their violent messages to America, Mr. Poe sees redecorating the NFL as “ISIS’s most obvious next move.”

Prior to his address about ISIS’s NFL burqa Armageddon, Poe alerted the American people that ISIS could infiltrate the United States across the southern border. Poe predicts ISIS will call upon Mexican drug cartels to traffic terrorists into America, thus advising President Obama to strengthen security at the U.S.-Mexico border, not only as means to prevent illegal aliens from entering, but as a weapon for thwarting ISIS’s next act of terror against the NFL.

Poe’s premonition that ISIS will seep into America has been further validated by Gary Painter, sheriff of Midland County, Texas, who reported finding Qurans, Islamic clothing, and sketches of Dallas Cowboys players wearing full-length burqas scattered along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has seconded these concerns, stating that President Obama “needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home, before ISIS covertly enters NFL locker rooms across America and sends our athletes out onto the field dressed in burqas, which aren’t even supposed to be worn by men in the first place.”","2014-09-19 09:33:11","0","22.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","8.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","65.0","1.0","35.0","5","296","93.46","61.96","19.68","12.37","26.91","27.36","66.22","38.18","5.74","2.36","0.00","1.35","0.00","0.34","0.68","3.38","5.41","15.20","4.73","3.38","4.39","1.69","9.46","4.73","2.36","1.01","0.34","1.35","4.39","1.69","2.70","1.01","1.35","0.00","6.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","10.14","1.01","1.35","1.01","2.36","2.36","3.04","0.34","0.34","0.00","0.00","1.69","1.35","0.34","0.00","0.00","9.12","2.70","1.69","3.38","1.01","2.03","1.69","6.08","2.03","13.18","1.69","8.11","4.05","2.36","1.01","1.01","0.00","1.35","0.34","0.68","0.00","0.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.26","6.08","6.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.34","1.69","2.36","2.70","0.00","0.00","1477","9.0","34.0","454","289","13","48.94","13.6","11.9","14.05","14.9","78","7.583333333333334","21.675847750865053","197","31.22","28","0.38","0","7","0","21","0","38","16","0","1","6","38","70","1","18","0","1","4","4","16","0","0","1","11","0","13","7","8","8","4","10","1","1","0","1"

"http://politicops.com/cuccinelli-conservative-wants-to-ban-teenage-bdsm-in-virginia/","‘Cuccinelli Conservative’ Wants To Ban Teenage BDSM In Virginia","RICHMOND, Va. – Announcing that “youngsters are getting a little too kinky,” a Virginia legislator has pushed a new law that would make it a felony for teenagers to engage in sex acts involving bondage, discipline, and sadomasochism, also known as BDSM.

“It’s just not right,” said Virginia state legislator and self-described “Cuccinelli conservative” Thomas Garrett (R). “Let’s say a nubile young woman of only 17 is getting into leather, and maybe she wants to experiment with her cherubic, slightly younger boyfriend. Maybe tie him up and make him bite her toes—not hard, just like a simpering nibble—well that sort of thing doesn’t belong in Virginia.”

Garrett’s attack on underage fetish is part of a new bill that would bring back much of Virginia’s “Crimes Against Nature” law, which federal courts declared unconstitutional months ago.

“Here’s another scenario for you,” Garrett began during a packed legislative session. “Two young men come home after football practice, and because they’re still jacked on testosterone, they take off their shirts to reveal powerful, bronzed upper-bodies and go out to the woodshed. Maybe they find a length of rope—strong, thick rope. Virginia currently has no law that would stop these two strapping young specimens from experimenting with all those strands of jute and shafts of lumber, which is why Old Dominion must demand that senate bill 14 be passed!”","2014-01-13 11:29:57","0","21.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","229","74.33","75.77","10.69","41.56","22.90","22.71","78.17","43.67","10.48","4.37","0.00","0.44","0.44","2.18","1.31","6.11","4.37","12.66","6.11","5.68","4.37","1.75","14.41","4.80","1.75","1.31","1.75","1.75","1.75","1.31","0.44","0.00","0.44","0.00","9.17","0.00","0.44","1.75","1.75","9.17","1.31","2.18","2.18","1.75","0.87","1.31","2.62","0.44","0.87","1.31","5.24","1.31","0.44","3.49","0.00","8.30","1.31","0.87","4.80","1.31","0.44","2.18","10.04","0.44","15.28","2.18","6.11","7.42","2.18","0.44","0.44","0.87","0.00","0.00","0.87","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.44","0.00","22.27","3.93","6.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.87","6.11","3.06","0.87","0.00","1124","8.1","29.5","323","225","9","63.02","12.7","10.7","13.58","15.9","46","12.875","20.177777777777777","171","27.38","3","0.39","0","7","4","14","0","25","21","1","0","4","38","20","0","12","1","0","11","2","20","0","0","2","4","0","12","6","5","7","6","8","5","0","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/john-mccain-sexiest-caliph/","Bloggers Claim John McCain Named 1996's Sexiest Caliph, Rand Paul Weighs in","New York-For the last few months it’s been reported, in a plethora of conspiratorial blogs based in the United States, that Senator John McCain (R-AZ) is not only part of ISIS, but had been named the Muslim World’s Sexiest Caliph in 1996. Despite McCain calling the rumors “unsubstantiated and absolutely ridiculous” questions about his involvement with the putative pageant continue to hound him.

McCain has spent a great deal of the last few months attempting to discredit rumors that he not only helped start ISIS, but is bedmates with the groups leader. The rumors were originated by a number of pictures McCain-some of which he shared on his twitter account-posed for with members of the Free Syrian Army. In the photos many of the bloggers have claimed that a man in the background looks suspiciously similar too ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghadadi. Though the only proof that’s been offered anent McCain’s involvement with ISIS has been the photos Mccain posted on his twitter, and other doctored photos, the rumors continue to persist.דפשמ>

On Monday the website ScarcytruthsforpatritoicseekersoftruthwhoalawaysknewthetruthwastheAmericanGovenmentisevil.com, published photos of the senator dressed in the traditional garb of a Caliph, holding a bouquet of assorted flowers, and posing on stage in front of a giant curtain that reads “Mr. Muslim World’s Sexiest Caliph 1996”.

Mccain, speaking earlier today, said of the new photo, “That’s… Do I even need to respond to questions about something so absurd? I’m a war hero damnit!

"http://politicops.com/republican-calls-bombing-dallas-stop-ebola-spread/","Republican Calls For Bombing Dallas to Stop Ebola Spread","South Carolina – Todd Kincannon, the former general counsel and executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party, used social media to give life to his solution to the Ebola crisis. Via Twitter, Kincannon called for anyone who contracts Ebola to be executed. Later, he upped the ante by saying any city where Ebola has been confirmed should be bombed off the face of the Earth, starting with Dallas.

“People with Ebola in the U.S. need to be humanely put down immediately,” he said through Twitter. “The protocol for a positive Ebola test should be immediate humane execution and sanitization of the whole area. That will save lives.”

When asked what he meant by the term ‘sanitization’ he responded, “Bomb them back to the stone age. Use nukes. Dallas must be wiped off the map.”

His Tweets sparked some outrage among many. Some pointed out that killing 1.25 million people after a single case of Ebola had been confirmed seemed excessive. Kincannon disagreed, Tweeting, “Ebola has a strong transmission vector through health care personnel. No effective way to contain while treating. Mass extermination only viable alternative.”

Aware that stopping the spread of Ebola in the U.S. was only the first step, Kincannon advocated using nuclear weapons on infected areas in Africa, saying the people of Africa have only themselves to blame.

“The people of Africa are to blame for why it’s so shitty,” he tweeted. “They could stop eating each other and learn calculus at any time… We need to be napalming villages from the air right now. No reason not to start with Dallas.”

This is not the first time Kincannon has used Twitter to post controversial remarks. He previously used the social media channel to mock Florida shooting victim Trayvon Martin, call for transgendered individuals to be placed in concentration camps, lament that Michael Prysner- an Iraq war veteran who became an anti-war protester- didn’t come home in a body bag, and saying that Ray Rice had every right to beat his fiance.

He has also long made a series of statements insulting and degrading Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, whom, in his most recent series of Tweets, he claimed was key to his anti-Ebola plan.

“We should put Wendy Davis’ vagina in charge of the Ebola outbreak,” he Tweeted. “It will kill all of them without mercy and go to Nordstrom’s afterwards.”","2014-10-07 13:12:31","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","8.0","0.0","40.0","31.0","0.0","60.0","1.0","35.0","3","396","91.52","87.73","11.00","3.73","17.22","20.71","78.54","42.68","8.59","5.05","0.00","0.51","0.00","3.54","1.01","3.54","7.07","14.39","7.32","2.78","2.53","1.52","15.15","2.53","1.26","1.77","1.26","3.28","4.80","1.26","3.54","0.00","2.78","0.00","14.39","0.25","0.25","0.00","3.79","9.85","2.53","2.53","1.77","1.77","1.01","1.52","1.26","0.00","1.26","0.00","2.53","1.01","1.01","0.25","0.51","8.33","3.54","1.26","2.78","0.25","0.76","5.05","7.07","0.76","14.90","1.26","8.08","5.56","1.52","1.26","0.25","0.00","0.25","1.52","1.01","0.25","0.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.43","7.07","4.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","4.29","1.26","0.00","0.00","1890","8.22","21.157894736842106","589","395","25","63.9","11.0","8.3","11.54","10.1","95","7.833333333333334","17.940253164556964","251","19.63","4","0.43","0","6","3","37","0","41","29","0","0","8","58","58","0","18","0","0","17","5","15","0","1","3","17","0","21","21","13","11","3","9","1","4","0","3"
"http://politicops.com/nh-republican-calls-swimsuit-competition-decide-congressional-race/","NH Republican Calls for Swimsuit Competition","MANCHESTER, New Hampshire – Republican State Representative Steve Vaillancourt recently took to a political blog to explain why the current race for Congress between Democratic Representative Ann McLane Kuster and New Hampshire State Representative Marilinda Garcia will come down to which one is prettier. Vaillancourt suggested that since voters will want to vote for the more attractive woman, the two candidates should just hold a swimsuit competition to ‘show off the whole package.’

“Let’s be honest. Does anyone not believe that Congressman Annie Kuster is as ugly as sin? And I hope I haven’t offended sin,” wrote Vaillancourt on NH Insider, a blog dedicated to New Hampshire politics. “Get her in a swimsuit and people will be hurling in the aisles.”

In comparison, said Vaillancourt, Republican challenger Garcia is “one of the most attractive women on the political scene anywhere. Not so attractive as to be intimidating, but truly attractive. We’re talking smoking. I don’t know why she doesn’t just campaign in a bikini 24/7.”

Vaillancourt then compared Kuster to a drag queen, saying, “How ugly is Annie Kuster?… drag queens are more attractive than Annie Kuster… not that there’s anything wrong with that. Annie Kuster looks more like a drag queen than most men in drag.”

At the top of his post, Vaillancourt gave readers a warning. “The subject matter, although very real, may prove uncomfortable for some of my more sensitive readers,” Garcia wrote. “ Not as uncomfortable as a picture of Annie Kuster in a two-piece, but pretty uncomfortable.”

Garcia refused to stand behind her fellow Republican, calling him out for his “sexist” comments. “Both Rep. Kuster and I have experienced this unfortunate reality of being a woman in politics. I hope that as time moves forward and more female candidates run for political office around the country, people will focus on the content of our ideas rather than what we wear and how we look,” she said. “That being said, I so totally rock a bikini.”

In a follow-up post, Vaillancourt doubled down on his suggestion. “Facts are facts, and Kuster is one ugly woman. Put her and Garcia in bikinis and stand them next to each other, this race is over,” he said. “In fact, why stop there? Let ‘em go topless. Who doesn’t want to see Garcia’s boobs?”","2014-10-14 15:44:00","0","21.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","8.0","0.0","40.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","385","81.80","68.91","15.08","7.66","14.81","21.30","79.48","46.23","9.61","5.97","1.82","1.30","0.00","2.60","0.26","3.64","6.23","15.06","7.01","4.42","5.97","2.08","14.81","11.17","5.71","2.08","2.08","3.38","5.19","1.82","3.38","0.78","1.30","0.00","11.17","0.00","0.26","3.38","1.82","10.91","1.30","1.56","1.56","2.60","1.56","3.38","2.86","1.30","1.30","0.00","0.78","0.52","0.00","0.26","0.26","7.53","1.30","1.30","4.68","0.52","0.78","2.08","9.87","2.08","12.47","2.34","7.27","2.86","3.12","1.30","0.00","0.00","0.52","0.00","0.52","0.26","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","22.86","6.49","5.97","0.00","0.00","1.04","0.00","0.52","6.23","2.34","0.00","0.26","1830","7.37","20.68421052631579","576","384","26","64.91","11.0","7.9","11.3","9.6","73","9.0","15.524166666666668","211","18.95","8","0.46","0","11","7","30","0","46","23","2","2","6","49","57","0","17","0","0","17","6","24","4","1","5","11","0","20","12","8","4","13","10","1","1","0","4"
"http://politicops.com/judge-accused-domestic-abuse-suspended-two-hearings/","Judge Accused of Domestic Abuse is Suspended Two Hearings","MONTGOMERY, Ala.— As Judge Mark E. Fuller explains it, the best defense is a strong offense. His offense: strong-arming his wife, Kelli Fuller, after she confronted him in August with suspicions that he had been unfaithful. Now his defense team is fighting for leniency in the face of a two-hearing suspension designed to allow time for Judge Fuller to “cool off” and provide his wife “the opportunity to apologize for her mistrustful behavior.”

“I deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve these difficulties with my family, where they should be resolved,” said Judge Fuller in a statement. “What is clear is that my wife needs space to think about how she can begin to repair the reputational damage she caused me.”

Before he accepts an apology from his wife, Judge Fuller suggested that “Kelli needs to work on her own issues first,” presumably referring to the visible lacerations to her mouth and forehead noted in the police report.

Judge Fuller went on to say, “Kelli and I had a long talk, and she’s adamant that I not be at home right now. Suspending me from court would leave me no option but to ferment my marital strife with a bottle of Jack Daniels in the den.”

Terri Sewell—a Democrat representing the state of Alabama, which includes the district over which Fuller presides—sees it differently. Said Sewell, “If an NFL player can lose his job because of domestic violence, then a federal judge should definitely not be allowed to keep his lifetime appointment to the federal bench.”

After taking more than a month to “gauge public opinion” over judge Fuller’s behavior, some state politicians even have come to the conclusion that Fuller should resign, so as to protect the judicial system from “a public relations nightmare.”

Rep. Marlin Richards noted, “I have to thank TMZ, Ray Rice, and [NFL] Commissioner Goodell for bringing the issue of domestic violence perpetrated by public figures to the fore. Without heroes like them to stir public outcry, we probably would’ve turned a blind eye to this whole Judge Fuller affair.”

Still, removing a judge from the bench by force can be difficult—if not impossible—for abuses not directly related to court proceedings, even after felony convictions.

For now, the commissioner of U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has indicated that criminal offenders who wish to return their sentences issued by Judge Fuller are entitled to a retrial or a free pizza, whichever is given less value.","2014-09-21 19:39:05","0","27.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","48.0","31.0","0.0","65.0","1.0","35.0","4","422","91.60","67.37","13.76","10.72","23.44","22.04","82.23","47.39","11.14","7.35","2.37","0.24","0.00","4.03","0.71","3.79","7.58","16.35","5.92","2.84","3.79","1.42","11.14","6.64","4.98","1.66","0.47","0.95","7.35","3.08","4.27","0.24","1.42","0.71","10.66","1.18","0.00","2.61","2.37","11.14","3.08","1.42","2.84","1.66","0.71","2.61","2.61","1.42","0.95","0.24","1.66","0.95","0.24","0.00","0.47","10.43","1.90","2.13","5.45","0.71","1.42","2.13","9.00","0.47","13.27","2.37","6.87","4.50","1.66","0.47","1.18","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","16.82","4.74","5.45","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.47","4.74","0.71","0.00","0.47","1987","8.84","47.333333333333336","610","416","17","55.07","13.3","11.7","12.02","14.4","105","8.4","21.896153846153847","258","40.11","11","0.46","0","8","2","37","0","53","27","2","1","8","65","49","0","14","0","0","20","13","21","0","0","0","24","0","27","10","9","12","6","12","2","2","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/insurers-worried-contracting-hiv-patients-offering-fair-coverage/","Some Insurers Worried About Contracting HIV Patients by Offering Fair Coverage","WASHINGTON—The partisan fever surrounding the rollout of the Affordable Care Act did little to lessen the positive fervor of patients who stood to gain the most from the law’s protections, like those living with HIV or AIDS. With one eye on their bank accounts and the other on their T-cell counts, some insurers are pulling out all the stops to avoid the costly risks of covering these patients.

Newly barred from denying coverage or charging more for individuals with preexisting conditions, insurance companies are no longer immune to the financial risks of making healthcare accessible to people who rely on costly drugs to keep their conditions in check.

Certain health insurance companies have started testing the waters to see if they can circumvent the new provisions.

Said actuary Chuck Denton of Cigna, “I’m not sure we want people infected with HIV in our risk pool. Casual contact may not spread the virus, but being contractually obligated to provide care for the seriously ill is just not something I signed up for when I entered this business relationship.”

A complaint by the AIDS Institute and the National Health Law Program accuses Cigna and three other insurers of discrimination by assigning all specialty HIV drugs—including generics—to the highest payment tier on Florida’s health insurance marketplace. In some cases, that meant patients would have to shoulder monthly pharmacy bills of $1000 or more, on top of their premiums.

What CoventryOne, Cigna, Humana, and Preferred Medical Plan are doing “has no rational reason other than to drive people with HIV and AIDS away from their plans,” according to a staff lawyer for the National Health Law Program.

“Other [mid-tier] plans don’t do this for HIV,” claims Carl Schmid of the AIDS Institute, “and that’s why we’re proving that it’s discrimination.” Comparable insurers in the marketplace offer the same prescriptions with out-of-pocket costs between $10 and $25.

When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Humana remained positive in her prognosis of the complaint, which is now in the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights. “It’ll be dismissed. It has to be, right? I mean, this was our first time forgetting to provide adequate coverage under ObamaCare.”

At press time, lawyers from CoventryOne were busy calling each and every one of the company’s trustees to recommend testing their business models to ensure lawful HIV coverage.","2014-06-04 08:47:33","1","26.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","403","94.96","63.59","17.46","21.94","25.19","25.56","83.13","44.91","8.93","3.97","0.99","0.99","0.00","0.25","1.74","4.96","6.95","17.62","6.20","1.49","3.97","1.49","11.17","4.22","2.48","1.74","1.74","2.23","3.47","1.49","1.74","0.99","0.00","0.00","8.19","0.00","0.25","0.25","0.00","8.68","1.49","0.99","0.99","2.23","1.99","3.23","1.49","0.50","0.50","0.50","7.20","0.74","6.45","2.48","0.00","7.94","1.24","1.74","2.98","0.99","1.49","2.23","6.70","1.24","10.92","0.74","7.20","2.98","6.70","0.50","0.00","3.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.63","3.72","4.47","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.99","2.48","2.48","0.00","1.24","1992","8.93","31.692307692307693","606","396","16","54.76","14.5","11.8","13.41","15.6","102","15.833333333333334","22.223030303030306","247","28.31","17","0.47","0","13","6","38","0","55","26","2","1","3","52","50","1","36","1","0","10","9","13","0","1","2","16","0","17","7","18","6","13","8","2","3","0","3"
"http://politicops.com/georgians-miss-thrill-carrying-concealed-guns-illegally/","Georgians Miss ‘Thrill’ of Carrying Concealed Guns Illegally","ATANTA – Earlier this week, when Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed a bill making it legal for registered gun owners to carry their weapons in “churches, schools, libraries and bars,” among other places, Georgian gun owners overwhelmingly supported the change. But just days later, public opinion has turned against the bill, as firearm enthusiasts realize that “all the fun and risk” has been “sucked out of illegally bringing guns into forbidden places.”

Billy Watson, 26, of Alpharetta, is one of thousands of Georgians who have quickly turned against the bill. “Yesterday I tucked my Glock into my waistband and went into a library, expectin’ to feel freer than I ever had before,” Watson explained. “But without the possibility of gettin’ caught, the Glock was just annoying and heavy. I ended up borrowin’ ‘Twilight’ again and headin’ home.”

From the start, critics of the legislation called it the “guns everywhere” bill, and although supporters initially resisted the nickname, many have since admitted that the characterization is accurate, and that the bill’s effect has been both surprising disappointing.

Dunwoody High School social studies teacher Sam Kelvin explained that it “used to be a lot of fun taking [his] gun into school,” but since Gov. Deal signed House Bill 60, carrying a loaded weapon in his classroom has “lost all its edge.”

“Man, used to be, when a kid came up to my desk to ask some stupid question, I had this secret thrill, knowing that I had a deadly weapon strapped around my ankle,” Kelvin said. “But now all the other teachers are packin’ too, and the whole thing’s starting to feel blasé.”

Even local NRA chapters are switching their stance on the bill and begging Gov. Deal to “do something to put the fun back into concealed carrying.” Although NRA members still largely support some of the bill’s measures—the legislation “removes the fingerprinting requirement for new gun licensees, and also abolished a state requirement that gun merchants maintain records of their sales and purchases,” for instance—many say that they’ll have to start “hanging around in the Capitol more often,” where carrying firearms is still banned.

The bill also made it easier for Georgians to evoke the state’s “stand your ground” law, even if the gun they use to kill someone is not registered. Initially one of the bill’s most popular measures, it too has earned criticism of late.

“I always thought that one day I’d probably kill somebody with one of my guns, you know, in ‘self-defense’,” said Grovetown native Andy Potts. “But now it’s all but certain that I wouldn’t be punished for it—which is great, but now it just seems too easy, you know?”","2014-04-24 21:41:46","0","25.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","448","75.28","50.89","72.31","19.13","23.58","22.10","83.48","46.65","11.38","5.13","2.90","0.00","0.67","0.45","1.12","6.25","6.92","12.28","6.47","5.80","5.80","0.67","15.18","4.91","1.79","1.12","1.56","2.90","6.70","3.12","3.57","0.45","2.23","0.67","7.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.67","13.62","3.12","2.01","0.67","3.12","2.01","3.79","1.79","0.00","0.67","0.89","0.89","0.67","0.00","0.00","0.22","5.13","0.67","0.45","2.90","0.89","0.45","6.03","8.04","0.67","15.85","3.35","6.03","6.92","4.46","1.12","0.45","2.90","0.22","0.45","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.88","4.02","7.81","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.22","7.59","3.57","0.00","0.45","2107","8.38","32.642857142857146","625","445","19","64.64","11.3","10.1","12.19","14.0","101","10.1","20.438651685393257","261","28.43","11","0.45","0","18","6","38","0","52","33","2","0","0","64","30","2","28","2","0","20","12","34","2","1","1","12","0","16","23","12","13","15","16","1","1","0","3"
"http://politicops.com/free-lap-dance-to-hillary/","Democrat Candidate A Former Male Stripper; Offers Free Lap-Dance To Hillary Clinton","“John Burkhalter, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor in Arkansas, used to be a male stripper before getting into politics, and he’s not embarrassed to talk about it, apparently. According to an interview Burkhalter gave to a CBS affiliate in Arkansas, 5NEWS, being a male stripper in Little Rock was one of the many “tough jobs” he had in his past.

“Asked about being portrayed as a candidate with a “different background, from Chippendales dancer to multi-millionaire”, Burkhalter openly said “I did have that job for a while, a very short time. It was when I was in Little Rock; I’ve always been an athlete, and I was actually buying cows from a farm.”

“The Democratic candidate also stated “I had like 17 acres in a little place called Billy Goat Hill, which is in North Pulaski County, and I was trying to make my way in life”.

But, what surprised during his interview the most is the fact that, apparently, stripping is like riding a bicycle: one never forgets how to do it (or loses the appetite for it).

“I’ll tell ya, stripping is one of those things that you can stop doing for a while, but it keeps on lurking beneath the surface, and pops up every now and then”, he continued. “Considering I was into bodybuilding in my younger days, stripping seemed like a quick way to earn some extra cash. I’ve had a lot of women in my day, but I have to admit that Hillary (Clinton) is one lady I wouldn’t mind revisiting my old ways for once again”, Burkhalter said.

Whether the former US Secretary of State has an irresistible aura or it’s just Burkhalter who sees something special in her is unclear; however, any woman who makes a man want to go back to his wicked ways for her is special, and Burkhalter agrees: “I wouldn’t even mind giving her a lap dance, and that has nothing to do with the fact that we’re members of the same party.”","2014-10-30 18:18:41","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","337","68.00","60.54","44.56","41.89","33.70","18.69","85.46","56.38","14.24","8.61","4.75","0.59","0.59","2.67","0.00","5.64","8.31","15.13","10.68","4.75","6.23","1.48","17.21","4.45","2.97","2.08","2.08","2.08","2.97","1.78","0.89","0.30","0.30","0.30","10.68","0.00","0.00","1.78","2.67","10.39","0.89","1.19","0.89","3.56","1.78","2.97","0.89","0.30","0.59","0.00","0.89","0.30","0.30","0.00","0.30","4.45","1.78","0.89","1.19","0.59","0.59","5.93","9.50","0.59","15.13","0.89","8.01","6.53","2.67","2.08","0.00","0.59","0.00","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.47","2.97","7.42","0.59","0.59","0.00","0.00","0.30","5.04","2.37","1.19","0.00","1451","8.03","38.333333333333336","462","336","10","54.29","12.9","14.0","9.7","16.8","58","12.375","22.34476190476191","199","33.56","15","0.54","0","12","7","34","0","41","21","1","0","1","44","27","0","10","0","0","24","9","18","0","1","1","12","0","13","19","14","4","7","18","2","3","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/mississippi-tea-party-challenger/","Mississippi Tea Party Challenger Offers $1,000 for Proof Black Conservatives Don’t Exist","WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate hopeful and tea party candidate Chris McDaniel isn’t ready to concede victory to Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., just yet. McDaniel announced that he would provide a $1,000 reward to anyone who is able to bring forward proof of fraud in last month’s Mississippi Republican primary, in which his competitor received 7,000 more votes.

“Specifically, what my campaign needs is incontrovertible proof that black conservatives don’t exist,” McDaniel said on an interview with CNN’s Kate Bolduan. “I mean let’s be honest here. Cochran won because of the black vote. Yet, as we all know, blacks don’t vote Republican. Something’s rotten in Mississippi, Kate, and it’s not just the stench from the Delta.”

McDaniel realizes that his “theory on black conservatives” is a mere gut feeling and requires some form of empirical proof, though, which led to his idea for offering a reward. He has urged political researchers, members of academia, and even blacks themselves to provide hard evidence that blacks are incapable of either registering as Republicans or voting for Republicans.

“Charts, regression analyses, an official declaration from Al Sharpton–I’ll take whatever I can get to show that these people couldn’t have legitimately voted for this crook,” continued state Sen. McDaniel, whose distrust of Cochran has existed since at least last month, when he hired poll watchers to oversee voting operations in those black communities courted by the incumbent senator.

McDaniel later admitted that since his announcement, he has received a wide array of underwhelming responses, including a hand-written letter reading, “I’m black and only vote for Democrats. Where’s my $1,000?”

“It’s a step in the right direction, but we’ll need something a bit stronger,” said McDaniel. “If nobody gives me what I’m looking for, I guess I’ll just bang my drum a little harder. Saying something enough times usually becomes the truth anyway.”","2014-07-07 21:28:53","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","312","64.27","62.57","13.65","56.01","18.35","26.92","77.24","44.23","14.74","7.37","3.53","0.96","0.00","2.56","0.32","7.37","5.13","11.86","7.37","4.17","4.17","1.92","15.38","4.81","2.56","2.88","1.92","1.92","4.17","2.88","1.28","0.00","0.32","0.32","9.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.56","12.82","2.88","1.60","1.92","3.53","1.92","2.24","5.45","2.24","0.96","1.60","1.28","0.64","0.32","0.00","0.32","7.69","1.92","2.24","3.53","1.92","0.32","2.56","10.58","1.28","10.26","1.92","4.49","5.13","3.53","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.64","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.32","25.96","6.09","8.65","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.64","4.49","5.13","0.00","0.64","1555","8.6","25.307692307692307","473","307","18","62.58","12.1","8.8","13.57","12.4","80","5.6875","19.263452768729646","212","23.85","12","0.43","0","7","6","21","0","36","27","2","1","2","52","34","3","15","0","0","18","7","15","0","0","0","8","0","12","11","8","7","15","13","4","3","1","1"
"http://politicops.com/preexisting-condition-precludes-al-qaidas-life-insurance-payout/","Preexisting Condition Precludes Al-Qaida's Life Insurance Payout","BEIRUT — Al-Qaida members may be asked to give up their life in the name of jihad, but their job benefits were historically considered sacrosanct. With its leadership now splintered and resources stretched, the terrorist organization has been forced to make cutbacks in their once generous offerings.

The family of the late Majid Al-Majid, former commander of a Sunni militant group linked to al-Qaida, filed an official complaint with the group’s office of martyr resources after he died while in Lebanese custody this past Saturday.

“My husband died protecting the principles of the Abdullah Azzam Brigades,” said al-Majid’s widow, referring to the al-Qaida-linked Sunni militant group he headed. “The least the organization could do is provide the life insurance payout we were promised.”

Prior to Osama bin Laden’s death in 2011, al-Qaida “functioned really like a multinational,” said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University.

Married members were entitled to a monthly salary and a week of vacation for every three worked under the old regime. This is in addition to the 72 virgins promised to jihadist martyrs, according to some interpretations of the Quran.

A representative from the office of martyr resources acknowledged that “current circumstances compelled a reduction in benefits,” but refused to provide updated policy details.

“Al-Majid’s preexisting kidney condition contributed to his death,” the unnamed representative explained. “We cannot be held responsible for his ultimate demise. At best, he’s looking at 12 virgins in the afterlife.”

The leader’s kidney troubles brought about his demise in more ways than one. Al-Majid was originally detained in an ambulance after he had undergone dialysis late last year.

Lebanese state-run media reported that al-Majid died “after his health conditions deteriorated” in a central military hospital.

The hospital’s chief nephrologist Farid Faysal explained that, “most deaths I see follow some sort of a deterioration of health. In fact, all of them do.”

Continued Faysal, “Fortunately, my union fights to ensure that my insurance would cover such eventualities. They make it clear to my employers that they’re either with us or against us, in terms of our insurance and 401(k) plan.”","2014-01-13 08:28:37","0","28.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","55.0","1.0","35.0","3","361","96.84","83.39","20.55","35.44","19.00","27.70","78.67","40.72","8.86","6.37","1.39","1.39","0.00","2.22","1.39","2.49","8.31","15.24","5.26","1.66","1.94","0.28","10.53","3.88","3.05","0.00","1.94","3.05","3.32","1.94","1.39","0.55","0.28","0.00","12.19","1.11","0.00","0.00","2.49","9.14","2.22","1.11","0.55","1.66","1.66","2.22","1.39","0.83","0.55","0.00","2.77","0.55","1.66","0.55","0.00","10.53","3.88","1.39","4.99","0.83","0.55","5.54","5.54","0.55","13.02","1.11","5.82","6.09","5.54","0.55","0.28","1.39","1.66","2.22","0.28","0.00","0.28","0.28","0.00","0.00","21.05","5.26","4.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.05","4.99","2.22","0.55","0.00","1838","9.24","23.0625","567","350","19","52.8","13.8","10.5","14.79","13.8","104","11.125","21.245714285714286","229","21.81","3","0.41","0","6","6","36","0","48","28","0","2","3","66","36","0","25","0","0","13","12","6","1","1","1","13","0","11","27","5","14","5","4","0","0","0","0"
"http://politicops.com/news-crew-quarantined-order-politicians-fearing-apocalypse/","News Crew Quarantined Under Order By Politicians Fearing Apocalypse","NEW JERSY – It should come as no surprise that in recent weeks there has been a heightened awareness of public health hazards that threaten the well being of the public. Government agencies, law enforcement, medical professionals, and even airlines have taken to new guidelines to try and prevent the spread of diseases across the country. However, one news crew is finding those guidelines rather – solitary.

According to reports a news crew recently returned from Liberia have been taken into custody for Quarantine. The reason? Zombie Apocalypse.

As shocking as this sounds, it seems that local officials were weary on taking the chance that the walking dead could, in fact, become a reality on the streets of New Jersey. While no names have been released, facts on the case have been made known to the public.

Sources from New Jersey Department of Health report that the members of the news crew who work for an affiliate of a major news outlet were recently on assignment in the African country of Liberia. The crew, whose names have not yet been released, were apparently traveling a region of the country where the Ebola virus had wiped out whole villages.

So, why are they being quarantined now?

Apparently footage recovered from the crew’s trip, indicate that some of the dead affected by the virus, reanimated hours after their demise. Sources say that while the crew may not exhibit signs or symptoms of Ebola, they could however be infected with a mutant strain that could cause them to become part of the walking dead.

This new order for mandatory quarantine was not a surprise to some. While on location, the news crew’s cameraman did become infected with the Ebola Virus. The other member’s of the crew had agreed to a state of voluntary quarantine upon return to the United States as per the standards for those considered to be at low probability for infection. Despite the fact that the rest of the members of said crew remain symptom free, the suggestion that the virus had mutated to reanimate the dead remains a concern for local politicians.

Be that as it may, sources close to the Health Department have said that the quarantine order came down from other levels of government. Rumors abound that evidence this strain of Ebola creates Zombies has politician’s clamoring to eliminate the problem before it gets started. All footage of the trip to Liberia has been seized for review while the news crew has gone into quarantine and are unavailable for comment at this time.","2014-10-12 18:14:07","1","25.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","55.0","1.0","35.0","3","424","95.20","62.06","29.04","18.79","21.20","23.35","83.73","51.42","7.31","0.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.94","6.37","11.32","16.75","9.67","3.30","3.77","1.18","14.62","4.72","2.36","0.94","0.24","1.18","3.30","1.42","1.89","0.71","0.24","0.24","6.60","0.00","1.89","0.00","0.00","10.85","2.36","2.12","1.42","2.59","0.94","2.36","0.94","0.00","0.94","0.00","2.59","0.00","2.59","0.00","0.00","8.49","2.83","0.94","2.59","1.18","1.18","5.66","6.13","0.47","14.39","1.89","6.84","5.19","5.19","0.24","0.00","0.24","0.00","1.65","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","9.67","4.25","4.01","0.00","0.00","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.94","0.00","0.00","2026","8.11","21.4","612","426","18","64.34","12.4","10.2","11.38","13.4","89","8.5","19.836807511737092","224","19.1","2","0.48","0","4","1","60","0","70","31","0","0","6","75","25","2","26","0","0","7","1","17","0","0","1","13","0","13","14","9","22","15","10","2","1","1","2"
"http://politicops.com/clinton-memoir-presents-alternate-history-hillary-elected-president-2008/","Clinton ‘Memoir’ Presents Alternate History in Which Hillary Was Elected President in 2008","WASHINGTON — Hillary Clinton released a one-chapter preview of her new book “Hard Choices” Friday, giving an insider’s account of the White House’s reaction to the Benghazi attack and sharply blasting Republicans who “insist on politicizing” the tragedy. Although initially reported to be a memoir, “Hard Choices”is actually an alternative history novel in which Hillary Clinton was elected president in 2008 over Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

The book, which begins with Sen. Barack Obama suspending his campaign for the Democratic nomination in June 2008, offers a gripping and vivid portrayal of the fictitious Clinton presidency. The novel features behind-the-scenes glimpses at several pivotal moments in the Clinton presidency, from the successful launch of the Hillarycare website, to the campaign to depose Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in 2013 after he crossed the so-called “Clinton Red Line” when he used chemical weapons on civilians.

In addition, significant detail is given to the hunt for Osama bin Laden, culminating in the raid that killed the terrorist mastermind in May 2011. Clinton fantasizes that the search for the al-Qaeda leader “was an obsession I pursued relentlessly from Day 1.

“I’ll never forget the moment when [then-CIA Director] Leon Panetta looked me in the eyes and said, ‘Madam President, we just can’t know it’s [bin Laden]. We need more time,’ ” reads an excerpt from Chapter 11, “Justice Done.” “I looked right back at him and said, ‘Leon, the American people have already waited 10 years. Send in the SEALs.’”

“Hard Choices” is widely seen as a publicity generator for Clinton’s upcoming presidential run. The Wall Street Journal described it as a first draft of her 2016 convention speech. Political pundits are already praising the choice to write an alternative history novel as a classic Clinton maneuver, saying that a fictitious universe of her own imagination creates distance from the controversy-soaked Obama administration.

“Hard Choices”isn’t all roses, however; Clinton readily admits her pretend mistakes, and doesn’t attempt to explain away or shift blame. Clinton is particularly harsh on herself for failing to reverse the losses of the ‘08-‘09 recession until late 2011 and concedes that her green energy initiatives “didn’t go nearly as far as they should have,” to combat climate change.

Reactions to “Hard Choices”have been divided. “Even in her fictitious world, Hillary Clinton succumbs to failed policies that punish our nation’s business leaders and damage America’s standing abroad,” said Speaker John Boehner, who is occasionally referred to as “former Rep. Boehner” in the novel.","2014-06-05 11:38:40","0","24.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","421","94.31","66.56","24.52","5.50","21.05","31.12","72.92","40.38","7.13","4.51","0.95","0.71","0.00","2.61","0.24","2.61","9.50","13.54","4.99","3.09","4.99","1.19","10.93","5.70","2.14","1.43","3.09","1.19","4.75","1.43","3.33","0.48","1.19","0.95","7.84","0.00","0.00","1.90","0.95","9.03","2.85","1.90","0.71","0.95","0.71","2.14","5.46","2.14","1.43","1.90","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.08","0.71","2.38","5.94","0.24","0.71","4.28","5.70","0.95","14.25","1.19","6.89","6.41","4.99","1.66","0.00","0.71","0.00","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.75","4.75","5.23","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","2.14","7.36","3.09","0.00","0.95","2130","9.58","28.8","654","411","20","50.57","12.9","11.3","14.39","14.6","128","7.25","22.697420924574214","274","26.8","6","0.39","0","8","12","41","0","48","34","1","0","2","70","68","2","16","0","0","14","7","22","0","0","0","12","0","13","15","8","8","9","15","3","2","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/colorado-gop-tests-new-strategy-sends-gunmen-doors-hesitant-voters/","Colorado GOP Tests New Strategy, Sends Gunmen to Doors of Hesitant Voters","DENVER, Colo. – Throughout the nation, GOP hopefuls have recently begun offering voters who submit personal contact information to their campaign websites and e-mailing lists the chance to win a firearm through number-based raffles.

Though a relatively unexploited political maneuver, such gun raffles have been used to collect information during a California race for sheriff, a Senate primary in South Carolina, and an unsuccessful gubernatorial run in Colorado. Though he was unsuccessful in making the Republican ballot, state Sen. Greg Brophy also ran his own gun sweepstakes while campaigning for governor of Colorado.

Brophy was quoted in an April 19th interview with Patriots, Pecs, and Ammo Magazine saying, “This gun sweepstakes, it’s just the beginning. These men and women who are entering the raffles are Republicans anyway. Now the next step is we gots [sic] to figure out how to get these people to the polls.”

In cooperation with the fundraising group Sons and Daughters of Constitutional Soil, a new Colorado GOP-sponsored website has since been launched. The site attempts to solicit volunteers to “help get hesitant voters to the polls, and, more importantly, educate them on why they should vote right”, according to the website’s mission statement.

The website, VOTEORWE’LLBLOWYOURSKULLAPART.COM, so far has already received 50,000 hits and attracted upwards of a 1,000 volunteers.

A request from the site owners for further information has been ignored, though an excerpt from an instructional handbook, normally available only to volunteers, has been obtained by Newslo.

It reads, in part, “To attract voters who might be hesitant to vote, and vote right, we are embarking on a new strategy in which we send armed volunteers to the homes of anyone who has not submitted contact information to our gun raffles… If, after gentle prodding, they still seem undecided or hesitant in voting, we suggest firing a warning shot just to let them know this is serious business. Perhaps aim at a birdbath or vanity mailbox. If the warning shot doesn’t produce the desired effect, more extreme measures are encouraged.”

State Sen. Brophy, when queried on the Colorado GOP’s new strategy responded,

“Look, man. No one’s doing anything illegal. You’re allowed to go door to door here. And to be honest if we have to blow a skull apart it’s only because these people still refuse to vote, and, to be entirely honest now, that scares us.”

He continued, “So really we’re just standing our political ground like a political Zimmerman, and what’s wrong with that? When Jay Z said ‘Vote or Die,’ he’s on all your musical televisions. But when we actually carry the warning out, we’re demonized by the liberal media. Now isn’t that the real issue here?”","2014-04-29 09:16:33","0","27.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","453","77.00","84.51","20.77","13.75","18.88","26.93","76.38","47.46","9.05","4.86","0.00","2.43","0.44","0.88","1.10","4.19","7.95","12.58","7.51","6.62","6.62","0.88","13.25","4.42","1.32","2.43","0.88","1.32","5.08","1.99","2.87","0.88","0.00","0.44","11.48","0.44","0.44","0.44","1.55","10.82","2.21","2.43","1.32","3.53","0.44","3.31","1.77","1.10","0.66","0.00","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.71","3.31","1.32","3.31","1.10","1.55","2.87","9.05","0.22","12.80","1.99","5.96","5.08","1.99","0.66","1.32","0.22","0.00","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.22","21.19","5.30","8.83","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.66","2.43","3.09","0.00","0.44","2211","8.87","25.833333333333332","701","447","24","52.6","12.6","10.5","12.88","12.4","122","11.2","20.357225950783","283","23.22","9","0.46","0","15","5","42","0","43","39","0","0","2","62","40","1","28","0","0","20","5","28","2","0","2","22","0","22","11","15","17","20","13","1","5","0","5"
"http://politicops.com/germany-authorizes-snowden-honorary-security-clearance/","Germany Authorizes Snowden for Honorary Security Clearance","BERLIN – Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who has found asylum in Russia, was recently granted honorary security clearance by the German government for his role in exposing surveillance practices of the United States.

“In our eyes, he is a friend, a hero, and an ally,” said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been the target of alleged NSA surveillance herself. “For his brave actions, he’ll have unfettered access to all government intel, which includes military strategy, economic planning, and the secret compounds where government officials watch the German national football team on TV while having access to unlimited Kolsch beer and mouth-watering schnitzel.”

“The strudel factory in Cologne will still be off limits to him,” continued Merkel, speaking of the anonymous, Michelin-rated pastry compound that is only open to high-ranking government officials. “It’s only honorary clearance, so we had to draw the line somewhere.”

The decision to grant Snowden clearance came after the University of Rostock awarded him an honorary doctorate for his “outstanding academic achievement” in shedding light on U.S. surveillance measures. She called the moment an “inspiring occasion.”

“Frankly, honorary degrees and security clearance aren’t enough for people like Edward,” said Merkel. “America has marginalized him, making him feel small, feeble, and insignificant. Yet he has withstood the pressure like any German would. He’s a champion.”

Merkel went on to say that while Snowden may “feel small” in Germany, it will be in a literal rather than figurative sense.

“It feels good to be welcomed,” said Snowden. “Everyone there might be tall and look like Leonardo DiCaprio with those piercing blue eyes and stunning cheek bones, and I may be a squirrely and smarmy dweeb, but I still feel like I’m one of them. Danke schoen, Deutschland.”

Snowden also said he’s excited to explore not only top-secret locations in Germany, but also its “verdant pastures and rolling hills.”

“It’s a beautiful place,” said Snowden. “Much prettier than bleak Russia. Speaking of which, I have to break the news to Putin. If he chastises me for abandoning him, which is a distinct possibility, I’ll just go ahead and share secrets about his surveillance practices. Sorry, Vlad.”

Snowden wouldn’t divulge what those secrets might be, but he did drop a hint, saying he had footage of “certain shirtless WWE wrestlers in rehearsal.”","2014-05-22 09:56:29","0","27.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","386","73.00","78.15","9.00","90.19","17.55","29.27","76.42","45.85","11.40","6.99","1.55","0.52","0.00","4.66","0.26","4.15","6.48","12.18","9.33","3.89","5.18","0.78","16.06","5.44","2.85","1.81","0.26","0.78","5.44","4.66","0.78","0.26","0.00","0.52","12.18","0.00","0.52","0.52","4.40","10.36","3.63","0.26","1.30","2.33","1.30","2.59","5.70","1.81","2.33","1.04","2.07","1.55","0.26","0.00","0.26","10.10","1.81","3.89","4.66","1.55","0.52","3.89","8.81","2.59","11.14","1.81","5.96","3.11","3.89","1.04","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","25.91","6.22","8.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.04","7.77","2.33","0.00","0.00","1943","8.78","26.466666666666665","579","384","21","61.36","11.9","9.2","13.87","13.0","103","15.166666666666666","20.049166666666668","241","24.2","12","0.43","0","14","1","29","0","39","41","1","0","7","62","43","1","19","0","0","27","6","15","0","0","1","11","0","16","19","9","9","6","12","4","3","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/fox-news-stunned-that-another-hand-picked-hero-turned-out-to-be-a-racist/","Fox News Stunned That Another Hand-Picked Hero Turned Out to be a Racist","NEW YORK — Conservative media outlets are scrambling to distance themselves from Nevada rancher Clive Bundy today, following statements appearing in The New York Times where the 67-year-old Bundy wondered out loud if blacks were “better off under slavery” and opined that young black men are incarcerated in large numbers because “they never learned how to pick cotton.” While responses so far have been predictably condemnatory, many conservative commentators have gone farther, daring to ask if right-wing extremism is intricately linked to racism.

“This has happened before,” said “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough. “It happened when conservatives raced blindly to put their arms around George Zimmerman…They basically pick their friends based on who their ‘enemies’ are. In this case, a lot of people in conservative media have raced to this guy’s defense. They must be feeling very exposed this morning.”

Time’s Michael Crowley echoed Scarborough’s statements, saying, “Guys like [Bundy] and Ted Nugent are doing a favor to the left, a favor to Democrats. To the extent that there are interesting, intellectually credible strains of conservative thought about limiting government authority, people like this get associated with them, and make them look ridiculous.”

“Once, just for once, can we find a fringe figure who isn’t a mass murderer, racist, or religious fanatic?” a senior executive at Fox News complained. “Somewhere there has to be a strict constitutionalist who believes in family values and small government, who doesn’t simultaneously fear and minorities and gays. Am I really asking for all that much?” The executive went on to blame the system for vetting right-wing heroes, which he confessed hadn’t been updated since “the early ‘80s or so.”

“It’s just a checklist on a clipboard,” the executive admitted with a note of embarrassment in his voice. “Denies the legitimacy of federal government? Check. Loves guns? Check. Prays out loud? Check. We don’t have any boxes for ‘doesn’t hate black people’ or ‘doesn’t think AIDS is a Biblical plague’ or ‘doesn’t have a 14-year-old wife’, and frankly, we’ve gotten bit on that last one a few times too many.”

Nevertheless, the right-wing media marches on stoically, determined to advance their message with whatever spokespeople they have.

“It’s just devastating to learn that another patriot for the American way of life is actually just a racist,” said Steve Doocy on Thursday’s “Fox & Friends.” “I think I now know how Asians feel when one of their children turns into a C-student.”","2014-04-24 15:31:16","0","30.0","11.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","55.0","31.0","0.0","81.0","1.0","35.0","9","413","71.40","75.88","61.55","18.62","17.21","23.24","80.87","45.28","9.93","4.84","0.73","0.73","0.00","0.48","2.91","4.84","6.30","12.59","8.47","5.81","5.33","1.94","16.95","2.91","1.21","2.66","1.45","2.18","5.33","2.42","2.91","0.73","1.21","0.24","11.38","0.48","0.97","0.24","1.21","10.90","4.36","2.18","0.73","2.66","0.97","2.42","3.39","1.21","1.69","0.48","1.45","0.24","0.73","0.48","0.00","7.99","2.18","1.21","3.87","1.21","0.24","4.12","11.38","0.24","16.46","1.45","7.99","6.78","2.66","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.97","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","26.63","4.84","5.57","0.00","0.00","1.21","0.00","1.94","7.99","4.36","0.00","0.73","2037","8.54","26.6875","620","405","20","59.33","12.6","10.0","13.63","13.8","100","13.875","19.996543209876545","269","23.88","7","0.45","0","11","5","35","0","44","36","1","0","2","59","38","4","29","1","0","17","6","27","0","0","2","13","0","14","14","14","12","19","12","2","4","0","5"
"http://politicops.com/love-story-white-house/","Love Story in the White House","On September 19th, 2014 a man by the name of Omar Gonzalez (42) became one of the selected few in the history of America who made it past the heavy security and into the White House. Having scaled the fence and run across the lawn, Gonzalez was able to slip through an unlocked door just prior to being tackled.

While this is not a new embarrassment for the Secret Service (the elite agency has been severely criticized for the many recent lapses of its agents and personnel), its reason might be. Namely, although the director (now former) of the US Secret Service, Julia Pierson, didn’t state it directly during a White House oversight committee hearing regarding the incident, a rumor has it that Gonzalez attempted to reach the US President because he had, and get a load of this – a huge crush on him!

Officials categorically deny such a claim and that’s completely understandable, considering the fact that Barrack Obama is the current President of one of the most powerful and influential countries on the planet. But, if he’s charming enough to inspire a married man of 42 years old to “come out of the closet” just because of him, then surely he should be capable of solving much more difficult global issues, wouldn’t you say?

Gonzalez was even successful enough to make it to the White House’s first floor and the East Room thanks to the fact that he pushed the unsuspecting guard from his way when he entered the unlocked door. Unfortunately for him, his love, Mr. Obama had left the White House some 10 minutes ago via helicopter. Apparently, in the end love doesn’t conquer all.

Although men have done insane things in the name of love in the past, breaking into the White House for a little r n’r between two married men is borderline incomprehensible. Then again, where better to hide such a secret than in plain sight? The incident is a demonstration of the power of raw sexual attraction; luckily (or maybe not) for the US President, the agent who tackled Gonzalez was probably a republican. Who knows what would have happened if he was a democrat.","2014-10-12 15:32:11","0","8.0","2.0","18.0","2.0","1.0","0.0","21.0","17.0","0.0","20.0","0.0","9.0","0","364","92.28","75.40","23.97","62.24","28.00","20.60","87.09","51.65","8.79","4.12","0.00","0.82","0.27","3.02","0.00","4.67","12.91","13.46","7.69","3.85","5.22","1.37","12.09","6.32","1.65","1.65","2.20","1.92","4.67","3.30","1.37","0.27","0.27","0.00","9.89","0.55","0.00","0.00","4.12","11.81","3.02","1.65","1.37","3.02","1.92","2.75","2.47","1.65","0.55","0.27","1.10","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","8.79","2.20","2.47","3.57","0.82","1.10","5.22","6.32","0.82","15.38","1.37","7.42","6.59","3.30","0.00","2.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.55","0.00","0.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.74","3.02","4.95","0.00","0.27","0.55","0.27","0.00","0.55","1.92","2.20","0.00","1652","8.35","28.46153846153846","531","364","14","53.55","13.5","12.3","10.28","13.7","79","12.0","21.08131868131868","218","24.77","3","0.49","0","9","8","51","1","52","33","1","0","3","49","39","0","11","1","0","14","4","25","1","1","0","9","0","11","16","6","7","5","8","0","3","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/wall-street-banker-urges-employees-cautious-screwing-counterparties/","Wall Street Banker Urges Employees To Be Cautious When Screwing Over Counterparties","NEW YORK – A leading investment banker at Deutsche Bank recently urged employees via a company video to clean up their vulgar, indiscreet, and boastful behavior when “screwing over their counterparties.”

“Some of you are falling way short of our established standards,” said Colin Fan, one of the heads of Deutsche Bank’s investment banking department, in the virally spread video. “When giving the shaft to those with whom we conduct business, we must remain mum on the issue so as not to raise any eyebrows, primarily within the SEC.”

The harsh-toned video was in response to the persisting exchange of unprofessional emails among Deutsche Bank employees, even after a 2013 internal investigation revealed that one company banker said of a 2007 interest-rate-swap deal with Indian firm Unitech, “No one likes to know he got screwed.”

“By continuing to broadcast our ‘transgressions’ to the world, we’re taking all the fun out of it,” continued Fan. “Trust me, I’ve been doing this for years, and there is no greater pleasure than swindling someone in a transaction, then playing dumb to the SEC and the court system. So please, exercise caution going forward.”

Sanjay Agarwal, the Deutsche Bank employee who sent the aforementioned 2007 email, said his co-workers would be wise to heed Fan’s directives.

“My bonus was cut in half as a result of my actions,” said Agarwal, who currently makes $680,000 per year. “It was exceptionally rough on me and family, and I certainly don’t wish the same on the guys at the firm.”

Agarwal went on to say that whenever his team manipulates an interest rate or sells damaged goods to a counterparty, they “simply move on, like it never happened.”

“Almost like a Jedi mind trick,” continued Agarwal. “And listen, if you seek catharsis and absolutely have to share your morally questionable activity with someone, be discreet. Tell your wife in private. Tell your brother over a beer. Or, if you really want to be cautious, share it on Myspace.”","2014-05-19 09:41:51","0","25.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","334","89.43","86.60","22.50","70.81","20.88","23.95","80.24","46.71","10.78","6.89","1.80","1.50","1.80","0.90","0.90","3.89","7.78","15.57","4.49","3.89","5.69","1.50","12.28","4.19","2.69","1.80","2.69","0.90","6.59","4.49","2.10","0.00","1.20","0.00","14.07","1.20","0.30","0.60","1.50","8.98","1.50","1.50","1.80","2.69","1.50","2.10","3.89","1.50","1.80","0.60","1.80","0.60","0.30","0.60","0.30","8.08","3.29","1.20","2.69","0.90","0.90","3.59","7.19","0.90","13.77","2.69","7.49","4.19","5.99","2.69","0.30","4.49","0.00","0.00","1.20","0.90","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","23.35","4.79","8.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.20","6.89","1.80","0.00","0.30","1572","8.29","34.0","486","331","16","58.92","13.0","10.2","11.89","12.6","76","12.0","19.464290030211483","228","30.1","7","0.44","0","9","7","30","0","42","18","1","0","2","60","31","0","15","1","0","16","11","16","0","0","2","13","0","13","16","10","6","9","5","0","3","0","3"
"http://politicops.com/john-boehner-pisses-putin/","House Speaker John Boehner Pisses Off Vladimir Putin","“Iowa – John Boehner, R-Ohio, is on a mission to destroy the diplomatic relationships between the United States and Russian Federation, apparently! The Republican candidate in Iowa stated that Russia would have never invaded any other country if former president George W. Bush had anything to say in the matter.

” “Does anybody think that Vladimir Putin would have gone into Crimea had George W. Bush been the president of the United States? No! Even Putin is smart enough to know that Bush would have punched him in the nose”, Boehner stated, according to the Quad Cities Online.

On the other side of the world, the Russian President was said to have laughed his bear hide off upon hearing House Speaker Boehner’s words…initially. Putin, who is not a man of many words, was said to have been unusually quiet in the days following the statement of the US Republican candidate.

“I was never too fond of the West as such, but I’ve always attempted to maintain a certain sense of politics and respectable diplomacy when it comes to treating foreign dignitaries. However, statements like these do not do well for my temper. At the end of the day, maybe I should remind Mr. Boehner that I’m a black belt in judo”, Putin semi-jokingly said in an interview with Russia Today.

What’s even more interesting is the fact that another former US President, Bill Clinton, made an interesting addition to the “conversation”: I can tell you that I wouldn’t want to be in W’s shoes right about now. I mean, I know he’s had CIA training in his day and all, but the Russians are not to be underestimated, not even ones as small as the current Russian President.

But on the other hand, that is a fight I would very much like to see.

"http://politicops.com/women-against-birth-control/","Group of Women Protest Against Birth Control","LOS ANGELES, CA – A large group of women decided to put a stop to the feminist movement that has plagued the country for the better of fifty years. Mightily holding up signs that read, “TELL US WHAT TO DO WITH OUR BODIES” AND “MY UTERUS IS YOUR UTERUS,” Stacey Wilson and Rita Johnson are clearly passionate about their rights – or rather, their right to not have rights.

“I’m just sick of women needing all this contraception mumbo jumbo,” Stacey fumed. “I have no idea how my menstrual cycle works, and why should I? I think we need to trust our government officials. These men know our bodies better than we do.”

“I agree,” chimed in Rita. “I have never used contraception, and my life has been much better for it. Sure, I have six children with five different men and none of us can afford them, but God loves me so it’s a fair trade off.”

Stacey, Rita and fifteen other anti-feminists gathered outside a Planned Parenthood on Monday afternoon to share their opinions with unsuspecting women walking in for their pelvic exam appointments. They handed out pamphlets titled “How To Surrender Your Body To Your Government” and “Leave Your Sexual Health To The Pros. P.S. It’s Not You,” and tried to convince women not to go into the sexual health center.

The group of women will hold a condom-burning event in Hollywood over the weekend.

"http://politicops.com/oklahoma-gun-range-2/","Oklahoma Gun Range Owner Claims Howitzer Misfire Caused By Liberal Conspiracy Called 'Physics'","WYANDOTTE, Okla. – An artillery shell fired from a 105mm howitzer at the Oklahoma Full Auto Shoot and Trade Show last weekend crashed through the walls and ceiling of an Oklahoma home three miles away while homeowner Gene Kelley and his wife were in the house. The owner of historic, military-grade weapon insisted that the gun was fired properly, and blamed the damage to the Kelley’s home on what he termed ‘that damn liberal conspiracy they call physics.’

“As far as the safety end of everything, we drill every one of our shooters before it ever begins. We have [a] 30-45 minute drill,” said Mike Friend, Owner of Fast Machine Gun Shoot. “We teach them how to point the gun, how to fire the gun, all that. What the shell does after that is up to God.”

Friend claimed that the individual who paid him money for the treat of firing the deadly weapon in no way intended to destroy the Kelley’s home. “It was not on a level plane, but on a downward trend, pointed downhill in the bottom of a valley,” said Friend. “For that thing to rise and go far northwest of the range, it’s just unheard of.

“It was those damn anti-gun freaks putting their physics mumbo-jumbo on the shell. They’re the real criminals,” he added.

Friend said authorities should look for a way to better protect gun owners from the ‘liberal physics conspiracy. “That’s some seriously dangerous stuff,” he said. “I mean you shoot a gun in the air, and they make the bullet come right back down at you. Someone’s going to get hurt!”

The homeowners, in another room at the time, were unharmed when the 14.5 inch-long, 3.5 inch-across shell blasted the walls of their house into smithereens. “It’s unbelievable,” Kelley said. “Unless you were here to see it or see the pictures I’ve got, you would not believe how huge this thing is.” Kelley said things could have been even worse had the shell not struck a tree and the ground before smashing its way through his home.

Friend agreed that his 105mm howitzer has some serious kill power. “Oh yeah, pulverize a wall three miles out? No problem,” he said. “You should see what it does from, like, a couple hundred yards away!”","2014-06-29 11:26:33","1","29.0","9.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","53.0","31.0","0.0","79.0","1.0","35.0","8","387","88.24","83.70","20.34","1.00","16.12","14.73","81.40","49.61","13.70","6.20","0.52","1.03","1.29","2.07","1.29","7.49","10.59","13.70","6.20","2.58","4.39","1.29","11.63","3.62","2.33","2.07","2.07","1.81","5.43","1.03","4.39","0.00","1.81","0.26","11.63","0.26","1.29","0.26","2.07","6.46","0.52","1.29","1.29","1.03","1.03","1.55","3.88","1.55","1.81","0.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.53","2.58","0.52","3.62","1.03","1.29","4.65","6.20","0.26","16.80","1.55","12.14","3.88","2.33","0.26","1.81","0.78","0.26","0.26","1.29","0.78","0.00","0.26","0.26","0.00","22.74","5.43","6.20","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.52","1.55","5.94","2.33","0.00","0.52","1666","6.67","20.894736842105264","495","382","25","81.33","8.7","5.7","8.98","8.0","55","12.375","13.879162303664925","231","19.0","3","0.47","0","9","12","52","0","44","19","1","0","4","66","28","0","17","1","0","26","7","19","1","0","1","9","0","15","29","4","4","11","8","2","4","0","4"
"http://politicops.com/obama-opposes-scottish-independence-like-need-another-country-spy/","Obama Opposes Scottish Independence: ‘Like We Need Another Country to Spy On’","BRUSSELS — President Obama came out against an independent Scotland Thursday, saying he wished the U.K. “remains a strong, robust, united, and effective partner,” adding that “a brand-new country to spy on is the last thing we need right now.”

Speaking alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron at a G7 press conference, President Obama called the U.K. an “extraordinary partner to [the U.S.]” and said that “From the outside at least, it looks like things have worked pretty well, so why make us go through the trouble of keeping tabs on a government in Edinburgh as well as London?”

“Breaking Scotland away from the U.K. would just mean more busywork for the N.S.A., and let me tell you, morale there is not great at the moment,” Obama said. “They’ve got their hands full enough without a newfangled industrial democracy to keep tabs on.”

The president also expressed concerns that, once independent, the U.S. risks seeing Scotland develop into “[o]ne of those human rights-obsessed headaches like Iceland or Sweden.”

“Because a first-world country that gives Edward Snowden safe passage and asylum is at the top of my wish list,” Obama added sarcastically.

"http://politicops.com/senator-accuses-tiger-montanans-pressuring-cheat/","Senator Accuses ‘Tiger Montanans’ of Pressuring Him to Cheat","HELENA, Mont.—Having brought disgrace to the state that raised him, Sen. John Walsh, Democrat of Montana, announced last week that he would drop his bid for reelection.

Walsh only reluctantly came to accept “full responsibility” for plagiarizing large portions of his final paper at the U.S. Army War College, having first claimed that it was combat stress and the “unrelenting pressure from ‘Tiger Montanans’ to outperform his white colleagues on the Senate floor” that drove him to act expeditiously.

Amy Chua, the author of the 2011 book, “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,” had little sympathy for Walsh—a stance she also adopted in raising her daughters were they ever to earn any grade less than an A or fall behind other students in any class, save for gym or drama.

“I might have expected this type of laziness from elected officials hailing from other Western states,” said Chua. “But John? His constituents sent their hard-earned tax dollars with him to Washington, presuming they’d get nothing less than the best, most genuine representation out there. Now John must come home in shame.”

According to Chua, Walsh acted like a “stubborn child” in refusing to apologize for his behavior, insisting only that the “research paper from my time at the U.S. Army War College has become a distraction from the debate you expect and deserve.”

“Perhaps if John spent less time fraternizing and messing about with the Senate’s Special Committee on Aging,” suggested Chua, “he would have been able to devote himself more fully to the real work of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation—and the violin.”

“Let this be a lesson to whomever is nominated to run in Walsh’s stead,” said Jon Tester, the state’s senior senator. “There are no shortcuts to academic or political excellence.”

Walsh’s replacement on the ballot is expected at the Aug. 16 convention here in the state capital. In the interim, journalists have taken to poring over the academic work of every vulnerable Senate candidate.

At press time, all copies of Sen. Mitch McConnell’s thesis, entitled “The Tortoise and the Hare,” had been reported missing from the University of Kentucky’s law library.

"http://politicops.com/gop-criticizes-obamacare-ineffective-death-panels/","GOP Criticizes Obamacare for Ineffective Death Panels","BOSTON – Republican leaders attempted to debunk a recent study out of Massachusetts, which offered evidence that the state’s decreased death rate since 2006 is a result of its universal health care system, the same system that served as a model for integral parts of Obamacare.

“What it really comes down to is utterly incompetent death panels, not this mumbo jumbo about socialist health care proactively saving Grandma’s life,” said Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, who once claimed that Obamacare may “start [America] down a treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia.”

The term “death panel,” coined by Sarah Palin, is a euphemism for the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, according to the former Alaska Governor, is a group of bureaucrats who decide whether sick individuals are worthy of Obamacare coverage and thus survival.

“Obama wanted these panels to decide the fate of sick peoples’ lives,” said Palin when she learned of the study. “Your coverage is denied, you go home, and you die. Pretty simple formula. Yet, these Democrats have gone ahead and botched the whole darn thing.”

Palin went on to say that while deep down she is delighted that peoples’ lives have been saved as a result of Obamcare’s shortcomings, “the principle of the matter” has forced her to point out the glaring errors in the “lazy” death panels.

“Laziness is one thing I just can’t deal with,” continued Palin. “If you say you’re going to do something, you better do it.”

When informed that the IAPB is not in fact a “death panel,” but instead a 15-person board which ensures that Medicare costs remain reasonable under the Affordable Care Act scheme, Palin could only guffaw.

“Six of one, a dozen of the other,” continued Palin. “Last time I checked, sending Aunt Barbara to an early retirement in heaven rather than Florida is a pretty good way to cut Medicare costs.”

Palin, who does not currently hold political office, says she won’t say “no” to a presidential run in 2016.

“First things first, I’d try to get rid of this health care nonsense,” said Palin. “If that wasn’t successful, I’d at least try to make sure these death panels worked hard and did their jobs, because that’s the American way.”","2014-05-15 21:45:16","0","29.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","67.0","1.0","35.0","5","375","84.77","64.57","20.24","66.17","23.44","18.93","78.13","44.80","11.73","4.00","1.07","0.00","1.60","1.07","0.27","7.73","8.00","12.80","6.93","2.67","3.73","1.87","15.73","4.53","2.13","2.67","2.67","0.80","4.80","3.47","1.33","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.07","0.53","0.00","1.60","0.00","10.13","1.60","2.40","1.33","2.13","0.53","3.73","2.40","0.00","2.13","0.27","2.67","0.00","2.67","0.00","0.00","6.93","0.53","3.20","3.20","1.07","0.00","3.73","10.93","1.33","12.00","1.87","5.07","5.07","4.27","0.00","0.53","1.33","0.27","1.87","0.53","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","24.53","4.27","7.73","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.80","8.00","3.20","0.00","0.53","1758","8.52","32.083333333333336","529","373","16","64.75","11.9","10.0","12.07","13.8","88","16.5","20.756997319034852","240","28.5","7","0.43","0","5","5","38","0","44","35","1","1","3","56","44","1","17","0","0","14","4","18","0","0","2","12","0","14","18","5","8","12","18","4","4","0","2"
"http://politicops.com/give-gun-take-gun-jar-georgia-convenience-store-hit-run/","Give-a-Gun, Take-a-Gun Jar in Georgia Convenience Store a Hit-and-Run","VALDOSTA, Ga.—No longer is the most dangerous thing in the local Enmark convenience store the three-alarm chili dog that has been spinning on its warmer since 1991. Thanks to the state’s new “guns everywhere” law, customers are able to grab a complimentary firearm if they come up short at the register.

The Georgia Safe Carry Protection Act came into effect last week, just in time for residents to stock up on chips, dip, and pistol grips for Independence Day. The law permits Georgia’s licensed gun owners and visitors from nearly 30 other states to carry their weapons into bars, schools, churches, and “pretty much everywhere else.”

“People come to Enmark to pick up a pack of cigarettes or a gallon of milk,” explained night manager Bob Beckhart. “Oftentimes they’re in a rush and don’t have time to put on a shirt or shoes before entering the store, let alone remember their handgun.”

Beckhart decided to offer a a give-a-gun, take-a-gun jar on the checkout counter to “handle this transition period, when our customers are still getting into the habit of always packing heat.”

Like a give-a-penny, take-a-penny jar, patrons are encouraged to drop spare guns into the jar or to grab a gun to help them settle an outstanding charge.

“It’s a real convenience,” said Bridgett Silver, 21, who was asked to buy a loaf of bread for her mother before realizing she didn’t have enough change. So she grabbed a gun from the jar, pointed in the general direction of the clerk and then walked out of the store with the bread.

“Next time I’m here,” said Silver, “I’ll be sure to pop the pistol back in the jar, so someone else could use it in a similar squeeze.”

Others come to the store prepared to give as good as they get but still appreciate the offering, nonetheless.

Ronald Williams, 62, spotted a fellow customer with a holstered weapon in Enmark on July 1—the same day the new law went into effect. After the customer refused to show Williams his identification and a firearms license, Williams drew his own gun.

No shots were fired, but Williams was arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor. Nobody, not even police officers, are allowed to demand to see a firearms permit under the new law.

Fortunately for Williams, the “guns everywhere” law also abolishes a previous restriction preventing people convicted of certain misdemeanors from obtaining a gun permit.

“It’s plain to see the law is having its intended effect,” said Williams as he was preparing to leave the police station. He excused himself to go to the convenience store for a pack of gum, taking with him his pistol but leaving his wallet behind.","2014-07-08 22:04:34","0","29.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","54.0","1.0","35.0","3","465","97.34","66.65","29.96","45.52","24.47","19.78","78.92","46.67","6.88","4.09","0.43","0.22","0.00","2.37","1.08","2.80","11.83","16.34","5.38","3.44","4.52","1.29","13.55","4.73","2.58","0.43","1.29","0.43","3.66","2.37","1.29","0.22","0.43","0.22","8.60","0.22","0.22","0.86","1.94","9.46","1.94","2.80","0.65","1.72","1.29","2.80","2.58","0.65","0.65","1.29","1.72","0.43","0.22","0.00","1.29","8.39","1.08","0.43","4.73","1.51","1.08","3.66","7.10","0.86","15.70","3.44","7.10","5.38","3.66","0.22","0.22","2.58","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.35","4.30","6.88","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.94","4.30","1.94","0.00","0.00","2087","7.88","31.6","635","454","19","64.14","12.1","10.3","11.15","13.4","88","12.25","19.31330396475771","271","27.4","3","0.44","0","12","6","56","0","50","33","0","0","1","97","33","0","24","0","0","15","10","22","0","1","3","23","0","25","21","11","8","13","7","1","1","0","1"
"http://politicops.com/critics-call-pentagons-zombie-survival-plan-racist/","Critics Call Pentagon’s Zombie Survival Plan Racist","WASHINGTON – A plan detailing the U.S. military’s reaction in the event of a zombie apocalypse has come under fire for being racist. The recently unclassified Defense Department document, titled “CONOP 8888,” was created by the Pentagon as a training exercise for dealing with unknown, planet-wide disasters and emergencies. However, a number of critics, including the ACLU and the NAACP, claim the response plan values the lives of Caucasians over minorities.

“The Pentagon’s zombie survival plan calls for abandoning our country’s urban centers to the hoards of the walking dead and concentrating on fortifying the suburbs,” explained NAACP Vice Chairman Leon Russell. “That sounds an awful lot like genocide of the African-American to me.”

The Pentagon dismissed the accusations. “The document is identified as a training tool used in an in-house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario,” said Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze, a spokeswoman for U.S. Strategic Command. “The dense concentration of human population within urban centers poses a direct threat to containment efforts. If folks have a problem with that, they should talk to the zombies.”

The document includes strategies for dealing with a variety of zombies, from ones “created via some form of occult experimentation in what might otherwise be referred to as ‘evil magic,’ to vegetarian zombies that pose no threat to humans due to their exclusive consumption of vegetation, to zombie life forms created after an organism is infected with a high dose of radiation.”

The method for dealing with the zombies has also raised some red flags for critics. “The only assumed way to effectively cause casualties to the zombie ranks by tactical force is the concentration of all firepower to the head, specifically the brain,” the plan reads. “The only way to ensure a zombie is ‘dead’ is to burn the zombie corpse.”

“Seriously? Burn their corpse?” responded Russell. “I get shooting them in the head but setting fire to them? All it’s missing is the phrase ‘while they hang from a tree limb in front of a burning cross’ and this could have been ripped out of the KKK playbook.”

The Pentagon maintains, however, that any similarities between the U.S. Strategic Command’s template for handling a zombie uprising and the methods historically employed by white supremacists against the African-American population are merely coincidence. “The plan is anti-city, not anti-black,” explained Kunze. “Trust me, plenty of white folk are gonna get eaten if this thing goes down.”","2014-05-19 09:28:37","0","24.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","422","99.00","55.65","8.59","13.04","19.18","28.91","76.54","44.31","4.50","2.37","0.71","0.24","0.00","0.00","1.42","2.13","13.27","16.82","4.98","2.13","4.03","0.47","9.48","4.50","1.90","0.47","0.24","1.90","3.79","1.42","2.37","0.47","0.47","0.47","4.27","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.00","2.37","2.13","1.18","2.13","0.71","1.90","2.84","0.95","0.71","1.18","2.84","0.71","1.42","0.00","0.71","8.29","0.24","3.55","3.08","0.47","1.42","2.61","5.92","1.90","9.00","1.18","6.16","1.42","1.66","0.47","0.24","0.00","0.00","4.03","0.24","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.09","5.92","4.74","0.00","0.00","0.71","0.00","1.42","6.40","1.90","0.00","0.00","2116","8.93","26.875","660","417","23","53.1","12.7","10.3","13.28","12.7","116","8.0","20.367098321342926","250","23.31","14","0.43","0","7","1","64","0","58","35","1","0","3","80","35","2","29","1","0","8","3","13","0","0","1","15","0","10","9","14","12","7","18","1","1","0","2"

"http://newslo.com/leafs-losing-revealed-rigged/","Leafs Losing Revealed to be Rigged","CANADA- The famous failure of the Toronto Maple Leafs has been revealed to be a dirty game.

On Wednesday night, following the Leafs 4-3 defeat to Montreal, Toronto team captain Dion Phaneuf broke the ice by addressing the team’s constant failure to associated press.

“I can’t stand it any longer,” Phanuef raged. “We do not suck. Our scores are rigged by higher powers. Our losing is rigged!”

The team’s general manager, Dave Nonis, confirmed this rumour to be true.

“I’ve been skating around the idea of going public about this for years,” Nonis said in an interview Friday. “It’s true- our game is controlled by the gods of the seasons. We’re always walking on thin ice.”

Nonis went on to explain that the Seasons dictate the team’s losses. For example, he said, in winter time, the team’s abilities are frozen, whereas in spring, they being to bloom.

“Too bad for us we’re usually eliminated by the time spring rolls around,” Nonis added.

When asked for comment, the Seasons politely declined.

The Leafs play next on Saturday at 7pm against Pittsburgh. Captain Phaneuf reported that while his teammates have been putting in an exceptional amount of ice time and mental work to prepare for this game, he still doesn’t feel optimistic about the outcome.

“It’s autumn, after all,” he said. “And the Seasons say that in autumn, the Leafs must fall.”","2014-10-11 15:19:32","0","29.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","62.0","1.0","34.0","5","231","92.84","89.52","57.14","6.50","12.83","20.35","83.98","45.45","9.96","6.06","0.87","3.03","0.00","1.73","0.43","3.90","9.09","15.58","7.79","3.46","2.16","1.30","14.72","4.76","1.30","0.43","0.87","1.73","6.06","2.16","3.90","0.00","0.87","2.16","13.85","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.73","7.36","1.73","0.87","0.43","0.87","2.16","1.73","3.46","0.43","1.73","1.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.15","6.93","5.63","4.76","1.30","2.16","4.33","9.09","0.87","19.91","2.60","6.49","10.82","5.63","4.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.43","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","27.27","7.36","7.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.43","1.30","6.06","4.76","0.00","0.00","1056","7.5","15.125","315","230","18","75.4","9.2","5.9","10.48","8.2","47","5.0","15.293913043478263","153","14.56","3","0.46","0","2","3","26","0","33","15","1","0","2","39","26","0","11","0","0","13","4","6","1","0","0","7","0","10","12","7","9","9","5","0","0","0","1"
"http://newslo.com/gop-rep-isis-will-force-nfl-play-burqas-dont-act/","GOP Rep.: ‘ISIS Will Force the NFL to Play in Burqas If We Don't Act’","HOUSTON—Representative Ted Poe, R-Texas, warned the Obama administration Wednesday that “ISIS will force the NFL to wear burqas and other forms of Islamic dress if we don’t act immediately.

“ISIS’s inevitable takeover of the NFL is a horrific vision. Burqas provide no head or body protection whatsoever. And by dressing all teams identically, ISIS will make it extremely difficult for NFL players to distinguish between their team members and opponents. How we will determine the true winner of this year’s Superbowl!” Mr. Poe added.

While ISIS has not specifically threatened to dress NFL players in Islamic garb during their violent messages to America, Mr. Poe sees redecorating the NFL as “ISIS’s most obvious next move.”

Prior to his address about ISIS’s NFL burqa Armageddon, Poe alerted the American people that ISIS could infiltrate the United States across the southern border. Poe predicts ISIS will call upon Mexican drug cartels to traffic terrorists into America, thus advising President Obama to strengthen security at the U.S.-Mexico border, not only as means to prevent illegal aliens from entering, but as a weapon for thwarting ISIS’s next act of terror against the NFL.

Poe’s premonition that ISIS will seep into America has been further validated by Gary Painter, sheriff of Midland County, Texas, who reported finding Qurans, Islamic clothing, and sketches of Dallas Cowboys players wearing full-length burqas scattered along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has seconded these concerns, stating that President Obama “needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home, before ISIS covertly enters NFL locker rooms across America and sends our athletes out onto the field dressed in burqas, which aren’t even supposed to be worn by men in the first place.”","2014-09-19 09:33:11","0","25.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","67.0","1.0","35.0","5","296","93.46","61.96","19.68","12.37","26.91","27.36","66.22","38.18","5.74","2.36","0.00","1.35","0.00","0.34","0.68","3.38","5.41","15.20","4.73","3.38","4.39","1.69","9.46","4.73","2.36","1.01","0.34","1.35","4.39","1.69","2.70","1.01","1.35","0.00","6.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","10.14","1.01","1.35","1.01","2.36","2.36","3.04","0.34","0.34","0.00","0.00","1.69","1.35","0.34","0.00","0.00","9.12","2.70","1.69","3.38","1.01","2.03","1.69","6.08","2.03","13.18","1.69","8.11","4.05","2.36","1.01","1.01","0.00","1.35","0.34","0.68","0.00","0.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.26","6.08","6.08","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.34","1.69","2.36","2.70","0.00","0.00","1477","9.0","34.0","454","289","13","48.94","13.6","11.9","14.05","14.9","78","7.583333333333334","21.675847750865053","197","31.22","28","0.38","0","7","0","21","0","38","16","0","1","6","38","70","1","18","0","1","4","4","16","0","0","1","11","0","13","7","8","8","4","10","1","1","0","1"

"http://newslo.com/republicans-prefer-putin-rather-obama-us-presidency/","The Republicans prefer Putin rather Than Obama for US presidency","WASHINGTON DC – Pat Buchanan: “if only Putin would have been leader of the free world and Obama of Russia”.

An unnamed source from the Republican party has openly stated that the general opinion within the party is that Obama is leading the country into doomsday recession, which has a twofold effect on world events: primarily, it is felt that such practice is diminishing the power and significance of American presence worldwide, while countries like Russia and China are increasing theirs.

Secondly, the symbolism of the Russian president has become incredibly potent in recent years, which is why an increasing number of American politicians (and especially republican ones) are openly admitting to admiring Vladimir Putin!

The fact to the matter is that world leaders with the kind of charisma that, for example, Kennedy had will never be born again, but it seems that the “iron bear” (how Putin is often referred to) is slowly managing to do the impossible. In fact, there have even been rumors that several party officials have stated that they would rather have a vodka or watch a hockey game with Putin than have a conversation with Obama! Additionally, it’s no secret that people just don’t like the fact that Obama keeps hiding that he’s a Muslim, unlike Putin who has on several occasions pointed out his belief in the Christian Orthodox Church.

Furthermore, they say that not only is Putin widely praised for his perseverance when it comes to the representation of Russia’s global socio-economic interests, but he is also being openly admired by several prominent republican party members, who feel that his charisma and relentlessness are exemplary characteristics of a global leader. The republicans’ next step remains to be seen, but it will undoubtedly be a very light one.

Who would you prefer as President of the United States? PUTIN

George Washington may have been a skilled military intelligence manager, but could he have planned the newly formed CIA’s first coup d’état in Syria? The Syrian coup of March 1949 was not only the first in CIA history, but it was the first in Syrian history, too! We’d love to see ol’ George Washington’s wooden teeth chew on that.

2.

Throwback to this strong-chinned former CIA director and 41st President, George H.W. Bush! Bush served as the CIA director for only one year, from January 30, 1976, to January 20, 1977. Just two months after he became the director, the CIA helped a military junta headed by Jorge Rafael Videla overthrow Argentinian President Isabel Perón.

3.

The Wounded Warrior Project (not “program,” CIA!) is a great nonprofit dedicated to providing programs, service, and events to wounded veterans of post-9/11 actions. Since we’re talking about 9/11, we should mention CIA’s Operation Cyclone, a codename for a program to arm and finance radical Islamic groups in Afghanistan prior to and during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Small world!

4.

What better way to wrap up this listicle than the best first tweet possible? Speaking of confirming and denying, did you know that the CIA didn’t admit to its role in orchestrating the August 1953 coup that overthrew Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh after he attempted to nationalize Iran’s oil reserves until 2013? They really love to neither confirm nor deny over there at the CIA, almost as much as they love overthrowing democratically elected civil governments!","2014-07-06 21:08:19","0","29.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","13.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","55.0","1.0","35.0","3","261","93.54","64.93","22.54","75.53","15.35","24.52","70.50","39.08","6.51","3.45","0.00","1.15","0.38","1.15","0.77","3.07","6.90","14.56","4.60","3.07","4.60","1.92","8.43","5.36","3.83","0.38","8.05","0.77","3.45","3.07","0.38","0.00","0.38","0.00","7.66","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.15","6.90","1.15","0.38","0.77","1.15","0.00","3.45","1.53","0.38","0.77","0.00","3.45","0.77","1.15","0.00","0.38","14.56","3.07","3.07","8.43","1.15","0.00","3.45","3.07","0.38","13.79","0.77","4.98","7.28","6.13","0.38","0.00","0.38","1.15","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.92","3.83","6.13","0.00","0.00","1.15","1.92","0.77","0.77","3.45","1.15","0.77","1231","8.78","15.764705882352942","383","255","12","58.32","13.6","10.4","12.42","13.3","66","6.5","20.87294117647059","183","14.53","11","0.39","0","8","18","22","0","26","21","1","1","3","37","47","0","9","0","0","10","1","13","0","0","1","11","0","7","9","6","6","6","3","1","1","0","0"
"http://newslo.com/republican-worried-corruption-trial-will-implicate-too-many-republicans-asks-for-delay-until-after-elections/","Republican Worried Corruption Trial Will Implicate Too Many Republicans; Asks for Delay Until After Elections","WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. — Former Queens Republican Vice Chairman Vincent Tabone this week filed papers asking federal Judge Kenneth Karas to delay his June 2 corruption trial until after the 2014 elections on the grounds that a pre-election trial would hurt the GOP’s chances in November. He claims that nearly every single New York Republican, as well as numerous national GOP figures, will be implicated during the course of his trial, and that revealing that level of corruption would unfairly influence people’s decisions at the ballot box.

“The necessary witnesses to such a trial may include the Republican Party chairmen of the state and county Republican committees in New York,” Tabone’s lawyer, Deborah Misir, wrote Saturday in a letter to Karas. “Subjecting the Republican Party, its officials and internal political strategies to intense scrutiny, while sparing the Democratic Party, would unfairly undermine Republican Party candidates in the general election.”

Misir’s letter went on to name a number of high-level Republicans who would be forced to either admit criminal wrongdoing or perjure themselves in court should Tabone’s trial move forward. “In addition to encompassing every single Republican member of the New York State Senate and Assembly, including but not limited to Senate Coalition Leader Dean Skelos and Assembly Republican Leader Brian Kolb, Mr. Tabone’s trial will rock the national Republican party to the core with the revelation that high-ranking national Republicans such as Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Ted Cruz,House Speaker John Boehner, Governor Rick Perry- really almost every Republican you can name- are guilty of serious crimes.

“Even former Vice President Dick Cheney makes an appearance, though that might not of itself be much of a shock,” she added.

The long list of names in Misir’s letter comes as a bit of a shock, seeing how Tabone is only accused of pocketing $25,000 as part of a failed scheme to get state Sen. Malcolm Smith (D-Queens) on the 2012 GOP line for mayor. But at a press conference, Tabone insisted that putting him on trial would turn America into a one-party nation.

“I’m at the center of a massive criminal conspiracy that envelops the entire Republican party, from Presidential hopefuls down to members of your local school board,” he said. “There isn’t a Republican official alive who won’t be sent to prison if my trial moves forward.

“In fact,” he added, “it would probably be best for everyone if the charges against me were dropped altogether.”","2014-02-18 09:52:49","0","26.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","66.0","1.0","35.0","5","411","93.73","69.53","13.40","34.20","29.36","25.30","72.02","40.15","6.81","3.16","0.73","0.00","0.49","1.70","0.24","3.65","8.03","13.87","5.60","2.92","4.62","0.97","8.52","7.06","2.43","0.73","1.95","2.92","3.89","2.19","1.70","0.24","0.00","0.49","9.49","0.00","0.00","0.73","1.46","10.22","1.22","1.22","2.19","1.95","1.95","2.92","1.95","0.97","0.49","0.49","0.49","0.24","0.24","0.24","0.00","10.71","2.19","1.46","7.30","0.97","0.24","2.19","4.38","1.22","13.38","2.19","8.27","3.89","4.14","1.95","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.49","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","18.00","3.89","5.84","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.70","3.41","2.43","0.49","0.24","2038","8.95","38.36363636363637","651","405","15","44.07","15.6","13.8","13.47","16.8","102","12.125","22.874074074074073","257","33.82","9","0.38","0","8","6","40","0","51","33","0","1","12","62","83","2","18","0","0","11","5","18","0","0","0","12","0","17","12","10","5","4","6","2","2","0","1"
"http://newslo.com/republican-calls-bombing-dallas-stop-ebola-spread/","Republican Calls For Bombing Dallas to Stop Ebola Spread","South Carolina – Todd Kincannon, the former general counsel and executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party, used social media to give life to his solution to the Ebola crisis. Via Twitter, Kincannon called for anyone who contracts Ebola to be executed. Later, he upped the ante by saying any city where Ebola has been confirmed should be bombed off the face of the Earth, starting with Dallas.

“People with Ebola in the U.S. need to be humanely put down immediately,” he said through Twitter. “The protocol for a positive Ebola test should be immediate humane execution and sanitization of the whole area. That will save lives.”

When asked what he meant by the term ‘sanitization’ he responded, “Bomb them back to the stone age. Use nukes. Dallas must be wiped off the map.”

His Tweets sparked some outrage among many. Some pointed out that killing 1.25 million people after a single case of Ebola had been confirmed seemed excessive. Kincannon disagreed, Tweeting, “Ebola has a strong transmission vector through health care personnel. No effective way to contain while treating. Mass extermination only viable alternative.”

Aware that stopping the spread of Ebola in the U.S. was only the first step, Kincannon advocated using nuclear weapons on infected areas in Africa, saying the people of Africa have only themselves to blame.

“The people of Africa are to blame for why it’s so shitty,” he tweeted. “They could stop eating each other and learn calculus at any time… We need to be napalming villages from the air right now. No reason not to start with Dallas.”

This is not the first time Kincannon has used Twitter to post controversial remarks. He previously used the social media channel to mock Florida shooting victim Trayvon Martin, call for transgendered individuals to be placed in concentration camps, lament that Michael Prysner- an Iraq war veteran who became an anti-war protester- didn’t come home in a body bag, and saying that Ray Rice had every right to beat his fiance.

He has also long made a series of statements insulting and degrading Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, whom, in his most recent series of Tweets, he claimed was key to his anti-Ebola plan.

“We should put Wendy Davis’ vagina in charge of the Ebola outbreak,” he Tweeted. “It will kill all of them without mercy and go to Nordstrom’s afterwards.”","2014-10-07 13:12:31","0","26.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","62.0","1.0","35.0","3","396","91.52","87.73","11.00","3.73","17.22","20.71","78.54","42.68","8.59","5.05","0.00","0.51","0.00","3.54","1.01","3.54","7.07","14.39","7.32","2.78","2.53","1.52","15.15","2.53","1.26","1.77","1.26","3.28","4.80","1.26","3.54","0.00","2.78","0.00","14.39","0.25","0.25","0.00","3.79","9.85","2.53","2.53","1.77","1.77","1.01","1.52","1.26","0.00","1.26","0.00","2.53","1.01","1.01","0.25","0.51","8.33","3.54","1.26","2.78","0.25","0.76","5.05","7.07","0.76","14.90","1.26","8.08","5.56","1.52","1.26","0.25","0.00","0.25","1.52","1.01","0.25","0.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.43","7.07","4.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.01","4.29","1.26","0.00","0.00","1890","8.22","21.157894736842106","589","395","25","63.9","11.0","8.3","11.54","10.1","95","7.833333333333334","17.940253164556964","251","19.63","4","0.43","0","6","3","37","0","41","29","0","0","8","58","58","0","18","0","0","17","5","15","0","1","3","17","0","21","21","13","11","3","9","1","4","0","3"
"http://newslo.com/ben-stein-says-poor-people-like-being-poor/","Ben Stein Says Poor People Like Being Poor","LOS ANGELES – Former actor and game show host Ben Stein said earlier this week that the main reason people are poor in America is because they want to be.

“My humble observation is that most long-term poverty is caused by self-sabotage by individuals,” he said. “Drug use. Drunkenness. Having children without a family structure. Gambling. Poor work habits. Disastrously unfortunate appearance.

“These are some of the elements of freedom available to those in poverty, and for some people it’s a fair trade-off,” he added.

The conservative commentator, known for his roles in films such as “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and “Ghostbusters II,” claimed that wealth inequality was a good thing, and anyone who says differently was simply jealous of billionaires. “[Billionaires] fund symphonies and ballets and schools for inner city kids,” he explained. “We want for there to be a high number of rich people who function as a brake on government just as the nobles did on the crown in long ago England.”

Stein, who also guest starred on episodes of “Charles in Charge” and “The Wonder Years” in addition to serving as a speechwriter for President Nixon, claimed that poor people had chosen to be poor so as to avoid having to work, and he lamented all the unwarranted media attention being given to those comfortably nestled within America’s safety net. “Yes, the government designates many tens of millions as poor, but they almost always have indoor plumbing,” he said. “They get food stamps. They get free medical care. They get vouchers for many of the needs of life.”

“With all that free stuff, who wouldn’t want to be poor?”","2014-04-10 22:36:14","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","275","85.29","85.42","2.05","31.99","15.28","21.09","83.27","45.45","10.91","4.73","0.36","0.36","0.00","2.18","1.82","6.18","5.45","16.36","6.91","2.55","6.55","0.73","13.09","7.64","3.27","1.45","1.09","3.27","6.91","3.64","3.27","0.36","0.36","0.00","12.73","0.36","0.36","0.00","2.18","9.09","1.82","1.45","1.82","2.18","1.09","1.45","2.55","0.73","1.82","0.00","1.82","0.00","1.09","0.00","0.73","10.55","1.09","0.73","6.18","1.82","0.73","5.09","8.73","0.00","9.09","0.00","6.18","2.91","2.55","2.55","0.36","5.45","0.00","0.36","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","0.00","23.27","6.18","5.09","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","1.09","8.36","1.45","0.00","0.73","1288","7.84","17.4375","393","273","15","69.92","11.2","8.0","11.66","11.2","57","6.714285714285714","17.63164835164835","179","15.5","3","0.45","0","9","0","22","0","40","27","0","1","0","41","27","0","23","2","0","12","1","10","1","0","0","9","0","6","16","4","6","12","5","0","4","0","0"
"http://newslo.com/sting-operation-uncovers-chicken-boxing-ring-in-louisiana-statehouse/","Sting Operation Uncovers Chicken Boxing Ring in Louisiana Statehouse","BATON ROUGE, La.- A sting operation uncovered an off-hours chicken boxing ring inside the Louisiana Statehouse this week. The discovery was made following comments by state Sen. Elbert Guillory, who last week denounced a bill aimed at further strengthening the state’s ban on cockfighting, stating that it would unintentionally infringe upon the “legitimate sport” of chicken boxing.

“Leather spur covers and plastic spur covers, um, that are used in the legitimate sport of chicken boxing might be considered paraphernalia” and swept up in the ban if the bill were to go through, claimed Guillory during a legislative session.

“Just as dueling is a blood sport, two men fighting each other with swords is a blood sport that is illegal,” elaborated Guillory, “Similarly, two men with boxing gloves on can box each other as a sport that is legal. This is the same distinction between chicken boxing and cockfighting.

“Chicken boxing is done without knives, so the chickens aren’t even killed. We let humans punch each other until they develop brain damage and Parkinson’s, why not chickens? It’s completely humane.”

Baton Rouge detectives and FBI agents told a different story, when they uncovered an extremely sophisticated, highly financed chicken boxing operation in the depths of the state capitol.

“It was just like Michael Vick’s house but with chickens,” said an FBI agent at the scene. “There were hundreds of chickens, all underfed and in cages that were far too small. We assume this was to make the chickens more aggressive, and so they could make their respective weight classes.”

“We are not sure how many government officials are involved, but we can confirm that this operation was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars at the very least,” said Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr.

“Just through the sheer number of chickens involved, we can assume that some very influential folks were passing through this ring.”

Still, Sen. Guillory was defiant when approached for comment, claiming that “the liberal media” is trying to defame the “great southern tradition of chicken boxing.”","2014-04-16 10:07:39","0","26.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","341","78.65","63.77","9.68","21.28","20.06","25.81","72.43","44.87","8.50","2.64","0.00","1.47","0.00","0.00","1.17","5.87","7.92","11.44","8.80","4.99","5.28","1.17","11.44","4.11","2.64","1.47","1.47","2.35","2.05","0.88","1.17","0.00","0.88","0.00","7.04","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.59","9.38","1.17","1.76","0.88","1.76","1.47","3.81","1.76","0.00","1.17","0.59","2.05","0.88","0.88","0.00","0.29","4.99","1.76","0.29","2.35","0.59","0.00","4.69","5.57","0.29","9.09","1.17","5.28","2.64","3.52","1.47","0.29","1.47","0.00","0.29","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.00","19.94","4.99","6.45","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.00","0.59","6.16","1.47","0.00","0.00","1693","8.2","31.454545454545453","508","340","18","60.75","12.0","9.5","13.05","12.6","78","10.4","18.736470588235296","203","27.0","5","0.44","0","9","2","36","0","39","31","0","1","6","51","32","0","26","0","0","11","1","17","1","0","1","3","0","10","17","13","10","9","10","4","1","0","4"
"http://newslo.com/britains-tea-party-shows-u-s-anti-immigrant-politicking-done/","Britain’s Own Tea Party Shows U.S. How Anti-Immigrant Politicking Is Done","LONDON—In a victory for freedom-lovers across the globe, the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), Great Britain’s answer to the Tea Party, performed well in the country’s local elections, conservative Americans reported.

“I guess they’re like the English version of the Tea Party?” mused Omaha, Neb. resident Eric Gletkoff over his morning paper. “Anyway, they won a big election last night or something.”

“Good to see even Europe is getting wise to the Obamanation,” Gletkoff added.

The UKIP is anti-immigration, anti-gay marriage, wants the U.K. to leave the European Union, opposes investment in renewable energy sources, and proposes a 40 percent increase in British military spending. Its position as an outsider from mainstream British politics is further proof that it’s “basically the Tea Party, but in Europe,” sources confirmed.

“Yeah, good to see the Tea Party’s message has even spread to the land of George III, the inspiration for the original Tea Party,” said Naomi Johnson of Knoxville, Tenn. “I wonder if these Uck-ip [sic] people have their own Glenn Beck or Sarah Palin like we do.”

At press time, Seaford, Va. resident Chris Dollard was wondering if he should emigrate to the U.K. following the Tea Party’s resounding defeats in the Republican primaries.

Conservatives have not hailed all European far-right victories, however. Despite an even more impressive electoral showing, France’s far-right National Front party has been largely ignored because “Even French Tea Partiers are still socialist-loving surrender monkeys.”","2014-06-01 21:05:28","0","24.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","43.0","31.0","0.0","53.0","1.0","35.0","3","248","93.58","71.38","20.84","99.00","15.50","30.24","75.40","37.50","5.65","3.63","0.81","0.40","0.81","0.81","0.81","2.02","9.27","10.48","5.65","3.63","3.63","0.40","10.89","4.84","2.02","0.00","0.40","1.61","9.68","8.87","0.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.27","0.40","0.40","0.00","0.81","9.68","2.02","1.61","1.61","3.23","0.81","3.63","2.02","1.21","0.40","0.40","3.63","0.00","0.00","0.81","2.82","12.50","6.05","1.61","4.03","3.23","0.00","2.42","6.85","0.40","12.10","1.21","8.87","2.02","2.02","3.63","0.81","1.21","0.40","0.00","2.82","0.00","1.61","1.21","0.40","0.40","28.63","6.85","8.47","0.00","0.00","0.40","0.00","2.82","5.65","2.82","0.81","0.81","1240","9.15","28.333333333333332","371","238","16","56.35","11.6","9.1","14.38","12.2","72","5.1875","20.060840336134454","182","25.56","10","0.35","0","4","1","25","0","22","24","1","0","1","35","57","2","11","0","0","7","3","14","1","0","0","7","0","4","11","6","4","6","9","0","0","0","0"
"http://newslo.com/oklahoma-state-house-candidate-says-gays-able-choose-stoning-crucifixion/","Oklahoma State House Candidate Says Gays Should Be Able to Choose Between Stoning and Crucifixion","TULSA, Okla. – An Oklahoma magazine discovered this week that current Tea Party State House candidate Scott Esk endorsed stoning gay people to death. “I think we would be totally in the right to do it,” he wrote last summer in a Facebook post. “That [stoning gay people to death] goes against some parts of libertarianism, I realize, and I’m largely libertarian, but ignoring as a nation things that are worthy of death is very remiss.”

When pressed recently to explain the post, Esk admitted that he may have been overly harsh. “As a libertarian, I believe in personal choice,” he said. “Therefore I think it only fair that gay people be given a choice between stoning and crucifixion when they are put to death.”

Asked why he thought gay individuals deserved to be put to death, Esk spoke with passion about his faith. “That was done in the Old Testament under a law that came directly from God and in that time there it was totally just. It came directly from God, he said. “I know what was done in the Old Testament and what was done back then was what’s just. … And I do stand for Biblical morality.”

Esk explained that his decision to accept for crucifixion as an allowable alternative to stoning came after much soul searching. “On the one hand, our Lord Jesus was crucified, and I wouldn’t want any gay person to feel close to Jesus,” he said. “But on the other hand, death by stoning is relatively quick while a crucifixion can last for days. It’s really all about maximizing the suffering of the gays.”

He said some of his fellow Republicans who were Hell-bent on stoning or nothing were out of step with the times. “I understand the desire to pelt gays with heavy stones until they die, but we have to remember to think like Jesus,” he said. “And I’m pretty sure Jesus would find it in His heart to crucify a gay if they asked.”

Pressed if he would lobby for legislation that would condemn gay people to a Biblical death if elected, Esk hesitated. “I never said I would author legislation to put homosexuals to death,” he clarified. “But I didn’t have a problem with it.”","2014-06-11 16:26:19","0","26.0","7.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","70.0","1.0","35.0","6","376","62.02","65.52","32.95","45.30","17.09","18.09","91.22","53.19","15.16","8.78","3.46","0.80","0.00","3.72","0.80","6.38","5.59","14.89","9.84","4.52","6.12","1.06","19.95","3.99","1.60","1.86","0.27","1.33","5.05","2.93","1.86","0.27","0.27","0.27","11.44","0.00","0.27","0.00","3.99","15.69","5.32","0.80","3.19","2.66","2.13","3.46","3.99","0.27","1.86","1.86","3.99","0.80","0.00","2.93","0.27","3.99","1.33","0.00","1.86","0.27","0.53","8.51","8.24","0.53","13.03","2.13","5.32","5.32","0.53","0.80","0.27","0.00","5.32","3.72","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","19.41","6.12","4.79","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.27","6.12","1.60","0.00","0.53","1632","6.92","23.875","534","377","21","70.13","11.3","8.0","8.81","9.0","57","8.7","15.247745358090185","201","21.38","14","0.5","0","12","1","28","0","46","22","0","0","7","46","29","1","14","0","0","35","5","18","0","0","0","18","0","18","28","9","11","17","5","4","4","0","3"

"http://newslo.com/nh-republican-calls-swimsuit-competition-decide-congressional-race/","NH Republican Calls for Swimsuit Competition","MANCHESTER, New Hampshire – Republican State Representative Steve Vaillancourt recently took to a political blog to explain why the current race for Congress between Democratic Representative Ann McLane Kuster and New Hampshire State Representative Marilinda Garcia will come down to which one is prettier. Vaillancourt suggested that since voters will want to vote for the more attractive woman, the two candidates should just hold a swimsuit competition to ‘show off the whole package.’

“Let’s be honest. Does anyone not believe that Congressman Annie Kuster is as ugly as sin? And I hope I haven’t offended sin,” wrote Vaillancourt on NH Insider, a blog dedicated to New Hampshire politics. “Get her in a swimsuit and people will be hurling in the aisles.”

In comparison, said Vaillancourt, Republican challenger Garcia is “one of the most attractive women on the political scene anywhere. Not so attractive as to be intimidating, but truly attractive. We’re talking smoking. I don’t know why she doesn’t just campaign in a bikini 24/7.”

Vaillancourt then compared Kuster to a drag queen, saying, “How ugly is Annie Kuster?… drag queens are more attractive than Annie Kuster… not that there’s anything wrong with that. Annie Kuster looks more like a drag queen than most men in drag.”

At the top of his post, Vaillancourt gave readers a warning. “The subject matter, although very real, may prove uncomfortable for some of my more sensitive readers,” Garcia wrote. “ Not as uncomfortable as a picture of Annie Kuster in a two-piece, but pretty uncomfortable.”

Garcia refused to stand behind her fellow Republican, calling him out for his “sexist” comments. “Both Rep. Kuster and I have experienced this unfortunate reality of being a woman in politics. I hope that as time moves forward and more female candidates run for political office around the country, people will focus on the content of our ideas rather than what we wear and how we look,” she said. “That being said, I so totally rock a bikini.”

In a follow-up post, Vaillancourt doubled down on his suggestion. “Facts are facts, and Kuster is one ugly woman.

"http://newslo.com/arizona-renames-mlk-day-go-to-work-monday/","Arizona Renames MLK Day ‘Go To Work Monday’","PHOENIX, Ariz. – Following a series of recent race-related controversies, Arizona is again in the middle of a political storm following Governor Jan Bewer’s announcement that the state is renaming the Martin Luther King, Jr. federal holiday “Go Back To Work Monday.”

Brewer denied that the move was racially motivated, although Arizona has a checkered history with the Holiday: boycotts followed the state’s decision to rescind MLK day in 1987, and it was only reinstated in 1992 when it threatened to overshadow the Super Bowl being held in Phoenix. Although the governor was adamant that the move was solely designed to help keep the economy moving, she did acknowledge that the state senate’s decision to add a holiday commemorating the birthday of Eugene “Bull” Connor – the Commissioner of Public Safety in Birmingham, Alabama, who sicked dogs and fire hoses on non-violent marchers led by Dr. King – did send a mixed message.

Senator John McCain – who, along with 40 percent of his Republican colleagues – voted against commemorating King’s birthday with a federal holiday in 1983, supported his state’s decision to rename the day. “Like many Americans, I consider Dr. King to be a hero, but Bull Connor helped to make King’s legacy so it only seems fair to acknowledge that with a holiday of his own.” McCain went on to argue that King would approve, “as he wanted African-Americans to be able to work – and by removing the holiday, that’s exactly what they’ll be doing.”

Arizona’s state senate also added the new holidays of “Sand Day,” “Jimmy Eat World Day” and “Arizona Day,” although the governor was quick to point out that the last one was celebrating iced tea, and not the state itself, adding: “We’re not that arrogant” before coughing the word “Nevada.”","2014-01-20 10:28:24","0","21.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","295","93.77","68.23","28.70","37.78","32.78","24.75","75.93","43.05","8.14","2.71","0.34","0.34","0.00","1.69","0.34","5.42","9.49","13.56","6.44","2.37","4.41","0.68","13.22","3.39","1.69","1.36","1.69","2.03","3.39","2.03","1.36","0.34","1.02","0.00","7.80","0.00","0.34","0.34","3.39","7.12","3.05","1.02","0.68","0.34","0.34","2.37","0.68","0.00","0.00","0.68","1.02","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.68","10.17","1.69","2.03","5.76","1.02","0.68","6.10","6.78","0.34","14.24","3.73","4.75","5.76","3.05","2.71","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","21.02","3.73","6.10","0.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.02","6.10","3.39","0.00","0.00","1404","9.14","76.25","457","298","10","49.69","15.5","13.7","12.08","16.8","76","12.375","24.121342281879198","182","59.5","3","0.43","0","6","4","28","0","39","24","0","0","1","43","52","2","6","0","0","9","3","9","0","0","1","13","0","17","18","12","6","3","5","0","3","0","1"
"http://newslo.com/john-mccain-sexiest-caliph/","Bloggers Claim John McCain Named 1996's Sexiest Caliph, Rand Paul Weighs in","New York-For the last few months it’s been reported, in a plethora of conspiratorial blogs based in the United States, that Senator John McCain (R-AZ) is not only part of ISIS, but had been named the Muslim World’s Sexiest Caliph in 1996. Despite McCain calling the rumors “unsubstantiated and absolutely ridiculous” questions about his involvement with the putative pageant continue to hound him.

McCain has spent a great deal of the last few months attempting to discredit rumors that he not only helped start ISIS, but is bedmates with the groups leader. The rumors were originated by a number of pictures McCain-some of which he shared on his twitter account-posed for with members of the Free Syrian Army. In the photos many of the bloggers have claimed that a man in the background looks suspiciously similar too ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghadadi. Though the only proof that’s been offered anent McCain’s involvement with ISIS has been the photos Mccain posted on his twitter, and other doctored photos, the rumors continue to persist.דפשמ>

On Monday the website ScarcytruthsforpatritoicseekersoftruthwhoalawaysknewthetruthwastheAmericanGovenmentisevil.com, published photos of the senator dressed in the traditional garb of a Caliph, holding a bouquet of assorted flowers, and posing on stage in front of a giant curtain that reads “Mr. Muslim World’s Sexiest Caliph 1996”.

Mccain, speaking earlier today, said of the new photo, “That’s… Do I even need to respond to questions about something so absurd? I’m a war hero damnit!

"http://newslo.com/cuccinelli-conservative-wants-to-ban-teenage-bdsm-in-virginia/","‘Cuccinelli Conservative’ Wants To Ban Teenage BDSM In Virginia","RICHMOND, Va. – Announcing that “youngsters are getting a little too kinky,” a Virginia legislator has pushed a new law that would make it a felony for teenagers to engage in sex acts involving bondage, discipline, and sadomasochism, also known as BDSM.

“It’s just not right,” said Virginia state legislator and self-described “Cuccinelli conservative” Thomas Garrett (R). “Let’s say a nubile young woman of only 17 is getting into leather, and maybe she wants to experiment with her cherubic, slightly younger boyfriend. Maybe tie him up and make him bite her toes—not hard, just like a simpering nibble—well that sort of thing doesn’t belong in Virginia.”

Garrett’s attack on underage fetish is part of a new bill that would bring back much of Virginia’s “Crimes Against Nature” law, which federal courts declared unconstitutional months ago.

“Here’s another scenario for you,” Garrett began during a packed legislative session. “Two young men come home after football practice, and because they’re still jacked on testosterone, they take off their shirts to reveal powerful, bronzed upper-bodies and go out to the woodshed. Maybe they find a length of rope—strong, thick rope. Virginia currently has no law that would stop these two strapping young specimens from experimenting with all those strands of jute and shafts of lumber, which is why Old Dominion must demand that senate bill 14 be passed!”","2014-01-13 11:29:57","0","21.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","46.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","229","74.33","75.77","10.69","41.56","22.90","22.71","78.17","43.67","10.48","4.37","0.00","0.44","0.44","2.18","1.31","6.11","4.37","12.66","6.11","5.68","4.37","1.75","14.41","4.80","1.75","1.31","1.75","1.75","1.75","1.31","0.44","0.00","0.44","0.00","9.17","0.00","0.44","1.75","1.75","9.17","1.31","2.18","2.18","1.75","0.87","1.31","2.62","0.44","0.87","1.31","5.24","1.31","0.44","3.49","0.00","8.30","1.31","0.87","4.80","1.31","0.44","2.18","10.04","0.44","15.28","2.18","6.11","7.42","2.18","0.44","0.44","0.87","0.00","0.00","0.87","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.44","0.00","22.27","3.93","6.99","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.87","6.11","3.06","0.87","0.00","1124","8.1","29.5","323","225","9","63.02","12.7","10.7","13.58","15.9","46","12.875","20.177777777777777","171","27.38","3","0.39","0","7","4","14","0","25","21","1","0","4","38","20","0","12","1","0","11","2","20","0","0","2","4","0","12","6","5","7","6","8","5","0","0","1"
"http://newslo.com/insurers-worried-contracting-hiv-patients-offering-fair-coverage/","Some Insurers Worried About Contracting HIV Patients by Offering Fair Coverage","WASHINGTON—The partisan fever surrounding the rollout of the Affordable Care Act did little to lessen the positive fervor of patients who stood to gain the most from the law’s protections, like those living with HIV or AIDS. With one eye on their bank accounts and the other on their T-cell counts, some insurers are pulling out all the stops to avoid the costly risks of covering these patients.

Newly barred from denying coverage or charging more for individuals with preexisting conditions, insurance companies are no longer immune to the financial risks of making healthcare accessible to people who rely on costly drugs to keep their conditions in check.

Certain health insurance companies have started testing the waters to see if they can circumvent the new provisions.

Said actuary Chuck Denton of Cigna, “I’m not sure we want people infected with HIV in our risk pool. Casual contact may not spread the virus, but being contractually obligated to provide care for the seriously ill is just not something I signed up for when I entered this business relationship.”

A complaint by the AIDS Institute and the National Health Law Program accuses Cigna and three other insurers of discrimination by assigning all specialty HIV drugs—including generics—to the highest payment tier on Florida’s health insurance marketplace. In some cases, that meant patients would have to shoulder monthly pharmacy bills of $1000 or more, on top of their premiums.

What CoventryOne, Cigna, Humana, and Preferred Medical Plan are doing “has no rational reason other than to drive people with HIV and AIDS away from their plans,” according to a staff lawyer for the National Health Law Program.

“Other [mid-tier] plans don’t do this for HIV,” claims Carl Schmid of the AIDS Institute, “and that’s why we’re proving that it’s discrimination.” Comparable insurers in the marketplace offer the same prescriptions with out-of-pocket costs between $10 and $25.

When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Humana remained positive in her prognosis of the complaint, which is now in the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights. “It’ll be dismissed. It has to be, right? I mean, this was our first time forgetting to provide adequate coverage under ObamaCare.”

At press time, lawyers from CoventryOne were busy calling each and every one of the company’s trustees to recommend testing their business models to ensure lawful HIV coverage.","2014-06-04 08:47:33","1","26.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","47.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","403","94.96","63.59","17.46","21.94","25.19","25.56","83.13","44.91","8.93","3.97","0.99","0.99","0.00","0.25","1.74","4.96","6.95","17.62","6.20","1.49","3.97","1.49","11.17","4.22","2.48","1.74","1.74","2.23","3.47","1.49","1.74","0.99","0.00","0.00","8.19","0.00","0.25","0.25","0.00","8.68","1.49","0.99","0.99","2.23","1.99","3.23","1.49","0.50","0.50","0.50","7.20","0.74","6.45","2.48","0.00","7.94","1.24","1.74","2.98","0.99","1.49","2.23","6.70","1.24","10.92","0.74","7.20","2.98","6.70","0.50","0.00","3.97","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.63","3.72","4.47","0.00","0.00","0.25","0.00","0.99","2.48","2.48","0.00","1.24","1992","8.93","31.692307692307693","606","396","16","54.76","14.5","11.8","13.41","15.6","102","15.833333333333334","22.223030303030306","247","28.31","17","0.47","0","13","6","38","0","55","26","2","1","3","52","50","1","36","1","0","10","9","13","0","1","2","16","0","17","7","18","6","13","8","2","3","0","3"

"http://newslo.com/georgians-miss-thrill-carrying-concealed-guns-illegally/","Georgians Miss ‘Thrill’ of Carrying Concealed Guns Illegally","ATANTA – Earlier this week, when Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed a bill making it legal for registered gun owners to carry their weapons in “churches, schools, libraries and bars,” among other places, Georgian gun owners overwhelmingly supported the change. But just days later, public opinion has turned against the bill, as firearm enthusiasts realize that “all the fun and risk” has been “sucked out of illegally bringing guns into forbidden places.”

Billy Watson, 26, of Alpharetta, is one of thousands of Georgians who have quickly turned against the bill. “Yesterday I tucked my Glock into my waistband and went into a library, expectin’ to feel freer than I ever had before,” Watson explained. “But without the possibility of gettin’ caught, the Glock was just annoying and heavy. I ended up borrowin’ ‘Twilight’ again and headin’ home.”

From the start, critics of the legislation called it the “guns everywhere” bill, and although supporters initially resisted the nickname, many have since admitted that the characterization is accurate, and that the bill’s effect has been both surprising disappointing.

Dunwoody High School social studies teacher Sam Kelvin explained that it “used to be a lot of fun taking [his] gun into school,” but since Gov. Deal signed House Bill 60, carrying a loaded weapon in his classroom has “lost all its edge.”

“Man, used to be, when a kid came up to my desk to ask some stupid question, I had this secret thrill, knowing that I had a deadly weapon strapped around my ankle,” Kelvin said. “But now all the other teachers are packin’ too, and the whole thing’s starting to feel blasé.”

Even local NRA chapters are switching their stance on the bill and begging Gov. Deal to “do something to put the fun back into concealed carrying.” Although NRA members still largely support some of the bill’s measures—the legislation “removes the fingerprinting requirement for new gun licensees, and also abolished a state requirement that gun merchants maintain records of their sales and purchases,” for instance—many say that they’ll have to start “hanging around in the Capitol more often,” where carrying firearms is still banned.

The bill also made it easier for Georgians to evoke the state’s “stand your ground” law, even if the gun they use to kill someone is not registered. Initially one of the bill’s most popular measures, it too has earned criticism of late.

“I always thought that one day I’d probably kill somebody with one of my guns, you know, in ‘self-defense’,” said Grovetown native Andy Potts. “But now it’s all but certain that I wouldn’t be punished for it—which is great, but now it just seems too easy, you know?”","2014-04-24 21:41:46","0","25.0","6.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","52.0","1.0","35.0","3","448","75.28","50.89","72.31","19.13","23.58","22.10","83.48","46.65","11.38","5.13","2.90","0.00","0.67","0.45","1.12","6.25","6.92","12.28","6.47","5.80","5.80","0.67","15.18","4.91","1.79","1.12","1.56","2.90","6.70","3.12","3.57","0.45","2.23","0.67","7.14","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.67","13.62","3.12","2.01","0.67","3.12","2.01","3.79","1.79","0.00","0.67","0.89","0.89","0.67","0.00","0.00","0.22","5.13","0.67","0.45","2.90","0.89","0.45","6.03","8.04","0.67","15.85","3.35","6.03","6.92","4.46","1.12","0.45","2.90","0.22","0.45","0.22","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.88","4.02","7.81","0.00","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.22","7.59","3.57","0.00","0.45","2107","8.38","32.642857142857146","625","445","19","64.64","11.3","10.1","12.19","14.0","101","10.1","20.438651685393257","261","28.43","11","0.45","0","18","6","38","0","52","33","2","0","0","64","30","2","28","2","0","20","12","34","2","1","1","12","0","16","23","12","13","15","16","1","1","0","3"
"http://newslo.com/gop-appeals-to-prisoners-to-lock-up-the-vote/","GOP Appeals to Prisoners to Lock Up the Vote","WASHINGTON — Even with midterm prospects running high, Republicans are pinning their party’s long-term hopes on the over 2.4 million prisoners living behind bars in the United States. To win their votes, members of the GOP are reluctantly softening their positions on mandatory minimum sentences.

For over two decades many Republicans have run under a “tough on crime” banner, attempting to outdo their competitors by imposing especially draconian sentencing laws designed to keep criminals off the street. Now prominent Republicans are breaking free from their self-imposed electoral shackles.

Even Texas Gov. Rick Perry took to CPAC earlier this month to plead for lighter sentences and the hiring of ex-convicts.

While he agrees with Perry in the broad sense, Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn raised questions about the motives of his fellow Republicans.

“I’d like to say that people wanted to keep hope on the idea that people, once they committed crimes, could be rehabilitated and become productive citizens,” said Cornyn. “Actually, what I think happened, the more likely explanation, was that we built so many prisons people began to ask the question: ‘Can we afford this?’

“And I’m not talking dollars and cents here. I’m talking about our viability as a party,” continued Cornyn. “Look at Texas. Soon the GOP’s base of white non-felons will become a minority in the state. Short of comprehensive immigration reform to win over the Hispanic community directly, we’ve got to go gangbusters on winning over the convict vote.”

By targeting the prison population, Cornyn and likeminded caucus members hope this strategy will eventually make inroads with minorities, as well. Blacks and Hispanics are dramatically overrepresented in the prison population. Black males are nearly six times as likely to be locked up as white males.

Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio described the situation as, “A jailbird in the GOP’s hand is worth two in a cell.” Aside from the federal penal system being “a really inefficient use of resources,” Portman warned that with current policy, “you end up with people not reaching their God-given potential” as Republican voters.

While their reasons differ, Republicans and Democrats are now working together to advance a broad criminal justice bill that would grant judges more sentencing discretion and provide more skills-training and early releases to low-risk offenders.

Said one GOP operative, “I think we can get this bill done without the Supreme Court needing to weigh in on the benefit to the GOP of hanging Chad [Smith],” a convict awaiting execution in Texas.","2014-03-19 08:45:45","0","27.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","49.0","31.0","0.0","55.0","1.0","35.0","3","420","94.13","77.69","22.31","61.90","19.09","25.95","75.71","41.90","7.38","5.00","1.19","1.19","0.24","0.48","1.90","2.38","7.14","16.19","5.95","3.57","4.29","0.71","13.10","4.76","2.86","0.24","1.67","1.19","4.52","3.10","1.19","0.48","0.24","0.24","9.52","0.00","0.24","0.00","1.19","8.33","2.86","1.19","1.67","2.14","0.71","1.43","2.14","0.95","0.71","0.24","1.43","0.24","0.71","0.00","0.48","12.14","2.62","2.38","6.43","1.90","0.71","2.86","8.57","1.90","13.10","0.95","8.10","4.05","2.86","1.43","0.00","1.43","0.24","0.24","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","18.57","5.00","4.76","0.24","0.00","0.24","0.00","1.67","4.29","1.90","0.00","0.48","2101","8.84","22.526315789473685","653","414","22","52.39","13.0","10.6","13.52","13.0","112","6.142857142857143","20.341256038647344","274","20.68","13","0.4","0","9","7","34","0","53","37","3","0","6","46","40","8","41","0","0","12","9","22","1","0","3","15","0","19","15","18","9","16","2","2","1","0","0"
"http://newslo.com/judge-accused-domestic-abuse-suspended-two-hearings/","Judge Accused of Domestic Abuse is Suspended Two Hearings","MONTGOMERY, Ala.— As Judge Mark E. Fuller explains it, the best defense is a strong offense. His offense: strong-arming his wife, Kelli Fuller, after she confronted him in August with suspicions that he had been unfaithful. Now his defense team is fighting for leniency in the face of a two-hearing suspension designed to allow time for Judge Fuller to “cool off” and provide his wife “the opportunity to apologize for her mistrustful behavior.”

“I deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve these difficulties with my family, where they should be resolved,” said Judge Fuller in a statement. “What is clear is that my wife needs space to think about how she can begin to repair the reputational damage she caused me.”

Before he accepts an apology from his wife, Judge Fuller suggested that “Kelli needs to work on her own issues first,” presumably referring to the visible lacerations to her mouth and forehead noted in the police report.

Judge Fuller went on to say, “Kelli and I had a long talk, and she’s adamant that I not be at home right now. Suspending me from court would leave me no option but to ferment my marital strife with a bottle of Jack Daniels in the den.”

Terri Sewell—a Democrat representing the state of Alabama, which includes the district over which Fuller presides—sees it differently. Said Sewell, “If an NFL player can lose his job because of domestic violence, then a federal judge should definitely not be allowed to keep his lifetime appointment to the federal bench.”

After taking more than a month to “gauge public opinion” over judge Fuller’s behavior, some state politicians even have come to the conclusion that Fuller should resign, so as to protect the judicial system from “a public relations nightmare.”

Rep. Marlin Richards noted, “I have to thank TMZ, Ray Rice, and [NFL] Commissioner Goodell for bringing the issue of domestic violence perpetrated by public figures to the fore. Without heroes like them to stir public outcry, we probably would’ve turned a blind eye to this whole Judge Fuller affair.”

Still, removing a judge from the bench by force can be difficult—if not impossible—for abuses not directly related to court proceedings, even after felony convictions.

For now, the commissioner of U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has indicated that criminal offenders who wish to return their sentences issued by Judge Fuller are entitled to a retrial or a free pizza, whichever is given less value.","2014-09-21 19:39:05","0","27.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","48.0","31.0","0.0","65.0","1.0","35.0","4","422","91.60","67.37","13.76","10.72","23.44","22.04","82.23","47.39","11.14","7.35","2.37","0.24","0.00","4.03","0.71","3.79","7.58","16.35","5.92","2.84","3.79","1.42","11.14","6.64","4.98","1.66","0.47","0.95","7.35","3.08","4.27","0.24","1.42","0.71","10.66","1.18","0.00","2.61","2.37","11.14","3.08","1.42","2.84","1.66","0.71","2.61","2.61","1.42","0.95","0.24","1.66","0.95","0.24","0.00","0.47","10.43","1.90","2.13","5.45","0.71","1.42","2.13","9.00","0.47","13.27","2.37","6.87","4.50","1.66","0.47","1.18","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.24","0.00","0.00","16.82","4.74","5.45","0.24","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.47","4.74","0.71","0.00","0.47","1987","8.84","47.333333333333336","610","416","17","55.07","13.3","11.7","12.02","14.4","105","8.4","21.896153846153847","258","40.11","11","0.46","0","8","2","37","0","53","27","2","1","8","65","49","0","14","0","0","20","13","21","0","0","0","24","0","27","10","9","12","6","12","2","2","0","2"
"http://newslo.com/mississippi-tea-party-challenger/","Mississippi Tea Party Challenger Offers $1,000 for Proof Black Conservatives Don’t Exist","WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate hopeful and tea party candidate Chris McDaniel isn’t ready to concede victory to Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., just yet. McDaniel announced that he would provide a $1,000 reward to anyone who is able to bring forward proof of fraud in last month’s Mississippi Republican primary, in which his competitor received 7,000 more votes.

“Specifically, what my campaign needs is incontrovertible proof that black conservatives don’t exist,” McDaniel said on an interview with CNN’s Kate Bolduan. “I mean let’s be honest here. Cochran won because of the black vote. Yet, as we all know, blacks don’t vote Republican. Something’s rotten in Mississippi, Kate, and it’s not just the stench from the Delta.”

McDaniel realizes that his “theory on black conservatives” is a mere gut feeling and requires some form of empirical proof, though, which led to his idea for offering a reward. He has urged political researchers, members of academia, and even blacks themselves to provide hard evidence that blacks are incapable of either registering as Republicans or voting for Republicans.

“Charts, regression analyses, an official declaration from Al Sharpton–I’ll take whatever I can get to show that these people couldn’t have legitimately voted for this crook,” continued state Sen. McDaniel, whose distrust of Cochran has existed since at least last month, when he hired poll watchers to oversee voting operations in those black communities courted by the incumbent senator.

McDaniel later admitted that since his announcement, he has received a wide array of underwhelming responses, including a hand-written letter reading, “I’m black and only vote for Democrats. Where’s my $1,000?”

“It’s a step in the right direction, but we’ll need something a bit stronger,” said McDaniel. “If nobody gives me what I’m looking for, I guess I’ll just bang my drum a little harder. Saying something enough times usually becomes the truth anyway.”","2014-07-07 21:28:53","0","23.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","45.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","312","64.27","62.57","13.65","56.01","18.35","26.92","77.24","44.23","14.74","7.37","3.53","0.96","0.00","2.56","0.32","7.37","5.13","11.86","7.37","4.17","4.17","1.92","15.38","4.81","2.56","2.88","1.92","1.92","4.17","2.88","1.28","0.00","0.32","0.32","9.94","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.56","12.82","2.88","1.60","1.92","3.53","1.92","2.24","5.45","2.24","0.96","1.60","1.28","0.64","0.32","0.00","0.32","7.69","1.92","2.24","3.53","1.92","0.32","2.56","10.58","1.28","10.26","1.92","4.49","5.13","3.53","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.64","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.00","0.32","25.96","6.09","8.65","0.00","0.00","0.32","0.00","0.64","4.49","5.13","0.00","0.64","1555","8.6","25.307692307692307","473","307","18","62.58","12.1","8.8","13.57","12.4","80","5.6875","19.263452768729646","212","23.85","12","0.43","0","7","6","21","0","36","27","2","1","2","52","34","3","15","0","0","18","7","15","0","0","0","8","0","12","11","8","7","15","13","4","3","1","1"
"http://newslo.com/nation-ambivalent-negotiating-terrorists-sgt-bergdahls-release/","Nation Ambivalent About Negotiating With Terrorists After Sgt. Bergdahl’s Release","WASHINGTON – Americans are expressing confusion and emotional strain this week after it was announced that the only American soldier held captive in Afghanistan was freed via a prisoner-exchange with the Taliban on Saturday. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl—who had been imprisoned by the Taliban for almost five years—was traded for five Taliban members who’d been held at Guantanamo Bay since 2002.

“Obviously, I’m ecstatic that Bowe has been released,” said Greg Thompson, a veteran himself, from Cleveland. “What he went through must have been horrifying, and it’s wonderful that he’s free. But we negotiated with those godless bastards to get it done?”

“It’s like I had the best sex of my life, but then found out it was with my cousin,” Thompson added. “I feel satisfied and dirty, all at the same time.”

Kendra Leverington, of Boise, Idaho—near Sgt. Bergdahl’s hometown of Haily—echoed Thompson’s comments. “I don’t know if it’s a fair trade or not,” Leverington said, referring to the five Taliban members who have been released from Guantanamo Bay and relocated to Qatar, where they will be subject to a one-year travel ban. “But even if it was a good deal, I thought we weren’t supposed to be dealing with them in the first place. Next thing you’ll tell me it’s okay to wear a Hitler mustache again.”

Since the 9/11 attacks, the White House—during both the Bush and Obama administrations—has maintained that the US government will not “negotiate with terrorists” under any circumstances. But the deal under which Sgt. Bergdahl was released from captivity appears to most observers like an obvious example of just that—a careful negotiation and exchange with what the US government considers a terrorist organization.

“It’s causing a fair amount of cognitive dissonance,” said Prof. George Herring of the University of Michigan. “People know that freeing an American POW is good, but they also know that negotiating with terrorists is bad—and this whole Sgt. Bergdahl situation has basically fried their circuits.”

Not all Americans are having so much trouble with the deal, however. Others have already resigned themselves to the situation, Prof. Herring said, and are eagerly searching for other ways in which negotiating with terrorists might help the United States.

“We’re seeing it on the message boards already,” Herring explained. “People are suggesting all kinds of trades. Seven al-Qaeda fighters for oil rights in Iraq. Twenty Taliban prisoners for fifty kilograms of opium.

“Not sure how that second one would help America, actually,” Herring added. “But people are going pretty wild with it.”","2014-06-01 20:37:05","0","26.0","5.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","51.0","1.0","35.0","3","429","69.69","61.92","14.63","38.18","15.89","25.87","78.55","49.42","12.59","5.13","1.86","1.17","0.23","0.70","1.17","7.46","6.76","13.05","10.72","3.26","5.13","1.40","16.32","2.80","1.40","2.10","3.03","2.56","6.29","3.50","2.80","1.17","0.70","0.23","9.56","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.70","11.19","2.10","0.93","0.93","2.56","1.63","4.43","2.33","0.93","0.93","0.23","0.93","0.23","0.23","0.23","0.23","8.62","2.56","0.47","4.20","1.63","0.70","6.76","7.93","1.40","7.93","0.70","3.73","3.50","3.03","0.47","0.23","1.40","0.00","0.00","0.47","0.23","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.00","22.14","6.53","5.36","0.00","0.00","0.23","0.00","0.70","5.83","3.26","0.00","0.23","2078","7.81","18.458333333333332","624","418","28","64.81","11.1","7.9","12.64","10.8","91","8.6","16.668133971291866","258","17.42","9","0.48","0","16","8","37","1","57","33","0","2","5","37","56","3","25","0","0","29","3","20","0","0","0","8","0","10","25","13","19","17","10","2","5","0","2"
"http://newslo.com/new-republican-healthcare-bill-involves-horcruxes/","New Republican Healthcare Bill Involves Horcruxes","WASHINGTON—Congressional Republicans are unimpressed by a recent study that was published in the Annuals of Internal Medicine which finds that Obama’s Affordable Care Act may ultimately save over 24,000 American lives every year. In effort to one-up this victory for Obamacare, Republicans have drawn up a new healthcare bill and have suddenly revealed that they have harnessed the dark power of “Horcruxes” which will keep citizens’ souls moored to the earth even after their bodies have been destroyed.

Since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law by the president in 2012, House Republicans have held a vote to change or repeal it over 50 times. The conservative Fox News channel has run countless stories admonishing its unviability in the real world, and now the Senate right’s new He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named-Care Act aims to out-shine the ACA by offering Americans the option of splitting their soul and hide it in objects from their enemies—but only after they have exterminated the enemies’ families and performed some sort of nefarious ritual.

“The thing about Obamacare is that it still exists within the realms of life and death. We, on the other hand, have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality!” cackled Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

McConnell was one of the first to create a Horocrux after he and Eric Cantor found the villainous book, “Secrets of the Dark Arts” in the restricted section of the Library of Congress. He keeps a piece of his soul at his ranch, bound to a hundred-year-old bottle of Kentucky bourbon and another piece inside McConnell’s old Louisville drinking buddy, Don, who works at a dump. Strangely enough, McConnell has very strongly insisted that Don, who remains unaware of the extra soul inside him, take advantage of Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

Representative Cantor has Horocruxed part of his soul into the body of his serpent pet, Nagini. It is rumored that sometimes the snake will take to the House floor wearing Cantor’s clothes and speaking in Parseltongue without anyone noticing the congressman’s absence.

The Affordable Care Act is now projected to give health care to 20 million Americans who would not have received it before, but Republicans believe that with their new plan they will finally be saying, “Avada Kedavra!” to all its hype.

“Honestly, when you think about it, life itself is the ultimate failed healthcare policy and not even unicorn’s blood can get around that. But Horcruxes make the soul eternal!” proclaimed McConnell. When asked about the inherent evilness of creating Horcruxes, which requires performing heinous acts upon innocent people in order to preserve the few who aren’t morally bothered by this at all, McConnell laughed, “I mean, you just described us Republicans’ modus operandi for the last fourteen years. What of it?”","2014-05-22 10:02:19","0","24.0","4.0","27.0","2.0","9.0","0.0","44.0","31.0","0.0","50.0","1.0","35.0","3","473","90.53","71.59","23.69","45.17","24.89","24.95","79.70","46.93","11.21","4.02","0.21","0.42","0.42","1.48","1.48","7.19","8.03","15.22","6.34","3.59","3.17","1.06","13.11","3.81","1.48","2.11","2.33","2.33","4.86","2.96","1.90","0.00","1.27","0.21","8.67","0.21","0.21","0.00","1.90","8.25","1.90","1.27","0.42","1.69","0.85","2.54","1.69","0.85","0.63","0.21","2.54","1.27","1.06","0.00","0.21","7.40","0.85","2.33","4.23","1.06","0.42","1.90","8.88","1.06","13.95","1.27","6.55","6.13","3.81","1.06","0.85","1.06","1.69","0.63","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.64","3.17","4.65","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.63","2.11","2.54","2.33","0.00","0.00","2310","8.68","30.125","701","461","19","55.27","12.7","11.6","13.18","15.2","112","17.5","21.438004338394794","291","27.44","3","0.45","0","13","8","45","0","63","29","0","0","6","66","61","8","16","0","0","20","10","21","0","0","3","12","0","15","14","9","18","16","16","5","6","0","2"
"http://newslo.com/news-crew-quarantined-order-politicians-fearing-apocalypse/","News Crew Quarantined Under Order By Politicians Fearing Apocalypse","NEW JERSY – It should come as no surprise that in recent weeks there has been a heightened awareness of public health hazards that threaten the well being of the public. Government agencies, law enforcement, medical professionals, and even airlines have taken to new guidelines to try and prevent the spread of diseases across the country. However, one news crew is finding those guidelines rather – solitary.

According to reports a news crew recently returned from Liberia have been taken into custody for Quarantine. The reason? Zombie Apocalypse.

As shocking as this sounds, it seems that local officials were weary on taking the chance that the walking dead could, in fact, become a reality on the streets of New Jersey. While no names have been released, facts on the case have been made known to the public.

Sources from New Jersey Department of Health report that the members of the news crew who work for an affiliate of a major news outlet were recently on assignment in the African country of Liberia. The crew, whose names have not yet been released, were apparently traveling a region of the country where the Ebola virus had wiped out whole villages.

So, why are they being quarantined now?

Apparently footage recovered from the crew’s trip, indicate that some of the dead affected by the virus, reanimated hours after their demise. Sources say that while the crew may not exhibit signs or symptoms of Ebola, they could however be infected with a mutant strain that could cause them to become part of the walking dead.

This new order for mandatory quarantine was not a surprise to some. While on location, the news crew’s cameraman did become infected with the Ebola Virus. The other member’s of the crew had agreed to a state of voluntary quarantine upon return to the United States as per the standards for those considered to be at low probability for infection. Despite the fact that the rest of the members of said crew remain symptom free, the suggestion that the virus had mutated to reanimate the dead remains a concern for local politicians.

"http://viralactions.com/iggy-azaela-get-over-yourself-n-im-killin-rappers-like-ferguson/","Iggy Azaela “Get Over Yourself N**** I’m Killin Rappers Like Ferguson”","Iggy Azalea is no stranger to making inappropriate tweets. Some of which have even been called racist by critics in the past. However, if anyone ever had any doubts whether or not Iggy Azalea was a race hater, Iggy went and confirmed it for them with various disturbing tweets after being criticized for not supporting the protestors in Ferguson and New York City. Also, several reports have been released stating that Azalea is “from Australia” and that Australia is “crazy racist.”

“I don’t know what you were thanking, I’m Australian,” she tweeted. She followed that tweet with “curse I am. My people were the rapists and murderers Britain didn’t want,” and “you expect an Ozzie to be respectful we had a law not to feed the black folks.” “When black people started getting all hungry for rights, we just rifled therm.”

Several other tweets followed such as, “we wouldn’t allow anybody but whites in Queensland” and “we took mixed chilrdren from they paren ts.”

Then, she hit everyone with the shocker.

However, black leaders along with civil rights activists in general, while not surprised to hear that a blond-haired Australian girl is also a racist, were surprised that so many people support her music career, follow her on twitter, and even look to hear her opinions on racial matters.

"http://viralactions.com/kerry-washington-quits-scandal-after-cheating-rumors/","Kerry Washington Quits Scandal After Cheating Rumors","HOLLYWOOD, CA– In one of the most shocking situations recently in Hollywood, Kerry Washington, who recently gave birth to Isabelle Amarachi Asomugha with husband and former NFL player Nnamdi Asomugha, has quit the hit show Scandal amid cheating rumors.

Washington has been the center of several rumors involving her daughter, and if the baby is truly her husbands. Their has been speculation that Nnamdi Asomugha took a paternity test following the birth of their child, fearing that his daughter is a direct result of adultery.

Since 2012, Washington has starred in the ABC drama Scandal, a Shonda Rhimes series in which Washington plays Olivia Pope, a crisis management expert to the President.

“I don’t understand how Kerry could go from this wholesome actress playing this virtuous feminine role, to being engulfed in these unfortunate allegations.” Show creator Shonda Rhimes said during a press conference Thursday evening. “Although this is a terrible situation, I am proud of Kerry for having the courage in stepping down from her role, but we are going to have a tough task finding a replacement who can bring more class and righteousness to this beloved character.”

Tough task indeed.

Kerry Washington’s close friend, who goes by the name R. Polanski, recently confirmed to the media that the star will not be returning to the show. Citing reasons of “moral disappointment, shame, dishonor and disgrace” within herself; attributes of which she stated she previously never came in touch with, in or out of her roles.

In 2013, Washington gained wide public recognition for her role and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television series.

Big shoes to fill.

So one can see why there are all sorts of scrambling within the production team to find a suitable replacement. Talking heads in Hollywood have thrown out names from Nia Long (The Best Man Holiday, Love Jones) to Gabrielle Union (Being Mary Jane, Think Like A Man Too).

Lets just hope for the best.

"http://viralactions.com/2pac-still-alive-new-evidence-emerges/","2Pac Still Alive?? New Evidence Emerges…","On September 13th 1996, American rapper 2pac Shakur was pronounced as being fatally killed by a series of gunshot wounds. Despite this, there is much surrounding his ‘death’ that doesn’t add up. Now you’re probably reading this thinking, this has got to be one of those whacked out ‘conspiracy theories’ going against everything ever officially reported, if he was alive we would know for certain, right? I initially thought the same seeing such claims too. It wasn’t long however, before I found myself uncovering much more about his supposed death and the circumstances situated around it that made be begin to think otherwise. I began to realise that actually, such claims that 2pac may have faked his own death and is still alive may have more truths to them than what first appears, as it is evident that there is more to this story than what was ever officially reported..

It all began a couple years ago when I was on Youtube listening to 2pac and some of his songs. On the sidebar I saw a link titled “2PAC ALIVE 2014 RETURN – MUST WATCH!!”. Of course I thought, another stereotypical video discrediting people questioning real conspiracies and cover-ups. Being a huge 2pac fan I couldn’t help but take an interest in seeing what these people were claiming and so clicked the video anyway. What I saw next could not have surprised me more, as it was suggesting the last known photo of 2pac alive the night he had allegedly been shot, was fake!

Another strong piece of evidence made against the photo is a picture snapped of 2pac and Suge Knight earlier. The night 2pac was ‘killed’, he was at the MGM strip in Las Vegas to see a Mike Tyson boxing match. Interestingly if you look at the picture seen below you will notice something doesn’t add up. It is very obvious if you examine the facial hair on 2pac’s chin, you can see that in the picture where he is in the car his beard is much longer!

Pictured above on the left is the photo in its original form. What stands out about it most is that there are no keys in the ignition! This can be seen clearly from the close up picture to the right. It was reported that this photo was allowed to be taken by paparazzi while 2pac and his manager Suge Knight were waiting at traffic lights. With this in mind, it isn’t possible that the car would have been able to take off without any keys.

Finally, if you didn’t think that was enough, this last piece of evidence against the ‘final’ photo is BY FAR the most compelling as it is quite clear that the photo of 2pac seen is actually his military portrait. Below you can see that this photo has been overlayed on top of the photo where he is seen in the car and is faded out gradually. The results are a perfect match..

If you look at his eyes throughout each frame they remain the same while the lighting changes..

This got me thinking, why on earth would somebody go to the trouble and effort to fake the last photo of 2pac being alive? There would have to be a reason for it, and so lead me to investigate further in finding out what else really happened that night. It turns out there were a number of things out of the ordinary. It was very strange for 2pac not to be wearing his bullet-proof vest as after less than a year earlier, 2pac had survived a point blank shooting in New York. It was because of this he was always seen to be wearing one. According to his cousin, Jamal Lesane: “Normally he wouldn’t leave without it, but this time he left it behind and didn’t have it with him.” E.D.I also claims that night Kastro told 2pac he should put his vest on, but replied “It’s too hot tonight.” Before the alleged shooting that would become known as the fatal night 2pac died, he and his camaraderie of Outlawz and bodyguards made their way across the Vegas strip to a mansion belonging to Suge Knight. According to members of The Outlawz, Suge and 2pac unexpectedly disappeared briefly while the others waited patiently. “I don’t really know what Pac or Suge was doing at the time, I just knew we was waiting and I was ready to go.” Reportedly after about half an hour, with 2pac and the others now ready to leave for a show at club 662, 2pac made an unusual request to his bodyguard, Frank Alexander. “I was walking to the car with Suge and Pac when I was opening up the door to get in the backseat. Then Pac stopped me and said no take the keys and go drive the Lexus with the Outlawz, we’re going to be drinking and you’re going to be the designated driver to drive us back after we’ve finished parting.” This was even more out of the ordinary as 2pac would never go anywhere in public without at least one of his bodyguards for his safety. Given such abnormal circumstances, what happened later involving his ‘death’, was was either very convenient, or a total coincidence.. The story officially reported of 2pac’s death is of he and Suge waiting at more traffic lights along the MGM strip, when a white Cadillac was seen pulling up next to them and began firing shots into their BMW. Frank Alexander was in the Lexus behind 2pac and described the scene as he saw it. “After the Cadillac shot into the car I thought they were dead, my reaction was to run up to the car, but instead the car sped up and took off.” The BMW went onto makes a hard right u-turn and race off in the opposite direction. “I didn’t know what to think, it was a faulk, it was a haze. Were these real bullets? Did they really shoot these guys?..” Frank also made mention that some of the other cars containing security went in pursuit of the white Cadillac, although failed to catch up to it and identify the vehicle plate. To this day nobody knows who killed 2pac and the case remains an unsolved murder. The events that followed suit involved 2pac being rushed to hospital, although the details as to how he arrived and by whom are uncertain due to three different scenarios being relayed by different accounts. According to media 2pac and Suge were found in the BMW with all four tires blown out. An ambulance also apparently arrived on scene shortly after and was said to have rushed 2pac to hospital. Suge describes a different series of events, claiming in an interview he drove 2pac to the hospital himself, he then however is oddly seen changing his story to coincide with that of official media reports! The third and final account is that of a by-stander still on scene when asked on camera what she had just witnessed. VIDEO: “We were pretty far down the street when it happened, we didn’t know if we heard gunshots, we didn’t know exactly what we heard, we heard a lot of screaming and car screeching. We ran up the street as cops were running past us and by the time we got here they were already taking which now I found out is 2pac into the helicopter away.”

Did this person say something she wasn’t supposed to? .. Afterwards nobody else on the scene was further asked for questioning and reports continued to detail 2pac being met by an ambulance at the scene of the broken down BMW.

How much more bizarre could this night get? .. Well as it turns out things were only beginning to get stranger.

Pictured above on the left is a picture of the crime scene where the BMW came to its end. The damage to the rims can be seen from the blown out tires. Pictured to the right is news footage showing investigators examining the supposed car 2pac and Suge were in. Here’s where it gets weird, if you look at the wheels of both cars neither match up.

When both cars are seen from another angle it is unmistakable that these are two totally different vehicles! This begs the question, why was this second car being examined and why was it on the scene??","2014-11-13 00:00:00","0","9.0","11.0","3.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","33.0","28.0","0.0","90.0","5.0","0.0","1","1413","70.52","57.58","47.77","23.55","21.74","16.91","84.71","55.48","13.59","6.51","1.63","0.99","0.78","2.55","0.57","7.08","7.86","15.29","9.84","5.02","5.94","1.70","18.83","5.24","3.33","2.05","0.92","2.55","1.98","0.92","1.06","0.07","0.28","0.07","7.43","0.07","0.07","0.14","2.69","11.75","2.41","1.49","1.56","2.48","1.34","3.96","4.46","3.61","0.71","0.14","1.27","0.57","0.64","0.00","0.07","5.38","1.49","0.50","2.26","1.13","0.35","8.99","7.50","0.64","16.77","3.11","8.28","5.52","1.13","0.57","0.07","0.28","0.00","1.27","0.21","0.00","0.07","0.00","0.07","0.07","12.67","4.60","3.26","0.14","0.00","0.57","0.50","0.28","1.49","1.84","0.00","0.00","6060","6.93","23.866666666666667","1877","1406","65","74.93","10.5","8.2","8.53","10.3","198","8.9","16.273001422475108","556","21.37","34","0.53","0","44","40","150","0","170","78","5","1","16","169","66","0","52","1","0","98","22","84","7","2","20","49","0","54","93","50","52","32","41","4","13","0","14"
"http://viralactions.com/watch-ignorant-mississippi-folks-explain-why-they-hate-obama-video/","WATCH: Ignorant Mississippi Folks Explain Why They Hate Obama (Video)","Why are so many white, poor, rural men conservative, even though liberal policies would help them?

And why do they hate President Barack Obama so much?

Scroll Down for Video…

These questions have baffled liberals for ages. In 2012, Bill Maher sent documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi out to ask them. She went to a rural part of Mississippi — the poorest and most conservative state in the Union — and talked with some white guys of varying ages and income levels.



What these southern men have to say might not surprise you, but you’ve got to give them props for being so affable and upfront with the daughter of Rep. Nancy “Devil Woman” Pelosi (D-Calif.)



Most striking is how even the least fortunate of these men stoically accepts his economic fate, and how deeply and sincerely these men cherish their beliefs — which seem so grim, heartless, and unappealing to the rest of us.Watch these white, rural men explain why they’re so conservative.White, conservative men explain why they hate Obama:

“One thing, he’s named ‘Obama’”

“This is America. Our president should be American. Not Muslim.”

Why they hate Obamacare even though they need healthcare:

I hate Obamacare. It’s retarded.

Back when i was growing up, and my parents were growing up, and my grandparents were growing up, we didn’t have all that and people still made it. And back then, people pulled their own weight, they didn’t sit around waiting for everyone else to take care of them.

Why they don’t want the government to fix the economy:

It’ll take care of itself. You put God in the saddle, it’ll all be okay.

Why they vote Republican even though it hasn’t worked for them:

But it COULD [work]. It hasn’t, but it could.

We would rather go broke and die hungry than to give up our moral beliefs.

Pelosi’s most baffling exchange was with a chatty, tooth-challenged man who said, “I don’t care for the government.” When an astonished Pelosi reminded him that he’s on food stamps, the man replied:

“Yeah, but I think I deserve food stamps. I have no employment.”

Since 51 percent of people in the state of Mississippi are female, and 37 percent are African American (according to the U.S. Census), we wish Pelosi had also talked with some women and blacks. Nonetheless, Pelosi’s interviews shed a fascinating light on how these white, male conservatives think.","2014-07-27 00:00:00","0","46.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","2.0","63.0","38.0","0.0","165.0","7.0","30.0","6","401","30.40","83.46","10.48","21.92","16.71","17.96","82.79","50.37","14.71","8.98","2.00","1.50","0.75","1.25","3.49","5.74","3.99","10.72","9.23","7.73","8.48","2.24","19.45","3.49","1.50","3.74","1.00","3.24","4.74","2.24","2.49","0.00","1.25","0.50","15.96","0.75","0.25","1.25","3.74","13.47","2.24","2.99","2.24","2.00","0.75","3.99","2.74","2.00","0.50","0.25","1.25","0.25","0.00","0.00","1.00","7.23","2.49","0.75","3.49","0.75","0.00","4.49","11.22","1.50","8.73","2.00","4.74","2.49","3.24","0.75","0.00","1.75","1.50","0.25","0.75","0.25","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.00","23.69","6.73","6.48","1.25","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.50","2.74","3.99","1.00","0.50","1831","7.23","21.94736842105263","534","400","25","80.62","10.0","6.0","10.96","9.7","71","7.833333333333334","15.5","241","18.95","9","0.49","0","19","4","28","0","34","35","0","3","5","38","37","0","28","0","0","38","7","25","0","1","3","9","1","15","19","7","6","31","9","1","2","0","12"

Stiviano On A Racist Tirade: ‘I don’t understand black people’","Well if this isn’t the pot calling the kettle anti-black.

V. Stiviano, who secretly recorded NBA owner Donald Sterling’s slurs against African-Americans, made a few of her own in two videos made public Saturday by TMZ.com.

“I don’t understand black people,” the 31-year-old model snaps in one clip. “The minute you give them a little bit of money, they don’t know what to do with it.

“They just act crazy. … They’re like, ‘Yo, I wanna put some rims on top of my rims. And my rims are gonna turn around, so I’m gonna call them — what? Spinners.’”

Stiviano, caught on camera during the shooting of a 2011 reality show pilot about gold-diggers, wasn’t finished sounding like Sterling.

“They do stupid s— like that, when there’s people starving around the world,” she announces. “That’s what people want to do with their money?”

In the second clip, Stiviano is riding shotgun while holding an Elmo doll as an African-American friend drives.

Speaking to the stuffed Muppet, Stiviano cracks, “We don’t like black people.”

She is black and Mexican.

Stiviano’s taped conversation with the 80-year-old Sterling turned the Los Angeles Clippers owner into a pariah, leading to a lifetime ban from the NBA and the forced sale of his team. The billionaire real estate mogul was also fined $2.5 million.

Sterling, in yet another secretly taped conversation, claimed his vile remarks were his version of sweet talk as he tried to bed the decades-younger Stiviano.

Stiviano claimed that she never slept with Sterling despite the gifts that he lavished upon her — including $500,000 in luxury cars and a $1.8 million Los Angeles duplex.

Sterling’s wife cut a deal last week to sell the Clippers for $2 billion, but lawyers filed suit on behalf of her litigious husband to fight the sale in court.

Sterling’s lawsuit against the league also seeks to overturn his suspension from the sport, although an NBA lawyer dismissed the move as “entirely baseless.”

Spouse Shelly Sterling seized control of her husband’s enormous holdings after Donald Sterling was branded “mentally incapacitated” by two neurologists who diagnosed him with dementia.

The other 29 NBA owners, who were initially expected to vote this week on whether to oust Sterling, will instead decide on the proposed purchase by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver scheduled a Wednesday meeting with civil rights leaders to discuss the sale of the Clippers and other issues, said the Rev. Al Sharpton.","2014-05-31 00:00:00","0","42.0","18.0","3.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","63.0","38.0","0.0","164.0","7.0","22.0","6","418","91.86","77.80","9.58","18.70","16.72","24.16","71.05","42.34","10.29","6.46","1.20","0.24","0.24","3.35","1.44","3.83","8.61","14.35","5.02","3.11","4.07","1.44","10.05","2.63","2.39","1.91","4.07","1.20","1.91","0.72","1.20","0.00","0.72","0.00","12.92","0.96","0.24","1.91","2.15","6.70","0.96","1.20","0.96","0.48","0.48","3.11","2.87","1.44","0.96","0.24","1.20","0.24","0.48","0.00","0.48","6.46","2.39","1.20","3.59","0.24","0.00","3.35","5.74","1.20","12.20","2.39","4.55","5.26","2.15","0.72","0.48","1.67","0.00","0.00","1.20","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.24","0.00","22.73","5.98","5.50","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.00","2.15","3.83","3.83","0.00","0.96","1964","8.02","21.7","573","410","23","70.33","9.5","7.9","12.06","11.6","91","5.928571428571429","17.998048780487807","266","20.5","11","0.41","0","6","17","42","0","54","36","1","0","1","68","48","2","23","0","0","18","11","15","0","0","1","11","0","12","23","8","8","14","7","0","6","0","1"
"http://viralactions.com/secret-to-sell-your-soul-to-satan-is-revealed/","Secret To Sell Your Soul To Satan is Revealed","You can have power, wealth, an attractive mate and virtually anything else you ever dreamed of – by selling your soul to Satan! But how?

You must know what you’re doing when you make the deal or Satan will cheat you blind. That’s the word from Dr. Rex Touth, expert on satanic rituals and author of How to Negotiate Unholy Contracts.

Dr. Touth cites cases dating all the way back to the 16th century in which humans have agreed to spend eternity in Hell when they die in exchange for earthly pleasures while they’re alive.

“Human history and world literature are teeming with stories like that of Germany’s Dr. Faustus who sold his soul,” says Dr. Touth. “Our own American statesman Daniel Webster once debated Satan in a landmark soul-selling case in which he renegotiated the contract and had it overturned.

“Thousands have gained riches and fulfilled their fantasies.”

Here are some tips from Dr. Touth on how you can take advantage of the same opportunity:

1. SET THE DEAL UP PROPERLY. There’s a right and wrong way to make contact with the Devil. The right way is to be alone in your room, close your eyes and say, “Satan, I summon you. I have a quality soul to sell if the price is right.” It may take dozens, even hundreds of tries but at all costs, avoid sounding desperate or needy. He’ll show up eventually.

2. DEAL FROM A POSITION OF POWER. By far the biggest mistake people make is to underestimate how badly Satan wants their soul. It’s like precious gold to him and he’ll pay anything to get it. When he appears, get him to make the first offer, then up it.

3. GET THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Remember, you’re going to burn in Hell forever. So no matter how badly off you are now, demand the best. For instance, even if you feel unlovable and desperate with loneliness, don’t just say, “I want the most gorgeous woman on earth and I want her to be madly in love with me.” Instead, add, “In fact, throw in 100 other women as well so I can pick and choose according to my mood.”

4. REMEMBER TO DEMAND THE LIFE-EXTENSION CLAUSE. Satan won’t tell you if you don’t ask but you can get a guarantee of 300 years of youthful life before you go to eternal damnation. Why enjoy a mere 75 or 80 years of reckless living when you can get 300?

Religious groups worldwide are trying to ban Dr. Touth’s book. “This kind of trash is spiritual dynamite,” says a spokesman for the North American Council of Churches and Synogogues. “We can’t, in good conscience, let people read how to destroy their almighty souls.”

But Dr. Touth says we should all be aware of the facts so we can make an informed decision. “It’s your soul,” he says. “Do waht you want with it.”","2014-08-01 00:00:00","0","38.0","18.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","59.0","38.0","0.0","165.0","7.0","22.0","6","486","63.59","89.51","14.34","19.62","13.50","16.46","85.19","48.77","12.35","8.85","1.44","0.82","4.32","1.44","0.82","3.50","5.56","13.37","8.02","5.35","7.82","1.03","16.67","2.88","1.85","3.09","2.88","1.44","6.79","3.09","3.50","0.62","1.03","0.41","13.37","0.00","0.41","0.62","1.65","12.35","1.65","2.67","2.06","3.09","2.06","2.88","2.88","0.82","1.65","0.41","1.44","0.21","1.03","0.00","0.00","8.64","1.85","2.06","2.88","3.09","0.41","1.23","13.99","1.85","12.14","0.62","7.00","4.73","1.03","0.62","0.21","2.26","4.32","0.41","0.82","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.00","21.19","8.23","4.73","0.21","0.00","0.41","0.21","0.41","3.91","3.09","0.00","0.00","2061","7.1","16.193548387096776","639","486","36","83.15","8.8","5.0","8.23","6.5","86","7.5","14.478189300411524","295","15.32","27","0.49","0","19","9","29","0","52","32","0","2","11","62","58","0","21","1","0","43","10","24","0","1","1","17","0","30","10","9","2","27","16","3","2","0","10"

Big name entertainers included on Mark’s list include Ludacris, Bow Wow, Method Man, Ja Rule, Scott Storch, Young Buck, Beanie Sigel, Lil Flip and others.

Scott Storch

Mark uses well publicized news articles to back up his claims.

“It just goes to show that many of these rap stars who fall victim to this system,” Mark says. “They become willing Illuminati icons. Willing servants of this satanic, mind numbing, materialistic, mentally controlling system. And then they just become victims of it. Most of these rappers really are just actors. A lot of the jewelry they have is just fake or rented. A lot of the assets that they have on MTV Cribs… I don’t know if that show is even on any more, but a lot of those cars are just rented or leased for the weekend while they shot the episode. Even some of the houses. They didn’t own the house. They were renting the house for maybe six months or a year.”

"http://viralactions.com/6-signs-your-being-cheated-on/","6 Signs Your Being Cheated On","Cheaters Hate This New Website – Here’s Why

Picture this scenario: You’re in the middle of dinner with your man, and he rushes outside for an “emergency” call. Normally you wouldn’t care, but this is the fourth time it’s happened! Suddenly you get a sick feeling in your stomach, and it’s not from the food.

By now, you’re finally convinced your man is cheating. But you need proof. Here’s your chance to get it.

“See who he’s been calling or texting behind your back. It’s as easy as typing in a phone number.”

Introducing the controversial new website that will blow the lid off his affair. It’s called Reverse Phone Lookup, and it will help you track down who your man’s been calling or texting. Like we said, cheaters hate this website.

If you think your man’s got a secret, use this tool right now.

See who he’s been calling or textingbehind your back. It’s as easy as typing in a phone number and he’ll never find out.

Still not sure you’re ready for the truth? Check out these telltale signs your man’s a cheater. Chances are, he’s guilty of all of them.

He’s Secretive With His Smartphone

Anyone with a smartphone is spending more time online than ever before. If your man wants to fool around, he’s got a million ways to do it–and they’re all at his fingertips. Look at his texts and see who and what he’s been texting behind your back. You may be surprised at what you find.

He’s Extra Sensitive About Privacy

Cheaters work overtime to cover their tracks. You have to be smarter than them. Look out for new hobbies your man won’t tell you about. Or excuses like, “I just need to be alone.”

Then use Reverse Phone to look up calls he’s made on his phone. Maybe “Brad from work” is actually a Michelle from Tinder.

He Hits The Gym All The Time

In the past, you’ve hinted he could lose some belly fat. But he’s never listened. Now, out of the blue, he’s started hitting the gym hard. What’s changed? Him. Because if he wants to cheat, this is his mating season. He’s bulking up so he can lure the hottest girls to his bed.

He’s Distant

If your man’s doting on someone else, he won’t be as affectionate toward you. And he’ll be moody. He’ll get upset over nothing, and he’ll blame you for everything. Why does it feel like someone flipped a switch on his emotions? Because your man’s got someone on his mind. And it’s definitely not you.

Find out who’s taking up all his attention.

He Smells Different

Trust your instincts and your senses. If your man smells different, it’s because he’s spending his time somewhere else. And he’s trying to throw you off track.

Maybe he’s showering at his side chick’s place. Or you’re picking up the scent of her perfume. When your gut and your senses tell you something’s wrong, listen. Then uncover the truthfrom Reverse Phone.

He Deletes Texts

You know you’re not the only one he’s calling. But you can’t prove it. Because the last time you snuck a peek at his phone, the call and text logs were empty. Just wait a couple days, and grab his phone again (sooner or later you’ll catch him slipping). When you look up the numbers, you’ll expose the identity (and address!) of his “special someone.”

"http://viralactions.com/all-americans-to-receive-microchip-implant-by-2016-by-way-of-obamacare/","All Americans To Receive Microchip Implant By 2016 By Way Of Obamacare","NBC has recently predicted that in 2016, all of America will be tagged with microchips. They will be implanted to help identify individuals immediately. According to the report, the technology is used to answer one question, “Am I who I say I am?”



Some worry, however, that the RFID Microchip will give the government too much power, allowing them to track every move. In some states, like Virginia, legislation is in process to stop this from happening. The report also reveals an RFID Brain Chip that has been developed and is currently being tested on several humans. Proof the RFID Microchip is in Obamacare below:



It was reported that the use of Micro-Chips in Bill H.R. 4872 was located on Page 1014 under “National Medical Device Registry” it tells about a “Class II Device That is Implantable” and yes, they passed the bill. Read Page “1014″ In The H.R. 4872 Read Class II Special Controls Guidance For FDA Staff

With the RFID Microchip they can track the movement of the people that are implanted. They can also control the money and food of the people. It is also reported to be possible to even kill the people that don’t obey. The HR 3962 Bill is an exact copy of the HR 3200 bill in with the exception of just a few words removed concerning the RFID Microchip but the ability to Chip Every Citizen of the United States is still in the bill.

"http://viralactions.com/george-w-bush-arrested-for-possession-of-cocaine/","George W. Bush Arrested For Possession Of Cocaine","One of the most notorious Presidents in history of The United States of America is back in the spotlight, but not because of his politics. George W. Bush was arrested in a Dallas suburb late Tuesday evening after a routine traffic stop uncovered over an ounce of cocaine in his glove compartment.

Dallas police say they pulled over Bush after he made a right turn without signaling. Officers report they were surprised when seeing it was the ex-president, but felt something was off about his behavior. They say Bush seemed under the influence of a narcotic, and the officers on-scene asked to search the car. Curiously, Bush consented, and police found the narcotics.“We pulled over the truck and were about to write a simple traffic ticket and things escalated fast,” said officer Charles Cane, a veteran officer with the Dallas Police Department. “At first my partner and I were stunned with who was in the truck ,and [Bush] began to crack jokes and asked if we wanted to take a picture with him. I noticed he was sniffling quite a bit and the glaze on his eyes screamed that the was under the influence.”Cane said that once the officers uncovered the cocaine, Bush tried to bribe them to keep from getting arrested. When that failed, he turned to threats and rambling, reportedly saying that he would ‘get the FBI to kick their a–’ and that ‘Presidents can break any laws they want.’

“I broke so many laws when I was in office, and I didn’t see you coming to try to arrest me then!” Bush shouted at police officers. “I’ve been doing coke for decades! I used to blow lines out of a Skull & Bones in New Haven tittie bars when you were making nice in your diapers, kid. You just want your name in the papers next to mine.”

“It was a tough arrest to make, but I didn’t become a police officer to make easy decisions. He begged me over and over to let it slide, then he offered me money, then he called me an ass—-, but that is the way the law goes. We don’t offer special treatment to anyone in Dallas. I don’t care who you are.”

Representatives for Bush have yet to comment, but bail was set at $5,000 and posted immediately. Bush spent less than 6 hours in a holding cell before being released.","2014-07-31 00:00:00","0","9.0","12.0","3.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","32.0","28.0","0.0","87.0","5.0","2.0","1","406","81.15","69.76","39.85","34.31","19.33","16.01","83.99","52.71","13.79","10.34","3.69","0.74","1.48","2.96","1.48","3.45","8.62","15.27","7.14","2.71","6.90","1.48","17.49","4.19","1.72","1.48","1.48","1.23","2.96","1.48","0.99","0.25","0.25","0.49","11.08","0.00","0.25","0.00","2.96","8.87","1.72","1.97","1.23","1.97","0.00","2.71","3.45","1.23","1.72","0.25","1.48","0.99","0.00","0.00","0.49","10.84","0.99","0.99","8.13","0.74","0.74","8.62","6.40","0.99","15.52","2.46","6.90","6.40","4.68","0.74","0.00","0.49","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.75","5.17","4.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.74","2.96","1.72","0.00","0.99","1726","6.94","25.6875","546","401","22","69.92","10.3","8.0","8.82","8.9","61","8.3","15.364788029925188","233","22.62","11","0.52","0","18","4","39","0","47","18","1","0","2","47","29","1","24","0","0","36","8","15","0","1","3","17","0","20","39","11","10","12","3","0","2","0","4"
"http://viralactions.com/floyd-mayweather-knocked-out-in-sparring-session-while-training-for-pacquiao-fight/","Floyd Mayweather Knocked Out In Sparring Session While Training For Pacquiao Fight!","Las Vegas – Recent reports out of a gym in Las Vegas have reported that a strange smelling Italian/Irish immigrant by the name of Peter McFarboroni has knocked out the undisputed, undefeated boxing great Floyd Mayweather.

Where the greats have failed, this man who many thought was simply the gym’s manager, succeeded by knocking out Mayweather in a mere sparring session while he is preparing for his upcoming Pacquiao match with what McFarboroni called a haymaker. “Jumpinbegonias,” the near Leprechaun exclaimed as he saw the stars in Mayweather’s eyes as the champ spun around six times, stuck out his tongue, and collapsed to the ground.

“I threw him off his game by saying he could not read which made him drop his guard and get angry, then all I had to do was dodge to the right, block, back, back, and then punch him in his weak spot Next thing you know, the lad’s down for the count,” said McFarboronni as he slid back into his pink jogging suit and proceeded to start mopping the sauna before the gym’s closing hours.

Mayweather has claimed that the fight never happened because it was never sanctioned. This is however the first time an unsanctioned bout did not land Mayweather behind bars. [Continue Reading]

"http://viralactions.com/u-s-plans-to-nuke-dallas-to-stop-spread-of-ebola-virus/","U.S. Plans To “NUKE” Dallas To Stop Spread Of Ebola Virus","Upon discovering the first U.S. ebola carrier in the city of Dallas, Texas, the United States has announced plans to safely eradicate the city by means of a human nuclear incineration device in fear that the disease might spread past city limits to infect people or because it’s Dallas and that sounds like a lot of fun.

Recently, Richard Burroughs, head director of the CDC stated, “I had a conversation with President Obama and we both agreed that the best course of action we could take would be to nuke Dallas…because of ebola of course.”

Although several health experts have already said the chance of ebola spreading on a mass scale are very slim. “You have a better chance dying of influenza in Dallas than of ebola,” said Matthew Graves, an expert in pandemic infections for Doctors without Borders. He continued, “but, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t blow up Dallas. If you’ve ever been there, it’s nothing but assholes and garbage piles.”

In a special State of the Union address, President Obama went live on television and on-line, with the broadcast being purposefully withheld from airing on Fox News in order to assure that no residents of Dallas would hear the news. In his address, President Obama stated, “men and women of America, it comes to me with great pleasure to announce that although ebolaactually did manage to make its way to the United States, it thankfully made its way to none other than Dallas, Texas and as a preemptive safety measure, I have ordered the United States Airforce to unload a small nuclear payload on the center of the city which will eradicate this city of assholes from our great nation. Oh, and it will ensure the disease doesn’t spread or something like that. You remember Outbreak.”

It has been reported at this time that the jets have taken off, but the city of Dallas stays committed in resolve to be a city full of self-absorbed, narrow-minded douchebags to the very end. One business man said with a smirk, “I’d like to see them try” right before his entire skeleton was pulverized to a fine ash by the blast.

"http://viralactions.com/lol-drunk-sarah-palin-gives-speech-on-impeaching-obamavideo/","LOL: Drunk Sarah Palin Gives Speech On Impeaching Obama(VIDEO)","At the Western Conservative Summit this last week, Sarah Palin drunkenly doubled down on her calls for impeachment after a string of word soup tailored together from past conservative talking points. Am I being critical of Palin’s intelligence while she stumbles through this 30 minutes speech by calling her “drunken”? No. I do believe that Palin is 99% moron, but this one appears to be a moron that had a few too many to drink that evening before they got up for their speaking engagement.



The speech seemed to have been written by some neo-libertarian tribute to Ayn Rand by offering a protagonist “the forgotten man”. Her speech didn’t ever cover one issue, but instead turned Tea Party talking points into a macabre poetry slam competition. Palin says absolutely nothing of substance in her speech aside from her general feelings about society and her hatred of the other side of politics.

The only thing that seems certain in Palin’s world is that Obama is evil and facts are relative. Her drive towards impeachment in the drunken speech strings together random accusations as public facts (most of which have been debunked). Palin even mentions the 2008 “loophole” signed by former President Bush to give refugee status to children as a reason to impeach Obama. Because she is just that dumb… and most likely drunk.This video is 30 minutes of “are you fucking kidding me?” that is only topped off by the introduction to Palin which labels her as the “most influential woman in the history of the republican party”. That doesn’t help the republicans in their defense of the “war on women” at all.

"http://viralactions.com/woman-accidentally-shoots-herself-with-gun-she-bought-for-ferguson-riots/","Woman Accidentally Shoots Herself with Gun She Bought For Ferguson Riots","As the Grand Jury decision on whether or not to indict Ferguson,MO police officer Darren Wilson in the death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown draws near, people around the area have begun to load up on firearms and ammunition. While it remains to be seen if the panic is warranted – everyone from community leaders to President Obama have stressed the need for peace following the announcement – the added guns in the hands of people who may not know how to properly use them has already seen at least one casualty.

St. Louis police are reporting that a 26-year-old woman has accidentally killed herself with a gun she had purchased in anticipation for Ferguson riots.

The accident occurred when the car the woman, identified as Becca Campbell, was riding in rear-ended a car in front of them. Typically a fender bender would not cause loss of life, but the woman’s gun discharged in the collision and the bullet struck her in the head.

According to KMOV:

The boyfriend, who wasn’t identified, told police that the couple had bought a gun because of fears of unrest related to the pending grand jury decision on the shooting of Michael Brown, the sources said.

He told investigators that as they drove late Friday night, the victim waved a gun, jokingly saying the couple were ready for Ferguson, the sources said.

He ducked to get out of the way of the gun and accidentally rear-ended another car. He said the accident caused the gun to go off and she was struck by a bullet in the head, the sources said.

Guns, already a problem for America more generally, are becoming an increasing concern for residents and law enforcement around Ferguson. As tensions rise – and urged on by a giddy media which can’t help but stoke the flames in pursuit of ratings boosts – the number of scared people buying firearms to “protect” themselves from their neighbors is skyrocketing. One Ferguson gun store owner told reporters that his sales have gone up by around 700% this month.

In a sign of just how bad it has gotten, store owners, like the one mentioned above, are now beginning to close up their shops and ship out their lethal stock so no more weapons can find their way onto the streets in the coming weeks. It’s a testament to the very real fear people feel that even the promise of large profits can’t entice gun shop owners from ignoring pleas from law enforcement and staying open for business.

Whether or not violence erupts after the decision, the fact that hundreds of more guns are now in the community is a problem that will likely plague Ferguson long after the protests end.

"http://viralactions.com/wiz-khalifa-arrested-for-tax-evasion-after-blowing-2-million-on-hoes-weed/","Wiz Khalifa Arrested for Tax Evasion After Blowing 2 Million On Hoes & Weed","The internet was abuzz today with more news regarding the divorce of pop icons Wiz Khalifa and wife Amber Rose, famous for something or another. It is reported that Khalifa has secretly depleted all of the couple’s wealth spending most of it on an exuberant amount of weed and hoes which were to be used on Khalifa’s extravagant hanging marijuana garden.

Khalifa had no comment for reporters as he stuffed what appeared to be a trash bag full of snapback hats into the backseat of a Mazaradi as men, appearing to be IRS, removed the rims and tires from the vehicle.

“You can’t take that,” yelled Khalifa as the men carried away a red, wooden snow sled from Khalifa’s youth. As he saw the men haul away the childhood toy, a slow tear rolled down Khalifa’s cheek realizing that he had spent so much of his life chasing paper and seeking fame that he had let his prime years slip through the cracks of his fingers.

When asked about Khalifa’s newfound poor status, wife and soon-to-be divorcee Amber Rose responded, “I knew Wiz was spending too much when he hired Malcolm Jamal-Warner to dry our hands in the restroom. Luckily, I’ve already arranged a new celebrity marriage to a fellow named Nick Canon? I don’t really know him, but whatever, my agent says it’s a good career move for whatever it is I do.”

Last seen sobbing in what was presumably a bed made of taxidermied endangered animals in throwback jerseys, Khalifa could only let out the quiet, gentle sigh, his lips forming the word “rosebud” which we can only assume is Khalifa’s favorite strain of marijuana.","2014-09-27 00:00:00","0","30.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","64.0","38.0","0.0","168.0","7.0","22.0","6","280","80.99","72.80","3.82","20.37","31.11","23.21","78.21","47.86","12.14","6.43","1.79","0.71","0.36","3.57","0.00","5.71","7.86","13.93","8.21","3.57","5.00","1.07","15.36","5.36","2.14","2.86","0.00","2.50","3.93","1.79","2.14","0.36","0.36","0.71","9.64","1.79","0.36","0.71","5.00","6.43","1.79","0.71","0.36","2.50","0.36","1.43","3.93","1.79","1.07","1.07","1.79","1.43","0.36","0.00","0.00","5.71","1.79","0.00","2.86","0.71","0.36","7.14","7.14","0.36","9.29","1.79","3.93","3.93","2.14","2.14","0.71","2.14","0.00","0.00","0.71","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","15.00","2.86","5.00","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","1.07","2.14","3.57","0.00","0.00","1248","8.53","36.25","396","277","9","57.13","14.1","12.9","10.51","16.0","59","16.0","22.83985559566787","190","31.88","5","0.46","0","7","0","26","0","32","22","0","1","3","48","24","0","17","0","0","16","6","10","1","0","3","6","0","12","17","8","12","6","6","3","2","0","2"

…At least that’s the case according to the manager of his former Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood castmate and “friend” Ray J.

During last night’s airing of the show’s reunion special, Cash Jones took to Instagram to expose the rapper for carrying on sexual activities with other men, and putting a slew of Black women “at risk.”

MONA SCOTT-YOUNG SAYS YUNG BERG FIRING WAS NETWORK’S DECISION, SHE WILL MISS HIM

“Walked in the studio, and seen some sh*t I [didn’t] want to see” he posted. “Be who [you’re going to] be, kick the closet doors down and come out switching.”

MASIKA TUCKER TALKS YUNG BERG INCIDENT: ‘IT WAS NOT AN ABUSIVE SITUATION’

No word has been given if Cash is retaliating against Berg for his fall out with Ray J‘s ex-girlfriend Teairra Mari—the former Roc-A-Fella Records singer who Berg alleges performed a sex act on him while they were recording music together.

"http://viralactions.com/ferguson-gang-leader-admits-eric-holder-paid-us-to-start-riots/","Ferguson Gang Leader Admits “Eric Holder Paid Us To Start Riots”","Eric Holder’s career has survived a long list of scandals; The 2008 Black Panther debacle, overturning Arizona’s immigration laws and ‘Fast and Furious‘ immediately spring to mind. These, however, pale in comparison to the recent allegations against Holder, the likes of which could easily land the Attorney General behind bars.

Evidence has been uncovered showing Eric Holder contributed funds to Ferguson’s gang population as incentive to loot and spread civil unrest in the area. These angry, government-sponsored terrorists have systematically infiltrated peaceful protests with the intention of escalating the situation and inciting riots.

A local gang leader came forward last week after being arrested during a night of mass-looting. The unnamed criminal is using his information to bargain for a reduced sentence.

Allegedly, Holder’s goal behind pouring the proverbial gasoline on an already volatile scene is to test militarized police response in a martial law scenario. It is also suspected that the riots have been started as the latest in distractions from the diabolical duo of Obama and Holder. This isn’t the first time they have created a media bait-and-switch to cover up any of their numerous crimes and blunders.

Officials have yet to publicly identify the damaging evidence submitted by the gang member, and are still in the process of verifying the legitimacy of said items. Judge Rineheart of the 22nd Circuit Court in St. Louis is presiding over the case, and has reviewed the materials. During a phone interview with National Report Judge Rineheart stated “The evidence I have seen is incredibly convincing.”

Holder is not yet officially charged with a crime, but it’s expected that a warrant could be issued for him within the coming days. Obama’s spokespeople have declined to comment.

"http://viralactions.com/meet-t-bone-a-jailhouse-prisoner-vigilante-who-beats-up-jail-rapis/","Meet T-Bone A Jailhouse Prisoner Vigilante Who Beats Up Jail Rapi**s","Last year I spoke to a guy named Shaun Attwood about making millions on the stock market and plunging it all into a new career as a rave-organizing ecstasy kingpin. One unfortunate side effect of selling drugs on a large scale, I discovered during our conversation, is that if the police find out about it, they’re probably going to send you to jail.

While serving time for his offenses, Shaun saw or heard about numerous rapes of inmates by their fellow prisoners—a major problem that he claimed isn’t getting nearly the amount of attention it should from prison authorities. However, he told me about a friend he made who believes it’s his Christian duty to protect weaker inmates from being sexually abused, and has been stabbed and beaten to within an inch of his life for doing just that.

T-Bone is a six feet five former Marine who’s become something of a legend in the West Coast prison system for taking a one-man stand against rapists in American jails. He’s currently serving time for robbery (he maintains his innocence), so I sent him some questions about his anti-rape crusade and the issues of sexual assault in American prisons.

VICE: Hi, T-Bone. When did you first decide that you were going to make a stand against rapists in the prison system?

T-Bone: It was in 1986, when I saw a young kid of 18 being pushed around for food and being told to smuggle crystal meth and heroin into prison inside his butt. When the kid brought the dope in, the two guys who’d made him do it both got high and raped the kid, which made me decide to take action.

How common is rape in American prisons? As prevalent as TV and movies would have you believe?

It’s very common, and it happens in a variety of ways. When I was in one particular prison here in Arizona, every single night someone was getting raped. All night long, I heard male flesh pounding against male flesh, guys getting fucked up the ass. Anyone who couldn’t fight back was game. The rapists were the size of apes. They’d put the victim in a chokehold to make them unconscious. Regular guys—not homosexuals—were getting punked and were scared to admit it. I also saw big guys kissing little white boys on the lips and neck like they were women. Gang members would sometimes hold someone down and stick things in his ass—stuff like cans, soda bottles, shampoo bottles, broom handles, or metal shanks.

Shaun has told me that your Christian faith played a part in inspiring you to take action against rapists.

My belief in God gives me the divine power to do all things through His spirit. Some people say that God doesn’t hurt people and that I hurt those rapists on my own because I wanted to run things in prison, but I believe that God didn’t tell the rapists I encountered over the years to force themselves on young inmates just because they could. I never ran across the yard and jumped on people because of their behavior; I prayed, I talked to a lot of people on the yard who felt the same way I did, and I asked God for protection.

I’m not a Superman or someone special. God’s power is much stronger than mine, and His will will be done. Making rapists stop hurting other people was God pushing and guiding me. I didn’t win all of my fights with rapists—I almost lost my life more than once when I was stabbed and smashed in the skull with rocks in socks. I believe the only reason I’m alive is by God’s grace.

Yeah, I heard that you sustained quite a few injuries after sticking up for weaker inmates.

As well as being shanked and hit with rocks, I’ve hurt my hands a lot. I’ve been hit hard and had to take it easy for weeks until my body healed from blows and hits to the back of my head. I have several large scars, including one on my shoulder, where I was sliced open. I’ve hurt my feet, knees, elbows, fingers, and toes. I’ve had contract killings put out on me for being outspoken about issues that are common in the joint. I’ve been asked to leave yards. I’ve been locked down because certain people didn’t want me around. I’ve found notes in my cell saying my life is in danger.

How did you end up in prison in the first place?

When I got out of the Marines, I set myself up as a bodyguard, and the cash started rolling in. I invested in the cocaine business and got addicted to it. I’ve lost over 20 years of my life due to the dumb decisions I made on drugs. I’ve hurt my wife and children by putting myself in here. Every time I’ve been released, I’ve come straight back. I’m not making excuses for myself, but most prisoners have drug problems, and the prisons offer no help, drug counseling, or rehabilitation. The system is designed so that prisoners come right back, because it keeps the prison in business. That’s part of the reason why there are more black guys in prison throughout the entire USA than are in college and more than were held under slavery before slavery was abolished.

[Editor’s Note: Ivory Toldson, a professor at Howard University, says the conventional idea that there are more black men in prison than in college is a myth. According to his research, there are 1.4 million black men in college and 840,000 black men in prison.]

Why do you think the US prison system has such a high level of sexual assault compared with the prison systems of other nations?

It boils down to human nature—people don’t care about prisoners. Prison is a smaller version of what our society is like, with its extremes of power and poverty. There are laws in place to protect people in society, but in here, if a guy is forced to have sex, he has nowhere to turn, because if he tells the guards, he’s considered to be a rat, and that’s worse than being labeled a punk. Rats get killed in here. That’s why so much rape goes on, but no one reports it.

T-Bone with his granddaughter in Tucson prison

Do you think the prison system could do more to protect weaker inmates?

The prison system does nothing to protect weaker inmates. It’s a system that encourages evil.

There are a lot of racial politics within the US prison system—do you ever get any trouble for helping inmates of other races?

Yes, I’ve had to defend myself many times against gang members for helping inmates of other races. Here in Arizona’s prison system, blacks are a minority. I experience pure hatred because of the color of my skin. People seethe with vile contempt and want to kill me because I’m black, but I’m wearing the same clothes and doing the same time as them.

When I first came into the prison I’m currently in, glad to see a black man stop by, I said, “Hey, what’s up, brother?” He replied: “Some of the white boys here are mad at you for smashing some whites who were raping a youngster at another yard. They said that was white-boy business and you shouldn’t be interfering.”

“How many brothers are on this run?” I asked, referring to black inmates. “You’re looking at him,” was the reply. “I guess I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place then,” I said, wondering how best to defend myself.

Did they come after you?

Later that day, I was let out for a shower. Two whites approached me at the steps, making noise to attract my attention. Then, out of nowhere, another white inmate jumped on my back and put me in a strong chokehold—a precision attack. Another guy grabbed my legs and pulled me down. I tried to kick and pull, but someone laid across my legs and twisted my body to an angle that hurt my back. Another inmate held my arms down while lying across my middle. I could tell they’d done this before.

The first guy said, “Pull his pants down.”

They started to yank my pants down, and I couldn’t stop them. One produced a wooden broom handle shaped like a penis at the end. The sight of the phallus made me struggle with all my might, but I was pinned down too strong. Luckily, two Mexicans ran up the steps. One kicked the first guy in the face and I broke loose of the chokehold. He then spun around and stabbed a Mexican in the stomach. I leaned forward and hit the guy holding my legs down in the neck with my right hand. He tried to grab me, but I got a hold of his wrist, turned him over, pushed his arm up behind his back, dislocated his shoulder and snapped his wrist. I smashed his face into the pavement. I hit another guy in the esophagus, and he went down. Then 20 cops materialized out of nowhere.

Jesus. Finally, if you could change one thing about the US prison system, what would it be?

The prison system here has been set up not to allow God in. That needs to change, because God is love, and where there’s love, there’s peace.

Thanks to Shaun Attwood for putting me in touch with T-Bone. You can read about Shaun’s own prison experiences in his new book, Prison Time.

“In the past, no one would ever think of putting Martin Luther King Jr. on one of the dollar bills, but now since inflation is making the dollar more and more worthless, there’s really no reason not to because these things aren’t nearly worth as much anymore,” said Lord Snoot Rothschild, international banker and one of the chairmen of the board of the Federal Reserve.

“We need a dollar for the modern American so we’re imagining a twenty dollar bill with the face of Martin Luther King Jr. boldly featured, a five dollar bill with the face of Caesar Chavez, and a one dollar bill with America’s greatest hero Hulk Hogan,” said Fagan Rockefeller, another chairman on the board of the Federal Reserve as he dumps thousands of America’s old dollar bills into the roaring fire of his Connecticut home. “It’s not like you use those dollars anyways when you’ve got a mountain of gold stored in Sweden,” added Rockefeller.

“This Barrack Obama ten dollar bill will surely let them know that there is absolutely nothing to worry about. America is doing fine. Just check out the radnew colors on these dollars, “Rothschild cackled as he proceed to wipe his ass with what one can only assume was the fabled million dollar bill.","2014-11-15 00:00:00","0","30.0","18.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","59.0","38.0","0.0","164.0","7.0","22.0","6","257","90.26","57.71","7.72","39.70","28.56","19.46","80.16","47.47","7.78","3.50","0.00","0.78","0.78","1.56","0.39","4.28","10.12","14.40","6.61","5.45","4.67","2.33","10.51","4.67","3.50","0.78","3.89","2.33","3.11","1.95","1.17","0.39","0.00","0.39","5.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.33","10.12","2.72","2.33","1.17","0.78","1.95","1.95","2.33","0.78","0.78","0.78","1.56","1.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.28","0.78","0.00","2.72","0.78","0.00","3.50","6.61","0.39","10.51","1.17","3.89","5.45","1.56","0.00","0.39","9.34","0.39","0.00","1.17","0.39","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.39","14.40","3.50","4.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.11","3.11","0.00","0.00","1192","8.19","37.857142857142854","365","257","9","59.37","12.1","12.1","10.91","15.5","51","15.833333333333334","21.37774319066148","161","31.0","0","0.45","0","6","6","33","0","36","12","2","1","4","43","34","1","9","0","0","9","2","14","1","0","1","4","0","9","10","6","3","9","7","0","1","0","1"

"http://viralactions.com/retired-army-general-says-the-mike-brown-shooting-was-staged-martial-law-is-coming-video/","Retired Army General Says The Mike Brown Shooting Was Staged & Martial Law Is Coming (VIDEO)","In the video he explains the dangers that are coming to America and that if we don’t change things at the ballot box we will have to go to the bullet box. He seems like a pretty patriotic guy in this video. Hey says we have the right to get rid of our current government.

Here are some of his important quotes from the speech.

“contractors are going to come in – maybe me.” –

“They’re going to kill you. That person sitting next to you won’t be sitting there because they’re going to be gone because somebody like me is going to come in and kill you. ”

“The new constitution is all ready to go. They only need the right incident to bring it down and they’re working on that right now. We’re not very far away from an event that’s going to bring what you call, martial law, that term will never be used by the way Emergency Police Powers will be.”

During the speech he said he still carries a secret clearance and had just left Fort Leonard Wood (military base in the Missouri Ozarks). He said he gets briefed every six months.

Here’s some more quotes.

“The news media is going to start banging on something – could be Ukraine, could be we don’t know. That’s how psychological warfare works. They talk about THIS and this is happening over here. It’s called a distraction.”

“So number one is – there’s going to be an emphasis on an international event – the news media is going to pound it, pound it, pound it. The second thing is you’re going to see a group or a person guilty of racism or something along those lines and they’re going to start pounding on that. They want your attention over here. The third thing you’re going to start seeing is people will be arrested for domestic terrorism. The fourth thing you’re going to see and this is what I’m going to talk to the ladies about – it’s what I call ancient hate, ancient madness, ancient revenge. When these things start to happen, people are going to start rioting. The EBT cards are going to shut down. Can you imagine what’s going to happen in St Louis County when the EBT cards go down, when the ATM machines don’t work?”

“When the inner cities start to erupt, people are going to start killing people they don’t like”.

“Right now in the United States, most Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs and Lieutenants and above will go to the FBI academy. When they go to the FBI academy, they come back brainwashed for some reason. Now I know that the St. Louis County police has that policy, I do not know about the rest of them but every Sheriff will go to the FBI academy.”

“Incidentally, there is a movie out with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, it’s called Escape…that boat exists. It’s real. That boat does exist. I’m telling you for a fact.”

“So I have to get permission from the Army to do this. I’m theirs, they own me.”

Okay so how does a “patriot” go from telling the truth about what’s going to come to actually being a part of the event he said was coming to America! Now for the record, I have found out that Dan Page did tell everybody after that speech that he was going to work for law enforcement and it’s probably safe to assume that he lived in the St. Louis area since the speech he gave to the oath keepers was in the St. Louis area and by his own admission he was checking in with Fort Leonard Wood which is in the Missouri Ozarks. So that’s not a huge deal.

But what is a HUGE deal is when Dan Page tells us exactly what is going to happen in 2012 and then is a part of it all in 2014! He tells us in the speech that he still checks in with Fort Leonard Wood for a briefing every six months and he still has an active secret clearance! That’s not typical of a person that is retired at all. You don’t just go back to your base and get briefings after you retire! He even says at the speech that they “own him”. He had to get the okay for him to speak to them. Why would somebody that is “retired” say that because you’re free to speak to anybody you want when you retire.

He’s involved in the CNN psyop that looks totally staged! How did he go from being a “good guy” to part of the “bad guys”? Did he go to the FBI academy after 2012 that he admitted that for some reason everybody came back brainwashed? And in the last video on this page, Dan admits that he worked in special forces and his specialty was psychological warfare (at about the 16:30 mark of the speech video) where he learned how to destroy a nation from within without direct military contact! What are the odds of this? Was he going back to his base at Fort Leonard Wood every six months to reinforce his brainwashing?

I believe this is VERY important information! Was Dan Page completely mind controlled at the FBI Academy or through Fort Leonard Wood? I don’t know what this all means but what does seem absolutely clear is that the Ferguson event is a STAGED event and Dan Page knew all about something just like this that would come. How did he know this unless he had access to their plans? He seems to be following the script he talked about in 2012! That’s the big deal here as well as his background in psychological warfare.

Video that ties Dan Page the “patriot” to the Cop Part of the CNN Psyop. This is a MUST SEE! There’s no doubt this is the same man! Same voice, and Dan admitted he was going to be a law enforcement officer and he was from the area!

This is a RED ALERT! Get this post out to everybody through social networks and email lists. I don’t believe in coincidences such as one of the main players at Ferguson being trained in Psychological Warfare and admitting there was major brainwashing going on in the police departments and then being part of it all! Who knows if Michael Brown was mind controlled to get aggressive with a cop or if they just were waiting for a white cop to kill a black kid before they sprang into action. It really doesn’t matter at this point because we now have the proof that this entire thing was scripted and they want to start using “Emergency Police Powers” everywhere! Dan Page told us EXACTLY what was going to happen in 2014 back in 2012! He even mentioned that “Ukraine” could be used as one of the two events as well as a racial event! They are using Ukraine and ISIS now as the other event Dan talked about in the speech to the Oath Keepers and Ferguson is being used as the racial event!

Here’s the interview with Dan Page where I found out that he specialized in Psychological Warfare and Asymmetrical Warfare which is “how to destroy a nation from within without direct military contact.” You’ll hear that at about the 16:30 mark in this video. Get the word out everywhere so everybody knows that Ferguson is a staged event! They are following the exact script that Dan Page talked about in 2012!","2014-08-22 00:00:00","0","50.0","27.0","3.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","61.0","38.0","0.0","165.0","7.0","24.0","6","1261","61.27","83.93","25.93","19.83","16.59","12.93","85.41","56.62","15.70","7.77","1.19","0.79","1.35","3.09","1.35","7.93","7.69","15.23","10.55","6.19","5.63","1.35","21.49","2.93","1.51","2.38","1.67","1.82","2.85","1.19","1.59","0.24","1.19","0.00","11.90","0.00","0.40","0.08","3.41","9.91","2.46","1.82","1.03","2.06","2.30","1.59","2.70","1.27","1.43","0.00","0.40","0.32","0.08","0.00","0.00","6.26","0.95","0.48","3.65","0.79","0.40","3.57","14.20","2.93","16.02","4.04","7.38","4.92","2.54","0.71","0.08","0.16","0.00","0.79","0.56","0.00","0.08","0.24","0.16","0.00","14.12","4.04","1.51","0.16","0.00","0.56","1.51","0.00","2.85","3.17","0.32","0.00","5271","6.06","20.0","1607","1265","75","79.7","9.0","6.3","7.6","7.4","127","6.142857142857143","12.775810276679842","439","17.51","32","0.55","0","35","18","134","0","158","66","0","1","11","144","119","2","34","0","0","104","10","58","1","0","6","61","0","68","41","50","17","60","61","11","11","0","16"

"http://viralactions.com/barack-obama-to-declare-cuba-51st-state-in-2016/","Barack Obama To Declare Cuba 51st State In 2016","In a surprise move today U.S. President Barak Obama made a declaration that sent shockwaves down both sides of the House and Senate floor. “It may take my final two years in office, but make no mistake: Cuba will be our 51st state,” Obama said.

Obama cites one reason for incorporating the island nation: “We need another vacation state.”

Below: U.S. flag redesign compositions to reflect all 51 states

“The tyranny of Fidel Castro can be overlooked now that he has stepped down, and we can take this opportunity to grow our borders for the betterment of our domestic travel options,” the president said. “Hawaii has played itself out. As beautiful as it is, we’ve all been there, done that. We don’t have another domestic tropical island where we can vacation without a passport. We need another. And Cuba is it.”

Currently Americans are not allowed to travel to Cuba; however, if the country does become a part of the United States, Americans will be able to visit the lush Caribbean island restriction free.

Estaban Arnaz, spokesman for Cuba’s president Raul Castro, when asked about becoming part of the United States, said simply, “We’re in.”

“This is yet another attempt by the president to abuse his executive power,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) told reporters, acknowledging that, in fact “the way the president has been able to bend the rules thus far, I wouldn’t be surprised if this actually happens, but in the end, do I care? F*ck no. I’ve never been to Cuba. I’m excited to check it out.”

Although a 51 star flag design is still in the works, the cost of changing the American flag to show 51 stars will be passed on to American workers, in what’s being called “The Star Tax.” FICA deductions will increase 2% beginning in March 2016.

Control, which is headquartered in Atlanta, has released a statement saying the trial vaccine for the deadly Ebola virus will only work on those with white skin.

In an excerpt from the statement, the government agency stated, “Early tests of an experimental drug, which would effectively combat the spread of Ebola, have proved successful only in those with white skin — We are working diligently to improve the sample to be able to help all those who are in need.”

The vaccine, which was developed by ThomasSmithCharles in conjunction with the BIP, has began a trial phase. The vaccine uses a strain of a West Nile monkey cold virus called ape multivirus type 5 to deliver benign genetic material of the West African strain of Ebola. The genetic material given to the patient is not able to replicate and poses virtually no health risk. The sample instead strengthens the immune system to fight off the virus. If successful, ape multivirus type 5 could stop the spread of Ebola.

According to the CDC, the trial was doled out 200 people, but only proved effective to those with white skin. Some scientists believe high levels of melanin may somehow be affecting the sample.

Many citizens voiced concern when two white Americans were flown to Emory Hospital in Atlanta and were cured of the deadly disease, while 1,000’s in Africa continue to die. Conspiracy theorists believe the American Government has a cure for the disease, but has no plans to dole it out to Africans.

A Twitter member, who goes by @Sidney_Bingham wrote, “Ebola was a incurable disease when it was killing Africans by the hundreds but now that 2 white people have it suddenly there’s a cure.”

User @J_Nuclear wrote, “Ebola death camps in Africa…..now when white people start getting it all of a sudden an experimental cure comes out.”

With the disease seeming to only work on those with white skin, the conspiracy theorists certainly have been provided with more fodder for their beliefs.

Original air date: November 14 , 2014

Excerpt from Sheldon Richman’s “The Political Sterility of John Stewart” as featured on Reason.com…

Throughout history, satirists have risked their liberty and even their lives using humor to engage in deep commentary about the reigning political system and its exalted political figures—they’re called leaders, though surely better terms are rulers and misleaders. But no satirist risks his life or liberty in America today, which makes the scarcity of good satire so puzzling. Is it fear that keeps it safely limited? Or is it simply that so few people today can see the fundamental flaws in the American political system, which trashes liberty in so many ways?

"https://libertytalk.fm/california-county-to-vote-to-secede-june/","California County to Secede? Interview with Anthony Intiso","Anthony Intiso, of the Jefferson Republic is leading a constitutional initiative for residents of Siskiyou County to vote to secede from the state of California this June. However, unlike other initiatives both across the country and within, such as “Six Californias” spearheaded by Tim Draper, the Jefferson Republic referendum seeks not to form a state, but a new sovereign nation. Whereas forming a new state requires permission from the legislatures of all states involved and the federal government, Mr. Intiso’s efforts have utilized the accepted legal mechanism regarding formation of an independent sovereign territory to the point that the residents will literally decide whether to declare independence from both the Golden State and crumbling American empire.

Not surprisingly, with such a revolutionary act mere months away from a vote, Mr. Intiso and his effort are gathering local/regional media attention. In addition, well-known Liberty Movement singer/songwriter, Jordan Page will be holding a concert, appropriately dubbed “The Liberty Concert” in support of the Jefferson Republic on March 22, 2014, tickets are $20.00.

According to Retired Major Todd Pierce , under the National Defense Authorization Act [read: NDAA] , America is already under martial law, so what does that mean, exactly for the average American? Major Todd Pierce joins Robin Koerner to share just what he has learned during his time providing defense counsel to Guantanamo detainees.

Motivated by the outrageous legal opinions that helped to justify the take-down of civil rights during the Bush Administration following the September Eleventh Attacks, Major Todd Pierce volunteered to provide defense counsel to Guantanamo detainees. Through his extensive work Retired Major Pierce has closely studied precedent in martial law, which now applies to civilians following passage of the NDAA of 2012. He has a front-row seat on how the government abuses martial law for its own purposes, and Major Pierce tells us how the US government has created a whole new legal paradigm called “domestic martial common law” to similarly justify, well, just about anything in the name of “National Security.”

Militarized Police Departments Front Line of Tyranny.

Emmy Award-winning investigative journalist, Ben Swann joins Robin to discuss the root of militarized police departments. Through his research via the Truth in Media project, Ben outlines “The 1033 Program” a.k.a. “Department of Defense Excess Property Program” that is a federal grant scheme, to wit provides the mechanism in which the D.O.D. gifts surplus and military equipment recently used on the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan to county sheriffs and local police departments. As such, it is through the 1033 Program in which local law enforcement such as those in Washington, Iowa and Concord, New Hampshire to highlight just two, receive fully armored military-grade vehicles designed for warzones such as MRAPs and Bearcats. However, excess ground vehicles are only a portion of 1033, the program also sends police departments such as Los Angles military-grade aircraft, whose use is justified as needed to combat the never-ending and now literal “war” on drugs.

40,000 times a year SWAT teams are carrying out military style raids in order to serve drug warrants.

Moreover, the absurd equipment dispersed to local police is only part of the equation, as the normalization of transforming police officers into combat ready soldiers in conjunction with a change in traditional civilian law enforcement rules-of-engagement from “Protect and Serve”, to those used in war, “Eliminate All Threats”, presents a less visible but greater danger to Liberty.

Further, Ben indicates while the mainstream media has highlighted militarized police with tabloid-like fanfare regarding the outrageous acquisition of equipment, old media editorial pages have had almost nothing to say regarding the implementation of military-style tactics and raids whose casualties include innocent children and are far too often executed upon the wrong address. Thus, the threat to liberty presented by militarized police departments will require a multipronged approach to mitigate this burgeoning problem plaguing the streets of America, which can arguably be stated is far more pressing than the STATE desire to prosecute narcotics.

Reform or Abolish the Electoral College?

In recent years, specifically following the debacle of Bush -v- Gore in the year 2000, a group is clamoring to see that the institution known as the Electoral College be abolished and the country be moved to a national popular vote . Such a call harkens back to the early years of the Twentieth Century, when so-called progressives backed by big bankers extolled the virtues of “Direct Democracy” under the guise that such reform would bring the people closer to their government. As such, progressives cried victory with the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, resulting in the direct election of U.S. Senators and the death of the final check upon an unrestrained federal government. However, not only did this enable the knee-jerk reaction forewarned by James Madison in Federalist Papers No. 62 and No. 63 , it abolished in its entirety the threat of recall. Further studies have shown, that in unchaining U.S. Senators from the inhabitants of their states, they became career politicians, easier to corrupt, consolidated the power of political parties , and led to become beholden to special interests through the need of big-money financiers’ for statewide campaigns.

Now nearly one-hundred years later, a new generation of progressives seek to homogenize U.S. elections further via the creation of a National election, whereby the electoral votes of all states will be chained to the National Popular vote. Thus, if California votes for the Democratic Candidate, but the Republican nominee has a greater popular vote total nationally, California’s electoral votes are given to the Republican. Moreover, the group is not content to merely overturn the will of a state and discount entire populations of small-town and rural dwelling Americans; they also seek to provide the Lobbyists and the Political Class direct sway over the election by elevating the power of Washington D.C.’s consolidated urban population.

Can the Electoral College be Reformed to become More Representative?

In contrast to the neo-progressive agenda to centralize the Presidential election into a one-size-fits-all version of SImple Majority Rule and Minority opinion be damned, Steven Nielson sits down with Robin to discuss how decentralizing the Electoral College not only from those who seek an end to differing regional sentiments, but also the at the state level. Such a plan would thereby allow the popular vote in each Congressional District to determine the specified allotment of electoral votes. Thus not only welcoming the diversity of varying opinions in urban centers that traditionally lean Democratic such as Los Angeles, but also affording a chance for rural voters to have their voices not drowned out by the homogenized disenfranchising winner-take-all system currently in place. Further, decentralizing the Electoral College increases the chance of having a third-party candidate’s voice included in the discussion.","2014-12-30 21:05:29","0","5.0","19.0","2.0","0.0","1.0","2.0","29.0","14.0","0.0","61.0","8.0","0.0","5","502","98.40","50.80","23.84","67.20","31.38","31.47","71.91","42.03","2.79","1.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.00","1.79","11.95","14.94","3.98","4.38","4.58","1.39","6.57","6.57","2.39","0.60","3.19","2.19","4.18","3.19","1.00","0.40","0.60","0.20","4.38","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.00","8.57","1.20","1.99","0.80","1.20","1.39","2.59","0.80","0.20","0.60","0.00","0.20","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.77","1.20","1.00","4.78","0.60","0.20","1.79","4.78","0.60","13.75","1.20","8.96","3.78","3.78","0.60","0.00","0.80","0.00","0.40","0.40","0.20","0.20","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.73","5.18","4.78","0.20","0.20","0.40","0.00","3.78","0.40","0.80","0.00","1.00","2512","9.62","27.444444444444443","808","474","21","40.08","15.2","13.3","14.74","15.6","146","15.5","23.360675105485235","285","23.89","10","0.43","1","12","10","67","0","56","45","1","0","5","69","63","3","30","2","0","3","4","25","2","0","2","20","0","20","9","12","13","9","8","1","1","0","2"

Do bills that establish “Universal Background Checks” – like I-594, set to be voted on this year in Washington state – really do just that, or do they also serve as a tool to enable future confiscation of firearms? Do background checks prevent crime or merely stymie peaceful gun owners; if not, why are government officials at both federal and state levels calling for their wider use?

Some of which have even been called racist by critics in the past. However, if anyone ever had any doubts whether or not Iggy Azalea was a race hater, Iggy went and confirmed it for them with various disturbing tweets after being criticized for not supporting the protestors in Ferguson and New York City. Also, several reports have been released stating that Azalea is “from Australia” and that Australia is “crazy racist.”

“I don’t know what you were thanking, I’m Australian,” she tweeted. She followed that tweet with “curse I am. My people were the rapists and murderers Britain didn’t want,” and “you expect an Ozzie to be respectful we had a law not to feed the black folks.” “When black people started getting all hungry for rights, we just rifled therm.”

Several other tweets followed such as, “we wouldn’t allow anybody but whites in Queensland” and “we took mixed chilrdren from they paren ts.”

Then, she hit everyone with the shocker.

However, black leaders along with civil rights activists in general, while not surprised to hear that a blond-haired Australian girl is also a racist, were surprised that so many people support her music career, follow her on twitter, and even look to hear her opinions on racial matters.

Stiviano On A Racist Tirade: ‘I don’t understand black people’ – 20minutenews","Well if this isn’t the pot calling the kettle anti-black.

V. Stiviano, who secretly recorded NBA owner Donald Sterling’s slurs against African-Americans, made a few of her own in two videos made public Saturday by TMZ.com.

“I don’t understand black people,” the 31-year-old model snaps in one clip. “The minute you give them a little bit of money, they don’t know what to do with it.

“They just act crazy. … They’re like, ‘Yo, I wanna put some rims on top of my rims. And my rims are gonna turn around, so I’m gonna call them — what? Spinners.’”

Stiviano, caught on camera during the shooting of a 2011 reality show pilot about gold-diggers, wasn’t finished sounding like Sterling.

“They do stupid s— like that, when there’s people starving around the world,” she announces. “That’s what people want to do with their money?”

In the second clip, Stiviano is riding shotgun while holding an Elmo doll as an African-American friend drives.

Speaking to the stuffed Muppet, Stiviano cracks, “We don’t like black people.”

She is black and Mexican.

Stiviano’s taped conversation with the 80-year-old Sterling turned the Los Angeles Clippers owner into a pariah, leading to a lifetime ban from the NBA and the forced sale of his team. The billionaire real estate mogul was also fined $2.5 million.

Sterling, in yet another secretly taped conversation, claimed his vile remarks were his version of sweet talk as he tried to bed the decades-younger Stiviano.

Stiviano claimed that she never slept with Sterling despite the gifts that he lavished upon her — including $500,000 in luxury cars and a $1.8 million Los Angeles duplex.

Sterling’s wife cut a deal last week to sell the Clippers for $2 billion, but lawyers filed suit on behalf of her litigious husband to fight the sale in court.

Sterling’s lawsuit against the league also seeks to overturn his suspension from the sport, although an NBA lawyer dismissed the move as “entirely baseless.”

Spouse Shelly Sterling seized control of her husband’s enormous holdings after Donald Sterling was branded “mentally incapacitated” by two neurologists who diagnosed him with dementia.

The other 29 NBA owners, who were initially expected to vote this week on whether to oust Sterling, will instead decide on the proposed purchase by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver scheduled a Wednesday meeting with civil rights leaders to discuss the sale of the Clippers and other issues, said the Rev. Al Sharpton.","2014-05-31 00:00:00","0","41.0","18.0","3.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","65.0","40.0","0.0","168.0","7.0","26.0","6","418","91.86","77.80","9.58","18.70","16.72","24.16","71.05","42.34","10.29","6.46","1.20","0.24","0.24","3.35","1.44","3.83","8.61","14.35","5.02","3.11","4.07","1.44","10.05","2.63","2.39","1.91","4.07","1.20","1.91","0.72","1.20","0.00","0.72","0.00","12.92","0.96","0.24","1.91","2.15","6.70","0.96","1.20","0.96","0.48","0.48","3.11","2.87","1.44","0.96","0.24","1.20","0.24","0.48","0.00","0.48","6.46","2.39","1.20","3.59","0.24","0.00","3.35","5.74","1.20","12.20","2.39","4.55","5.26","2.15","0.72","0.48","1.67","0.00","0.00","1.20","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.24","0.00","22.73","5.98","5.50","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.00","2.15","3.83","3.83","0.00","0.96","1964","8.02","21.7","573","410","23","70.33","9.5","7.9","12.06","11.6","91","5.928571428571429","17.998048780487807","266","20.5","11","0.41","0","6","17","42","0","54","36","1","0","1","68","48","2","23","0","0","18","11","15","0","0","1","11","0","12","23","8","8","14","7","0","6","0","1"
"http://20minutenews.com/watch-ignorant-mississippi-folks-explain-why-they-hate-obama-video/","WATCH: Ignorant Mississippi Folks Explain Why They Hate Obama (Video) – 20minutenews","Why are so many white, poor, rural men conservative, even though liberal policies would help them?

And why do they hate President Barack Obama so much?

Scroll Down for Video…

These questions have baffled liberals for ages. In 2012, Bill Maher sent documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi out to ask them. She went to a rural part of Mississippi — the poorest and most conservative state in the Union — and talked with some white guys of varying ages and income levels.



What these southern men have to say might not surprise you, but you’ve got to give them props for being so affable and upfront with the daughter of Rep. Nancy “Devil Woman” Pelosi (D-Calif.)



Most striking is how even the least fortunate of these men stoically accepts his economic fate, and how deeply and sincerely these men cherish their beliefs — which seem so grim, heartless, and unappealing to the rest of us.Watch these white, rural men explain why they’re so conservative.White, conservative men explain why they hate Obama:

“One thing, he’s named ‘Obama’”

“This is America. Our president should be American. Not Muslim.”

Why they hate Obamacare even though they need healthcare:

I hate Obamacare. It’s retarded.

Back when i was growing up, and my parents were growing up, and my grandparents were growing up, we didn’t have all that and people still made it. And back then, people pulled their own weight, they didn’t sit around waiting for everyone else to take care of them.

Why they don’t want the government to fix the economy:

It’ll take care of itself. You put God in the saddle, it’ll all be okay.

Why they vote Republican even though it hasn’t worked for them:

But it COULD [work]. It hasn’t, but it could.

We would rather go broke and die hungry than to give up our moral beliefs.

Pelosi’s most baffling exchange was with a chatty, tooth-challenged man who said, “I don’t care for the government.” When an astonished Pelosi reminded him that he’s on food stamps, the man replied:

“Yeah, but I think I deserve food stamps. I have no employment.”

Since 51 percent of people in the state of Mississippi are female, and 37 percent are African American (according to the U.S. Census), we wish Pelosi had also talked with some women and blacks. Nonetheless, Pelosi’s interviews shed a fascinating light on how these white, male conservatives think.","2014-07-27 00:00:00","0","45.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","2.0","65.0","40.0","0.0","169.0","7.0","34.0","6","401","30.40","83.46","10.48","21.92","16.71","17.96","82.79","50.37","14.71","8.98","2.00","1.50","0.75","1.25","3.49","5.74","3.99","10.72","9.23","7.73","8.48","2.24","19.45","3.49","1.50","3.74","1.00","3.24","4.74","2.24","2.49","0.00","1.25","0.50","15.96","0.75","0.25","1.25","3.74","13.47","2.24","2.99","2.24","2.00","0.75","3.99","2.74","2.00","0.50","0.25","1.25","0.25","0.00","0.00","1.00","7.23","2.49","0.75","3.49","0.75","0.00","4.49","11.22","1.50","8.73","2.00","4.74","2.49","3.24","0.75","0.00","1.75","1.50","0.25","0.75","0.25","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.00","23.69","6.73","6.48","1.25","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.50","2.74","3.99","1.00","0.50","1831","7.23","21.94736842105263","534","400","25","80.62","10.0","6.0","10.96","9.7","71","7.833333333333334","15.5","241","18.95","9","0.49","0","19","4","28","0","34","35","0","3","5","38","37","0","28","0","0","38","7","25","0","1","3","9","1","15","19","7","6","31","9","1","2","0","12"

New Evidence Emerges… – 20minutenews","On September 13th 1996, American rapper 2pac Shakur was pronounced as being fatally killed by a series of gunshot wounds. Despite this, there is much surrounding his ‘death’ that doesn’t add up. Now you’re probably reading this thinking, this has got to be one of those whacked out ‘conspiracy theories’ going against everything ever officially reported, if he was alive we would know for certain, right? I initially thought the same seeing such claims too. It wasn’t long however, before I found myself uncovering much more about his supposed death and the circumstances situated around it that made be begin to think otherwise. I began to realise that actually, such claims that 2pac may have faked his own death and is still alive may have more truths to them than what first appears, as it is evident that there is more to this story than what was ever officially reported..

It all began a couple years ago when I was on Youtube listening to 2pac and some of his songs. On the sidebar I saw a link titled “2PAC ALIVE 2014 RETURN – MUST WATCH!!”. Of course I thought, another stereotypical video discrediting people questioning real conspiracies and cover-ups. Being a huge 2pac fan I couldn’t help but take an interest in seeing what these people were claiming and so clicked the video anyway. What I saw next could not have surprised me more, as it was suggesting the last known photo of 2pac alive the night he had allegedly been shot, was fake!

Another strong piece of evidence made against the photo is a picture snapped of 2pac and Suge Knight earlier. The night 2pac was ‘killed’, he was at the MGM strip in Las Vegas to see a Mike Tyson boxing match. Interestingly if you look at the picture seen below you will notice something doesn’t add up. It is very obvious if you examine the facial hair on 2pac’s chin, you can see that in the picture where he is in the car his beard is much longer!

Pictured above on the left is the photo in its original form. What stands out about it most is that there are no keys in the ignition! This can be seen clearly from the close up picture to the right. It was reported that this photo was allowed to be taken by paparazzi while 2pac and his manager Suge Knight were waiting at traffic lights. With this in mind, it isn’t possible that the car would have been able to take off without any keys.

Finally, if you didn’t think that was enough, this last piece of evidence against the ‘final’ photo is BY FAR the most compelling as it is quite clear that the photo of 2pac seen is actually his military portrait. Below you can see that this photo has been overlayed on top of the photo where he is seen in the car and is faded out gradually. The results are a perfect match..

If you look at his eyes throughout each frame they remain the same while the lighting changes..

This got me thinking, why on earth would somebody go to the trouble and effort to fake the last photo of 2pac being alive? There would have to be a reason for it, and so lead me to investigate further in finding out what else really happened that night. It turns out there were a number of things out of the ordinary. It was very strange for 2pac not to be wearing his bullet-proof vest as after less than a year earlier, 2pac had survived a point blank shooting in New York. It was because of this he was always seen to be wearing one. According to his cousin, Jamal Lesane: “Normally he wouldn’t leave without it, but this time he left it behind and didn’t have it with him.” E.D.I also claims that night Kastro told 2pac he should put his vest on, but replied “It’s too hot tonight.” Before the alleged shooting that would become known as the fatal night 2pac died, he and his camaraderie of Outlawz and bodyguards made their way across the Vegas strip to a mansion belonging to Suge Knight. According to members of The Outlawz, Suge and 2pac unexpectedly disappeared briefly while the others waited patiently. “I don’t really know what Pac or Suge was doing at the time, I just knew we was waiting and I was ready to go.” Reportedly after about half an hour, with 2pac and the others now ready to leave for a show at club 662, 2pac made an unusual request to his bodyguard, Frank Alexander. “I was walking to the car with Suge and Pac when I was opening up the door to get in the backseat. Then Pac stopped me and said no take the keys and go drive the Lexus with the Outlawz, we’re going to be drinking and you’re going to be the designated driver to drive us back after we’ve finished parting.” This was even more out of the ordinary as 2pac would never go anywhere in public without at least one of his bodyguards for his safety. Given such abnormal circumstances, what happened later involving his ‘death’, was was either very convenient, or a total coincidence.. The story officially reported of 2pac’s death is of he and Suge waiting at more traffic lights along the MGM strip, when a white Cadillac was seen pulling up next to them and began firing shots into their BMW. Frank Alexander was in the Lexus behind 2pac and described the scene as he saw it. “After the Cadillac shot into the car I thought they were dead, my reaction was to run up to the car, but instead the car sped up and took off.” The BMW went onto makes a hard right u-turn and race off in the opposite direction. “I didn’t know what to think, it was a faulk, it was a haze. Were these real bullets? Did they really shoot these guys?..” Frank also made mention that some of the other cars containing security went in pursuit of the white Cadillac, although failed to catch up to it and identify the vehicle plate. To this day nobody knows who killed 2pac and the case remains an unsolved murder. The events that followed suit involved 2pac being rushed to hospital, although the details as to how he arrived and by whom are uncertain due to three different scenarios being relayed by different accounts. According to media 2pac and Suge were found in the BMW with all four tires blown out. An ambulance also apparently arrived on scene shortly after and was said to have rushed 2pac to hospital. Suge describes a different series of events, claiming in an interview he drove 2pac to the hospital himself, he then however is oddly seen changing his story to coincide with that of official media reports! The third and final account is that of a by-stander still on scene when asked on camera what she had just witnessed. VIDEO: “We were pretty far down the street when it happened, we didn’t know if we heard gunshots, we didn’t know exactly what we heard, we heard a lot of screaming and car screeching. We ran up the street as cops were running past us and by the time we got here they were already taking which now I found out is 2pac into the helicopter away.”

Did this person say something she wasn’t supposed to? .. Afterwards nobody else on the scene was further asked for questioning and reports continued to detail 2pac being met by an ambulance at the scene of the broken down BMW.

How much more bizarre could this night get? .. Well as it turns out things were only beginning to get stranger.

Pictured above on the left is a picture of the crime scene where the BMW came to its end. The damage to the rims can be seen from the blown out tires. Pictured to the right is news footage showing investigators examining the supposed car 2pac and Suge were in. Here’s where it gets weird, if you look at the wheels of both cars neither match up.

When both cars are seen from another angle it is unmistakable that these are two totally different vehicles! This begs the question, why was this second car being examined and why was it on the scene??","2014-11-13 00:00:00","0","9.0","11.0","3.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","37.0","32.0","0.0","92.0","5.0","1.0","1","1413","70.52","57.58","47.77","23.55","21.74","16.91","84.71","55.48","13.59","6.51","1.63","0.99","0.78","2.55","0.57","7.08","7.86","15.29","9.84","5.02","5.94","1.70","18.83","5.24","3.33","2.05","0.92","2.55","1.98","0.92","1.06","0.07","0.28","0.07","7.43","0.07","0.07","0.14","2.69","11.75","2.41","1.49","1.56","2.48","1.34","3.96","4.46","3.61","0.71","0.14","1.27","0.57","0.64","0.00","0.07","5.38","1.49","0.50","2.26","1.13","0.35","8.99","7.50","0.64","16.77","3.11","8.28","5.52","1.13","0.57","0.07","0.28","0.00","1.27","0.21","0.00","0.07","0.00","0.07","0.07","12.67","4.60","3.26","0.14","0.00","0.57","0.50","0.28","1.49","1.84","0.00","0.00","6060","6.93","23.866666666666667","1877","1406","65","74.93","10.5","8.2","8.53","10.3","198","8.9","16.273001422475108","556","21.37","34","0.53","0","44","40","150","0","170","78","5","1","16","169","66","0","52","1","0","98","22","84","7","2","20","49","0","54","93","50","52","32","41","4","13","0","14"

"http://20minutenews.com/kerry-washington-quits-scandal-after-cheating-rumors/","Kerry Washington Quits Scandal After Cheating Rumors – 20minutenews","HOLLYWOOD, CA– In one of the most shocking situations recently in Hollywood, Kerry Washington, who recently gave birth to Isabelle Amarachi Asomugha with husband and former NFL player Nnamdi Asomugha, has quit the hit show Scandal amid cheating rumors.

Washington has been the center of several rumors involving her daughter, and if the baby is truly her husbands. Their has been speculation that Nnamdi Asomugha took a paternity test following the birth of their child, fearing that his daughter is a direct result of adultery.

Since 2012, Washington has starred in the ABC drama Scandal, a Shonda Rhimes series in which Washington plays Olivia Pope, a crisis management expert to the President.

“I don’t understand how Kerry could go from this wholesome actress playing this virtuous feminine role, to being engulfed in these unfortunate allegations.” Show creator Shonda Rhimes said during a press conference Thursday evening. “Although this is a terrible situation, I am proud of Kerry for having the courage in stepping down from her role, but we are going to have a tough task finding a replacement who can bring more class and righteousness to this beloved character.”

Tough task indeed.

Kerry Washington’s close friend, who goes by the name R. Polanski, recently confirmed to the media that the star will not be returning to the show. Citing reasons of “moral disappointment, shame, dishonor and disgrace” within herself; attributes of which she stated she previously never came in touch with, in or out of her roles.

In 2013, Washington gained wide public recognition for her role and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television series.

Big shoes to fill.

So one can see why there are all sorts of scrambling within the production team to find a suitable replacement. Talking heads in Hollywood have thrown out names from Nia Long (The Best Man Holiday, Love Jones) to Gabrielle Union (Being Mary Jane, Think Like A Man Too).

Lets just hope for the best.

"http://20minutenews.com/lol-drunk-sarah-palin-gives-speech-on-impeaching-obamavideo/","LOL: Drunk Sarah Palin Gives Speech On Impeaching Obama(VIDEO) – 20minutenews","At the Western Conservative Summit this last week, Sarah Palin drunkenly doubled down on her calls for impeachment after a string of word soup tailored together from past conservative talking points. Am I being critical of Palin’s intelligence while she stumbles through this 30 minutes speech by calling her “drunken”? No. I do believe that Palin is 99% moron, but this one appears to be a moron that had a few too many to drink that evening before they got up for their speaking engagement.



The speech seemed to have been written by some neo-libertarian tribute to Ayn Rand by offering a protagonist “the forgotten man”. Her speech didn’t ever cover one issue, but instead turned Tea Party talking points into a macabre poetry slam competition. Palin says absolutely nothing of substance in her speech aside from her general feelings about society and her hatred of the other side of politics.

The only thing that seems certain in Palin’s world is that Obama is evil and facts are relative. Her drive towards impeachment in the drunken speech strings together random accusations as public facts (most of which have been debunked). Palin even mentions the 2008 “loophole” signed by former President Bush to give refugee status to children as a reason to impeach Obama. Because she is just that dumb… and most likely drunk.This video is 30 minutes of “are you fucking kidding me?” that is only topped off by the introduction to Palin which labels her as the “most influential woman in the history of the republican party”. That doesn’t help the republicans in their defense of the “war on women” at all.

"http://20minutenews.com/secret-to-sell-your-soul-to-satan-is-revealed/","Secret To Sell Your Soul To Satan is Revealed – 20minutenews","You can have power, wealth, an attractive mate and virtually anything else you ever dreamed of – by selling your soul to Satan! But how?

You must know what you’re doing when you make the deal or Satan will cheat you blind. That’s the word from Dr. Rex Touth, expert on satanic rituals and author of How to Negotiate Unholy Contracts.

Dr. Touth cites cases dating all the way back to the 16th century in which humans have agreed to spend eternity in Hell when they die in exchange for earthly pleasures while they’re alive.

“Human history and world literature are teeming with stories like that of Germany’s Dr. Faustus who sold his soul,” says Dr. Touth. “Our own American statesman Daniel Webster once debated Satan in a landmark soul-selling case in which he renegotiated the contract and had it overturned.

“Thousands have gained riches and fulfilled their fantasies.”

Here are some tips from Dr. Touth on how you can take advantage of the same opportunity:

1. SET THE DEAL UP PROPERLY. There’s a right and wrong way to make contact with the Devil. The right way is to be alone in your room, close your eyes and say, “Satan, I summon you. I have a quality soul to sell if the price is right.” It may take dozens, even hundreds of tries but at all costs, avoid sounding desperate or needy. He’ll show up eventually.

2. DEAL FROM A POSITION OF POWER. By far the biggest mistake people make is to underestimate how badly Satan wants their soul. It’s like precious gold to him and he’ll pay anything to get it. When he appears, get him to make the first offer, then up it.

3. GET THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Remember, you’re going to burn in Hell forever. So no matter how badly off you are now, demand the best. For instance, even if you feel unlovable and desperate with loneliness, don’t just say, “I want the most gorgeous woman on earth and I want her to be madly in love with me.” Instead, add, “In fact, throw in 100 other women as well so I can pick and choose according to my mood.”

4. REMEMBER TO DEMAND THE LIFE-EXTENSION CLAUSE. Satan won’t tell you if you don’t ask but you can get a guarantee of 300 years of youthful life before you go to eternal damnation. Why enjoy a mere 75 or 80 years of reckless living when you can get 300?

Religious groups worldwide are trying to ban Dr. Touth’s book. “This kind of trash is spiritual dynamite,” says a spokesman for the North American Council of Churches and Synogogues. “We can’t, in good conscience, let people read how to destroy their almighty souls.”

Recently, Richard Burroughs, head director of the CDC stated, “I had a conversation with President Obama and we both agreed that the best course of action we could take would be to nuke Dallas…because of ebola of course.”

Although several health experts have already said the chance of ebola spreading on a mass scale are very slim. “You have a better chance dying of influenza in Dallas than of ebola,” said Matthew Graves, an expert in pandemic infections for Doctors without Borders. He continued, “but, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t blow up Dallas. If you’ve ever been there, it’s nothing but assholes and garbage piles.”

In a special State of the Union address, President Obama went live on television and on-line, with the broadcast being purposefully withheld from airing on Fox News in order to assure that no residents of Dallas would hear the news. In his address, President Obama stated, “men and women of America, it comes to me with great pleasure to announce that although ebolaactually did manage to make its way to the United States, it thankfully made its way to none other than Dallas, Texas and as a preemptive safety measure, I have ordered the United States Airforce to unload a small nuclear payload on the center of the city which will eradicate this city of assholes from our great nation. Oh, and it will ensure the disease doesn’t spread or something like that. You remember Outbreak.”

It has been reported at this time that the jets have taken off, but the city of Dallas stays committed in resolve to be a city full of self-absorbed, narrow-minded douchebags to the very end. One business man said with a smirk, “I’d like to see them try” right before his entire skeleton was pulverized to a fine ash by the blast.

Where the greats have failed, this man who many thought was simply the gym’s manager, succeeded by knocking out Mayweather in a mere sparring session while he is preparing for his upcoming Pacquiao match with what McFarboroni called a haymaker. “Jumpinbegonias,” the near Leprechaun exclaimed as he saw the stars in Mayweather’s eyes as the champ spun around six times, stuck out his tongue, and collapsed to the ground.

“I threw him off his game by saying he could not read which made him drop his guard and get angry, then all I had to do was dodge to the right, block, back, back, and then punch him in his weak spot Next thing you know, the lad’s down for the count,” said McFarboronni as he slid back into his pink jogging suit and proceeded to start mopping the sauna before the gym’s closing hours.

Mayweather has claimed that the fight never happened because it was never sanctioned. This is however the first time an unsanctioned bout did not land Mayweather behind bars. [Continue Reading]

"http://20minutenews.com/george-w-bush-arrested-for-possession-of-cocaine/","George W. Bush Arrested For Possession Of Cocaine – 20minutenews","One of the most notorious Presidents in history of The United States of America is back in the spotlight, but not because of his politics. George W. Bush was arrested in a Dallas suburb late Tuesday evening after a routine traffic stop uncovered over an ounce of cocaine in his glove compartment.

Dallas police say they pulled over Bush after he made a right turn without signaling. Officers report they were surprised when seeing it was the ex-president, but felt something was off about his behavior. They say Bush seemed under the influence of a narcotic, and the officers on-scene asked to search the car. Curiously, Bush consented, and police found the narcotics.“We pulled over the truck and were about to write a simple traffic ticket and things escalated fast,” said officer Charles Cane, a veteran officer with the Dallas Police Department. “At first my partner and I were stunned with who was in the truck ,and [Bush] began to crack jokes and asked if we wanted to take a picture with him. I noticed he was sniffling quite a bit and the glaze on his eyes screamed that the was under the influence.”Cane said that once the officers uncovered the cocaine, Bush tried to bribe them to keep from getting arrested. When that failed, he turned to threats and rambling, reportedly saying that he would ‘get the FBI to kick their a–’ and that ‘Presidents can break any laws they want.’

“I broke so many laws when I was in office, and I didn’t see you coming to try to arrest me then!” Bush shouted at police officers. “I’ve been doing coke for decades! I used to blow lines out of a Skull & Bones in New Haven tittie bars when you were making nice in your diapers, kid. You just want your name in the papers next to mine.”

“It was a tough arrest to make, but I didn’t become a police officer to make easy decisions. He begged me over and over to let it slide, then he offered me money, then he called me an ass—-, but that is the way the law goes. We don’t offer special treatment to anyone in Dallas. I don’t care who you are.”

Representatives for Bush have yet to comment, but bail was set at $5,000 and posted immediately. Bush spent less than 6 hours in a holding cell before being released.","2014-07-31 00:00:00","0","9.0","12.0","3.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","36.0","32.0","0.0","89.0","5.0","3.0","1","406","81.15","69.76","39.85","34.31","19.33","16.01","83.99","52.71","13.79","10.34","3.69","0.74","1.48","2.96","1.48","3.45","8.62","15.27","7.14","2.71","6.90","1.48","17.49","4.19","1.72","1.48","1.48","1.23","2.96","1.48","0.99","0.25","0.25","0.49","11.08","0.00","0.25","0.00","2.96","8.87","1.72","1.97","1.23","1.97","0.00","2.71","3.45","1.23","1.72","0.25","1.48","0.99","0.00","0.00","0.49","10.84","0.99","0.99","8.13","0.74","0.74","8.62","6.40","0.99","15.52","2.46","6.90","6.40","4.68","0.74","0.00","0.49","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.75","5.17","4.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.74","2.96","1.72","0.00","0.99","1726","6.94","25.6875","546","401","22","69.92","10.3","8.0","8.82","8.9","61","8.3","15.364788029925188","233","22.62","11","0.52","0","18","4","39","0","47","18","1","0","2","47","29","1","24","0","0","36","8","15","0","1","3","17","0","20","39","11","10","12","3","0","2","0","4"

"http://20minutenews.com/6-signs-your-being-cheated-on/","6 Signs Your Being Cheated On – 20minutenews","Cheaters Hate This New Website – Here’s Why

Picture this scenario: You’re in the middle of dinner with your man, and he rushes outside for an “emergency” call. Normally you wouldn’t care, but this is the fourth time it’s happened! Suddenly you get a sick feeling in your stomach, and it’s not from the food.

By now, you’re finally convinced your man is cheating. But you need proof. Here’s your chance to get it.

“See who he’s been calling or texting behind your back. It’s as easy as typing in a phone number.”

Introducing the controversial new website that will blow the lid off his affair. It’s called Reverse Phone Lookup, and it will help you track down who your man’s been calling or texting. Like we said, cheaters hate this website.

If you think your man’s got a secret, use this tool right now.

See who he’s been calling or textingbehind your back. It’s as easy as typing in a phone number and he’ll never find out.

Still not sure you’re ready for the truth? Check out these telltale signs your man’s a cheater. Chances are, he’s guilty of all of them.

He’s Secretive With His Smartphone

Anyone with a smartphone is spending more time online than ever before. If your man wants to fool around, he’s got a million ways to do it–and they’re all at his fingertips. Look at his texts and see who and what he’s been texting behind your back. You may be surprised at what you find.

He’s Extra Sensitive About Privacy

Cheaters work overtime to cover their tracks. You have to be smarter than them. Look out for new hobbies your man won’t tell you about. Or excuses like, “I just need to be alone.”

Then use Reverse Phone to look up calls he’s made on his phone. Maybe “Brad from work” is actually a Michelle from Tinder.

He Hits The Gym All The Time

In the past, you’ve hinted he could lose some belly fat. But he’s never listened. Now, out of the blue, he’s started hitting the gym hard. What’s changed? Him. Because if he wants to cheat, this is his mating season. He’s bulking up so he can lure the hottest girls to his bed.

He’s Distant

If your man’s doting on someone else, he won’t be as affectionate toward you. And he’ll be moody. He’ll get upset over nothing, and he’ll blame you for everything. Why does it feel like someone flipped a switch on his emotions? Because your man’s got someone on his mind. And it’s definitely not you.

Find out who’s taking up all his attention.

He Smells Different

Trust your instincts and your senses. If your man smells different, it’s because he’s spending his time somewhere else. And he’s trying to throw you off track.

Maybe he’s showering at his side chick’s place. Or you’re picking up the scent of her perfume. When your gut and your senses tell you something’s wrong, listen. Then uncover the truthfrom Reverse Phone.

He Deletes Texts

You know you’re not the only one he’s calling. But you can’t prove it. Because the last time you snuck a peek at his phone, the call and text logs were empty. Just wait a couple days, and grab his phone again (sooner or later you’ll catch him slipping). When you look up the numbers, you’ll expose the identity (and address!) of his “special someone.”

Let Reverse Phone do the secret sleuthing for you! Look up any number you want. No one will ever find out.

Everyone’s eyes wander from time to time. But not everyone strays. Make sure you don’t get caught in a love triangle you never wanted to be part of. With Reverse Phone, you’ll have the upper hand again.

Find out the truth in minutes, before he plays you for a total fool.","2014-12-09 00:00:00","0","48.0","20.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","61.0","40.0","0.0","168.0","7.0","26.0","6","643","30.79","99.00","8.88","21.01","10.37","14.93","90.67","57.39","21.31","15.40","0.16","0.16","7.93","6.69","0.47","5.75","5.60","13.37","10.42","5.29","7.15","2.33","21.15","6.07","3.11","1.87","0.62","1.71","5.75","2.64","2.95","0.31","1.40","0.47","25.82","0.00","0.00","0.47","8.71","15.86","2.64","1.87","2.18","3.89","3.42","4.51","5.91","1.87","2.02","1.09","1.87","1.09","0.31","0.16","0.47","5.75","1.09","1.71","1.56","1.24","0.47","2.95","14.93","2.80","14.46","0.93","7.62","6.38","0.78","0.62","0.47","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.95","8.71","3.58","0.16","0.00","0.47","0.47","0.00","1.56","8.40","0.62","0.00","2720","6.43","11.813559322033898","791","643","60","94.45","6.8","2.7","7.93","5.4","92","4.833333333333333","12.00317262830482","319","11.44","1","0.57","0","26","1","49","0","69","33","2","1","7","95","36","1","20","0","0","79","36","42","2","0","13","12","0","38","28","21","13","33","27","1","8","0","4"

Khalifa had no comment for reporters as he stuffed what appeared to be a trash bag full of snapback hats into the backseat of a Mazaradi as men, appearing to be IRS, removed the rims and tires from the vehicle.

“You can’t take that,” yelled Khalifa as the men carried away a red, wooden snow sled from Khalifa’s youth. As he saw the men haul away the childhood toy, a slow tear rolled down Khalifa’s cheek realizing that he had spent so much of his life chasing paper and seeking fame that he had let his prime years slip through the cracks of his fingers.

When asked about Khalifa’s newfound poor status, wife and soon-to-be divorcee Amber Rose responded, “I knew Wiz was spending too much when he hired Malcolm Jamal-Warner to dry our hands in the restroom. Luckily, I’ve already arranged a new celebrity marriage to a fellow named Nick Canon? I don’t really know him, but whatever, my agent says it’s a good career move for whatever it is I do.”

Last seen sobbing in what was presumably a bed made of taxidermied endangered animals in throwback jerseys, Khalifa could only let out the quiet, gentle sigh, his lips forming the word “rosebud” which we can only assume is Khalifa’s favorite strain of marijuana.","2014-09-27 00:00:00","0","29.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","66.0","40.0","0.0","172.0","7.0","26.0","6","280","80.99","72.80","3.82","20.37","31.11","23.21","78.21","47.86","12.14","6.43","1.79","0.71","0.36","3.57","0.00","5.71","7.86","13.93","8.21","3.57","5.00","1.07","15.36","5.36","2.14","2.86","0.00","2.50","3.93","1.79","2.14","0.36","0.36","0.71","9.64","1.79","0.36","0.71","5.00","6.43","1.79","0.71","0.36","2.50","0.36","1.43","3.93","1.79","1.07","1.07","1.79","1.43","0.36","0.00","0.00","5.71","1.79","0.00","2.86","0.71","0.36","7.14","7.14","0.36","9.29","1.79","3.93","3.93","2.14","2.14","0.71","2.14","0.00","0.00","0.71","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","15.00","2.86","5.00","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","1.07","2.14","3.57","0.00","0.00","1248","8.53","36.25","396","277","9","57.13","14.1","12.9","10.51","16.0","59","16.0","22.83985559566787","190","31.88","5","0.46","0","7","0","26","0","32","22","0","1","3","48","24","0","17","0","0","16","6","10","1","0","3","6","0","12","17","8","12","6","6","3","2","0","2"

Big name entertainers included on Mark’s list include Ludacris, Bow Wow, Method Man, Ja Rule, Scott Storch, Young Buck, Beanie Sigel, Lil Flip and others.

Scott Storch

Mark uses well publicized news articles to back up his claims.

“It just goes to show that many of these rap stars who fall victim to this system,” Mark says. “They become willing Illuminati icons. Willing servants of this satanic, mind numbing, materialistic, mentally controlling system. And then they just become victims of it. Most of these rappers really are just actors. A lot of the jewelry they have is just fake or rented. A lot of the assets that they have on MTV Cribs… I don’t know if that show is even on any more, but a lot of those cars are just rented or leased for the weekend while they shot the episode. Even some of the houses. They didn’t own the house. They were renting the house for maybe six months or a year.”

…At least that’s the case according to the manager of his former Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood castmate and “friend” Ray J.

During last night’s airing of the show’s reunion special, Cash Jones took to Instagram to expose the rapper for carrying on sexual activities with other men, and putting a slew of Black women “at risk.”

MONA SCOTT-YOUNG SAYS YUNG BERG FIRING WAS NETWORK’S DECISION, SHE WILL MISS HIM

“Walked in the studio, and seen some sh*t I [didn’t] want to see” he posted. “Be who [you’re going to] be, kick the closet doors down and come out switching.”

MASIKA TUCKER TALKS YUNG BERG INCIDENT: ‘IT WAS NOT AN ABUSIVE SITUATION’

No word has been given if Cash is retaliating against Berg for his fall out with Ray J‘s ex-girlfriend Teairra Mari—the former Roc-A-Fella Records singer who Berg alleges performed a sex act on him while they were recording music together.

They will be implanted to help identify individuals immediately. According to the report, the technology is used to answer one question, “Am I who I say I am?”



Some worry, however, that the RFID Microchip will give the government too much power, allowing them to track every move. In some states, like Virginia, legislation is in process to stop this from happening. The report also reveals an RFID Brain Chip that has been developed and is currently being tested on several humans. Proof the RFID Microchip is in Obamacare below:



It was reported that the use of Micro-Chips in Bill H.R. 4872 was located on Page 1014 under “National Medical Device Registry” it tells about a “Class II Device That is Implantable” and yes, they passed the bill. Read Page “1014″ In The H.R. 4872 Read Class II Special Controls Guidance For FDA Staff

With the RFID Microchip they can track the movement of the people that are implanted. They can also control the money and food of the people. It is also reported to be possible to even kill the people that don’t obey. The HR 3962 Bill is an exact copy of the HR 3200 bill in with the exception of just a few words removed concerning the RFID Microchip but the ability to Chip Every Citizen of the United States is still in the bill.

Obama cites one reason for incorporating the island nation: “We need another vacation state.”

“The tyranny of Fidel Castro can be overlooked now that he has stepped down, and we can take this opportunity to grow our borders for the betterment of our domestic travel options,” the president said. “Hawaii has played itself out. As beautiful as it is, we’ve all been there, done that. We don’t have another domestic tropical island where we can vacation without a passport. We need another. And Cuba is it.”

Currently Americans are not allowed to travel to Cuba; however, if the country does become a part of the United States, Americans will be able to visit the lush Caribbean island restriction free.

Estaban Arnaz, spokesman for Cuba’s president Raul Castro, when asked about becoming part of the United States, said simply, “We’re in.”

“This is yet another attempt by the president to abuse his executive power,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) told reporters, acknowledging that, in fact “the way the president has been able to bend the rules thus far, I wouldn’t be surprised if this actually happens, but in the end, do I care? F*ck no. I’ve never been to Cuba. I’m excited to check it out.”

Although a 51 star flag design is still in the works, the cost of changing the American flag to show 51 stars will be passed on to American workers, in what’s being called “The Star Tax.” FICA deductions will increase 2% beginning in March 2016.

"http://20minutenews.com/ferguson-gang-leader-admits-eric-holder-paid-us-to-start-riots/","Ferguson Gang Leader Admits “Eric Holder Paid Us To Start Riots” – 20minutenews","Eric Holder’s career has survived a long list of scandals; The 2008 Black Panther debacle, overturning Arizona’s immigration laws and ‘Fast and Furious‘ immediately spring to mind. These, however, pale in comparison to the recent allegations against Holder, the likes of which could easily land the Attorney General behind bars.

Evidence has been uncovered showing Eric Holder contributed funds to Ferguson’s gang population as incentive to loot and spread civil unrest in the area. These angry, government-sponsored terrorists have systematically infiltrated peaceful protests with the intention of escalating the situation and inciting riots.

A local gang leader came forward last week after being arrested during a night of mass-looting. The unnamed criminal is using his information to bargain for a reduced sentence.

Allegedly, Holder’s goal behind pouring the proverbial gasoline on an already volatile scene is to test militarized police response in a martial law scenario. It is also suspected that the riots have been started as the latest in distractions from the diabolical duo of Obama and Holder. This isn’t the first time they have created a media bait-and-switch to cover up any of their numerous crimes and blunders.

Officials have yet to publicly identify the damaging evidence submitted by the gang member, and are still in the process of verifying the legitimacy of said items. Judge Rineheart of the 22nd Circuit Court in St. Louis is presiding over the case, and has reviewed the materials. During a phone interview with National Report Judge Rineheart stated “The evidence I have seen is incredibly convincing.”

Holder is not yet officially charged with a crime, but it’s expected that a warrant could be issued for him within the coming days. Obama’s spokespeople have declined to comment.

“In the past, no one would ever think of putting Martin Luther King Jr. on one of the dollar bills, but now since inflation is making the dollar more and more worthless, there’s really no reason not to because these things aren’t nearly worth as much anymore,” said Lord Snoot Rothschild, international banker and one of the chairmen of the board of the Federal Reserve.

“We need a dollar for the modern American so we’re imagining a twenty dollar bill with the face of Martin Luther King Jr. boldly featured, a five dollar bill with the face of Caesar Chavez, and a one dollar bill with America’s greatest hero Hulk Hogan,” said Fagan Rockefeller, another chairman on the board of the Federal Reserve as he dumps thousands of America’s old dollar bills into the roaring fire of his Connecticut home. “It’s not like you use those dollars anyways when you’ve got a mountain of gold stored in Sweden,” added Rockefeller.

“This Barrack Obama ten dollar bill will surely let them know that there is absolutely nothing to worry about. America is doing fine. Just check out the radnew colors on these dollars, “Rothschild cackled as he proceed to wipe his ass with what one can only assume was the fabled million dollar bill.","2014-11-15 00:00:00","0","29.0","18.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","61.0","40.0","0.0","168.0","7.0","26.0","6","257","90.26","57.71","7.72","39.70","28.56","19.46","80.16","47.47","7.78","3.50","0.00","0.78","0.78","1.56","0.39","4.28","10.12","14.40","6.61","5.45","4.67","2.33","10.51","4.67","3.50","0.78","3.89","2.33","3.11","1.95","1.17","0.39","0.00","0.39","5.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.33","10.12","2.72","2.33","1.17","0.78","1.95","1.95","2.33","0.78","0.78","0.78","1.56","1.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.28","0.78","0.00","2.72","0.78","0.00","3.50","6.61","0.39","10.51","1.17","3.89","5.45","1.56","0.00","0.39","9.34","0.39","0.00","1.17","0.39","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.39","14.40","3.50","4.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.11","3.11","0.00","0.00","1192","8.19","37.857142857142854","365","257","9","59.37","12.1","12.1","10.91","15.5","51","15.833333333333334","21.37774319066148","161","31.0","0","0.45","0","6","6","33","0","36","12","2","1","4","43","34","1","9","0","0","9","2","14","1","0","1","4","0","9","10","6","3","9","7","0","1","0","1"
"http://20minutenews.com/meet-t-bone-a-jailhouse-prisoner-vigilante-who-beats-up-jail-rapis/","Meet T-Bone A Jailhouse Prisoner Vigilante Who Beats Up Jail Rapi**s – 20minutenews","Last year I spoke to a guy named Shaun Attwood about making millions on the stock market and plunging it all into a new career as a rave-organizing ecstasy kingpin. One unfortunate side effect of selling drugs on a large scale, I discovered during our conversation, is that if the police find out about it, they’re probably going to send you to jail.

While serving time for his offenses, Shaun saw or heard about numerous rapes of inmates by their fellow prisoners—a major problem that he claimed isn’t getting nearly the amount of attention it should from prison authorities. However, he told me about a friend he made who believes it’s his Christian duty to protect weaker inmates from being sexually abused, and has been stabbed and beaten to within an inch of his life for doing just that.

T-Bone is a six feet five former Marine who’s become something of a legend in the West Coast prison system for taking a one-man stand against rapists in American jails. He’s currently serving time for robbery (he maintains his innocence), so I sent him some questions about his anti-rape crusade and the issues of sexual assault in American prisons.

VICE: Hi, T-Bone. When did you first decide that you were going to make a stand against rapists in the prison system?

T-Bone: It was in 1986, when I saw a young kid of 18 being pushed around for food and being told to smuggle crystal meth and heroin into prison inside his butt. When the kid brought the dope in, the two guys who’d made him do it both got high and raped the kid, which made me decide to take action.

How common is rape in American prisons? As prevalent as TV and movies would have you believe?

It’s very common, and it happens in a variety of ways. When I was in one particular prison here in Arizona, every single night someone was getting raped. All night long, I heard male flesh pounding against male flesh, guys getting fucked up the ass. Anyone who couldn’t fight back was game. The rapists were the size of apes. They’d put the victim in a chokehold to make them unconscious. Regular guys—not homosexuals—were getting punked and were scared to admit it. I also saw big guys kissing little white boys on the lips and neck like they were women. Gang members would sometimes hold someone down and stick things in his ass—stuff like cans, soda bottles, shampoo bottles, broom handles, or metal shanks.

Shaun has told me that your Christian faith played a part in inspiring you to take action against rapists.

My belief in God gives me the divine power to do all things through His spirit. Some people say that God doesn’t hurt people and that I hurt those rapists on my own because I wanted to run things in prison, but I believe that God didn’t tell the rapists I encountered over the years to force themselves on young inmates just because they could. I never ran across the yard and jumped on people because of their behavior; I prayed, I talked to a lot of people on the yard who felt the same way I did, and I asked God for protection.

I’m not a Superman or someone special. God’s power is much stronger than mine, and His will will be done. Making rapists stop hurting other people was God pushing and guiding me. I didn’t win all of my fights with rapists—I almost lost my life more than once when I was stabbed and smashed in the skull with rocks in socks. I believe the only reason I’m alive is by God’s grace.

Yeah, I heard that you sustained quite a few injuries after sticking up for weaker inmates.

As well as being shanked and hit with rocks, I’ve hurt my hands a lot. I’ve been hit hard and had to take it easy for weeks until my body healed from blows and hits to the back of my head. I have several large scars, including one on my shoulder, where I was sliced open. I’ve hurt my feet, knees, elbows, fingers, and toes. I’ve had contract killings put out on me for being outspoken about issues that are common in the joint. I’ve been asked to leave yards. I’ve been locked down because certain people didn’t want me around. I’ve found notes in my cell saying my life is in danger.

How did you end up in prison in the first place?

When I got out of the Marines, I set myself up as a bodyguard, and the cash started rolling in. I invested in the cocaine business and got addicted to it. I’ve lost over 20 years of my life due to the dumb decisions I made on drugs. I’ve hurt my wife and children by putting myself in here. Every time I’ve been released, I’ve come straight back. I’m not making excuses for myself, but most prisoners have drug problems, and the prisons offer no help, drug counseling, or rehabilitation. The system is designed so that prisoners come right back, because it keeps the prison in business. That’s part of the reason why there are more black guys in prison throughout the entire USA than are in college and more than were held under slavery before slavery was abolished.

[Editor’s Note: Ivory Toldson, a professor at Howard University, says the conventional idea that there are more black men in prison than in college is a myth. According to his research, there are 1.4 million black men in college and 840,000 black men in prison.]

Why do you think the US prison system has such a high level of sexual assault compared with the prison systems of other nations?

It boils down to human nature—people don’t care about prisoners. Prison is a smaller version of what our society is like, with its extremes of power and poverty. There are laws in place to protect people in society, but in here, if a guy is forced to have sex, he has nowhere to turn, because if he tells the guards, he’s considered to be a rat, and that’s worse than being labeled a punk. Rats get killed in here. That’s why so much rape goes on, but no one reports it.

T-Bone with his granddaughter in Tucson prison

Do you think the prison system could do more to protect weaker inmates?

The prison system does nothing to protect weaker inmates. It’s a system that encourages evil.

There are a lot of racial politics within the US prison system—do you ever get any trouble for helping inmates of other races?

Yes, I’ve had to defend myself many times against gang members for helping inmates of other races. Here in Arizona’s prison system, blacks are a minority. I experience pure hatred because of the color of my skin. People seethe with vile contempt and want to kill me because I’m black, but I’m wearing the same clothes and doing the same time as them.

When I first came into the prison I’m currently in, glad to see a black man stop by, I said, “Hey, what’s up, brother?” He replied: “Some of the white boys here are mad at you for smashing some whites who were raping a youngster at another yard. They said that was white-boy business and you shouldn’t be interfering.”

“How many brothers are on this run?” I asked, referring to black inmates. “You’re looking at him,” was the reply. “I guess I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place then,” I said, wondering how best to defend myself.

Did they come after you?

Later that day, I was let out for a shower. Two whites approached me at the steps, making noise to attract my attention. Then, out of nowhere, another white inmate jumped on my back and put me in a strong chokehold—a precision attack. Another guy grabbed my legs and pulled me down. I tried to kick and pull, but someone laid across my legs and twisted my body to an angle that hurt my back. Another inmate held my arms down while lying across my middle. I could tell they’d done this before.

The first guy said, “Pull his pants down.”

They started to yank my pants down, and I couldn’t stop them. One produced a wooden broom handle shaped like a penis at the end. The sight of the phallus made me struggle with all my might, but I was pinned down too strong. Luckily, two Mexicans ran up the steps. One kicked the first guy in the face and I broke loose of the chokehold. He then spun around and stabbed a Mexican in the stomach. I leaned forward and hit the guy holding my legs down in the neck with my right hand. He tried to grab me, but I got a hold of his wrist, turned him over, pushed his arm up behind his back, dislocated his shoulder and snapped his wrist. I smashed his face into the pavement. I hit another guy in the esophagus, and he went down. Then 20 cops materialized out of nowhere.

Jesus. Finally, if you could change one thing about the US prison system, what would it be?

The prison system here has been set up not to allow God in. That needs to change, because God is love, and where there’s love, there’s peace.

Thanks to Shaun Attwood for putting me in touch with T-Bone. You can read about Shaun’s own prison experiences in his new book, Prison Time.

"http://20minutenews.com/cdc-says-ebola-virus-vaccine-only-works-on-white-people/","CDC Says Ebola Virus Vaccine Only Works On White People – 20minutenews","The Center of Disease

Control, which is headquartered in Atlanta, has released a statement saying the trial vaccine for the deadly Ebola virus will only work on those with white skin.

In an excerpt from the statement, the government agency stated, “Early tests of an experimental drug, which would effectively combat the spread of Ebola, have proved successful only in those with white skin — We are working diligently to improve the sample to be able to help all those who are in need.”

The vaccine, which was developed by ThomasSmithCharles in conjunction with the BIP, has began a trial phase. The vaccine uses a strain of a West Nile monkey cold virus called ape multivirus type 5 to deliver benign genetic material of the West African strain of Ebola. The genetic material given to the patient is not able to replicate and poses virtually no health risk. The sample instead strengthens the immune system to fight off the virus. If successful, ape multivirus type 5 could stop the spread of Ebola.

According to the CDC, the trial was doled out 200 people, but only proved effective to those with white skin. Some scientists believe high levels of melanin may somehow be affecting the sample.

Many citizens voiced concern when two white Americans were flown to Emory Hospital in Atlanta and were cured of the deadly disease, while 1,000’s in Africa continue to die. Conspiracy theorists believe the American Government has a cure for the disease, but has no plans to dole it out to Africans.

A Twitter member, who goes by @Sidney_Bingham wrote, “Ebola was a incurable disease when it was killing Africans by the hundreds but now that 2 white people have it suddenly there’s a cure.”

With the disease seeming to only work on those with white skin, the conspiracy theorists certainly have been provided with more fodder for their beliefs.

"http://20minutenews.com/retired-army-general-says-the-mike-brown-shooting-was-staged-martial-law-is-coming-video/","Retired Army General Says The Mike Brown Shooting Was Staged & Martial Law Is Coming (VIDEO) – 20minutenews","In the video he explains the dangers that are coming to America and that if we don’t change things at the ballot box we will have to go to the bullet box. He seems like a pretty patriotic guy in this video. Hey says we have the right to get rid of our current government.

Here are some of his important quotes from the speech.

“contractors are going to come in – maybe me.” –

“They’re going to kill you. That person sitting next to you won’t be sitting there because they’re going to be gone because somebody like me is going to come in and kill you. ”

“The new constitution is all ready to go. They only need the right incident to bring it down and they’re working on that right now. We’re not very far away from an event that’s going to bring what you call, martial law, that term will never be used by the way Emergency Police Powers will be.”

During the speech he said he still carries a secret clearance and had just left Fort Leonard Wood (military base in the Missouri Ozarks). He said he gets briefed every six months.

Here’s some more quotes.

“The news media is going to start banging on something – could be Ukraine, could be we don’t know. That’s how psychological warfare works. They talk about THIS and this is happening over here. It’s called a distraction.”

“So number one is – there’s going to be an emphasis on an international event – the news media is going to pound it, pound it, pound it. The second thing is you’re going to see a group or a person guilty of racism or something along those lines and they’re going to start pounding on that. They want your attention over here. The third thing you’re going to start seeing is people will be arrested for domestic terrorism. The fourth thing you’re going to see and this is what I’m going to talk to the ladies about – it’s what I call ancient hate, ancient madness, ancient revenge. When these things start to happen, people are going to start rioting. The EBT cards are going to shut down. Can you imagine what’s going to happen in St Louis County when the EBT cards go down, when the ATM machines don’t work?”

“When the inner cities start to erupt, people are going to start killing people they don’t like”.

“Right now in the United States, most Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs and Lieutenants and above will go to the FBI academy. When they go to the FBI academy, they come back brainwashed for some reason. Now I know that the St. Louis County police has that policy, I do not know about the rest of them but every Sheriff will go to the FBI academy.”

“Incidentally, there is a movie out with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, it’s called Escape…that boat exists. It’s real. That boat does exist. I’m telling you for a fact.”

“So I have to get permission from the Army to do this. I’m theirs, they own me.”

Okay so how does a “patriot” go from telling the truth about what’s going to come to actually being a part of the event he said was coming to America! Now for the record, I have found out that Dan Page did tell everybody after that speech that he was going to work for law enforcement and it’s probably safe to assume that he lived in the St. Louis area since the speech he gave to the oath keepers was in the St. Louis area and by his own admission he was checking in with Fort Leonard Wood which is in the Missouri Ozarks. So that’s not a huge deal.

But what is a HUGE deal is when Dan Page tells us exactly what is going to happen in 2012 and then is a part of it all in 2014! He tells us in the speech that he still checks in with Fort Leonard Wood for a briefing every six months and he still has an active secret clearance! That’s not typical of a person that is retired at all. You don’t just go back to your base and get briefings after you retire! He even says at the speech that they “own him”. He had to get the okay for him to speak to them. Why would somebody that is “retired” say that because you’re free to speak to anybody you want when you retire.

He’s involved in the CNN psyop that looks totally staged! How did he go from being a “good guy” to part of the “bad guys”? Did he go to the FBI academy after 2012 that he admitted that for some reason everybody came back brainwashed? And in the last video on this page, Dan admits that he worked in special forces and his specialty was psychological warfare (at about the 16:30 mark of the speech video) where he learned how to destroy a nation from within without direct military contact! What are the odds of this? Was he going back to his base at Fort Leonard Wood every six months to reinforce his brainwashing?

I believe this is VERY important information! Was Dan Page completely mind controlled at the FBI Academy or through Fort Leonard Wood? I don’t know what this all means but what does seem absolutely clear is that the Ferguson event is a STAGED event and Dan Page knew all about something just like this that would come. How did he know this unless he had access to their plans? He seems to be following the script he talked about in 2012! That’s the big deal here as well as his background in psychological warfare.

Video that ties Dan Page the “patriot” to the Cop Part of the CNN Psyop. This is a MUST SEE! There’s no doubt this is the same man! Same voice, and Dan admitted he was going to be a law enforcement officer and he was from the area!

This is a RED ALERT! Get this post out to everybody through social networks and email lists. I don’t believe in coincidences such as one of the main players at Ferguson being trained in Psychological Warfare and admitting there was major brainwashing going on in the police departments and then being part of it all! Who knows if Michael Brown was mind controlled to get aggressive with a cop or if they just were waiting for a white cop to kill a black kid before they sprang into action. It really doesn’t matter at this point because we now have the proof that this entire thing was scripted and they want to start using “Emergency Police Powers” everywhere! Dan Page told us EXACTLY what was going to happen in 2014 back in 2012! He even mentioned that “Ukraine” could be used as one of the two events as well as a racial event! They are using Ukraine and ISIS now as the other event Dan talked about in the speech to the Oath Keepers and Ferguson is being used as the racial event!

Here’s the interview with Dan Page where I found out that he specialized in Psychological Warfare and Asymmetrical Warfare which is “how to destroy a nation from within without direct military contact.” You’ll hear that at about the 16:30 mark in this video. Get the word out everywhere so everybody knows that Ferguson is a staged event! They are following the exact script that Dan Page talked about in 2012!","2014-08-22 00:00:00","0","49.0","27.0","3.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","63.0","40.0","0.0","169.0","7.0","28.0","6","1261","61.27","83.93","25.93","19.83","16.59","12.93","85.41","56.62","15.70","7.77","1.19","0.79","1.35","3.09","1.35","7.93","7.69","15.23","10.55","6.19","5.63","1.35","21.49","2.93","1.51","2.38","1.67","1.82","2.85","1.19","1.59","0.24","1.19","0.00","11.90","0.00","0.40","0.08","3.41","9.91","2.46","1.82","1.03","2.06","2.30","1.59","2.70","1.27","1.43","0.00","0.40","0.32","0.08","0.00","0.00","6.26","0.95","0.48","3.65","0.79","0.40","3.57","14.20","2.93","16.02","4.04","7.38","4.92","2.54","0.71","0.08","0.16","0.00","0.79","0.56","0.00","0.08","0.24","0.16","0.00","14.12","4.04","1.51","0.16","0.00","0.56","1.51","0.00","2.85","3.17","0.32","0.00","5271","6.06","20.0","1607","1265","75","79.7","9.0","6.3","7.6","7.4","127","6.142857142857143","12.775810276679842","439","17.51","32","0.55","0","35","18","134","0","158","66","0","1","11","144","119","2","34","0","0","104","10","58","1","0","6","61","0","68","41","50","17","60","61","11","11","0","16"

According to TMZ, the couple had a dispute on March 19th that turned physical. Game,real name Jayceon Taylor, reportedly punched Tiffney in the face repeatedly. She suffered an injury to her eye socket and a broken nose.

Tiffney filed a police report over the weekend. Photos of her injuries were taken. The L.A. County Sheriff’s Department has launched a criminal investigation into the incident.

Sources close to the 34-year old rapper acknowledge that something happened, but insist he never laid a hand on his fiancee.

"http://20minutenews.com/woman-accidentally-shoots-herself-with-gun-she-bought-for-ferguson-riots/","Woman Accidentally Shoots Herself with Gun She Bought For Ferguson Riots – 20minutenews","As the Grand Jury decision on whether or not to indict Ferguson,MO police officer Darren Wilson in the death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown draws near, people around the area have begun to load up on firearms and ammunition. While it remains to be seen if the panic is warranted – everyone from community leaders to President Obama have stressed the need for peace following the announcement – the added guns in the hands of people who may not know how to properly use them has already seen at least one casualty.

St. Louis police are reporting that a 26-year-old woman has accidentally killed herself with a gun she had purchased in anticipation for Ferguson riots.

The accident occurred when the car the woman, identified as Becca Campbell, was riding in rear-ended a car in front of them. Typically a fender bender would not cause loss of life, but the woman’s gun discharged in the collision and the bullet struck her in the head.

According to KMOV:

The boyfriend, who wasn’t identified, told police that the couple had bought a gun because of fears of unrest related to the pending grand jury decision on the shooting of Michael Brown, the sources said.

He told investigators that as they drove late Friday night, the victim waved a gun, jokingly saying the couple were ready for Ferguson, the sources said.

He ducked to get out of the way of the gun and accidentally rear-ended another car. He said the accident caused the gun to go off and she was struck by a bullet in the head, the sources said.

Guns, already a problem for America more generally, are becoming an increasing concern for residents and law enforcement around Ferguson. As tensions rise – and urged on by a giddy media which can’t help but stoke the flames in pursuit of ratings boosts – the number of scared people buying firearms to “protect” themselves from their neighbors is skyrocketing. One Ferguson gun store owner told reporters that his sales have gone up by around 700% this month.

In a sign of just how bad it has gotten, store owners, like the one mentioned above, are now beginning to close up their shops and ship out their lethal stock so no more weapons can find their way onto the streets in the coming weeks. It’s a testament to the very real fear people feel that even the promise of large profits can’t entice gun shop owners from ignoring pleas from law enforcement and staying open for business.

Whether or not violence erupts after the decision, the fact that hundreds of more guns are now in the community is a problem that will likely plague Ferguson long after the protests end.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/6-signs-your-being-cheated-on/","6 Signs Your Being Cheated On","Cheaters Hate This New Website – Here’s Why

Picture this scenario: You’re in the middle of dinner with your man, and he rushes outside for an “emergency” call. Normally you wouldn’t care, but this is the fourth time it’s happened! Suddenly you get a sick feeling in your stomach, and it’s not from the food.

By now, you’re finally convinced your man is cheating. But you need proof. Here’s your chance to get it.

“See who he’s been calling or texting behind your back. It’s as easy as typing in a phone number.”

Introducing the controversial new website that will blow the lid off his affair. It’s called Reverse Phone Lookup, and it will help you track down who your man’s been calling or texting. Like we said, cheaters hate this website.

If you think your man’s got a secret, use this tool right now.

See who he’s been calling or textingbehind your back. It’s as easy as typing in a phone number and he’ll never find out.

Still not sure you’re ready for the truth? Check out these telltale signs your man’s a cheater. Chances are, he’s guilty of all of them.

He’s Secretive With His Smartphone

Anyone with a smartphone is spending more time online than ever before. If your man wants to fool around, he’s got a million ways to do it–and they’re all at his fingertips. Look at his texts and see who and what he’s been texting behind your back. You may be surprised at what you find.

He’s Extra Sensitive About Privacy

Cheaters work overtime to cover their tracks. You have to be smarter than them. Look out for new hobbies your man won’t tell you about. Or excuses like, “I just need to be alone.”

Then use Reverse Phone to look up calls he’s made on his phone. Maybe “Brad from work” is actually a Michelle from Tinder.

He Hits The Gym All The Time

In the past, you’ve hinted he could lose some belly fat. But he’s never listened. Now, out of the blue, he’s started hitting the gym hard. What’s changed? Him. Because if he wants to cheat, this is his mating season. He’s bulking up so he can lure the hottest girls to his bed.

He’s Distant

If your man’s doting on someone else, he won’t be as affectionate toward you. And he’ll be moody. He’ll get upset over nothing, and he’ll blame you for everything. Why does it feel like someone flipped a switch on his emotions? Because your man’s got someone on his mind. And it’s definitely not you.

Find out who’s taking up all his attention.

He Smells Different

Trust your instincts and your senses. If your man smells different, it’s because he’s spending his time somewhere else. And he’s trying to throw you off track.

Maybe he’s showering at his side chick’s place. Or you’re picking up the scent of her perfume. When your gut and your senses tell you something’s wrong, listen. Then uncover the truthfrom Reverse Phone.

He Deletes Texts

You know you’re not the only one he’s calling. But you can’t prove it. Because the last time you snuck a peek at his phone, the call and text logs were empty. Just wait a couple days, and grab his phone again (sooner or later you’ll catch him slipping). When you look up the numbers, you’ll expose the identity (and address!) of his “special someone.”

Big name entertainers included on Mark’s list include Ludacris, Bow Wow, Method Man, Ja Rule, Scott Storch, Young Buck, Beanie Sigel, Lil Flip and others.

Scott Storch

Mark uses well publicized news articles to back up his claims.

“It just goes to show that many of these rap stars who fall victim to this system,” Mark says. “They become willing Illuminati icons. Willing servants of this satanic, mind numbing, materialistic, mentally controlling system. And then they just become victims of it. Most of these rappers really are just actors. A lot of the jewelry they have is just fake or rented. A lot of the assets that they have on MTV Cribs… I don’t know if that show is even on any more, but a lot of those cars are just rented or leased for the weekend while they shot the episode. Even some of the houses. They didn’t own the house. They were renting the house for maybe six months or a year.”

“In the past, no one would ever think of putting Martin Luther King Jr. on one of the dollar bills, but now since inflation is making the dollar more and more worthless, there’s really no reason not to because these things aren’t nearly worth as much anymore,” said Lord Snoot Rothschild, international banker and one of the chairmen of the board of the Federal Reserve.

“We need a dollar for the modern American so we’re imagining a twenty dollar bill with the face of Martin Luther King Jr. boldly featured, a five dollar bill with the face of Caesar Chavez, and a one dollar bill with America’s greatest hero Hulk Hogan,” said Fagan Rockefeller, another chairman on the board of the Federal Reserve as he dumps thousands of America’s old dollar bills into the roaring fire of his Connecticut home. “It’s not like you use those dollars anyways when you’ve got a mountain of gold stored in Sweden,” added Rockefeller.

“This Barrack Obama ten dollar bill will surely let them know that there is absolutely nothing to worry about. America is doing fine. Just check out the radnew colors on these dollars, “Rothschild cackled as he proceed to wipe his ass with what one can only assume was the fabled million dollar bill.","2014-11-15 00:00:00","0","29.0","18.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","71.0","50.0","0.0","169.0","7.0","23.0","6","257","90.26","57.71","7.72","39.70","28.56","19.46","80.16","47.47","7.78","3.50","0.00","0.78","0.78","1.56","0.39","4.28","10.12","14.40","6.61","5.45","4.67","2.33","10.51","4.67","3.50","0.78","3.89","2.33","3.11","1.95","1.17","0.39","0.00","0.39","5.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.33","10.12","2.72","2.33","1.17","0.78","1.95","1.95","2.33","0.78","0.78","0.78","1.56","1.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.28","0.78","0.00","2.72","0.78","0.00","3.50","6.61","0.39","10.51","1.17","3.89","5.45","1.56","0.00","0.39","9.34","0.39","0.00","1.17","0.39","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.39","14.40","3.50","4.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.11","3.11","0.00","0.00","1192","8.19","37.857142857142854","365","257","9","59.37","12.1","12.1","10.91","15.5","51","15.833333333333334","21.37774319066148","161","31.0","0","0.45","0","6","6","33","0","36","12","2","1","4","43","34","1","9","0","0","9","2","14","1","0","1","4","0","9","10","6","3","9","7","0","1","0","1"
"http://smhwtfnews.com/u-s-plans-to-nuke-dallas-to-stop-spread-of-ebola-virus/","U.S. Plans To “NUKE” Dallas To Stop Spread Of Ebola Virus","Upon discovering the first U.S. ebola carrier in the city of Dallas, Texas, the United States has announced plans to safely eradicate the city by means of a human nuclear incineration device in fear that the disease might spread past city limits to infect people or because it’s Dallas and that sounds like a lot of fun.

Recently, Richard Burroughs, head director of the CDC stated, “I had a conversation with President Obama and we both agreed that the best course of action we could take would be to nuke Dallas…because of ebola of course.”

Although several health experts have already said the chance of ebola spreading on a mass scale are very slim. “You have a better chance dying of influenza in Dallas than of ebola,” said Matthew Graves, an expert in pandemic infections for Doctors without Borders. He continued, “but, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t blow up Dallas. If you’ve ever been there, it’s nothing but assholes and garbage piles.”

In a special State of the Union address, President Obama went live on television and on-line, with the broadcast being purposefully withheld from airing on Fox News in order to assure that no residents of Dallas would hear the news. In his address, President Obama stated, “men and women of America, it comes to me with great pleasure to announce that although ebolaactually did manage to make its way to the United States, it thankfully made its way to none other than Dallas, Texas and as a preemptive safety measure, I have ordered the United States Airforce to unload a small nuclear payload on the center of the city which will eradicate this city of assholes from our great nation. Oh, and it will ensure the disease doesn’t spread or something like that. You remember Outbreak.”

It has been reported at this time that the jets have taken off, but the city of Dallas stays committed in resolve to be a city full of self-absorbed, narrow-minded douchebags to the very end. One business man said with a smirk, “I’d like to see them try” right before his entire skeleton was pulverized to a fine ash by the blast.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/wiz-khalifa-arrested-for-tax-evasion-after-blowing-2-million-on-hoes-weed/","Wiz Khalifa Arrested for Tax Evasion After Blowing 2 Million On Hoes & Weed","The internet was abuzz today with more news regarding the divorce of pop icons Wiz Khalifa and wife Amber Rose, famous for something or another. It is reported that Khalifa has secretly depleted all of the couple’s wealth spending most of it on an exuberant amount of weed and hoes which were to be used on Khalifa’s extravagant hanging marijuana garden.

Khalifa had no comment for reporters as he stuffed what appeared to be a trash bag full of snapback hats into the backseat of a Mazaradi as men, appearing to be IRS, removed the rims and tires from the vehicle.

“You can’t take that,” yelled Khalifa as the men carried away a red, wooden snow sled from Khalifa’s youth. As he saw the men haul away the childhood toy, a slow tear rolled down Khalifa’s cheek realizing that he had spent so much of his life chasing paper and seeking fame that he had let his prime years slip through the cracks of his fingers.

When asked about Khalifa’s newfound poor status, wife and soon-to-be divorcee Amber Rose responded, “I knew Wiz was spending too much when he hired Malcolm Jamal-Warner to dry our hands in the restroom. Luckily, I’ve already arranged a new celebrity marriage to a fellow named Nick Canon? I don’t really know him, but whatever, my agent says it’s a good career move for whatever it is I do.”

Last seen sobbing in what was presumably a bed made of taxidermied endangered animals in throwback jerseys, Khalifa could only let out the quiet, gentle sigh, his lips forming the word “rosebud” which we can only assume is Khalifa’s favorite strain of marijuana.","2014-09-27 00:00:00","0","29.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","76.0","50.0","0.0","173.0","7.0","23.0","6","280","80.99","72.80","3.82","20.37","31.11","23.21","78.21","47.86","12.14","6.43","1.79","0.71","0.36","3.57","0.00","5.71","7.86","13.93","8.21","3.57","5.00","1.07","15.36","5.36","2.14","2.86","0.00","2.50","3.93","1.79","2.14","0.36","0.36","0.71","9.64","1.79","0.36","0.71","5.00","6.43","1.79","0.71","0.36","2.50","0.36","1.43","3.93","1.79","1.07","1.07","1.79","1.43","0.36","0.00","0.00","5.71","1.79","0.00","2.86","0.71","0.36","7.14","7.14","0.36","9.29","1.79","3.93","3.93","2.14","2.14","0.71","2.14","0.00","0.00","0.71","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","15.00","2.86","5.00","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","1.07","2.14","3.57","0.00","0.00","1248","8.53","36.25","396","277","9","57.13","14.1","12.9","10.51","16.0","59","16.0","22.83985559566787","190","31.88","5","0.46","0","7","0","26","0","32","22","0","1","3","48","24","0","17","0","0","16","6","10","1","0","3","6","0","12","17","8","12","6","6","3","2","0","2"

Despite this, there is much surrounding his ‘death’ that doesn’t add up. Now you’re probably reading this thinking, this has got to be one of those whacked out ‘conspiracy theories’ going against everything ever officially reported, if he was alive we would know for certain, right? I initially thought the same seeing such claims too. It wasn’t long however, before I found myself uncovering much more about his supposed death and the circumstances situated around it that made be begin to think otherwise. I began to realise that actually, such claims that 2pac may have faked his own death and is still alive may have more truths to them than what first appears, as it is evident that there is more to this story than what was ever officially reported..

It all began a couple years ago when I was on Youtube listening to 2pac and some of his songs. On the sidebar I saw a link titled “2PAC ALIVE 2014 RETURN – MUST WATCH!!”. Of course I thought, another stereotypical video discrediting people questioning real conspiracies and cover-ups. Being a huge 2pac fan I couldn’t help but take an interest in seeing what these people were claiming and so clicked the video anyway. What I saw next could not have surprised me more, as it was suggesting the last known photo of 2pac alive the night he had allegedly been shot, was fake!

Another strong piece of evidence made against the photo is a picture snapped of 2pac and Suge Knight earlier. The night 2pac was ‘killed’, he was at the MGM strip in Las Vegas to see a Mike Tyson boxing match. Interestingly if you look at the picture seen below you will notice something doesn’t add up. It is very obvious if you examine the facial hair on 2pac’s chin, you can see that in the picture where he is in the car his beard is much longer!

Pictured above on the left is the photo in its original form. What stands out about it most is that there are no keys in the ignition! This can be seen clearly from the close up picture to the right. It was reported that this photo was allowed to be taken by paparazzi while 2pac and his manager Suge Knight were waiting at traffic lights. With this in mind, it isn’t possible that the car would have been able to take off without any keys.

Finally, if you didn’t think that was enough, this last piece of evidence against the ‘final’ photo is BY FAR the most compelling as it is quite clear that the photo of 2pac seen is actually his military portrait. Below you can see that this photo has been overlayed on top of the photo where he is seen in the car and is faded out gradually. The results are a perfect match..

If you look at his eyes throughout each frame they remain the same while the lighting changes..

This got me thinking, why on earth would somebody go to the trouble and effort to fake the last photo of 2pac being alive? There would have to be a reason for it, and so lead me to investigate further in finding out what else really happened that night. It turns out there were a number of things out of the ordinary. It was very strange for 2pac not to be wearing his bullet-proof vest as after less than a year earlier, 2pac had survived a point blank shooting in New York. It was because of this he was always seen to be wearing one. According to his cousin, Jamal Lesane: “Normally he wouldn’t leave without it, but this time he left it behind and didn’t have it with him.” E.D.I also claims that night Kastro told 2pac he should put his vest on, but replied “It’s too hot tonight.” Before the alleged shooting that would become known as the fatal night 2pac died, he and his camaraderie of Outlawz and bodyguards made their way across the Vegas strip to a mansion belonging to Suge Knight. According to members of The Outlawz, Suge and 2pac unexpectedly disappeared briefly while the others waited patiently. “I don’t really know what Pac or Suge was doing at the time, I just knew we was waiting and I was ready to go.” Reportedly after about half an hour, with 2pac and the others now ready to leave for a show at club 662, 2pac made an unusual request to his bodyguard, Frank Alexander. “I was walking to the car with Suge and Pac when I was opening up the door to get in the backseat. Then Pac stopped me and said no take the keys and go drive the Lexus with the Outlawz, we’re going to be drinking and you’re going to be the designated driver to drive us back after we’ve finished parting.” This was even more out of the ordinary as 2pac would never go anywhere in public without at least one of his bodyguards for his safety. Given such abnormal circumstances, what happened later involving his ‘death’, was was either very convenient, or a total coincidence.. The story officially reported of 2pac’s death is of he and Suge waiting at more traffic lights along the MGM strip, when a white Cadillac was seen pulling up next to them and began firing shots into their BMW. Frank Alexander was in the Lexus behind 2pac and described the scene as he saw it. “After the Cadillac shot into the car I thought they were dead, my reaction was to run up to the car, but instead the car sped up and took off.” The BMW went onto makes a hard right u-turn and race off in the opposite direction. “I didn’t know what to think, it was a faulk, it was a haze. Were these real bullets? Did they really shoot these guys?..” Frank also made mention that some of the other cars containing security went in pursuit of the white Cadillac, although failed to catch up to it and identify the vehicle plate. To this day nobody knows who killed 2pac and the case remains an unsolved murder. The events that followed suit involved 2pac being rushed to hospital, although the details as to how he arrived and by whom are uncertain due to three different scenarios being relayed by different accounts. According to media 2pac and Suge were found in the BMW with all four tires blown out. An ambulance also apparently arrived on scene shortly after and was said to have rushed 2pac to hospital. Suge describes a different series of events, claiming in an interview he drove 2pac to the hospital himself, he then however is oddly seen changing his story to coincide with that of official media reports! The third and final account is that of a by-stander still on scene when asked on camera what she had just witnessed. VIDEO: “We were pretty far down the street when it happened, we didn’t know if we heard gunshots, we didn’t know exactly what we heard, we heard a lot of screaming and car screeching. We ran up the street as cops were running past us and by the time we got here they were already taking which now I found out is 2pac into the helicopter away.”

Did this person say something she wasn’t supposed to? .. Afterwards nobody else on the scene was further asked for questioning and reports continued to detail 2pac being met by an ambulance at the scene of the broken down BMW.

How much more bizarre could this night get? .. Well as it turns out things were only beginning to get stranger.

Pictured above on the left is a picture of the crime scene where the BMW came to its end. The damage to the rims can be seen from the blown out tires. Pictured to the right is news footage showing investigators examining the supposed car 2pac and Suge were in. Here’s where it gets weird, if you look at the wheels of both cars neither match up.

When both cars are seen from another angle it is unmistakable that these are two totally different vehicles! This begs the question, why was this second car being examined and why was it on the scene??","2014-11-13 00:00:00","0","9.0","11.0","3.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","47.0","42.0","0.0","92.0","5.0","1.0","1","1413","70.52","57.58","47.77","23.55","21.74","16.91","84.71","55.48","13.59","6.51","1.63","0.99","0.78","2.55","0.57","7.08","7.86","15.29","9.84","5.02","5.94","1.70","18.83","5.24","3.33","2.05","0.92","2.55","1.98","0.92","1.06","0.07","0.28","0.07","7.43","0.07","0.07","0.14","2.69","11.75","2.41","1.49","1.56","2.48","1.34","3.96","4.46","3.61","0.71","0.14","1.27","0.57","0.64","0.00","0.07","5.38","1.49","0.50","2.26","1.13","0.35","8.99","7.50","0.64","16.77","3.11","8.28","5.52","1.13","0.57","0.07","0.28","0.00","1.27","0.21","0.00","0.07","0.00","0.07","0.07","12.67","4.60","3.26","0.14","0.00","0.57","0.50","0.28","1.49","1.84","0.00","0.00","6060","6.93","23.866666666666667","1877","1406","65","74.93","10.5","8.2","8.53","10.3","198","8.9","16.273001422475108","556","21.37","34","0.53","0","44","40","150","0","170","78","5","1","16","169","66","0","52","1","0","98","22","84","7","2","20","49","0","54","93","50","52","32","41","4","13","0","14"

"http://smhwtfnews.com/cdc-says-ebola-virus-vaccine-only-works-on-white-people/","CDC Says Ebola Virus Vaccine Only Works On White People","The Center of Disease

Control, which is headquartered in Atlanta, has released a statement saying the trial vaccine for the deadly Ebola virus will only work on those with white skin.

In an excerpt from the statement, the government agency stated, “Early tests of an experimental drug, which would effectively combat the spread of Ebola, have proved successful only in those with white skin — We are working diligently to improve the sample to be able to help all those who are in need.”

The vaccine, which was developed by ThomasSmithCharles in conjunction with the BIP, has began a trial phase. The vaccine uses a strain of a West Nile monkey cold virus called ape multivirus type 5 to deliver benign genetic material of the West African strain of Ebola. The genetic material given to the patient is not able to replicate and poses virtually no health risk. The sample instead strengthens the immune system to fight off the virus. If successful, ape multivirus type 5 could stop the spread of Ebola.

According to the CDC, the trial was doled out 200 people, but only proved effective to those with white skin. Some scientists believe high levels of melanin may somehow be affecting the sample.

Many citizens voiced concern when two white Americans were flown to Emory Hospital in Atlanta and were cured of the deadly disease, while 1,000’s in Africa continue to die. Conspiracy theorists believe the American Government has a cure for the disease, but has no plans to dole it out to Africans.

A Twitter member, who goes by @Sidney_Bingham wrote, “Ebola was a incurable disease when it was killing Africans by the hundreds but now that 2 white people have it suddenly there’s a cure.”

User @J_Nuclear wrote, “Ebola death camps in Africa…..now when white people start getting it all of a sudden an experimental cure comes out.”

With the disease seeming to only work on those with white skin, the conspiracy theorists certainly have been provided with more fodder for their beliefs.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/meet-t-bone-a-jailhouse-prisoner-vigilante-who-beats-up-jail-rapis/","Meet T-Bone A Jailhouse Prisoner Vigilante Who Beats Up Jail Rapi**s","Last year I spoke to a guy named Shaun Attwood about making millions on the stock market and plunging it all into a new career as a rave-organizing ecstasy kingpin. One unfortunate side effect of selling drugs on a large scale, I discovered during our conversation, is that if the police find out about it, they’re probably going to send you to jail.

While serving time for his offenses, Shaun saw or heard about numerous rapes of inmates by their fellow prisoners—a major problem that he claimed isn’t getting nearly the amount of attention it should from prison authorities. However, he told me about a friend he made who believes it’s his Christian duty to protect weaker inmates from being sexually abused, and has been stabbed and beaten to within an inch of his life for doing just that.

T-Bone is a six feet five former Marine who’s become something of a legend in the West Coast prison system for taking a one-man stand against rapists in American jails. He’s currently serving time for robbery (he maintains his innocence), so I sent him some questions about his anti-rape crusade and the issues of sexual assault in American prisons.

VICE: Hi, T-Bone. When did you first decide that you were going to make a stand against rapists in the prison system?

T-Bone: It was in 1986, when I saw a young kid of 18 being pushed around for food and being told to smuggle crystal meth and heroin into prison inside his butt. When the kid brought the dope in, the two guys who’d made him do it both got high and raped the kid, which made me decide to take action.

How common is rape in American prisons? As prevalent as TV and movies would have you believe?

It’s very common, and it happens in a variety of ways. When I was in one particular prison here in Arizona, every single night someone was getting raped. All night long, I heard male flesh pounding against male flesh, guys getting fucked up the ass. Anyone who couldn’t fight back was game. The rapists were the size of apes. They’d put the victim in a chokehold to make them unconscious. Regular guys—not homosexuals—were getting punked and were scared to admit it. I also saw big guys kissing little white boys on the lips and neck like they were women. Gang members would sometimes hold someone down and stick things in his ass—stuff like cans, soda bottles, shampoo bottles, broom handles, or metal shanks.

Shaun has told me that your Christian faith played a part in inspiring you to take action against rapists.

My belief in God gives me the divine power to do all things through His spirit. Some people say that God doesn’t hurt people and that I hurt those rapists on my own because I wanted to run things in prison, but I believe that God didn’t tell the rapists I encountered over the years to force themselves on young inmates just because they could. I never ran across the yard and jumped on people because of their behavior; I prayed, I talked to a lot of people on the yard who felt the same way I did, and I asked God for protection.

I’m not a Superman or someone special. God’s power is much stronger than mine, and His will will be done. Making rapists stop hurting other people was God pushing and guiding me. I didn’t win all of my fights with rapists—I almost lost my life more than once when I was stabbed and smashed in the skull with rocks in socks. I believe the only reason I’m alive is by God’s grace.

Yeah, I heard that you sustained quite a few injuries after sticking up for weaker inmates.

As well as being shanked and hit with rocks, I’ve hurt my hands a lot. I’ve been hit hard and had to take it easy for weeks until my body healed from blows and hits to the back of my head. I have several large scars, including one on my shoulder, where I was sliced open. I’ve hurt my feet, knees, elbows, fingers, and toes. I’ve had contract killings put out on me for being outspoken about issues that are common in the joint. I’ve been asked to leave yards. I’ve been locked down because certain people didn’t want me around. I’ve found notes in my cell saying my life is in danger.

How did you end up in prison in the first place?

When I got out of the Marines, I set myself up as a bodyguard, and the cash started rolling in. I invested in the cocaine business and got addicted to it. I’ve lost over 20 years of my life due to the dumb decisions I made on drugs. I’ve hurt my wife and children by putting myself in here. Every time I’ve been released, I’ve come straight back. I’m not making excuses for myself, but most prisoners have drug problems, and the prisons offer no help, drug counseling, or rehabilitation. The system is designed so that prisoners come right back, because it keeps the prison in business. That’s part of the reason why there are more black guys in prison throughout the entire USA than are in college and more than were held under slavery before slavery was abolished.

[Editor’s Note: Ivory Toldson, a professor at Howard University, says the conventional idea that there are more black men in prison than in college is a myth. According to his research, there are 1.4 million black men in college and 840,000 black men in prison.]

Why do you think the US prison system has such a high level of sexual assault compared with the prison systems of other nations?

It boils down to human nature—people don’t care about prisoners. Prison is a smaller version of what our society is like, with its extremes of power and poverty. There are laws in place to protect people in society, but in here, if a guy is forced to have sex, he has nowhere to turn, because if he tells the guards, he’s considered to be a rat, and that’s worse than being labeled a punk. Rats get killed in here. That’s why so much rape goes on, but no one reports it.

T-Bone with his granddaughter in Tucson prison

Do you think the prison system could do more to protect weaker inmates?

The prison system does nothing to protect weaker inmates. It’s a system that encourages evil.

There are a lot of racial politics within the US prison system—do you ever get any trouble for helping inmates of other races?

Yes, I’ve had to defend myself many times against gang members for helping inmates of other races. Here in Arizona’s prison system, blacks are a minority. I experience pure hatred because of the color of my skin. People seethe with vile contempt and want to kill me because I’m black, but I’m wearing the same clothes and doing the same time as them.

When I first came into the prison I’m currently in, glad to see a black man stop by, I said, “Hey, what’s up, brother?” He replied: “Some of the white boys here are mad at you for smashing some whites who were raping a youngster at another yard. They said that was white-boy business and you shouldn’t be interfering.”

“How many brothers are on this run?” I asked, referring to black inmates. “You’re looking at him,” was the reply. “I guess I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place then,” I said, wondering how best to defend myself.

Did they come after you?

Later that day, I was let out for a shower. Two whites approached me at the steps, making noise to attract my attention. Then, out of nowhere, another white inmate jumped on my back and put me in a strong chokehold—a precision attack. Another guy grabbed my legs and pulled me down. I tried to kick and pull, but someone laid across my legs and twisted my body to an angle that hurt my back. Another inmate held my arms down while lying across my middle. I could tell they’d done this before.

The first guy said, “Pull his pants down.”

They started to yank my pants down, and I couldn’t stop them. One produced a wooden broom handle shaped like a penis at the end. The sight of the phallus made me struggle with all my might, but I was pinned down too strong. Luckily, two Mexicans ran up the steps. One kicked the first guy in the face and I broke loose of the chokehold. He then spun around and stabbed a Mexican in the stomach. I leaned forward and hit the guy holding my legs down in the neck with my right hand. He tried to grab me, but I got a hold of his wrist, turned him over, pushed his arm up behind his back, dislocated his shoulder and snapped his wrist. I smashed his face into the pavement. I hit another guy in the esophagus, and he went down. Then 20 cops materialized out of nowhere.

Jesus. Finally, if you could change one thing about the US prison system, what would it be?

The prison system here has been set up not to allow God in. That needs to change, because God is love, and where there’s love, there’s peace.

Thanks to Shaun Attwood for putting me in touch with T-Bone. You can read about Shaun’s own prison experiences in his new book, Prison Time.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/iggy-azaela-get-over-yourself-n-im-killin-rappers-like-ferguson/","Iggy Azaela “Get Over Yourself N**** I’m Killin Rappers Like Ferguson”","Iggy Azalea is no stranger to making inappropriate tweets. Some of which have even been called racist by critics in the past. However, if anyone ever had any doubts whether or not Iggy Azalea was a race hater, Iggy went and confirmed it for them with various disturbing tweets after being criticized for not supporting the protestors in Ferguson and New York City. Also, several reports have been released stating that Azalea is “from Australia” and that Australia is “crazy racist.”

“I don’t know what you were thanking, I’m Australian,” she tweeted. She followed that tweet with “curse I am. My people were the rapists and murderers Britain didn’t want,” and “you expect an Ozzie to be respectful we had a law not to feed the black folks.” “When black people started getting all hungry for rights, we just rifled therm.”

Several other tweets followed such as, “we wouldn’t allow anybody but whites in Queensland” and “we took mixed chilrdren from they paren ts.”

Then, she hit everyone with the shocker.

However, black leaders along with civil rights activists in general, while not surprised to hear that a blond-haired Australian girl is also a racist, were surprised that so many people support her music career, follow her on twitter, and even look to hear her opinions on racial matters.

…At least that’s the case according to the manager of his former Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood castmate and “friend” Ray J.

During last night’s airing of the show’s reunion special, Cash Jones took to Instagram to expose the rapper for carrying on sexual activities with other men, and putting a slew of Black women “at risk.”

MONA SCOTT-YOUNG SAYS YUNG BERG FIRING WAS NETWORK’S DECISION, SHE WILL MISS HIM

“Walked in the studio, and seen some sh*t I [didn’t] want to see” he posted. “Be who [you’re going to] be, kick the closet doors down and come out switching.”

MASIKA TUCKER TALKS YUNG BERG INCIDENT: ‘IT WAS NOT AN ABUSIVE SITUATION’

No word has been given if Cash is retaliating against Berg for his fall out with Ray J‘s ex-girlfriend Teairra Mari—the former Roc-A-Fella Records singer who Berg alleges performed a sex act on him while they were recording music together.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/retired-army-general-says-the-mike-brown-shooting-was-staged-martial-law-is-coming-video/","Retired Army General Says The Mike Brown Shooting Was Staged & Martial Law Is Coming (VIDEO)","In the video he explains the dangers that are coming to America and that if we don’t change things at the ballot box we will have to go to the bullet box. He seems like a pretty patriotic guy in this video. Hey says we have the right to get rid of our current government.

Here are some of his important quotes from the speech.

“contractors are going to come in – maybe me.” –

“They’re going to kill you. That person sitting next to you won’t be sitting there because they’re going to be gone because somebody like me is going to come in and kill you. ”

“The new constitution is all ready to go. They only need the right incident to bring it down and they’re working on that right now. We’re not very far away from an event that’s going to bring what you call, martial law, that term will never be used by the way Emergency Police Powers will be.”

During the speech he said he still carries a secret clearance and had just left Fort Leonard Wood (military base in the Missouri Ozarks). He said he gets briefed every six months.

Here’s some more quotes.

“The news media is going to start banging on something – could be Ukraine, could be we don’t know. That’s how psychological warfare works. They talk about THIS and this is happening over here. It’s called a distraction.”

“So number one is – there’s going to be an emphasis on an international event – the news media is going to pound it, pound it, pound it. The second thing is you’re going to see a group or a person guilty of racism or something along those lines and they’re going to start pounding on that. They want your attention over here. The third thing you’re going to start seeing is people will be arrested for domestic terrorism. The fourth thing you’re going to see and this is what I’m going to talk to the ladies about – it’s what I call ancient hate, ancient madness, ancient revenge. When these things start to happen, people are going to start rioting. The EBT cards are going to shut down. Can you imagine what’s going to happen in St Louis County when the EBT cards go down, when the ATM machines don’t work?”

“When the inner cities start to erupt, people are going to start killing people they don’t like”.

“Right now in the United States, most Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs and Lieutenants and above will go to the FBI academy. When they go to the FBI academy, they come back brainwashed for some reason. Now I know that the St. Louis County police has that policy, I do not know about the rest of them but every Sheriff will go to the FBI academy.”

“Incidentally, there is a movie out with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, it’s called Escape…that boat exists. It’s real. That boat does exist. I’m telling you for a fact.”

“So I have to get permission from the Army to do this. I’m theirs, they own me.”

Okay so how does a “patriot” go from telling the truth about what’s going to come to actually being a part of the event he said was coming to America! Now for the record, I have found out that Dan Page did tell everybody after that speech that he was going to work for law enforcement and it’s probably safe to assume that he lived in the St. Louis area since the speech he gave to the oath keepers was in the St. Louis area and by his own admission he was checking in with Fort Leonard Wood which is in the Missouri Ozarks. So that’s not a huge deal.

But what is a HUGE deal is when Dan Page tells us exactly what is going to happen in 2012 and then is a part of it all in 2014! He tells us in the speech that he still checks in with Fort Leonard Wood for a briefing every six months and he still has an active secret clearance! That’s not typical of a person that is retired at all. You don’t just go back to your base and get briefings after you retire! He even says at the speech that they “own him”. He had to get the okay for him to speak to them. Why would somebody that is “retired” say that because you’re free to speak to anybody you want when you retire.

He’s involved in the CNN psyop that looks totally staged! How did he go from being a “good guy” to part of the “bad guys”? Did he go to the FBI academy after 2012 that he admitted that for some reason everybody came back brainwashed? And in the last video on this page, Dan admits that he worked in special forces and his specialty was psychological warfare (at about the 16:30 mark of the speech video) where he learned how to destroy a nation from within without direct military contact! What are the odds of this? Was he going back to his base at Fort Leonard Wood every six months to reinforce his brainwashing?

I believe this is VERY important information! Was Dan Page completely mind controlled at the FBI Academy or through Fort Leonard Wood? I don’t know what this all means but what does seem absolutely clear is that the Ferguson event is a STAGED event and Dan Page knew all about something just like this that would come. How did he know this unless he had access to their plans? He seems to be following the script he talked about in 2012! That’s the big deal here as well as his background in psychological warfare.

Video that ties Dan Page the “patriot” to the Cop Part of the CNN Psyop. This is a MUST SEE! There’s no doubt this is the same man! Same voice, and Dan admitted he was going to be a law enforcement officer and he was from the area!

This is a RED ALERT! Get this post out to everybody through social networks and email lists. I don’t believe in coincidences such as one of the main players at Ferguson being trained in Psychological Warfare and admitting there was major brainwashing going on in the police departments and then being part of it all! Who knows if Michael Brown was mind controlled to get aggressive with a cop or if they just were waiting for a white cop to kill a black kid before they sprang into action. It really doesn’t matter at this point because we now have the proof that this entire thing was scripted and they want to start using “Emergency Police Powers” everywhere! Dan Page told us EXACTLY what was going to happen in 2014 back in 2012! He even mentioned that “Ukraine” could be used as one of the two events as well as a racial event! They are using Ukraine and ISIS now as the other event Dan talked about in the speech to the Oath Keepers and Ferguson is being used as the racial event!

Here’s the interview with Dan Page where I found out that he specialized in Psychological Warfare and Asymmetrical Warfare which is “how to destroy a nation from within without direct military contact.” You’ll hear that at about the 16:30 mark in this video. Get the word out everywhere so everybody knows that Ferguson is a staged event! They are following the exact script that Dan Page talked about in 2012!","2014-08-22 00:00:00","0","49.0","27.0","3.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","79.0","50.0","0.0","170.0","7.0","25.0","6","1261","61.27","83.93","25.93","19.83","16.59","12.93","85.41","56.62","15.70","7.77","1.19","0.79","1.35","3.09","1.35","7.93","7.69","15.23","10.55","6.19","5.63","1.35","21.49","2.93","1.51","2.38","1.67","1.82","2.85","1.19","1.59","0.24","1.19","0.00","11.90","0.00","0.40","0.08","3.41","9.91","2.46","1.82","1.03","2.06","2.30","1.59","2.70","1.27","1.43","0.00","0.40","0.32","0.08","0.00","0.00","6.26","0.95","0.48","3.65","0.79","0.40","3.57","14.20","2.93","16.02","4.04","7.38","4.92","2.54","0.71","0.08","0.16","0.00","0.79","0.56","0.00","0.08","0.24","0.16","0.00","14.12","4.04","1.51","0.16","0.00","0.56","1.51","0.00","2.85","3.17","0.32","0.00","5271","6.06","20.0","1607","1265","75","79.7","9.0","6.3","7.6","7.4","127","6.142857142857143","12.775810276679842","439","17.51","32","0.55","0","35","18","134","0","158","66","0","1","11","144","119","2","34","0","0","104","10","58","1","0","6","61","0","68","41","50","17","60","61","11","11","0","16"

Rapper Lil Boosie finds himself in jail again for marijuana possession. In just less than 48 hours from being released from a Louisiana prison, Lil Boosie has been arrested again for illegal drugs and if found guilty, will receive a minimum of 2 years in prison.

Lil Boosie was just released from prison yesterday after serving a prison term of about 5 years for multiple crimes including illegal drug possession, violation of probation, federal charges on first-degree murder, etc. It is reported that Louisiana police coincidentally happened to be walking down the street as Boosie walked out the door of an apartment “reaking of weed”. The two officers then searched Boosie and found a bag filled with a quarter-pound of weed in his jacket pocket.

According to Louisiana police officer Jack Napier, “I can’t believe he would even dare carry that much marjuana again, well, he was looking for trouble”. Boosie will appear before a judge late March.

This comes just hours after Lil Boosie signed a huge Million Dollar Deal With Rick Ross & Maybach Music. The Bawse Ricky Ross released a statement saying “Deez Ni**az can’t hold Boosie back we bringing them M’s to the courthouse i got a money bag for the homie he be out soon Ugh Bawse”

"http://smhwtfnews.com/the-brotherhood-of-masons-using-their-influence-to-push-a-homosexual-agenda/","The Brotherhood Of Masons Using Their Influence To Push A Homosexual Agenda?","This is why so many politicians are gay, why heterosexuality is being repressed and

homosexuality and pederasty foisted on us instead.

It explains why the elite is gay, and phallic obelisks are everywhere. Humanity has been

inducted into a pagan sex cult. This involves “gendercide” – i.e. gender genocide.



“Freemasonry’s Connection to the Homosexual Movement”

The esoteric all-male group known as Freemasonry (or Masonry) has been connected to homosexuality by a number of researchers.

“Why?” you may ask.

Albert Pike was Sovereign Grand Commander of the (Masonic) Scottish Rite’s Southern Jurisdiction from 1859-1891. He published a book called Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in 1871. Citations from Pike’s magnum opus will be featured here.





FREEMASONS HAVE A SECRET AGENDA



Like other esoteric groups and some fraternities, the Masons have secret doctrines and initiations. The homosexual agenda is hidden from the membership.Now, as Pike mysteriously put it, Freemasonry ""conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it. Truth is not for those who are unworthy or unable to receive it, or would pervert it.""Instead of Masons stating their secrets secretly, they only obliquely impart them. Pike states: ""What the Chiefs of the Order really believed and taught, is indicated to the Adepts by the hints contained in the high degrees of Free-masonry."" Like other esoteric groups and some fraternities, the Masons have secret doctrines and initiations. The homosexual agenda is hidden from the membership.Now, as Pike mysteriously put it, FreemasonryInstead of Masons stating their secrets secretly, they only obliquely impart them. Pike states: ""What the Chiefs of the Order really believed and taught, is indicated to the Adepts by the hints contained in the high degrees of Free-masonry."" Pike again: ""The symbols and ceremonies of Masonry have more than one meaning. They rather conceal than disclose the Truth. They hint it only."" More: ""We have hints, and not details...hints of the true objects and purposes of the Mysteries."" (The ""Mysteries"" are secret Masonic ""Truths"" and secret initiatory rituals.) Pike speaks in enigmas because he can only hint at Masonic secrets. Masons take oaths not to reveal the group's secrets. Upper-level Masons even keep secrets from lower-level Masons. According to Pike, a lower-level Mason ""is intentionally misled by false interpretations [of Masonic symbols]. It is not intended that he shall understand them [the symbols]; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry."" Lower-level Masons are just dupes being used by the upper-level ones, the so-called ""Princes of Masonry."" HOMOSEXUALITY Are Masons using their power and influence to try to spread homosexual ""values""? In the following enigmatic words, Pike seems to be saying that Mason [adepts] engage in homosexual oral sex. He states that an initiate ""commemorates in sacramental observance this mysterious passion; and while partaking of the raw flesh of the victim, seems to be invigorated by a fresh draught from the fountain of universal life....Hence the significance of the phallus."" (p.393) As is his wont, Pike does not explain these words. For example, he does not spell out what he means by ""this mysterious passion."" But elsewhere in the book he twice notes that phallic worship is a part of their ""Ancient Mysteries."" Not only does homosexual sex apparently play a role in Masonry, but so do homosexual orgies. Pike, speaking in general of a newly initiated member, says: ""he mingles with the crowd of Initiates, and, crowned with flowers, celebrates with them the holy orgies."" Needless to say, Pike does not define ""holy orgy."" In at least two other locations in his book he mentions that orgies are associated with Masonic initiations. [Albert Pike pictured below has a reputation for indulging in debaucheries as well as Satanic butchery.

HETEROPHOBIA Now to return to Masonry---which, we should keep in mind---is an all-male group, Pike provides serious evidence of organizational sexism in Masonry via these words: ""The love of woman cannot die out; and it has a terrible and uncontrollable fate."" As usual, he does not explain what he means by this startling statement (but the heterophobic meaning seems obvious enough). Elsewhere he stated that ""Christianity...gave to woman her proper rank and influence; it regulated domestic life."" In some circles, it is a common opinion, misguided or not, that Christianity, especially Catholicism, places women at a lower rank than men because women cannot become priests or bishops or cardinals or popes' and because wives are supposed to be submissive or subordinate to their husbands, generally speaking. In sum, while Pike does not explicitly declare that women are inferior to men, or that they are unworthy of love, but he does seem to strongly hint at that. Freemasonry is still a force in America and the world. The fact that this group is evidently biased against women (who cannot join) and biased in favor of homosexual relationships should not go unnoticed, and neither should the fact this group is using its influence to try to impose pro-homosexual ""values"" on the public. We'll end with a quote from Masonic author Carl H. Claudy: ""The real secrets of Masonry are never told, not even mouth to ear. For the real secret of Masonry is spoken to your heart, and from it to that of your brother [Mason]. Never the language made for tongue may speak it; it is uttered only in the language of the eye, in those manifestations of that love which a man has for his friend, which passeth all other loves, even that of woman."" Note those last four words.","2014-08-16 00:00:00","0","21.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","48.0","42.0","0.0","91.0","5.0","3.0","1","989","79.83","74.79","16.97","50.29","19.02","23.96","80.69","50.15","10.72","4.45","0.00","0.40","0.30","1.92","1.82","6.27","7.38","14.16","7.79","3.74","6.07","2.02","12.54","5.16","2.02","1.52","0.81","1.92","3.74","2.53","1.21","0.30","0.00","0.51","12.64","0.30","0.10","0.91","2.73","15.98","4.04","3.24","0.51","3.24","1.92","4.65","1.62","0.61","0.91","0.00","3.74","0.61","0.20","2.53","0.00","7.68","2.83","1.52","3.54","0.20","0.00","1.72","9.20","0.81","9.00","0.61","5.76","2.43","1.11","0.51","0.10","0.20","1.42","0.20","0.20","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.10","0.00","22.24","6.57","5.16","0.71","0.61","0.20","0.00","1.82","4.45","0.61","1.21","0.91","4789","8.0","19.134615384615383","1543","969","57","54.22","12.1","9.9","12.58","11.6","216","5.5","17.71640866873065","431","17.0","8","0.48","0","45","7","95","0","128","73","4","1","10","102","97","3","83","0","0","48","15","60","1","0","1","28","0","42","15","11","32","26","53","4","7","0","4"
"http://smhwtfnews.com/watch-ignorant-mississippi-folks-explain-why-they-hate-obama-video/","WATCH: Ignorant Mississippi Folks Explain Why They Hate Obama (Video)","Why are so many white, poor, rural men conservative, even though liberal policies would help them?

And why do they hate President Barack Obama so much?

Scroll Down for Video…

These questions have baffled liberals for ages. In 2012, Bill Maher sent documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi out to ask them. She went to a rural part of Mississippi — the poorest and most conservative state in the Union — and talked with some white guys of varying ages and income levels.



What these southern men have to say might not surprise you, but you’ve got to give them props for being so affable and upfront with the daughter of Rep. Nancy “Devil Woman” Pelosi (D-Calif.)



Most striking is how even the least fortunate of these men stoically accepts his economic fate, and how deeply and sincerely these men cherish their beliefs — which seem so grim, heartless, and unappealing to the rest of us.Watch these white, rural men explain why they’re so conservative.White, conservative men explain why they hate Obama:

“One thing, he’s named ‘Obama’”

“This is America. Our president should be American. Not Muslim.”

Why they hate Obamacare even though they need healthcare:

I hate Obamacare. It’s retarded.

Back when i was growing up, and my parents were growing up, and my grandparents were growing up, we didn’t have all that and people still made it. And back then, people pulled their own weight, they didn’t sit around waiting for everyone else to take care of them.

Why they don’t want the government to fix the economy:

It’ll take care of itself. You put God in the saddle, it’ll all be okay.

Why they vote Republican even though it hasn’t worked for them:

But it COULD [work]. It hasn’t, but it could.

We would rather go broke and die hungry than to give up our moral beliefs.

Pelosi’s most baffling exchange was with a chatty, tooth-challenged man who said, “I don’t care for the government.” When an astonished Pelosi reminded him that he’s on food stamps, the man replied:

“Yeah, but I think I deserve food stamps. I have no employment.”

Since 51 percent of people in the state of Mississippi are female, and 37 percent are African American (according to the U.S. Census), we wish Pelosi had also talked with some women and blacks. Nonetheless, Pelosi’s interviews shed a fascinating light on how these white, male conservatives think.","2014-07-27 00:00:00","0","45.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","2.0","75.0","50.0","0.0","170.0","7.0","31.0","6","401","30.40","83.46","10.48","21.92","16.71","17.96","82.79","50.37","14.71","8.98","2.00","1.50","0.75","1.25","3.49","5.74","3.99","10.72","9.23","7.73","8.48","2.24","19.45","3.49","1.50","3.74","1.00","3.24","4.74","2.24","2.49","0.00","1.25","0.50","15.96","0.75","0.25","1.25","3.74","13.47","2.24","2.99","2.24","2.00","0.75","3.99","2.74","2.00","0.50","0.25","1.25","0.25","0.00","0.00","1.00","7.23","2.49","0.75","3.49","0.75","0.00","4.49","11.22","1.50","8.73","2.00","4.74","2.49","3.24","0.75","0.00","1.75","1.50","0.25","0.75","0.25","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.00","23.69","6.73","6.48","1.25","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.50","2.74","3.99","1.00","0.50","1831","7.23","21.94736842105263","534","400","25","80.62","10.0","6.0","10.96","9.7","71","7.833333333333334","15.5","241","18.95","9","0.49","0","19","4","28","0","34","35","0","3","5","38","37","0","28","0","0","38","7","25","0","1","3","9","1","15","19","7","6","31","9","1","2","0","12"
"http://smhwtfnews.com/ferguson-gang-leader-admits-eric-holder-paid-us-to-start-riots/","Ferguson Gang Leader Admits “Eric Holder Paid Us To Start Riots”","Eric Holder’s career has survived a long list of scandals; The 2008 Black Panther debacle, overturning Arizona’s immigration laws and ‘Fast and Furious‘ immediately spring to mind. These, however, pale in comparison to the recent allegations against Holder, the likes of which could easily land the Attorney General behind bars.

Evidence has been uncovered showing Eric Holder contributed funds to Ferguson’s gang population as incentive to loot and spread civil unrest in the area. These angry, government-sponsored terrorists have systematically infiltrated peaceful protests with the intention of escalating the situation and inciting riots.

A local gang leader came forward last week after being arrested during a night of mass-looting. The unnamed criminal is using his information to bargain for a reduced sentence.

Allegedly, Holder’s goal behind pouring the proverbial gasoline on an already volatile scene is to test militarized police response in a martial law scenario. It is also suspected that the riots have been started as the latest in distractions from the diabolical duo of Obama and Holder. This isn’t the first time they have created a media bait-and-switch to cover up any of their numerous crimes and blunders.

Officials have yet to publicly identify the damaging evidence submitted by the gang member, and are still in the process of verifying the legitimacy of said items. Judge Rineheart of the 22nd Circuit Court in St. Louis is presiding over the case, and has reviewed the materials. During a phone interview with National Report Judge Rineheart stated “The evidence I have seen is incredibly convincing.”

Holder is not yet officially charged with a crime, but it’s expected that a warrant could be issued for him within the coming days. Obama’s spokespeople have declined to comment.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/floyd-mayweather-knocked-out-in-sparring-session-while-training-for-pacquiao-fight/","Floyd Mayweather Knocked Out In Sparring Session While Training For Pacquiao Fight!","Las Vegas – Recent reports out of a gym in Las Vegas have reported that a strange smelling Italian/Irish immigrant by the name of Peter McFarboroni has knocked out the undisputed, undefeated boxing great Floyd Mayweather.

Where the greats have failed, this man who many thought was simply the gym’s manager, succeeded by knocking out Mayweather in a mere sparring session while he is preparing for his upcoming Pacquiao match with what McFarboroni called a haymaker. “Jumpinbegonias,” the near Leprechaun exclaimed as he saw the stars in Mayweather’s eyes as the champ spun around six times, stuck out his tongue, and collapsed to the ground.

“I threw him off his game by saying he could not read which made him drop his guard and get angry, then all I had to do was dodge to the right, block, back, back, and then punch him in his weak spot Next thing you know, the lad’s down for the count,” said McFarboronni as he slid back into his pink jogging suit and proceeded to start mopping the sauna before the gym’s closing hours.

Mayweather has claimed that the fight never happened because it was never sanctioned. This is however the first time an unsanctioned bout did not land Mayweather behind bars. [Continue Reading]

They will be implanted to help identify individuals immediately. According to the report, the technology is used to answer one question, “Am I who I say I am?”



Some worry, however, that the RFID Microchip will give the government too much power, allowing them to track every move. In some states, like Virginia, legislation is in process to stop this from happening. The report also reveals an RFID Brain Chip that has been developed and is currently being tested on several humans. Proof the RFID Microchip is in Obamacare below:



It was reported that the use of Micro-Chips in Bill H.R. 4872 was located on Page 1014 under “National Medical Device Registry” it tells about a “Class II Device That is Implantable” and yes, they passed the bill. Read Page “1014″ In The H.R. 4872 Read Class II Special Controls Guidance For FDA Staff

With the RFID Microchip they can track the movement of the people that are implanted. They can also control the money and food of the people. It is also reported to be possible to even kill the people that don’t obey. The HR 3962 Bill is an exact copy of the HR 3200 bill in with the exception of just a few words removed concerning the RFID Microchip but the ability to Chip Every Citizen of the United States is still in the bill.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/barack-obama-to-declare-cuba-51st-state-in-2016/","Barack Obama To Declare Cuba 51st State In 2016","In a surprise move today U.S. President Barak Obama made a declaration that sent shockwaves down both sides of the House and Senate floor. “It may take my final two years in office, but make no mistake: Cuba will be our 51st state,” Obama said.

Obama cites one reason for incorporating the island nation: “We need another vacation state.”

Below: U.S. flag redesign compositions to reflect all 51 states

“The tyranny of Fidel Castro can be overlooked now that he has stepped down, and we can take this opportunity to grow our borders for the betterment of our domestic travel options,” the president said. “Hawaii has played itself out. As beautiful as it is, we’ve all been there, done that. We don’t have another domestic tropical island where we can vacation without a passport. We need another. And Cuba is it.”

Currently Americans are not allowed to travel to Cuba; however, if the country does become a part of the United States, Americans will be able to visit the lush Caribbean island restriction free.

Estaban Arnaz, spokesman for Cuba’s president Raul Castro, when asked about becoming part of the United States, said simply, “We’re in.”

“This is yet another attempt by the president to abuse his executive power,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) told reporters, acknowledging that, in fact “the way the president has been able to bend the rules thus far, I wouldn’t be surprised if this actually happens, but in the end, do I care? F*ck no. I’ve never been to Cuba. I’m excited to check it out.”

Although a 51 star flag design is still in the works, the cost of changing the American flag to show 51 stars will be passed on to American workers, in what’s being called “The Star Tax.” FICA deductions will increase 2% beginning in March 2016.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/kerry-washington-quits-scandal-after-cheating-rumors/","Kerry Washington Quits Scandal After Cheating Rumors","HOLLYWOOD, CA– In one of the most shocking situations recently in Hollywood, Kerry Washington, who recently gave birth to Isabelle Amarachi Asomugha with husband and former NFL player Nnamdi Asomugha, has quit the hit show Scandal amid cheating rumors.

Washington has been the center of several rumors involving her daughter, and if the baby is truly her husbands. Their has been speculation that Nnamdi Asomugha took a paternity test following the birth of their child, fearing that his daughter is a direct result of adultery.

Since 2012, Washington has starred in the ABC drama Scandal, a Shonda Rhimes series in which Washington plays Olivia Pope, a crisis management expert to the President.

“I don’t understand how Kerry could go from this wholesome actress playing this virtuous feminine role, to being engulfed in these unfortunate allegations.” Show creator Shonda Rhimes said during a press conference Thursday evening. “Although this is a terrible situation, I am proud of Kerry for having the courage in stepping down from her role, but we are going to have a tough task finding a replacement who can bring more class and righteousness to this beloved character.”

Tough task indeed.

Kerry Washington’s close friend, who goes by the name R. Polanski, recently confirmed to the media that the star will not be returning to the show. Citing reasons of “moral disappointment, shame, dishonor and disgrace” within herself; attributes of which she stated she previously never came in touch with, in or out of her roles.

In 2013, Washington gained wide public recognition for her role and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television series.

Big shoes to fill.

So one can see why there are all sorts of scrambling within the production team to find a suitable replacement. Talking heads in Hollywood have thrown out names from Nia Long (The Best Man Holiday, Love Jones) to Gabrielle Union (Being Mary Jane, Think Like A Man Too).

"http://smhwtfnews.com/unreleased-video-shows-donald-sterlings-ex-mistress-v-stiviano-on-a-racist-tirade-i-dont-understand-black-people/","Unreleased Video Shows Donald Sterling’s ex-mistress V. Stiviano On A Racist Tirade: ‘I don’t understand black people’","Well if this isn’t the pot calling the kettle anti-black.

V. Stiviano, who secretly recorded NBA owner Donald Sterling’s slurs against African-Americans, made a few of her own in two videos made public Saturday by TMZ.com.

“I don’t understand black people,” the 31-year-old model snaps in one clip. “The minute you give them a little bit of money, they don’t know what to do with it.

“They just act crazy. … They’re like, ‘Yo, I wanna put some rims on top of my rims. And my rims are gonna turn around, so I’m gonna call them — what? Spinners.’”

Stiviano, caught on camera during the shooting of a 2011 reality show pilot about gold-diggers, wasn’t finished sounding like Sterling.

“They do stupid s— like that, when there’s people starving around the world,” she announces. “That’s what people want to do with their money?”

In the second clip, Stiviano is riding shotgun while holding an Elmo doll as an African-American friend drives.

Speaking to the stuffed Muppet, Stiviano cracks, “We don’t like black people.”

She is black and Mexican.

Stiviano’s taped conversation with the 80-year-old Sterling turned the Los Angeles Clippers owner into a pariah, leading to a lifetime ban from the NBA and the forced sale of his team. The billionaire real estate mogul was also fined $2.5 million.

Sterling, in yet another secretly taped conversation, claimed his vile remarks were his version of sweet talk as he tried to bed the decades-younger Stiviano.

Stiviano claimed that she never slept with Sterling despite the gifts that he lavished upon her — including $500,000 in luxury cars and a $1.8 million Los Angeles duplex.

Sterling’s wife cut a deal last week to sell the Clippers for $2 billion, but lawyers filed suit on behalf of her litigious husband to fight the sale in court.

Sterling’s lawsuit against the league also seeks to overturn his suspension from the sport, although an NBA lawyer dismissed the move as “entirely baseless.”

Spouse Shelly Sterling seized control of her husband’s enormous holdings after Donald Sterling was branded “mentally incapacitated” by two neurologists who diagnosed him with dementia.

The other 29 NBA owners, who were initially expected to vote this week on whether to oust Sterling, will instead decide on the proposed purchase by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver scheduled a Wednesday meeting with civil rights leaders to discuss the sale of the Clippers and other issues, said the Rev. Al Sharpton.","2014-05-31 00:00:00","0","41.0","18.0","3.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","75.0","50.0","0.0","169.0","7.0","23.0","6","418","91.86","77.80","9.58","18.70","16.72","24.16","71.05","42.34","10.29","6.46","1.20","0.24","0.24","3.35","1.44","3.83","8.61","14.35","5.02","3.11","4.07","1.44","10.05","2.63","2.39","1.91","4.07","1.20","1.91","0.72","1.20","0.00","0.72","0.00","12.92","0.96","0.24","1.91","2.15","6.70","0.96","1.20","0.96","0.48","0.48","3.11","2.87","1.44","0.96","0.24","1.20","0.24","0.48","0.00","0.48","6.46","2.39","1.20","3.59","0.24","0.00","3.35","5.74","1.20","12.20","2.39","4.55","5.26","2.15","0.72","0.48","1.67","0.00","0.00","1.20","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.24","0.00","22.73","5.98","5.50","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.00","2.15","3.83","3.83","0.00","0.96","1964","8.02","21.7","573","410","23","70.33","9.5","7.9","12.06","11.6","91","5.928571428571429","17.998048780487807","266","20.5","11","0.41","0","6","17","42","0","54","36","1","0","1","68","48","2","23","0","0","18","11","15","0","0","1","11","0","12","23","8","8","14","7","0","6","0","1"
"http://smhwtfnews.com/woman-accidentally-shoots-herself-with-gun-she-bought-for-ferguson-riots/","Woman Accidentally Shoots Herself with Gun She Bought For Ferguson Riots","As the Grand Jury decision on whether or not to indict Ferguson,MO police officer Darren Wilson in the death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown draws near, people around the area have begun to load up on firearms and ammunition. While it remains to be seen if the panic is warranted – everyone from community leaders to President Obama have stressed the need for peace following the announcement – the added guns in the hands of people who may not know how to properly use them has already seen at least one casualty.

St. Louis police are reporting that a 26-year-old woman has accidentally killed herself with a gun she had purchased in anticipation for Ferguson riots.

The accident occurred when the car the woman, identified as Becca Campbell, was riding in rear-ended a car in front of them. Typically a fender bender would not cause loss of life, but the woman’s gun discharged in the collision and the bullet struck her in the head.

According to KMOV:

The boyfriend, who wasn’t identified, told police that the couple had bought a gun because of fears of unrest related to the pending grand jury decision on the shooting of Michael Brown, the sources said.

He told investigators that as they drove late Friday night, the victim waved a gun, jokingly saying the couple were ready for Ferguson, the sources said.

He ducked to get out of the way of the gun and accidentally rear-ended another car. He said the accident caused the gun to go off and she was struck by a bullet in the head, the sources said.

Guns, already a problem for America more generally, are becoming an increasing concern for residents and law enforcement around Ferguson. As tensions rise – and urged on by a giddy media which can’t help but stoke the flames in pursuit of ratings boosts – the number of scared people buying firearms to “protect” themselves from their neighbors is skyrocketing. One Ferguson gun store owner told reporters that his sales have gone up by around 700% this month.

In a sign of just how bad it has gotten, store owners, like the one mentioned above, are now beginning to close up their shops and ship out their lethal stock so no more weapons can find their way onto the streets in the coming weeks. It’s a testament to the very real fear people feel that even the promise of large profits can’t entice gun shop owners from ignoring pleas from law enforcement and staying open for business.

Whether or not violence erupts after the decision, the fact that hundreds of more guns are now in the community is a problem that will likely plague Ferguson long after the protests end.

"http://smhwtfnews.com/george-w-bush-arrested-for-possession-of-cocaine/","George W. Bush Arrested For Possession Of Cocaine","One of the most notorious Presidents in history of The United States of America is back in the spotlight, but not because of his politics. George W. Bush was arrested in a Dallas suburb late Tuesday evening after a routine traffic stop uncovered over an ounce of cocaine in his glove compartment.

Dallas police say they pulled over Bush after he made a right turn without signaling. Officers report they were surprised when seeing it was the ex-president, but felt something was off about his behavior. They say Bush seemed under the influence of a narcotic, and the officers on-scene asked to search the car. Curiously, Bush consented, and police found the narcotics.“We pulled over the truck and were about to write a simple traffic ticket and things escalated fast,” said officer Charles Cane, a veteran officer with the Dallas Police Department. “At first my partner and I were stunned with who was in the truck ,and [Bush] began to crack jokes and asked if we wanted to take a picture with him. I noticed he was sniffling quite a bit and the glaze on his eyes screamed that the was under the influence.”Cane said that once the officers uncovered the cocaine, Bush tried to bribe them to keep from getting arrested. When that failed, he turned to threats and rambling, reportedly saying that he would ‘get the FBI to kick their a–’ and that ‘Presidents can break any laws they want.’

“I broke so many laws when I was in office, and I didn’t see you coming to try to arrest me then!” Bush shouted at police officers. “I’ve been doing coke for decades! I used to blow lines out of a Skull & Bones in New Haven tittie bars when you were making nice in your diapers, kid. You just want your name in the papers next to mine.”

“It was a tough arrest to make, but I didn’t become a police officer to make easy decisions. He begged me over and over to let it slide, then he offered me money, then he called me an ass—-, but that is the way the law goes. We don’t offer special treatment to anyone in Dallas. I don’t care who you are.”

Representatives for Bush have yet to comment, but bail was set at $5,000 and posted immediately. Bush spent less than 6 hours in a holding cell before being released.","2014-07-31 00:00:00","0","9.0","12.0","3.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","46.0","42.0","0.0","89.0","5.0","3.0","1","406","81.15","69.76","39.85","34.31","19.33","16.01","83.99","52.71","13.79","10.34","3.69","0.74","1.48","2.96","1.48","3.45","8.62","15.27","7.14","2.71","6.90","1.48","17.49","4.19","1.72","1.48","1.48","1.23","2.96","1.48","0.99","0.25","0.25","0.49","11.08","0.00","0.25","0.00","2.96","8.87","1.72","1.97","1.23","1.97","0.00","2.71","3.45","1.23","1.72","0.25","1.48","0.99","0.00","0.00","0.49","10.84","0.99","0.99","8.13","0.74","0.74","8.62","6.40","0.99","15.52","2.46","6.90","6.40","4.68","0.74","0.00","0.49","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.75","5.17","4.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.74","2.96","1.72","0.00","0.99","1726","6.94","25.6875","546","401","22","69.92","10.3","8.0","8.82","8.9","61","8.3","15.364788029925188","233","22.62","11","0.52","0","18","4","39","0","47","18","1","0","2","47","29","1","24","0","0","36","8","15","0","1","3","17","0","20","39","11","10","12","3","0","2","0","4"

"http://smhwtfnews.com/lol-drunk-sarah-palin-gives-speech-on-impeaching-obamavideo/","LOL: Drunk Sarah Palin Gives Speech On Impeaching Obama(VIDEO)","At the Western Conservative Summit this last week, Sarah Palin drunkenly doubled down on her calls for impeachment after a string of word soup tailored together from past conservative talking points. Am I being critical of Palin’s intelligence while she stumbles through this 30 minutes speech by calling her “drunken”? No. I do believe that Palin is 99% moron, but this one appears to be a moron that had a few too many to drink that evening before they got up for their speaking engagement.



The speech seemed to have been written by some neo-libertarian tribute to Ayn Rand by offering a protagonist “the forgotten man”. Her speech didn’t ever cover one issue, but instead turned Tea Party talking points into a macabre poetry slam competition. Palin says absolutely nothing of substance in her speech aside from her general feelings about society and her hatred of the other side of politics.

The only thing that seems certain in Palin’s world is that Obama is evil and facts are relative. Her drive towards impeachment in the drunken speech strings together random accusations as public facts (most of which have been debunked). Palin even mentions the 2008 “loophole” signed by former President Bush to give refugee status to children as a reason to impeach Obama. Because she is just that dumb… and most likely drunk.This video is 30 minutes of “are you fucking kidding me?” that is only topped off by the introduction to Palin which labels her as the “most influential woman in the history of the republican party”. That doesn’t help the republicans in their defense of the “war on women” at all.

"https://theinternetpost.net/2014/07/17/students-offered-grants-if-they-tweet-pro-israeli-propaganda-2/","Students Offered Grants if they Tweet Pro-Israeli Propaganda","This article was published in August 2013, but it is even more relevant today, as the world witnesses more attacks on Gaza and an important propaganda operation from Israel.

In a campaign to improve its image abroad, the Israeli government plans to provide scholarships to hundreds of students at its seven universities in exchange for their making pro-Israel Facebook posts and tweets to foreign audiences.

The students making the posts will not reveal online that they are funded by the Israeli government, according to correspondence about the plan revealed in the Haaretz newspaper.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, which will oversee the programme, confirmed its launch and wrote that its aim was to “strengthen Israeli public diplomacy and make it fit the changes in the means of information consumption”.

The government’s hand is to be invisible to the foreign audiences. Daniel Seaman, the official who has been planning the effort, wrote in a letter on 5 August to a body authorising government projects that “the idea requires not making the role of the state stand out and therefore it is necessary to adhere to great involvement of the students themselves, without political linkage or affiliation”.

According to the plan, students are to be organised into units at each university, with a chief co-ordinator who receives a full scholarship, three desk co-ordinators for language, graphics and research who receive lesser scholarships and students termed “activists” who will receive a “minimal scholarship”.

Mr Netanyahu’s aides said the main topics the units would address related to political and security issues, combating calls to boycott Israel and combating efforts to question Israel’s legitimacy. The officials said the students would stress Israeli democratic values, freedom of religion and pluralism.

But Alon Liel, the doveish former director-general of the Israeli foreign ministry, criticised the plan as “quite disgusting”. “University students should be educated to think freely. When you buy the mind of a student, he becomes a puppet of the Israeli government grant,” he said. “You can give a grant to do social work or teach but not to do propaganda on controversial issues for the government.”

–Defense Department spent millions to research social network

s 08 Jul 2014 The activities of users of Twitter and other social media services were recorded and analysed as part of a major project funded by the US military, in a program that covers ground similar to Facebook’s controversial experiment into how to control emotions by manipulating news feeds. Research funded directly or indirectly by the US Department of Defense’s military research department, known as Darpa, has involved users of some of the internet’s largest destinations, including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Kickstarter, for studies of social connections and how messages spread..

.Several of the DoD-funded studies went further than merely monitoring what users were communicating on their own, instead messaging unwitting participants in order to track and study how they responded.

Any generalization can always be shown to be wrong in some aspects. The point of highlighting this particular article, by , of ‘Lions of Liberty’ is that the answer is more likely “Yes” than “No”.

Besides that, a very worthwhile overview of American history is presented, together with discussion on all the main wars and some history of other countries who gained their “independence” without fighting.

All this in a light-hearted approach and in an entertaining manner.

by Bionic Mosquito

Memorial Day is a US federal holiday wherein the men and women who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces are remembered.

This weekend and continuing through Monday Americans will witness countless varied acts of praise for those who have died in America’s wars. Ball games, parades, pancake breakfasts, even Sunday church service (Laurence Vance, be on alert) – one or more of these will offer opportunities for just about any patriotic American looking for an opportunity to worship.

Apparently, about 1.3 million Americans died in the wars since 1775 (not counting suicides, apparently one every 65 seconds since 1999). It is worth considering: for what did they die? Was any of it worth it?

(Note: I will not, in this post, examine the costs and devastation for those victims of American military aggression, more by orders of magnitude – Memorial Day does not recognize those who died on the other side….For the most part, apparently, Americans don’t care. There is no American holiday for you!)

Revolutionary War

I will spend the most digits on this war, as even the most principled anti-war critic might consider it an appropriate war.

The American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the American War of Independence, or simply the Revolutionary War in the United States, was the successful military rebellion against Great Britain of Thirteen American Colonies…

Certainly, if there was one war worthwhile in the history of the United States, it would have to be this one. Who on earth could possibly disagree (well, besides King George)?

“Hey, back here…I have a question: Whose independence was won?”

It seems fair to ask if the war was worth it. What if the war wasn’t fought? What was this “independence”? “Independence” for whom? Was life for the average American different than life for the average Brit twenty years after the war? One hundred years? Two hundred years? Was life for the average American different after the war than it might have been had this war not been fought at all, if the colonies remained part of the empire? What of the path of Canada or Australia? Did the American Revolutionary War result in a vastly different life for the average American than it did for the average Canadian or Australian?

I don’t recall reading about a Canadian war for independence. Let’s check:

Canada Day (French: Fête du Canada) is the national day of Canada, a federal statutory holiday celebrating the anniversary of the July 1, 1867, enactment of the British North America Act, 1867 (today called the Constitution Act, 1867), which united three colonies into a single country called Canada within the British Empire.

Frequently referred to as “Canada’s birthday”, particularly in the popular press, the occasion marks the joining of the British North American colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the Province of Canada into a federation of four provinces (the Province of Canada being divided, in the process, into Ontario and Quebec) on July 1, 1867. Canada became a kingdom in its own right on that date, but the British parliament and Cabinet kept limited rights of political control over the new country that were shed by stages over the years until the last vestiges were surrendered in 1982, when the Constitution Act patriated the Canadian constitution.

Canada Day? What? It sounds so…passive. No war, no blood, no glory? They just, kind of, decided? No rockets’ red glare? What do they do in place of fireworks? Trade pens? They call it a “birthday”! It is so…non-violent. No war, plus they got the greatest rock band of all time out of the deal.

What about the Aussies? Hold onto your vegemite sandwich; you won’t believe this. They don’t even know when they got independence; well not exactly anyway:

We only became independent of Britain on this day [March 3] in 1986.

You might think this statement absurd. Surely Australia has been independent for a lot longer than that? Let me provide a lawyer’s answer: yes and no. Yes, Australia as a nation became independent at some unknown date after 1931. By 1931 it had the power to exercise independence but chose not to do so for some time.

An unknown date? Don’t they care?

They could have done it in 1931, but didn’t? No bullets, no crossing the Murrumbidgee covered in ice, no Valley Styx, no nothing? Were they upset that they didn’t get to fight a war? Did they declare a war, and Britain forgot to attend?

The Australian states, however, did not gain their independence from Britain at that time. Bizarrely, they remained colonial dependencies of the British crown, despite being constituent parts of an independent nation. This meant state governors were appointed by the Queen on the advice of British ministers and that it was the Queen of the United Kingdom (not the Queen of Australia) who gave royal assent to state bills.

So what happened in 1986?

On March 3, 1986, these acts, the Australia Acts, came into force. They state that the British government is no longer responsible for the government of any state and that the Westminster parliament can no longer legislate for Australia. Most important, they transferred into Australian hands full control of all Australia’s constitutional documents. So March 3, 1986, is the day Australia achieved complete independence from Britain. Happy Australian Independence Day.

Well, unlike the Canadians and Australians, at least the Americans got to stay out of the British wars for the intervening 200 years…wait, check that. More on this later, I think.

"https://theinternetpost.net/2014/02/20/agenda-21-is-increasing-the-scope-of-its-enslavement-of-america/","Agenda 21 Is Increasing the Scope of Its Enslavement of America","This ‘IntelliHub’ post awakens interest in the global control agenda, partially driven by the creed and power of a movement called ‘Agenda 21’, a birth-child of the UN.

A general idea of the movement, in particular as it relates to Australia, is provided in the ‘tgrule’ post ” What Our (Australian) Government “neglects” To Tell You “. In general it is a mechanism by which the UN gains control of sovereign countries by bypassing the elected democratic governments, parliaments and their constitutions.

So, this “Draconian Menace” is global, not just a threat to America. It goes hand in hand with the regime change agenda and chaos deliberately put in place in other countries which do not meekly sign up to this “New World Order” control procedure.

Here is a portion of the title post, the whole of which is linked here. If this fails to shake your beliefs in your personal and national security, there is plenty more to read about if you follow the related links.

Agenda 21 destroys people from all walks of life. Its policies are draconian By Dave Hodges (INTELLIHUB) — Its unconstitutional dictates are carried out with impunity. Agenda 21 seeks to destroy the family by separating children from parents. Its allies are destroying private property rights. Agenda 21 wants to remove all people from rural areas through the enforcement of the anti-small farmer administratively contrived policies frequently concocted by bureaucrats who are outside the reach of the electorate. Agenda 21 proponents allow no discourse as to the veracity and legitimacy of its policies. Agenda 21 advocates pursue a course of extreme revenge against those who speak out against its policies. Agenda 21 is the driving force behind the ridiculous and mindless control policies besieging America under the guise of HOA regulations. Agenda 21 is the administrative arm of the climate change extremists who use pseudoscience to pursue policies related to the elimination of private property rights. As some of you already know, Agenda 21 seeks to remove nearly all energy usage from the populace. Ultimately, Agenda 21 creators seek to reduce the population by 90%. Agenda 21 is the enemy of humanity and this article is a snap shot of how the Agenda 21 forces are attacking people on an individual, a state and a regional basis. Agenda 21 Attacks Its Detractors by Separating Families Anti-Agenda 21 activist, Stacy Lynne, defeated several Agenda 21 proposals in Fort Collins, Colorado, which would have cost the local community hundreds of jobs. And what was her reward? Did she get a commendation from the city council? Did she get a meritorious service award from Mayor? What she received was one of the most heinous political retaliations in recent history. Her son, Jaden, was stolen by the Agenda 21 controlled courts in Larimer County, Colorado. Her son was taken without so much as allegation of wrong doing and the part of Stacy. Despite never having had her parental rights severed, she has not been allowed to see her son in 16 months. Agenda 21 Attacks “Off the Grid” Americans Kim Fahey, located in Antelope Valley, CA., constructed one of the most unique homes in the United States. He received notoriety for the design of his home which became affectionately known as Phonehenge. Fahey was also living off the grid, a huge violation of Agenda 21 protocols. The Agenda 21 beholding LA County Sheriff Swat team subsequently descended upon Fahey and arrested him for code violations. He was sentenced to 543 days in jail because he could not afford to haul away the debris of his home which was demolished by the County. However, the real target, was his off the grid lifestyle. Agenda 21 Attacks Small Farmers Agenda 21 Forces Steal A Million Acres and An Entire Town Agenda 21 Attacks An Entire Region of the Country Conclusion There was a time, not so long ago, if you mentioned Agenda 21, you were labeled a tin-foil hat conspiracy theorist. Only two years ago, I was at a town hall meeting and Senator McCain was asked about Agenda 21 and he said that he did not know what Agenda 21 was. Today, Agenda is out in the open for all who want to see.

Activist Post

Doesn’t there always seem to be funny business with these alleged school shootings? The latest is the Marysville, Washington active shooter event taking place today.

This post isn’t to discuss the details of the ongoing event, but rather to point out that it appears the Marysville Police were scheduled to run a SWAT training exercise yesterday or perhaps today too. We can’t know for sure because they scraped all references to it from the Internet.

Major props to Lori Price of LegitGov for catching this:

CNN host Brooke Baldwin, covering breaking news of the school shooting in Marysville, Washington, announces that she has a live update regarding the school shooting. Baldwin said she’s been just handed a paper with new information, which she will read on the air. She asks for viewers to, quoting, “bear with her,” as she reads it “cold.” She reads: “Marysville Police will be holding SWAT training today –” Baldwin then interrupts herself, and states, “Oh. This is from yesterday.” Later, the host announces, “initially, students thought this was a fire drill.”

When Googling the SWAT drill in Marysville, the official school district website is the first result:

However, when you click on this link, the announcement has been disappeared and replaced by the following:

October 24, 2014: The Marysville Pilchuck High School is currently in lock down due to an emergency situation. Police and emergency services have responded. The Marysville School District lock down procedures will remain in effect at Pilchuck until further notice from law enforcement. We will continue to forward communication in cooperation with law enforcement. Students who attend MPHS campus are being relocated to the Shoultes Community Church at the corner of 116th and 51st Street. Buses will take students home from there. Those parents in the area wanting to pick up their child will need to go to the church location and sign out their child out with school administrator or law enforcement. All after-school activities across the district are canceled today.

We may be dealing with yet another vicious false flag by the authorities to justify gun control and an increased police state. Please add any evidence you can find to the comment section below.

"https://theinternetpost.net/2014/10/08/cnn-axes-300-jobs/","CNN axes 300 jobs","Turner Broadcasting, the parent company of CNN, will cut its total workforce by about 10% in the coming weeks through a mix of buyouts, layoffs and other measures, the company said Monday.

The reductions are part of a broader effort to save money and refocus investment, known internally as Turner 2020.

The company said about 1,475 positions — out of 14,000 full-time positions worldwide — would be eliminated in the coming weeks.

Within CNN Worldwide, where the workforce totals roughly 3,500, about 300 positions will be cut, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan, totaling 8.5%.

CNN Worldwide includes CNN’s U.S. and International television channels, HLN, CNN Digital, and other ventures.

About 130 of the CNN reductions are being achieved through voluntary buyouts, the person said.

A buyout program for Turner staffers age 55 and older with ten-plus years at the company was announced in August.

The remainder of the CNN positions, about 170, will be cut through layoffs.

Along with CNN, Turner owns cable channels like TNT, TBS, and the Cartoon Network. The headcount reductions there will also come from both buyouts and layoffs.

The eliminations “are at all levels of the company’s news, entertainment, kids, young adult and sports networks and businesses, as well as corporate functions, in 18 Turner locations around the world,” Turner CEO John Martin said in a memorandum to staffers.

“Those whose jobs are impacted will receive every consideration and the respect they are due, starting with severance pay for transition,” Martin wrote. “Whatever their job title, business unit or location, they have contributed to the success story that is Turner Broadcasting, and they leave with our thanks and sincere best wishes.”

The layoffs will take place in the next two weeks.

18 Jul 2014 CNN’s International correspondent Diana Magnay has been removed from covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after she branded a group of Israelis ‘scum’ on Thursday. Magnay had taken to Twitter to express her fury after a group of whooping Israelis watching missile strikes ‘threatened to destroy’ her team’s car if the British reporter used negative language. Almost as soon as she posted the controversial comment, she deleted it – but not before it was retweeted more than 200 times. CNN said it has now assigned her to Moscow.

"https://theinternetpost.net/2014/04/04/us-secretly-created-cuban-twitter-to-stir-unrest-and-undermine-government/","US secretly created ‘Cuban Twitter’ to stir unrest and undermine government","In July 2010, Joe McSpedon, a US government official, flew to Barcelona to put the final touches on a secret plan to build a social media project aimed at undermining Cuba’s communist government.

McSpedon and his team of high-tech contractors had come in from Costa Rica and Nicaragua, Washington and Denver. Their mission: to launch a messaging network that could reach hundreds of thousands of Cubans. To hide the network from the Cuban government, they would set up a byzantine system of front companies using a Cayman Islands bank account, and recruit unsuspecting executives who would not be told of the company’s ties to the US government.

McSpedon didn’t work for the CIA. This was a program paid for and run by the US Agency for International Development, best known for overseeing billions of dollars in US humanitarian aid.

According to documents obtained by the Associated Press and multiple interviews with people involved in the project, the plan was to develop a bare-bones “Cuban Twitter,” using cellphone text messaging to evade Cuba’s strict control of information and its stranglehold restrictions over the internet. In a play on Twitter, it was called ZunZuneo — slang for a Cuban hummingbird’s tweet.

Documents show the US government planned to build a subscriber base through “non-controversial content”: news messages on soccer, music, and hurricane updates. Later when the network reached a critical mass of subscribers, perhaps hundreds of thousands, operators would introduce political content aimed at inspiring Cubans to organize “smart mobs” — mass gatherings called at a moment’s notice that might trigger a Cuban spring, or, as one USAid document put it, “renegotiate the balance of power between the state and society.”

At its peak, the project drew in more than 40,000 Cubans to share news and exchange opinions. But its subscribers were never aware it was created by the US government, or that American contractors were gathering their private data in the hope that it might be used for political purposes.

“There will be absolutely no mention of United States government involvement,” according to a 2010 memo from Mobile Accord, one of the project’s contractors. “This is absolutely crucial for the long-term success of the service and to ensure the success of the Mission.”

The program’s legality is unclear: US law requires that any covert action by a federal agency must have a presidential authorization. Officials at USAid would not say who had approved the program or whether the White House was aware of it. McSpedon, the most senior official named in the documents obtained by the AP, is a mid-level manager who declined to comment.

USAid spokesman Matt Herrick said the agency is proud of its Cuba programs and noted that congressional investigators reviewed them last year and found them to be consistent with US law.

“USAid is a development agency, not an intelligence agency, and we work all over the world to help people exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms, and give them access to tools to improve their lives and connect with the outside world,” he said.","2014-04-04 11:59:16","0","83.0","4.0","165.0","0.0","18.0","0.0","535.0","512.0","100.0","57.0","0.0","7.0","0","512","96.48","82.08","5.73","73.22","26.95","28.52","78.32","44.73","7.62","3.71","0.00","1.76","0.00","0.39","1.56","3.91","10.16","15.04","5.66","1.17","4.69","1.17","11.13","2.93","1.17","0.98","2.15","0.98","2.93","2.73","0.20","0.00","0.20","0.00","10.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.39","8.59","1.56","1.56","1.37","1.95","1.17","1.95","1.95","0.39","1.17","0.39","0.78","0.20","0.59","0.00","0.00","12.70","4.30","2.93","5.47","1.17","0.39","4.88","4.10","1.17","9.77","1.56","5.86","2.34","9.57","1.37","0.20","1.17","0.00","0.00","0.78","0.00","0.39","0.39","0.00","0.00","15.04","3.71","5.47","0.59","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.98","2.73","1.56","0.00","0.00","2529","9.34","30.58823529411765","797","508","19","44.37","14.9","13.7","13.0","16.3","141","12.0","23.78236220472441","286","26.88","10","0.42","0","21","6","57","0","61","37","1","1","9","99","51","4","36","0","0","11","8","8","0","1","1","19","0","26","20","9","16","3","8","2","3","0","1"

We’ve known for 5,000 years that mass spying on one’s own people is always aimed at grabbing power and crushing dissent, not protecting us from bad guys.

We’ve known for 4,000 years that debts need to be periodically written down, or the entire economy will collapse. And see this.

We’ve known for 2,500 years that prolonged war bankrupts an economy.

We’ve known for 2,000 years that wars are based on lies.

We’ve known for 1,900 years that runaway inequality destroys societies.

We’ve known for thousands of years that debasing currencies leads to economic collapse.

We’ve known for millennia that torture is a form of terrorism.

We’ve known for thousands of years that – when criminals are not punished – crime spreads.

We’ve known for hundreds of years that the failure to punish financial fraud destroys economies, as it destroys all trust in the financial system.

We’ve known for centuries that monopolies and the political influence which accompanies too much power in too few hands are dangerous for free markets.

We’ve known for hundreds of years that companies will try to pawn their debts off on governments, and that it is a huge mistake for governments to allow corporate debt to be backstopped by government.

We’ve known for centuries that powerful people – unless held to account – will get together and steal from everyone else.

We’ve known for hundreds of years that standing armies and warmongering harm Western civilization.

We’ve known for 200 years that allowing private banks to control credit creation eventually destroys the nation’s prosperity.

We’ve known for two centuries that a fiat money system – where the money supply is not pegged to anything real – is harmful in the long-run.

We’ve known for 200 years that a two-party system quickly becomes corrupted.

We’ve known for over a century that torture produces false and useless information.

We’ve known since the 1930s Great Depression that separating depository banking from speculative investment banking is key to economic stability. See this, this, this and this.

We’ve known for 80 years that inflation is a hidden tax.

We’ve known for 79 years that war is a racket that benefits the elites but harms everyone else.

We’ve known since 1988 that quantitative easing doesn’t work to rescue an ailing economy.

We’ve known since 1993 that derivatives such as credit default swaps – if not reined in – could take down the economy. And see this.

We’ve known since 1998 that crony capitalism destroys even the strongest economies, and that economies that are capitalist in name only need major reforms to create accountability and competitive markets.

We’ve known since 2007 or earlier that lax oversight of hedge funds could blow up the economy.

And we knew before the 2008 financial crash and subsequent bailouts that:

The easy credit policy of the Fed and other central banks, the failure to regulate the shadow banking system, and “the use of gimmicks and palliatives” by central banks hurt the economy

Anything other than (1) letting asset prices fall to their true market value, (2) increasing savings rates, and (3) forcing companies to write off bad debts “will only make things worse”

Bailouts of big banks harm the economy

The Fed and other central banks were simply transferring risk from private banks to governments, which could lead to a sovereign debt crisis

Postscript: Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it … and we’ve known that for a long time.

Over 12 years into the so-called “Global War on Terror,” the United States appears to be striking terror into the hearts of the rest of the world.

In their annual End of Year survey, Win/Gallup International found that the United States is considered the number one “greatest threat to peace in the world today” by people across the globe.

The poll of 67,806 respondents from 65 countries found that the U.S. won this dubious distinction by a landslide, as revealed in the chart below.

The BBC explains that the U.S. was deemed a threat by geopolitical allies as well as foes, including a significant portion of U.S. society.

Predictable in some areas (the Middle East and North Africa) but less so in others. Eastern Europe’s 32% figure may be heavily influenced by Russia and Ukraine, but across most of Western Europe there are also lots of figures in the high teens. In the Americas themselves, decades of US meddling have left an awkward legacy. Its neighbours, Mexico (37%) and Canada (17%), clearly have issues. Even 13% of Americans see their own country as a danger.

Before the nation and the world, President Obama pledges to take “action” against “economic inequality,” while simultaneously holding secret negotiations on a Trans Pacific Partnership trade scheme that will quicken the pace of the global Race to the Bottom, deepening economic inequalities. “Lies of omission are even more despicable than the overt variety, because they hide.”

“When you say ‘jobs,’ he says tax cuts – just like the Republicans, only Obama first cites the pain of the unemployed, so that you know he cares.”

“Believe it,” said the current Prevaricator-in-Chief, in the conclusion to his annual litany lies. President Obama’s specialty, honed to theatrical near-perfection over five disastrous years, is in crafting the sympathetic lie, designed to suspend disbelief among those targeted for oblivion, through displays of empathy for the victims. In contrast to the aggressive insults and bluster employed by Republican political actors, whose goal is to incite racist passions against the Other, the sympathetic Democratic liar disarms those who are about to be sacrificed by pretending to feel their pain.

Barack Obama, who has presided over the sharpest increases in economic inequality in U.S. history, adopts the persona of public advocate, reciting wrongs inflicted by unseen and unknown forces that have “deepened” the gap between the rich and the rest of us and “stalled” upward mobility. Having spent half a decade stuffing tens of trillions of dollars into the accounts of an ever shrinking gaggle of financial capitalists, Obama declares this to be “a year of action” in the opposite direction. “Believe it.” And if you do believe it, then crown him the Most Effective Liar of the young century.

Lies of omission are even more despicable than the overt variety, because they hide. The potentially most devastating Obama contribution to economic inequality is being crafted in secret by hundreds of corporate lobbyists and lawyers and their revolving-door counterparts in government. The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, described as “NAFTA on steroids,” would accelerate the global Race to the Bottom that has made a wasteland of American manufacturing, plunging the working class into levels of poverty and insecurity without parallel in most people’s lifetimes, and totally eviscerating the meager gains of three generations of African Americans. Yet, the closest Obama came to even an oblique allusion to his great crime-in-the-making, was to announce that “new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help [small businesses] create even more jobs. We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment and open new markets to new goods stamped ‘Made in the USA.’” Like NAFTA twenty years ago – only far bigger and more diabolically destructive – TPP will have the opposite effect, destroying millions more jobs and further deepening worker insecurity. The Trans Pacific Partnership expands the legal basis for global economic inequalities – which is why the negotiations are secret, and why the treaty’s name could not be spoken in the State of the Union address. It is a lie of omission of global proportions. Give Obama his crown.

“The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, described as ‘NAFTA on steroids,’ would accelerate the global Race to the Bottom.”

The president who promised in his 2008 campaign to support a hike in the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011, and then did nothing at all to make it happen, says this is the “year of action” when he’ll move heaven and earth to get a $10.10 minimum. He will start, Obama told the Congress and the nation, by issuing “an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dishes, you should not have to live in poverty.” Obama neglected to mention that only new hires – a small fraction, beginning with zero, of the two million federal contract workers – will get the wage boost; a huge and conscious lie of omission. The fact that the president does not even propose a gradual, mandated increase for the rest of the two million shows he has no intention of using his full powers to ameliorate taxpayer-financed poverty. We can also expect Obama to issue waivers to every firm that claims a hardship, as is always his practice.

What is Obama’s jobs program? It is the same as laid out at last year’s State of the Union, and elaborated on last summer: lower business taxes and higher business subsidies. When you say “jobs,” he says tax cuts – just like the Republicans, only Obama first cites the pain of the unemployed, so that you know he cares. “Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad. Let’s flip that equation. Let’s work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home.” Actually, Obama wants to lower tax rates for all corporations to 28 percent, from 35 percent, as part of his ongoing quest for a Grand Bargain with Republicans. For Obama, the way to bring jobs back to the U.S. is to make American taxes and wages more “competitive” in the “global marketplace” – the Race to the Bottom.

In the final analysis, the sympathetic corporate Democrat and the arrogant corporate Republican offer only small variations on the same menu: ever increasing austerity. Obama bragged about reducing the deficit, never acknowledging that this has been accomplished on the backs of the poor, contributing mightily to economic inequality and social insecurity.

Obama offers nothing of substance, because he is not authorized by his corporate masters to do so. He takes his general orders from the same people as do the Republicans. That’s why Obama only speaks of minimum wage hikes while Republicans are in power, rather than when his own party controlled both houses of Congress. Grand Bargains are preferred, because they are the result of consensus between the two corporate parties. In effect, the Grand Bargain is the distilled political will of Wall Street, which feeds the donkey and the elephant. Wall Street – the 1 percent – believes the world is theirs for the taking, and they want all of it. Given this overarching truth, Obama has no choice but to stage a festival of lies.

In a rare break from the NSA’s tradition of listening but not speaking, NSA chief General Keith Alexander was grilled Tuesday on the topic of eavesdropping on Americans in front of a House subcommittee.

The questioning from Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Georgia) was prompted by Wired’s cover story this month on the NSA’s growing reach and capabilities, but leaves Americans with as many questions about the reach of spy agency’s powers as they had before Alexander spoke.

Alexander denied, in carefully parsed words, that the NSA has the power to monitor Americans’ communications without getting a court warrant.

But Alexander’s comments fly in the face of people who actually helped create the agency’s eavesdropping and data mining infrastructure. Few people know that system as well as William Binney, who served as the technical director for the agency’s M Group, which stood for World Geopolitical Military Analysis and Reporting, the giant 6,000-person organization responsible for eavesdropping on most of the world.

He was also the founder and co-director of the agency’s Signals Intelligence Automation Research Center, which helped automate that eavesdropping network. Binney decided to leave after a long career rather than be involved in the agency warrantless eavesdropping program, a program he said involves secret monitoring facilities in ten to twenty large telecom switches around the country, such as the one discovered in San Francisco’s AT&T installation a few years ago.

Historically, the NSA’s initial response has always been to either deny or evade when confronted with issues involving eavesdropping on Americans. For decades the agency secretly hid from Congress the fact that it was copying, without a warrant, virtually every telegram traveling through the United States, a program known as Project Shamrock. Then it hid from Congress the fact that it was illegally targeting the phone calls of anti-war protesters during the Vietnam War, known as Project Minaret.

More recently, President Bush said falsely that no American had been wiretapped without a warrant at the same time the agency was eavesdropping on thousands of Americans without a warrant as part of the later revealed Operation Stellar Wind. The Congress then passed a bill granting immunity from prosecution and law suits to the telecom companies involved in the illegal program.

Also, in the same way that General Alexander carefully parsed his words, the agency has always maintained its own secret definition of words in a document known as United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18, a document classified above top secret.

For example, NSA can intercept millions of domestic communications and store them in a data center like Bluffdale and still be able to say it has not “intercepted” any domestic communications. This is because of its definition of the word. “Intercept,” in NSA’s lexicon, only takes place when the communications are “processed” “into an intelligible form intended for human inspection,” not as they pass through NSA listening posts and transferred to data warehouses.

Complicating matters is the senseless scenario made up for the questioning by Congress, which makes it difficult to make sense of his answers, especially since many seem very parsed, qualified, and surrounded in garbled syntax.

That scenario involved NSA targeting U.S. citizens for making fun of a President Dick Cheney for shooting a fellow hunter in the face with a shotgun, and then the fun-makers being waterboarded for their impertinence.

Asked whether the NSA has the capability of monitoring the communications of Americans, he never denies it – he simply says, time and again, that NSA can’t do it “in the United States.” In other words it can monitor those communications from satellites in space, undersea cables, or from one of its partner countries, such as Canada or Britain, all of which it has done in the past.

In my article I quote from a former NSA intercept operator, Adrienne Kinne, who was posted at the NSA’s giant listening post in Georgia and who eavesdropped on many communications between Americans overseas and in the U.S., including personal calls between journalists and their families. But while she was in Georgia, satellites deep in space did the actual interception.

“Basically all rules were thrown out the window and they would use any excuse to justify a waiver to spy on Americans,” she said. She added, “A lot of time you could tell they were calling their families, waking them up in the middle of the night because of the time difference. And so they would be talking all quiet and soft and their family member is like half asleep and incredibly intimate, personal conversations.” Kinne protested both within NSA and then in a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee, but neither took any action.

Her allegations were confirmed by a second source I interviewed several years ago. David Murfee Faulk was also an intercept operator at NSA Georgia, but at a later date than Kinne, whom he never met. While there, a colleague told him about being instructed to begin warrantless targeting of Americans overseas calling the U.S. “The calls were all in English, they were all American, and the guy goes back to his supervisor, a warrant officer, and says, ‘Sir, these people are all Americans,’” according to Faulk. “He said, ‘No, just transcribe it, that’s an order, transcribe everything.’ . . . A lot of these people were having personal phone calls, calling their families back home, having all kinds of personal discussions, and everything just disappeared somewhere, someone’s got it.”

Like Kinne, Faulk’s fellow intercept operator also complained. “After a few days he said he didn’t want to do it anymore, didn’t think it was right. And in a situation like that the officer just gets someone else to do it. So they got somebody else to do it. There is always somebody else who will do something like that. The whole agency down here, at least the way it operates in Georgia, there’s a lot of intimidation, everybody’s afraid of getting in trouble, and people just follow orders.” Like Kinne, Faulk also told his story privately to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

The agency can also do the actual domestic eavesdropping from foreign countries, such as Canada, or from its greatly expanding listening post in Central England, and then just retransmit the data to the U.S. A former NSA deputy director, Louis Tordella, once referred to this technique when testifying before Congress. He noted that the NSA had asked the CIA to conduct illegal domestic eavesdropping but was turned down because the monitoring would take place “on U.S. soil.”

He added, “I was told that if they could move a group of Cubans up to Canada it would be quite all right, but they would not do it in the United States.” And the U.S. frequently asks its very close foreign partners, Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand, to conduct eavesdropping on its behalf and vice versa. The countries call themselves, the “Five Eyes.” Prior to 9/11, says Kinne, these countries were not supposed to monitor citizens in each other’s countries, but that also changed. “We listened to Australians, Canadians, Brits. And so it wasn’t just the Americans but that whole idea that you weren’t supposed to monitor those five countries either – citizens of those five countries.” With the borderlessness of modern digital communications, where the actual eavesdropping is done becomes almost irrelevant.

For years, public interest groups such as the ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center have been trying through court suits to find out the extend of NSA’s eavesdropping on Americans, only to be rebuffed at every turn with claims of secrecy, while whistleblowers such as Adrienne Kinne, David Murfee Faulk, and William Binney have risked going to prison in order to expose NSA’s actions.

Now that General Alexander has broached the subject in an open session of Congress, it is time for the American people to know the real truth about their communications, not heavily parsed, qualified denials about an unlikely hypothetical. Let Congress call an open panel where whistleblowers such as Kinne, Faulk, and Binney give sworn testimony, and NSA, at last, responds fully concerning its domestic involvement.

The spring air in the small, sand-dusted town has a soft haze to it, and clumps of green-gray sagebrush rustle in the breeze. Bluffdale sits in a bowl-shaped valley in the shadow of Utah’s Wasatch Range to the east and the Oquirrh Mountains to the west. It’s the heart of Mormon country, where religious pioneers first arrived more than 160 years ago. They came to escape the rest of the world, to understand the mysterious words sent down from their god as revealed on buried golden plates, and to practice what has become known as “the principle,” marriage to multiple wives.

Today Bluffdale is home to one of the nation’s largest sects of polygamists, the Apostolic United Brethren, with upwards of 9,000 members. The brethren’s complex includes a chapel, a school, a sports field, and an archive. Membership has doubled since 1978—and the number of plural marriages has tripled—so the sect has recently been looking for ways to purchase more land and expand throughout the town.

But new pioneers have quietly begun moving into the area, secretive outsiders who say little and keep to themselves. Like the pious polygamists, they are focused on deciphering cryptic messages that only they have the power to understand. Just off Beef Hollow Road, less than a mile from brethren headquarters, thousands of hard-hatted construction workers in sweat-soaked T-shirts are laying the groundwork for the newcomers’ own temple and archive, a massive complex so large that it necessitated expanding the town’s boundaries. Once built, it will be more than five times the size of the US Capitol.

Rather than Bibles, prophets, and worshippers, this temple will be filled with servers, computer intelligence experts, and armed guards. And instead of listening for words flowing down from heaven, these newcomers will be secretly capturing, storing, and analyzing vast quantities of words and images hurtling through the world’s telecommunications networks. In the little town of Bluffdale, Big Love and Big Brother have become uneasy neighbors.

The NSA has become the largest, most covert, and potentially most intrusive intelligence agency ever.

Under construction by contractors with top-secret clearances, the blandly named Utah Data Center is being built for the National Security Agency. A project of immense secrecy, it is the final piece in a complex puzzle assembled over the past decade. Its purpose: to intercept, decipher, analyze, and store vast swaths of the world’s communications as they zap down from satellites and zip through the underground and undersea cables of international, foreign, and domestic networks. The heavily fortified $2 billion center should be up and running in September 2013. Flowing through its servers and routers and stored in near-bottomless databases will be all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private emails, cell phone calls, and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails—parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, and other digital “pocket litter.” It is, in some measure, the realization of the “total information awareness” program created during the first term of the Bush administration—an effort that was killed by Congress in 2003 after it caused an outcry over its potential for invading Americans’ privacy.

But “this is more than just a data center,” says one senior intelligence official who until recently was involved with the program. The mammoth Bluffdale center will have another important and far more secret role that until now has gone unrevealed. It is also critical, he says, for breaking codes. And code-breaking is crucial, because much of the data that the center will handle—financial information, stock transactions, business deals, foreign military and diplomatic secrets, legal documents, confidential personal communications—will be heavily encrypted. According to another top official also involved with the program, the NSA made an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world but also many average computer users in the US. The upshot, according to this official: “Everybody’s a target; everybody with communication is a target.”

For the NSA, overflowing with tens of billions of dollars in post-9/11 budget awards, the cryptanalysis breakthrough came at a time of explosive growth, in size as well as in power. Established as an arm of the Department of Defense following Pearl Harbor, with the primary purpose of preventing another surprise assault, the NSA suffered a series of humiliations in the post-Cold War years. Caught offguard by an escalating series of terrorist attacks—the first World Trade Center bombing, the blowing up of US embassies in East Africa, the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen, and finally the devastation of 9/11—some began questioning the agency’s very reason for being. In response, the NSA has quietly been reborn. And while there is little indication that its actual effectiveness has improved—after all, despite numerous pieces of evidence and intelligence-gathering opportunities, it missed the near-disastrous attempted attacks by the underwear bomber on a flight to Detroit in 2009 and by the car bomber in Times Square in 2010—there is no doubt that it has transformed itself into the largest, most covert, and potentially most intrusive intelligence agency ever created.

In the process—and for the first time since Watergate and the other scandals of the Nixon administration—the NSA has turned its surveillance apparatus on the US and its citizens. It has established listening posts throughout the nation to collect and sift through billions of email messages and phone calls, whether they originate within the country or overseas. It has created a supercomputer of almost unimaginable speed to look for patterns and unscramble codes. Finally, the agency has begun building a place to store all the trillions of words and thoughts and whispers captured in its electronic net. And, of course, it’s all being done in secret. To those on the inside, the old adage that NSA stands for Never Say Anything applies more than ever.

Poor nutrition in first two years has permanent effect on growth and development, and could spell disaster for country

Afghanistan is raising a stunted generation, whose hobbled development could spell disaster for the country’s feeble economy and undermine the impact of billions of dollars in aid poured into health, education and other areas.

More than half of Afghan girls and boys suffer damage to their minds and bodies that cannot be undone because they are poorly fed in the crucial first two years of life, doctors and experts say. The revelation raises serious questions about the legacy of more than 10 years of western involvement in Afghanistan.

“After the age of two years, stunting is largely irreversible, and has an impact on growth and development and cognitive function,” says Carrie Morrison from the World Food Programme. “Over the longer term, it can have a very damaging effect on the national economy. Young people are not able to attain what they should be able to attain. Women who marry young and are stunted themselves give birth to a small infant and the cycle goes on.”

The problem of children who are not getting enough nutrients from their food is known as chronic malnutrition. It afflicts poorer countries worldwide, but in Afghanistan it is particularly widespread and persistent.

A decade after the fall of the Taliban, 55% of the country’s children are stunted because of inadequate food, Afghan government and UN data shows.

The statistic is damning for western powers which have poured billions into Afghanistan to fund development and reconstruction. The US alone has spent $90bn (£54bn). Such funding aimed to transform Afghanistan from an impoverished, unstable country of largely subsistence farmers into a more modern nation, but return on that spending has been low.

With troops soon to head home, the returns have been limited. Violence is spreading and Afghanistan remains one of the world’s poorest countries, with low life expectancy and poor healthcare for mothers and young children.

The malnutrition problem is caused by the basic poverty of those who can’t afford healthy food, as well as poor hygiene and healthcare, child marriage, and a web of other issues.

“We have whole families where food insecurity means they are all malnourished, but we [also] even have rich families that have one child who is sick,” says Alam Mohammad, a 25-year-old doctor who swapped the chance of an easy city practice to work in Feroz Nakhchair, on the gruelling frontline of a fight for the country’s future.

Half an hour’s drive down a dirt track from the nearest country road, in a valley on the fringes of Taliban territory, he sees dozens of cases a day like Mojabeen, whose leopard-print dress beneath her burqa seems incongruous with her life of constant hardship; at 19, she has three children and the family live in a one-room house on a flood plain that is periodically inundated.

Her husband earns $2 or $3 a day, if he can find work, which is not enough to feed the small family. “My second child is living with my mother, as we can’t provide for him,” says Mojabeen, as she waits for her baby to be weighed and examined.

Her children were at a disadvantage even before they were born because Mojabeen was so starved of nutrients that she could not pass on what they needed during pregnancy. In a district of around 13,000 people, the problem is so widespread that a programme set up for around 100 pregnant and breastfeeding mothers is already serving more than four times that number.

Nevertheless, it can be hard for charities and the government to focus attention or funds on chronic malnutrition when the country is battling a more dramatic type of hunger, which is also easier to address: acute malnutrition.

In clinics nationwide tens of thousands of babies and toddlers have experienced such severe shortages of calories that they have the protruding bones and distended stomachs familiar from photographs of famine victims. Acute malnutrition affects more than one in four children in some areas, but it can usually be resolved relatively quickly with a steady supply of high energy Plumpy’nut feeding paste.

In some ways, chronic malnutrition is harder to tackle as the children suffering from it often don’t show their desperate need for help.

“You might see a child who appears underweight, or short for their age, but it doesn’t really tell you much unless you line them up against a well-nourished child. But it prevents them growing up to lead a more productive life,” says Morrison.

But appearances are disastrously deceptive. “It prevents them growing up for a productive life,” she adds.

A lack of iron, which affects three-quarters of Afghan children, reduces activity and productivity. In young children, it disrupts brain development with effects including “stunting, sickliness, poor school attendance, and lower levels of concentration and memory”. A lack of iodine “is the world’s leading cause of preventable mental impairment”, and a lack of vitamin A hobbles the immune system, pushing up death rates among children under five.

So severe is the damage that tackling it by lacing basic foods such as salt and flour with micronutrients has been rated one of the most economical ways to do good. “In the worst-affected countries, the benefits of supplementation with vitamin A and zinc can be up to 100 times higher than the costs,” according to a research paper on the impact of giving children “micronutrients” – generally known in the west as “vitamins and minerals”.

Recently, the government launched a five-year programme to fortify flour used to make ubiquitous nan flat bread – often the only daily food for poor families – oil and other foodstuffs. Gradual progress with women’s education, healthcare and hygiene education is expected to bring slow but important progress.

A recent World Bank study found a direct link between sanitation and height: a five-year-old child in a community where everyone uses a toilet is on average more than 2cm taller than a child from one where people defecate in the open.

But poverty is also a pressing problem, in a country where a third of all citizens do not always know where their next meal will come from. A recent UN study found even a minimally healthy diet was beyond the reach of the majority of Afghans; in some provinces, only one in five could afford balanced meals.

And while the government and aid workers try to address problems that can take years to solve, healthworkers are often hobbled by a focus on more apparently pressing problems.

“We do worry about chronic malnutrition, but all we can give them is advice,” says Nehmatullah Majidzafa, a nutrition nurse at an Oxfam-supported project in the shadow of the ruined ancient city of Balkh, where most funds support feeding the children in most obvious need.

That includes hands-on demonstrations, with nurses chopping onions into a basic pressure cooker before adding lentils, rice and vegetables, and warnings to spend spare money on protein rather than the cookies and cakes that many lavish on their children.

The information does help, because “parents don’t know much about health here”, says Mohammad, the doctor in Feroz Nakhchair, but still it troubles him to see those who arrive beyond the reach of his help. “If a child comes in after too long with chronic malnutrition, he cannot fully recover. We can only teach the parents so they take more care it doesn’t happen with the other kids.”

Hunger in Afghanistan

Extreme poverty and a harsh climate mean many Afghans go hungry. One-third of the population do not get enough food to live healthy, active lives, and another third hover around the borderline of “food insecurity”, or not knowing where their next meal will come from. But the food shortages are particularly damaging to young children, who need to develop fast.

International studies show that children who are properly fed can earn between a third and a half more as adults than those who did not get a proper diet, the World Food Programme’s Morrison says.

And overall malnutrition shaves 2%-3% off Afghanistan’s national income each year, the World Bank says. That’s around half a billion dollars lost to an already very poor country.

“Knowing about the terror threat to the Olympic games at Sochi is one thing. Understanding the threat and what’s behind it is quite another. There’s a very important back-story that no one is reporting,” stated this source. “Understanding what’s happening behind the scenes will put things into a certain perspective, and it’s a perspective from which nightmares are born,” he added.

I was recently asked about the possibility of a false flag attack at the Olympics by someone I respect. He is well grounded and well informed, and is not someone who travels down rabbit holes chasing alternate realities. Initially, I had not given that angle as much consideration as it warranted. After carefully consideration of his question, I contacted several sources active in the intelligence community, posing the question he asked. I was somewhat surprised to receive similar responses from each source, with one intelligence source providing a very coherent (albeit disturbing) scenario rooted in the current politics of the Middle East.

It appeared that I was a bit behind the curve about the very real threat of a false flag event taking place at the Olympics. To clarify the definition of false flag, I’ll also include the passive act of looking the other way, allowing an event to occur, or permitting just enough of something to happen that it would capture the attention of the world. It certainly does not need to be on the scale of 9/11, but could very well have similar consequences. Consequences that could lead to global war. Despite looking at and assessing this information daily, I was just not thinking big enough. The following should provide you with the information and scenario that seems to put everything into perspective.

The Olympic games are very high profile event with multi-national participation. Any attack, terrorist event or disruption at Sochi, whether a false-flag or “real world” action, would be viewed as an attack on the “world’s” Olympic games, not just against Russia. Considering everything that has gone into the planning of the games and preparation of the venue, in this case to the tune of a reported $50 billion, Sochi provides itself as a near-perfect venue for such an event, which needn’t be large scale. A smaller attack or the mere discovery of a plot having a significant potential would likely be sufficient to enable Russian President Vladimir Putin to gain popular support at home and globally.

We’ve already seen a number of disconcerting things take place in the run-up to the games that should serve as indicators of potential problems. Most telling, perhaps, is that the Saudi Intelligence Minister, Prince Bandar bin Sultan visited Putin last August and again in December, 2013. It is well known that Bandar, also known as “Bandar Bush,” speaks for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He told Putin that the Saudis would not authorize or support any terror attacks during the Olympics, but they could stop such attacks under the right circumstances.

What was the message in that statement, and specifically, what circumstances were being referenced? Through Bandar, the Saudis delivered a backward threat over Syria and the future of President Assad. They are strong-arming Putin over Syria, pushing him into a corner to keep him from overtly backing Assad by military and other means by using the threat of terrorism during the Olympics as a bargaining chip. The Saudis are basically telling Putin to stop providing material support to Assad. Failure to comply means that they won’t stop terror attacks at the games, over which they appear to have certain control. On one hand, this could not have pleased Putin. On the other hand, it appears to have given Putin a definitive suspect, a solid alibi, and a “free pass” of sorts relative to a terror act or incident at the Olympics.

Those who have followed my reports on Benghazi and its relevance to overthrowing Assad understand that Syria holds strategic military and economic importance to Russia. We also know that Putin has questioned the motives of the West (U.S. and U.S. led NATO, the British, French, the Saudis and even Israel) from the Arab Spring through present day Syria. The world has seen the chaos that resulted from the Arab Spring and Putin does not want Syria to descend into the same chaos via the installation of a Muslim Brotherhood regime.

So, the Olympics are being used as a bargaining chip by the Saudis to ties Putin’s hands, at least until the Olympics are over. Putin has so far been reserved in his responses, or perhaps he is actually being calculating rather than reserved.

It is also noted with interest that the threats by the so-called black widow(s) have ramped up this week. Intelligence agencies are aware of the difficulties in getting in and out of Sochi. The fact that a known black widow (one or more) allegedly have been able to infiltrate Sochi is interesting, as such a journey would be difficult at best. There are layers of security that would or should prevent this. Could this be a signal of a possible false flag? Perhaps.

Is the U.S. taking the threat seriously? It appears so, as we’ve already strategically moved naval assets in position in the event it becomes necessary to respond to an incident and move Americans out of that area.

Historical considerations

First, it must be understood that the Arab Spring was not a spontaneous event, but was planned in advance. Secondly, it is important to understand what was taking place in Benghazi that led to the attack on the CIA operations center. It was a weapons running operation to arm the anti-Assad terrorists, spearheaded by the U.S. in collusion with the British, French and others. My previous reports contain sufficient documentation to support these assertions.

We know that the so-called Arab Spring did not start on December 18, 2010 as a spontaneous revolutionary wave of demonstrations by people to rid themselves from the shackles of governmental oppression. One aspect of this was the ousting of Libya’s Gaddafi, which was detailed in a leaked 1300 word e-mail dated June 8, 2008, sent by former British Ambassador to Libya Sir Vincent Fean to Tony Blair two years before the start of the Arab Spring.

The communication consisted of a briefing on the state of relations between Great Britain and Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in advance of a visit by Blair to see Gaddafi. His June 10, 2008 visit with Gaddafi would be one of six made by Blair after leaving office and just three years before being deposed by the U.S. and UK led interests and ultimately murdered.

We know that Benghazi was an arms running operation as I’ve detailed in numerous articles. Putin knew exactly what was going on and has exercised a great amount of restraint against what he has seen as Western aggression in his back yard and against his allies, especially Syria. Although he cannot obviously or overtly change his tune on a dime easily, a terrorist event, or the disruption to the games, would certainly allow Putin much more leeway in dealing with the nation-state level attacks by proxy. Simply look at the U.S. post 9/11.

It’s also important to understand what’s going on in the Al Anbar province of Iraq, particularly with the terror group ISIS. Putin correctly understands that ISIS, a Western backed group, is being fortified during this Olympic window. They are consolidating their forces to take their attacks against Assad to new levels, by opening a new front from the southeastern border of Syria. The U.S. is allowing this to happen by affirming that we would not engage ISIS militarily, per U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.

The Western objective, from the Arab Spring to Benghazi through the present is to topple the Assad government and replace it with a Muslim Brotherhood regime, much like Egypt. The consequences, through active intervention (think Benghazi) or in this case, by a hands-off approach, will result in a serious destabilization of the region.

Putin

Considering this situation, it is possible that Putin, who thinks of himself as a Russian John Wayne, could very well look the other way in the face of a terror threat, even allowing a false-flag operation to take place. As noted, the not-so-thinly veiled threat by the Saudis has given Putin a free pass of sorts, the ability or the rare opportunity (plausibility) to blame the Saudis and by extension, the West, and specifically Obama, causing them to appear weak, indecisive and slow to act against terrorist organizations. In that sense, it’s difficult to imagine him not to take advantage of this opportunity.

Putin is all about stage presence and is a calculating geo-political master. He’s a very experienced player and would capitalize on such an event by emerging as the Russian equivalent of Ronald Reagan by making a strong, visible stand against evil forces in the world in the event of a terrorist action, regardless of its origin.

The larger picture

Based on information from my intelligence contacts, I think that it is necessary to view the likelihood of an event, perhaps a false flag event, taking place at the Olympics as a real possibility. The importance is to understand what’s at stake, and that such an event will not happen in a vacuum.

In the grand scheme of things, Sochi is merely a side show, even at $50 billion. To reiterate, its real value is that an attack here would be viewed as an attack against the entire world. The real prize, looking long term, is the strategic advantage Putin is seeking in Syria and in that region, in which the context of Benghazi must be viewed.

Consider that we are in an epic battle of nations and ideas for ownership of the next 50-100 years economically, militarily and politically in that area. With that in mind, if a false flag can give both pretense and support (two very different things, related but different) to any escalation of response by Russian forces in Syria and the surrounding region, especially Turkey, then Putin will do it in an instant, and blame the Saudis for it. Or any of the NATO-Western forces – the U.S., Saudis, Qatar, and even Israel. (Remember that Saudi Arabia and Israel are tied at the hip over Syria, which seems to have gone completely unrecognized by the general public).

In summary, we are witnessing the ultimate game of political brinkmanship, with terrorism by proxy being used as the tactic at the nation-state level. Terrorism is a tactic, a tool that is being used by nations to advance their geopolitical aims.

Terrorism at the Olympics will not be caused by “crazy Islamic homicide bombers” as the media and many political pundits want us to believe. It is a tactic to advance much larger agendas in the Middle East. Think bigger. Look at the whole picture, not just where we are being directed to look.

We are entering a very critical and dangerous phase of a global realignment of power. Watch this very carefully, as the future of the word is at stake.

Arianna Huffington is behind an effort to afford the one percenters their own voice on a medium flooded with the dangerous political ideas of commoners.

Huffington, who sold her Huffington Post to media giant America Online (and in the process angered no shortage of starry-eyed leftists), has teamed up with billionaire Nicolas Berggruen to create World Post, a news and comment website.

The site will use the same worker model as the Huffington Post. It will exploit unpaid citizen journalists who will serve as bunting on a stage dominated by the likes of former British prime minister Tony Blair, Microsoft’s Bill Gates and Google’s Eric Schmidt.

“You can have all those heads of state and major business people, etcetera etcetera, writing right next to an unemployed man from Spain, a student from Brazil. The great heart of HuffPo is no hierarchy,” Huffington told The Guardian.

Huffington’s venture will receive an appropriate christening. It will be rolled out at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month. The Davos shindig holds a special place in the globalist constellation along with the G7, World Bank, World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund.

The idea is to use the Huffington Post model to get the global elite message to the masses. This is critically important now that the establishment’s dinosaur media is dying and millions of people are flocking to alternative media websites beyond the grasp of the corporate media.

“I think there will be a few media voices that really have weight and will survive but fewer and fewer,” Berggruen predicted.

The Huffington post venture arrives as a tidal wave of investment cash is being doled out to new media operations, most notably First Look Media, the news operation featuring journalist Glenn Greenwald financed by Pierre Omidyar, the eBay founder who bought Paypal.

Omidyar will be on the World Post editorial board with a number of other major league news media corporatists, including Luis Cebrian, founding editor of El Pais, Dileep Padgaonkar, consulting editor of the Times of India, and Yoichi Funabashi, former editor-in-chief of Asahi Shimbun, a large Japanese newspaper that collaborated with The New York Times.

It is uncertain if the downtrodden – and unpaid – masses working for AOL-Huffpo will go along with the globalist plan to subvert alternative media. It is truly amazing so many supposedly progressive journalists and bloggers stuck around after Arianna sold them out in a deal with AOL back in 2011.

Huffpo went on the block for a cool $315 million and Arianna pocketed tens of millions, none of which, of course, she shared with her league of idealistic citizen journalists. It looks like the plantation model will continue with World Post. It is, of course, a model the global elite are comfortable with.

The suicide blasts in Volgograd signal that it’s time for international players to stop dividing terrorists into “good” and “bad” ones based on geopolitical agenda, and to unite the globe in a battle against the threat, Russia’s Foreign Ministry stated.

“A strike, cynically planned on the eve of New Year celebrations, is another attempt by the terrorists to open a domestic ‘front,’ spread panic and chaos, cause interfaith strife and conflicts within the Russian society,” the ministry said in a statement.

The two consecutive suicide attacks in the southern Russian city of Volgograd – which killed more than 30 people on Sunday and Monday – will not see Russia retreating in its “tough and consistent battle against the insidious enemy that knows no boundaries and can only be stopped collectively,” the ministry said.

The ministry stressed that the Volgograd blasts were staged using the same template as recent terror attacks in the US, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and other countries.

“The position of some politicians and political strategists, who are still trying to divide terrorists as ‘good’ and ‘bad’ ones, depending on current geopolitical aims, is becoming evidently mischievous,” the ministry stressed. “Terrorism is always a crime and the punishment for it must be inevitable.”

Russia has urged the international community to show “united condemnation of terrorism and genuine international solidarity in opposition to it and the ideology of violence and extremism, on which it feeds.”

The Foreign Ministry thanked UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and other world leaders who sent their condolences and condemned the Volgograd attacks.



“We consider it a confirmation of the determination of the international community to ramp up the war on terrorists in whatever part of the world they may be and no matter what slogans they use to justify their inhuman crimes,” the statement concluded.

Olympic boss sure of ‘safe and secure’ Games in Sochi

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach was also among those who expressed condolences following the “despicable” and “cowardly” attacks in Volgograd, AP reported.

Volgograd is located about 650 kilometers northeast of Sochi, which will host the Winter Games on February 7-23, 2014.

Bach stressed that he is not concerned about security at the upcoming Games, stating that he is “certain that everything will be done to ensure the security of the athletes and all the participants of the Olympic Games.”

Well, it’s not much of a “win” for Obamacare, and it’s certainly not a victory for Oregon taxpayers.

According to the Washington Examiner, the state’s healthcare exchange was once touted as a model for President Obama’s signature piece of legislation. But after signing up only 44 people throughout the month of November – at a cost of about $300 million – if that is “success,” then maybe Oregonians don’t want to know what failure looks like (or costs).

As reported by the online news site:

The state’s exchange had the fewest sign-ups in the nation, according to a new report … by the Department of Health and Human Services.

The weak number of sign-ups undercuts two major defenses of Obamacare from its supporters.

One defense was that state-based exchanges were performing a lot better than the federal healthcare.gov website servicing 36 states. But Oregon’s website problems have forced the state to rely on paper applications to sign up participants.

Another defense of the Obama administration has attributed the troubled rollout of Obamacare to the obstruction of Republican governors who wanted to see the law fail as well as a lack of funding.

However, that doesn’t hold up either, as Oregon is a heavily Democratic state that supported Obamacare from the get-go, and very enthusiastically. The state’s outreach program was praised by the laws’ supporters and included a folk-style type music video that featured a singer playing an acoustic guitar set against a colorful, scenic background.

The more than $300 million that Oregon received in federal grant money to build and promote its online exchange exceeded all but two states – New York and California, which are much more populous.

Nowhere has this process of simplification become so refined as it has in the United States of America, sometimes laughingly referred to as the “leaders of the free world.”

"https://theinternetpost.net/2014/01/30/kerry-signals-advance-of-north-american-union-plan/","Kerry signals advance of ‘North American Union’ plan","Kerry signals advance of ‘North American Union’ plan

EW YORK – It was in last year’s State of the Union address that President Obama announced an ambitious trade agreement negotiated behind closed doors with North American and Pacific Rim nations – the Trans-Pacific Partnership – that drew little attention.

Now, ahead of Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Secretary of State John Kerry presented evidence that a plan originating with the George W. Bush administration to evolve NAFTA into a European Union-style confederation in North America between the U.S., Mexico and Canada has been put into overdrive with the Obama administration’s effort to obtain “fast track authority” to rush the Trans-Pacific Partnership through Congress with limited debate.

In a joint press conference in Washington Jan. 17 at the conclusion of a ministerial meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird and Mexican Foreign Secretary Jose Antonio Meade, a reporter posed a question to Kerry. The secretary of state was asked if the U.S. planned to reopen NAFTA and engage in direct negotiations with Mexico and Canada to avoid future conflicts between the Trans-Pacific Partnership currently before Congress and the forthcoming Atlantic counterpart, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, now being negotiated with the Europeans.

Kerry’s surprising answer suggested that with the expected ratification by Congress of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, the Obama administration already considers the U.S., Mexico and Canada as part of a “post-NAFTA” world.

“I think that stepping up, all of us, to the TPP, is a very critical component of sort of moving to the next tier, post-NAFTA,” Kerry answered. So I don’t think you have to open up NAFTA, per se, in order to achieve what we’re trying to achieve.”

The Canadian foreign minister, Baird, reinforced Kerry’s point.

“Now listen, we believe that NAFTA’s been an unqualified success; the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, which all three of us are in, offer us the opportunity to strengthen the trilateral partnership, and we’re keen to use that opportunity to do so,” he said.

Jerome Corsi’s “Late Great USA” uncovers government deceptions that threaten U.S. sovereignty

Anticipating the rubber-stamp passage of the TPP by Congress through “fast track” authorization, the White House will have an opportunity to kick off the “post-NAFTA” era at the next North American Leaders Summit meeting between the “three amigos” of President Obama, Mexican President Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

The meeting in Toluca, Mexico, is scheduled for Feb. 19.

As WND reported, Obama announced in his 2013 State of the Union address the plan to add the trans-Pacific free-trade agreement to the trans-Atlantic agreement already in place.

“Fast-track” authority would allow the Obama administration to move the TPP through Congress with a simple majority vote. The rules would limit debate so that no amendments could be introduced to modify the language of the agreement the Obama administration has negotiated behind closed doors.

Leapfrogging NAFTA

As WND reported, the Obama administration has shut down the Security and Prosperity Partnership website, spp.gov. The last joint statement issued by the newly formed North American Leaders Summit, operating as the rebranded SPP, was issued April 2, 2012, at the conclusion of the last tri-lateral head-of-state meeting between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, held in Washington, D.C.

Without much fanfare, the White House wrapped Mexico and Canada into the TPP negotiations.

On June 16, 2012, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk issued a statement announcing that Mexico had decided to join the TPP negotiations.

“We are delighted to invite Mexico, our neighbor and second largest export market, to join the TPP negotiations,” said Kirk. “Mexico’s interest in the TPP reflects its recognition that the TPP presents the most promising pathway to boosting trade across the Asia Pacific and to encouraging regional trade integration. We look forward to continuing consultations with the Congress and domestic stakeholders as we move forward.”

Three days later, with similar language, the USTR announced Canada had decided to join the TPP negotiations.

“Inviting Canada to join the TPP negotiations presents a unique opportunity for the United States to build upon this already dynamic trading relationship. Through TPP, we are bringing the relationship with our largest trading partner into the 21st century,” said Kirk. “We look forward to continuing consultations with the Congress and domestic stakeholders regarding Canada’s entry into the TPP as we move closer to a broad-based, high-standard trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region.”

Now, with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Obama administration appears to have leapfrogged SPP ambitions to work toward creating an EU-style confederation by including Mexico and Canada in the TPP configuration.

The 12 nations in the TPP – along with Mexico, Canada and the U.S. – are Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan.

A graph shows the reach of the agreement across the Pacific, including Peru and Chile in South America; Australia and New Zealand; Malaysia and Vietnam in Southeast Asia; Singapore; and Japan.

Republicans join in

As WND has reported, Republicans under the leadership of House Speaker John Boehner, with the willing cooperation of Reps. Mark Cantor and Paul Ryan, have given way to multi-national corporate interests backing the party and are preparing to support the White House on passage of the TPP.

On Jan. 9, in a little-noticed statement, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont, together with ranking member Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., announced they were introducing “fast-track” trade promotion authority.

The last line of congressional resistance to TPP appears to be coming from House Democrats concerned that more U.S. union jobs will be lost.

Last year, 151 House Democrats opposed to TPP, led by Reps. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and George Miller, D-Calif., wrote a letter to President Obama stating their opposition to using “outdated ‘Fast Track’ procedures that usurp Congress’s authority over trade matters.”

This week, as WND reported, political analysts with an impressive group of 564 labor, environmental, family farm and community organizations in the Democratic Party’s voting base sent Obama a strongly worded letter charging that pushing TPP undermines the president’s message on income inequality.

“President Obama can’t have it both ways,” Arthur Stamoulis, the spokesman for Citizens Trade Campaign, the group organizing the letter, told WND. “Either the president is for reducing income eligibility as we expect he will say in the State of the Union address, or he can push for Fast Track legislation on the job-destroying TPP free-trade agreement. He can’t have it both ways.”

The power of the punch the Citizens Trade Campaign plans to deliver the White House can be seen by the letter’s signatories.

They include labor unions such as the AFL-CIO; American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); American Federation of Teachers; International Brotherhood of Teamsters; United Autoworkers (UAW); United Brotherhood of Carpenters; United Steelworkers (USW); and Service Employees International Union (SEIU).

Among the environmental organizations are 350.org, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, League of Conservation Voters, National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Rainforest Action Network and the Sierra Club.

Family farm organizations include the National Family Farm Coalition, National Farmers Union and the Western Organization of Resource Councils. Consumer groups include Food & Water Watch, Organic Consumers Association, National Consumers League and Public Citizen.

“Income inequality and long-term unemployment are serious problems that the job-killing TPP would only worsen,” Stamoulis said.

Obama’s 2-ocean globalist plan

As WND reported, in his SOTU address last year, Obama announced a two-ocean globalist free-trade agenda:

“To boost American exports, support American jobs, and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight, I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union – because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.”

It marked the first time that a decision was made public by the U.S. trade representative to expand on-going trade negotiations to create a free-trade zone with Pacific-rim as well as EU countries.

WND reported in 2009 that the Obama administration had “rebranded” and “refocused” the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America to advance the Bush administration’s agenda of North American integration under the rubric of the “North American Leaders Summit.” The rubric was a less controversial banner, according to confidential sources in the U.S. Department of Commerce and State Department who agreed to speak with WND only if their comments were kept off the record.

In a series of articles dating back to June 13, 2006, WND reported the activities of the extensive tripartite “working-group” designed for the bureaucrats of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada to create the regulatory structure needed to transform NAFTA into a fully-functioning regional confederation.

The SPP was simply announced at a tripartite summit meeting held between President George W. Bush, Mexican President Vicente Fox and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin in Waco, Texas, on March 23, 2005.","2014-01-30 12:45:37","0","84.0","8.0","165.0","0.0","16.0","0.0","553.0","510.0","101.0","50.0","0.0","7.0","0","1536","98.76","78.27","11.94","67.60","26.03","29.49","70.38","36.13","3.91","2.02","0.20","1.11","0.07","0.39","0.26","1.89","9.96","14.26","3.39","1.17","4.30","0.33","7.88","3.58","1.56","0.20","1.63","1.24","3.65","2.86","0.65","0.13","0.26","0.07","7.81","0.33","1.04","0.00","0.52","4.10","1.50","0.91","0.65","0.65","0.20","0.65","1.37","0.72","0.59","0.07","0.26","0.07","0.07","0.00","0.13","12.24","4.82","2.67","4.88","0.98","0.39","2.47","4.75","1.24","12.63","1.89","8.01","3.26","9.44","0.52","1.37","2.47","0.33","0.07","0.26","0.00","0.20","0.00","0.07","0.00","22.01","5.66","7.16","0.07","0.78","0.00","0.00","2.99","3.19","1.43","0.65","0.07","7985","8.57","37.30952380952381","2514","1493","72","42.0","14.6","12.5","15.43","15.5","369","12.25","20.166135298057604","663","31.76","91","0.36","0","47","21","160","0","178","103","0","2","12","195","432","9","54","0","0","30","7","28","2","1","5","50","0","52","52","40","32","29","20","4","2","0","0"

1911, May 15

The Supreme Court of the U.S. finds John Rockefeller and his Trust guilty of corruption, illegal business practices and racketeering. As a result of this decision, the entire Rockefeller Standard Oil-Trust, the world’s largest corporation of its time, was sentenced to be dismantled. But Rockefeller was already above the Supreme Court and did not care about this decision.

1913

In order to disperse public and political pressure on him and other robber-barons, Rockefeller uses a trick called “philanthropy”, whereby the illegal gains from his robber-practices in the oil business are used to launch the Rockefeller Foundation. This tax haven was used to strategically take over the health care sector in the U.S..

The Rockefeller Foundation was the front organization for a new global business venture of Rockefeller and his accomplices. This new venture was called the pharmaceutical investment business. Donations from the Rockefeller Foundation went only to medical schools and hospitals. These institutions had become missionaries of a new breed of companies: the manufacturers of patented, synthetic drugs.

This was also the time when the first vitamins were discovered. It soon became clear however that these natural molecules had live-saving health benefits and that they were able to prevent many chronic health conditions. The first books appeared with research, subsequently abandoned, about the health benefits of vitamins. These newly discovered molecules had only one disadvantage: they were non-patentable.

Thus, in its first years of existence, the pharmaceutical investment business already faced a mortal thread: vitamins and other micronutrients promoted as public health programs would prohibit the development of any sizable investment business based on patented drugs. The elimination of this unwanted competition from natural micronutrients therefore became a question of life and death for the pharmaceutical business.

1918

The Rockefeller Foundation uses the Spanish flu epidemic – and the media (that it already controlled by this time) – to start a witch-hunt on all forms of medicine that were not covered by its patents.

Within the next 15 years, all medical schools in the U.S., most hospitals and the American Medical Association all essentially became pawns on the chessboard of Rockefeller’s strategy to subjugate the entire health care sector under the monopoly of his pharmaceutical investment business.

Disguised as a “Mother Theresa”, the Rockefeller Foundation was also used to conquer foreign countries and entire continents for the pharmaceutical investment business – just as Rockefeller himself had done a few decades previously with his petrochemical investment business.

1925

On the other side of the Atlantic, in Germany, the first chemical / pharmaceutical cartel is founded in order to compete with Rockefeller’s quest for control of the global drug market. Lead by the German multinationals Bayer, BASF and Hoechst, the I.G. Farben cartel was founded with a total number of employees surpassing 80,000. The race for global control was on.

1929, November 29

The Rockefeller cartel (U.S.A.) and the I.G. Farben cartel (Germany) decided to divide the entire globe into interest spheres – the very same crime Rockefeller had been sentenced for 18 years earlier, when his trust had divided up the U.S. into “interest zones”.

1932 / 33

The I.G. Farben cartel, equally insatiable, decides no longer to be bound by the 1929 constraints. They support an uprising German politician, who promises I.G. Farben to militarily conquer the world for them. With millions of dollars in election campaign donations, this politician seized power in Germany, turned the German democracy into a dictatorship and kept his promise to launch his conquest war, a war that soon became known as WWII.

In each and every country Hitler’s wehrmacht invaded, the first act was to rob the chemical, petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries and assign them – free of charge – to the I.G. Farben empire.

1942 – 45

In order to cement its global leadership with patented drugs, the I.G. Farben cartel tests its patented pharmaceutical substances on concentration camp inmates in Auschwitz, Dachau and many other sites. The fees for conducting these inhumane studies were transferred directly from the bank accounts of Bayer, Hoechst and BASF to the bank accounts of the SS, who operated the concentration camps.

1945

I.G. Farben’s plan to take control of the global oil and drug markets has failed. The U.S. and the other allied forces won WWII. Nevertheless, many U.S. and allied soldiers had lost their lives during the conflict, and the allies’ reward was little compared to the rewards of others. The corporate shares of the losers, I.G. Farben, went to the Rockefeller trust (U.S.A.) and Rothschild / J.P. Morgan (U.K.).

1947

In the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal, 24 managers from Bayer, BASF, Hoechst and other executives of the I.G. Farben cartel were tried for crimes against humanity. These crimes included: leading wars of aggression, instituting slavery and committing mass murder. In his final pleading, U.S.-Chief Prosecutor Telford Taylor summarized the crimes committed by these corporate criminals with the following words: “Without I.G. Farben, the second World War would not have been possible”.

Amazingly, the real culprits for the death of 60 Million people in World War II – the I.G. Farben executives – received the mildest verdicts. Even those executives directly responsible for the crimes in I.G. Auschwitz only received a maximum of twelve years in jail. Surprised? You shouldn’t be.

By 1944 Nelson Rockefeller had already entered the executive branch of the U.S. government. He started off as Under-Secretary of State and ended up a few years later as Special Adviser of President Truman for Special Affairs. In other words, at critical junctures of the 20th century, the Rockefeller interests took direct charge. They decided the post war shape of the world and the distribution of its wealth.

As such, under the influence of the U.S. State Department, the verdicts in Nuremberg against the I.G. Farben managers can easily be explained. In return for taking over the corporate shares of I.G. Farben, and thereby global control of the oil and drug business, Nelson Rockefeller made sure that the real culprits of World War II were not hanged. In fact, and as we shall see, they were needed.

1949

The Federal Republic of Germany was founded. This was the first time in history that the constitution and society of an industrialized nation could be planned and modeled as a fortress of the pharmaceutical investment business – a transatlantic outpost of the Rockefeller interests.

Within only a few years, the I.G. Farben managers sentenced in Nuremberg were released from jail and put back into their previous positions as stakeholders of the Rockefeller interests. Fritz Ter Meer, for example, sentenced to twelve years in jail for his crimes in Auschwitz, was back as chairman of the board of Germany’s largest pharmaceutical multinational, Bayer, by 1963!

1945 – 49

The role of the Rockefeller brothers was not limited to their taking over the global monopolies of the oil and drug businesses. They also needed to create the political framework for these businesses to thrive. Under their influence, therefore, the United Nations was founded in 1945, in San Francisco. To seize political control of the post war world, three countries – leading drug export nations – had all the say, and 200 other nations were rendered mere spectators.

Founded as organizations to allegedly serve the wellbeing of the people of the world, the UN’s subsidiary organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Trade Organization (WTO), soon turned out to be nothing more than the political arms of the global oil and drug interests.

1963

On behalf of the Rockefeller interests, the government of the pharmaceutical banana republic Germany spearheaded one of the most infamous efforts ever made within the United Nations. Under the pretense of consumer protection, it launched a four-decade-long crusade to outlaw vitamin therapies and other natural, non-patentable health approaches in all member countries of the United Nations. The goal was to simply ban any and all competition for the multi-billion dollar business with patented drugs. The plan was simple: copy for the entire world what had already been accomplished in America in the 1920s – a monopoly on health care for the investment business with patented drugs.

Since the marketplace for the pharmaceutical investment business depends upon the continued existence of diseases, the drugs it developed were not intended to prevent, cure or eradicate disease. Thus, the goal of the global strategy was to monopolize health for billions of people, with pills that nearly cover symptoms but hardly ever address the root cause of disease. The deprivation of billions of people from having access to life saving information about the health benefits of natural health approaches, whilst at the same time establishing a monopoly with largely ineffective and frequently toxic patented drugs, caused disease and death in genocidal proportions.

This epidemic of unnecessary disability and death by the pharmaceutical business with disease is unparalleled in history.

Linus Pauling and other eminent scientists deserve credit for having kept open the door of knowledge about the health benefits of vitamins and other effective natural health approaches. If it were not for them we would already be living in a health prison today, guarded by the gatekeepers of the pharmaceutical business with disease in medicine, politics and the media.

Linus Pauling should also be credited for having identified the significance of Dr. Rath’s early research in vitamins and cardiovascular disease, and for having invited Dr. Rath to join him during his last years to continue his life’s work.

1990 – 92

These years will go down in history as the beginning of the end of the pharmaceutical business with disease. In a series of scientific publications, in some of which Dr. Rath invited Linus Pauling to join him as co-author, Dr. Rath identified micronutrient deficiency as the primary cause of diseases. These diseases include heart attacks, high blood pressure, diabetic circulatory problems, cancer and even immune deficiency diseases, including AIDS.

Like a Sherlock Holmes of science, Dr. Rath traced the real cause of these diseases, and found that they had been deliberately nebulized or even hidden away from millions of people for one purpose only: to feed the insatiable greed of the pharmaceutical business with disease.

As natural gas prices climb, reaching over $5/mcf again on 4 February, and with an unseasonably cold winter, local utilities say that natural gas customers’ bills are 30-40% higher now than last winter.

Last week, we saw natural gas prices rise above $5 for the first time in three years, then falling back a bit only to rise again on 4 February, with March futures trading above $5.25/mcf—or more than 6%, according to expert trader Dan Dicker.

Customers are footing the bill for higher gas prices and the coldest November-January period in four years in the Midwest and Northeast.

In Omaha, Nebraska, weather has been about 30% colder this year than last, and utility regulatory officials saying that gas use among customers is up while bills are up by 34-38% over last year.

Utilities are paying high prices for gas because demand has been higher and consumption rates at a level that has reduced storage by about 17% over the average of the previous five years.

In the meantime, there is a great deal of disconnect between cash prices and futures prices for natural gas, with futures trading an increasingly volatile business. While 6 February saw a spike in next-day prices, according to Reuters, 5 February saw natural gas futures fall sharply due to longer-term mild weather forecasts.

“The futures market appears to be disconnected from key developments occurring in the physical market,” Reuters quoted BNP Paribas analyst Teri Viswanath as saying on 6 February. “Today we witnessed a marked increase in spot prices for every consuming region, suggesting that utilities might be rationing limited inventories by purchasing gas off the market.”

As Dicker noted for The Street, “Low stockpiles caused by sequestration and a rush of domestic exploration and production companies away from natural gas production in favor of shale oil is taking its toll and providing the first real and consistent support of prices since 2007. Suddenly, natural gas markets are vulnerable to price spikes and traders are afraid to be short.”

The death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman reportedly from a heroin overdose, with a needle in his arm and 50 baggies of junk found in his apartment, is newsworthy only because of his celebrity status. These overdose deaths are occurring regularly these days but usually to the faceless junkies whose numbers seem to be increasing.

In looking at the comments at the articles on Hoffman, there are many who feel no empathy, those who address addiction as a disease and everywhere in between. Some are boosting the call to decriminalize these drugs in combination with therapy as an alternative to the scourge of the war on drugs. What’s generally missing from the debate is are we going to accept the fact that it is elements of our own government and especially the CIA who are involved in the drug trade? That our occupation of Afghanistan has resulted in the largest opium crops ever known. That we built the opium to heroin processing plants there. That bankers launder the money. That there is no war on drugs except against those who don’t collude with the government monopoly.

Individuals are responsible for their own addictions but that does not absolve the dope pushers at the top.

So was it heroin from Afghanistan that Hoffman was using? Our taxpayer funded occupation dope? Most likely.

Hoffman’s death was tragic but unless we take on the issue of how the Afghanistan ‘war on terror’ became a government sponsored crime syndicate’s war for drug running, his will be only one… with many more to come.","2014-02-05 18:35:21","0","46.0","3.0","165.0","0.0","16.0","0.0","538.0","510.0","104.0","51.0","0.0","7.0","0","263","86.09","71.58","12.40","3.69","17.53","24.71","81.75","54.37","12.17","4.18","0.00","2.28","0.00","1.52","0.38","7.98","9.13","16.73","7.98","4.94","4.56","1.52","13.31","2.66","2.28","2.66","0.76","1.90","3.04","0.38","2.66","0.38","1.52","0.76","7.98","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.52","10.27","2.28","1.52","0.00","2.28","1.52","3.04","0.76","0.38","0.00","0.38","3.80","0.38","3.42","0.00","0.00","7.98","2.66","0.38","4.94","0.38","0.00","3.04","7.60","0.76","10.27","1.90","6.84","1.52","3.42","1.14","0.76","1.90","0.00","2.66","0.76","0.00","0.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.27","4.56","1.90","0.00","0.00","1.52","0.00","0.00","0.38","1.90","0.00","0.00","1244","8.29","17.8","382","263","14","60.85","11.5","9.4","10.97","10.9","62","10.1","18.949657794676806","157","16.13","1","0.54","0","6","2","33","0","45","11","1","1","1","47","14","0","18","0","0","7","8","11","0","0","0","7","0","7","9","8","4","12","6","0","5","1","1"

Some of which have even been called racist by critics in the past. However, if anyone ever had any doubts whether or not Iggy Azalea was a race hater, Iggy went and confirmed it for them with various disturbing tweets after being criticized for not supporting the protestors in Ferguson and New York City. Also, several reports have been released stating that Azalea is “from Australia” and that Australia is “crazy racist.”

“I don’t know what you were thanking, I’m Australian,” she tweeted. She followed that tweet with “curse I am. My people were the rapists and murderers Britain didn’t want,” and “you expect an Ozzie to be respectful we had a law not to feed the black folks.” “When black people started getting all hungry for rights, we just rifled therm.”

Several other tweets followed such as, “we wouldn’t allow anybody but whites in Queensland” and “we took mixed chilrdren from they paren ts.”

Then, she hit everyone with the shocker.

However, black leaders along with civil rights activists in general, while not surprised to hear that a blond-haired Australian girl is also a racist, were surprised that so many people support her music career, follow her on twitter, and even look to hear her opinions on racial matters.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/kerry-washington-quits-scandal-after-cheating-rumors/","Kerry Washington Quits Scandal After Cheating Rumors","HOLLYWOOD, CA– In one of the most shocking situations recently in Hollywood, Kerry Washington, who recently gave birth to Isabelle Amarachi Asomugha with husband and former NFL player Nnamdi Asomugha, has quit the hit show Scandal amid cheating rumors.

Washington has been the center of several rumors involving her daughter, and if the baby is truly her husbands. Their has been speculation that Nnamdi Asomugha took a paternity test following the birth of their child, fearing that his daughter is a direct result of adultery.

Since 2012, Washington has starred in the ABC drama Scandal, a Shonda Rhimes series in which Washington plays Olivia Pope, a crisis management expert to the President.

“I don’t understand how Kerry could go from this wholesome actress playing this virtuous feminine role, to being engulfed in these unfortunate allegations.” Show creator Shonda Rhimes said during a press conference Thursday evening. “Although this is a terrible situation, I am proud of Kerry for having the courage in stepping down from her role, but we are going to have a tough task finding a replacement who can bring more class and righteousness to this beloved character.”

Tough task indeed.

Kerry Washington’s close friend, who goes by the name R. Polanski, recently confirmed to the media that the star will not be returning to the show. Citing reasons of “moral disappointment, shame, dishonor and disgrace” within herself; attributes of which she stated she previously never came in touch with, in or out of her roles.

In 2013, Washington gained wide public recognition for her role and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television series.

Big shoes to fill.

So one can see why there are all sorts of scrambling within the production team to find a suitable replacement. Talking heads in Hollywood have thrown out names from Nia Long (The Best Man Holiday, Love Jones) to Gabrielle Union (Being Mary Jane, Think Like A Man Too).

Lets just hope for the best.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/2pac-still-alive-new-evidence-emerges/","2Pac Still Alive?? New Evidence Emerges…","On September 13th 1996, American rapper 2pac Shakur was pronounced as being fatally killed by a series of gunshot wounds. Despite this, there is much surrounding his ‘death’ that doesn’t add up. Now you’re probably reading this thinking, this has got to be one of those whacked out ‘conspiracy theories’ going against everything ever officially reported, if he was alive we would know for certain, right? I initially thought the same seeing such claims too. It wasn’t long however, before I found myself uncovering much more about his supposed death and the circumstances situated around it that made be begin to think otherwise. I began to realise that actually, such claims that 2pac may have faked his own death and is still alive may have more truths to them than what first appears, as it is evident that there is more to this story than what was ever officially reported..

It all began a couple years ago when I was on Youtube listening to 2pac and some of his songs. On the sidebar I saw a link titled “2PAC ALIVE 2014 RETURN – MUST WATCH!!”. Of course I thought, another stereotypical video discrediting people questioning real conspiracies and cover-ups. Being a huge 2pac fan I couldn’t help but take an interest in seeing what these people were claiming and so clicked the video anyway. What I saw next could not have surprised me more, as it was suggesting the last known photo of 2pac alive the night he had allegedly been shot, was fake!

Another strong piece of evidence made against the photo is a picture snapped of 2pac and Suge Knight earlier. The night 2pac was ‘killed’, he was at the MGM strip in Las Vegas to see a Mike Tyson boxing match. Interestingly if you look at the picture seen below you will notice something doesn’t add up. It is very obvious if you examine the facial hair on 2pac’s chin, you can see that in the picture where he is in the car his beard is much longer!

Pictured above on the left is the photo in its original form. What stands out about it most is that there are no keys in the ignition! This can be seen clearly from the close up picture to the right. It was reported that this photo was allowed to be taken by paparazzi while 2pac and his manager Suge Knight were waiting at traffic lights. With this in mind, it isn’t possible that the car would have been able to take off without any keys.

Finally, if you didn’t think that was enough, this last piece of evidence against the ‘final’ photo is BY FAR the most compelling as it is quite clear that the photo of 2pac seen is actually his military portrait. Below you can see that this photo has been overlayed on top of the photo where he is seen in the car and is faded out gradually. The results are a perfect match..

If you look at his eyes throughout each frame they remain the same while the lighting changes..

This got me thinking, why on earth would somebody go to the trouble and effort to fake the last photo of 2pac being alive? There would have to be a reason for it, and so lead me to investigate further in finding out what else really happened that night. It turns out there were a number of things out of the ordinary. It was very strange for 2pac not to be wearing his bullet-proof vest as after less than a year earlier, 2pac had survived a point blank shooting in New York. It was because of this he was always seen to be wearing one. According to his cousin, Jamal Lesane: “Normally he wouldn’t leave without it, but this time he left it behind and didn’t have it with him.” E.D.I also claims that night Kastro told 2pac he should put his vest on, but replied “It’s too hot tonight.” Before the alleged shooting that would become known as the fatal night 2pac died, he and his camaraderie of Outlawz and bodyguards made their way across the Vegas strip to a mansion belonging to Suge Knight. According to members of The Outlawz, Suge and 2pac unexpectedly disappeared briefly while the others waited patiently. “I don’t really know what Pac or Suge was doing at the time, I just knew we was waiting and I was ready to go.” Reportedly after about half an hour, with 2pac and the others now ready to leave for a show at club 662, 2pac made an unusual request to his bodyguard, Frank Alexander. “I was walking to the car with Suge and Pac when I was opening up the door to get in the backseat. Then Pac stopped me and said no take the keys and go drive the Lexus with the Outlawz, we’re going to be drinking and you’re going to be the designated driver to drive us back after we’ve finished parting.” This was even more out of the ordinary as 2pac would never go anywhere in public without at least one of his bodyguards for his safety. Given such abnormal circumstances, what happened later involving his ‘death’, was was either very convenient, or a total coincidence.. The story officially reported of 2pac’s death is of he and Suge waiting at more traffic lights along the MGM strip, when a white Cadillac was seen pulling up next to them and began firing shots into their BMW. Frank Alexander was in the Lexus behind 2pac and described the scene as he saw it. “After the Cadillac shot into the car I thought they were dead, my reaction was to run up to the car, but instead the car sped up and took off.” The BMW went onto makes a hard right u-turn and race off in the opposite direction. “I didn’t know what to think, it was a faulk, it was a haze. Were these real bullets? Did they really shoot these guys?..” Frank also made mention that some of the other cars containing security went in pursuit of the white Cadillac, although failed to catch up to it and identify the vehicle plate. To this day nobody knows who killed 2pac and the case remains an unsolved murder. The events that followed suit involved 2pac being rushed to hospital, although the details as to how he arrived and by whom are uncertain due to three different scenarios being relayed by different accounts. According to media 2pac and Suge were found in the BMW with all four tires blown out. An ambulance also apparently arrived on scene shortly after and was said to have rushed 2pac to hospital. Suge describes a different series of events, claiming in an interview he drove 2pac to the hospital himself, he then however is oddly seen changing his story to coincide with that of official media reports! The third and final account is that of a by-stander still on scene when asked on camera what she had just witnessed. VIDEO: “We were pretty far down the street when it happened, we didn’t know if we heard gunshots, we didn’t know exactly what we heard, we heard a lot of screaming and car screeching. We ran up the street as cops were running past us and by the time we got here they were already taking which now I found out is 2pac into the helicopter away.”

Did this person say something she wasn’t supposed to? .. Afterwards nobody else on the scene was further asked for questioning and reports continued to detail 2pac being met by an ambulance at the scene of the broken down BMW.

How much more bizarre could this night get? .. Well as it turns out things were only beginning to get stranger.

Pictured above on the left is a picture of the crime scene where the BMW came to its end. The damage to the rims can be seen from the blown out tires. Pictured to the right is news footage showing investigators examining the supposed car 2pac and Suge were in. Here’s where it gets weird, if you look at the wheels of both cars neither match up.

When both cars are seen from another angle it is unmistakable that these are two totally different vehicles! This begs the question, why was this second car being examined and why was it on the scene??","2014-11-13 00:00:00","0","9.0","12.0","3.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","35.0","30.0","0.0","90.0","5.0","1.0","1","1413","70.52","57.58","47.77","23.55","21.74","16.91","84.71","55.48","13.59","6.51","1.63","0.99","0.78","2.55","0.57","7.08","7.86","15.29","9.84","5.02","5.94","1.70","18.83","5.24","3.33","2.05","0.92","2.55","1.98","0.92","1.06","0.07","0.28","0.07","7.43","0.07","0.07","0.14","2.69","11.75","2.41","1.49","1.56","2.48","1.34","3.96","4.46","3.61","0.71","0.14","1.27","0.57","0.64","0.00","0.07","5.38","1.49","0.50","2.26","1.13","0.35","8.99","7.50","0.64","16.77","3.11","8.28","5.52","1.13","0.57","0.07","0.28","0.00","1.27","0.21","0.00","0.07","0.00","0.07","0.07","12.67","4.60","3.26","0.14","0.00","0.57","0.50","0.28","1.49","1.84","0.00","0.00","6060","6.93","23.866666666666667","1877","1406","65","74.93","10.5","8.2","8.53","10.3","198","8.9","16.273001422475108","556","21.37","34","0.53","0","44","40","150","0","170","78","5","1","16","169","66","0","52","1","0","98","22","84","7","2","20","49","0","54","93","50","52","32","41","4","13","0","14"

Stiviano On A Racist Tirade: ‘I don’t understand black people’","Well if this isn’t the pot calling the kettle anti-black.

V. Stiviano, who secretly recorded NBA owner Donald Sterling’s slurs against African-Americans, made a few of her own in two videos made public Saturday by TMZ.com.

“I don’t understand black people,” the 31-year-old model snaps in one clip. “The minute you give them a little bit of money, they don’t know what to do with it.

“They just act crazy. … They’re like, ‘Yo, I wanna put some rims on top of my rims. And my rims are gonna turn around, so I’m gonna call them — what? Spinners.’”

Stiviano, caught on camera during the shooting of a 2011 reality show pilot about gold-diggers, wasn’t finished sounding like Sterling.

“They do stupid s— like that, when there’s people starving around the world,” she announces. “That’s what people want to do with their money?”

In the second clip, Stiviano is riding shotgun while holding an Elmo doll as an African-American friend drives.

Speaking to the stuffed Muppet, Stiviano cracks, “We don’t like black people.”

She is black and Mexican.

Stiviano’s taped conversation with the 80-year-old Sterling turned the Los Angeles Clippers owner into a pariah, leading to a lifetime ban from the NBA and the forced sale of his team. The billionaire real estate mogul was also fined $2.5 million.

Sterling, in yet another secretly taped conversation, claimed his vile remarks were his version of sweet talk as he tried to bed the decades-younger Stiviano.

Stiviano claimed that she never slept with Sterling despite the gifts that he lavished upon her — including $500,000 in luxury cars and a $1.8 million Los Angeles duplex.

Sterling’s wife cut a deal last week to sell the Clippers for $2 billion, but lawyers filed suit on behalf of her litigious husband to fight the sale in court.

Sterling’s lawsuit against the league also seeks to overturn his suspension from the sport, although an NBA lawyer dismissed the move as “entirely baseless.”

Spouse Shelly Sterling seized control of her husband’s enormous holdings after Donald Sterling was branded “mentally incapacitated” by two neurologists who diagnosed him with dementia.

The other 29 NBA owners, who were initially expected to vote this week on whether to oust Sterling, will instead decide on the proposed purchase by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver scheduled a Wednesday meeting with civil rights leaders to discuss the sale of the Clippers and other issues, said the Rev. Al Sharpton.","2014-05-31 00:00:00","0","42.0","19.0","3.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","63.0","41.0","0.0","164.0","7.0","22.0","6","418","91.86","77.80","9.58","18.70","16.72","24.16","71.05","42.34","10.29","6.46","1.20","0.24","0.24","3.35","1.44","3.83","8.61","14.35","5.02","3.11","4.07","1.44","10.05","2.63","2.39","1.91","4.07","1.20","1.91","0.72","1.20","0.00","0.72","0.00","12.92","0.96","0.24","1.91","2.15","6.70","0.96","1.20","0.96","0.48","0.48","3.11","2.87","1.44","0.96","0.24","1.20","0.24","0.48","0.00","0.48","6.46","2.39","1.20","3.59","0.24","0.00","3.35","5.74","1.20","12.20","2.39","4.55","5.26","2.15","0.72","0.48","1.67","0.00","0.00","1.20","0.00","0.72","0.00","0.24","0.00","22.73","5.98","5.50","0.00","0.00","0.48","0.00","2.15","3.83","3.83","0.00","0.96","1964","8.02","21.7","573","410","23","70.33","9.5","7.9","12.06","11.6","91","5.928571428571429","17.998048780487807","266","20.5","11","0.41","0","6","17","42","0","54","36","1","0","1","68","48","2","23","0","0","18","11","15","0","0","1","11","0","12","23","8","8","14","7","0","6","0","1"

"http://tmzbreaking.com/watch-ignorant-mississippi-folks-explain-why-they-hate-obama-video/","WATCH: Ignorant Mississippi Folks Explain Why They Hate Obama (Video)","Why are so many white, poor, rural men conservative, even though liberal policies would help them?

And why do they hate President Barack Obama so much?

Scroll Down for Video…

These questions have baffled liberals for ages. In 2012, Bill Maher sent documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi out to ask them. She went to a rural part of Mississippi — the poorest and most conservative state in the Union — and talked with some white guys of varying ages and income levels.



What these southern men have to say might not surprise you, but you’ve got to give them props for being so affable and upfront with the daughter of Rep. Nancy “Devil Woman” Pelosi (D-Calif.)



Most striking is how even the least fortunate of these men stoically accepts his economic fate, and how deeply and sincerely these men cherish their beliefs — which seem so grim, heartless, and unappealing to the rest of us.Watch these white, rural men explain why they’re so conservative.White, conservative men explain why they hate Obama:

“One thing, he’s named ‘Obama’”

“This is America. Our president should be American. Not Muslim.”

Why they hate Obamacare even though they need healthcare:

I hate Obamacare. It’s retarded.

Back when i was growing up, and my parents were growing up, and my grandparents were growing up, we didn’t have all that and people still made it. And back then, people pulled their own weight, they didn’t sit around waiting for everyone else to take care of them.

Why they don’t want the government to fix the economy:

It’ll take care of itself. You put God in the saddle, it’ll all be okay.

Why they vote Republican even though it hasn’t worked for them:

But it COULD [work]. It hasn’t, but it could.

We would rather go broke and die hungry than to give up our moral beliefs.

Pelosi’s most baffling exchange was with a chatty, tooth-challenged man who said, “I don’t care for the government.” When an astonished Pelosi reminded him that he’s on food stamps, the man replied:

“Yeah, but I think I deserve food stamps. I have no employment.”

Since 51 percent of people in the state of Mississippi are female, and 37 percent are African American (according to the U.S. Census), we wish Pelosi had also talked with some women and blacks. Nonetheless, Pelosi’s interviews shed a fascinating light on how these white, male conservatives think.","2014-07-27 00:00:00","0","46.0","20.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","2.0","63.0","41.0","0.0","165.0","7.0","30.0","6","401","30.40","83.46","10.48","21.92","16.71","17.96","82.79","50.37","14.71","8.98","2.00","1.50","0.75","1.25","3.49","5.74","3.99","10.72","9.23","7.73","8.48","2.24","19.45","3.49","1.50","3.74","1.00","3.24","4.74","2.24","2.49","0.00","1.25","0.50","15.96","0.75","0.25","1.25","3.74","13.47","2.24","2.99","2.24","2.00","0.75","3.99","2.74","2.00","0.50","0.25","1.25","0.25","0.00","0.00","1.00","7.23","2.49","0.75","3.49","0.75","0.00","4.49","11.22","1.50","8.73","2.00","4.74","2.49","3.24","0.75","0.00","1.75","1.50","0.25","0.75","0.25","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.00","23.69","6.73","6.48","1.25","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.50","2.74","3.99","1.00","0.50","1831","7.23","21.94736842105263","534","400","25","80.62","10.0","6.0","10.96","9.7","71","7.833333333333334","15.5","241","18.95","9","0.49","0","19","4","28","0","34","35","0","3","5","38","37","0","28","0","0","38","7","25","0","1","3","9","1","15","19","7","6","31","9","1","2","0","12"
"http://tmzbreaking.com/secret-to-sell-your-soul-to-satan-is-revealed/","Secret To Sell Your Soul To Satan is Revealed","You can have power, wealth, an attractive mate and virtually anything else you ever dreamed of – by selling your soul to Satan! But how?

You must know what you’re doing when you make the deal or Satan will cheat you blind. That’s the word from Dr. Rex Touth, expert on satanic rituals and author of How to Negotiate Unholy Contracts.

Dr. Touth cites cases dating all the way back to the 16th century in which humans have agreed to spend eternity in Hell when they die in exchange for earthly pleasures while they’re alive.

“Human history and world literature are teeming with stories like that of Germany’s Dr. Faustus who sold his soul,” says Dr. Touth. “Our own American statesman Daniel Webster once debated Satan in a landmark soul-selling case in which he renegotiated the contract and had it overturned.

“Thousands have gained riches and fulfilled their fantasies.”

Here are some tips from Dr. Touth on how you can take advantage of the same opportunity:

1. SET THE DEAL UP PROPERLY. There’s a right and wrong way to make contact with the Devil. The right way is to be alone in your room, close your eyes and say, “Satan, I summon you. I have a quality soul to sell if the price is right.” It may take dozens, even hundreds of tries but at all costs, avoid sounding desperate or needy. He’ll show up eventually.

2. DEAL FROM A POSITION OF POWER. By far the biggest mistake people make is to underestimate how badly Satan wants their soul. It’s like precious gold to him and he’ll pay anything to get it. When he appears, get him to make the first offer, then up it.

3. GET THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Remember, you’re going to burn in Hell forever. So no matter how badly off you are now, demand the best. For instance, even if you feel unlovable and desperate with loneliness, don’t just say, “I want the most gorgeous woman on earth and I want her to be madly in love with me.” Instead, add, “In fact, throw in 100 other women as well so I can pick and choose according to my mood.”

4. REMEMBER TO DEMAND THE LIFE-EXTENSION CLAUSE. Satan won’t tell you if you don’t ask but you can get a guarantee of 300 years of youthful life before you go to eternal damnation. Why enjoy a mere 75 or 80 years of reckless living when you can get 300?

Religious groups worldwide are trying to ban Dr. Touth’s book. “This kind of trash is spiritual dynamite,” says a spokesman for the North American Council of Churches and Synogogues. “We can’t, in good conscience, let people read how to destroy their almighty souls.”

But Dr. Touth says we should all be aware of the facts so we can make an informed decision. “It’s your soul,” he says. “Do waht you want with it.”","2014-08-01 00:00:00","0","38.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","59.0","41.0","0.0","165.0","7.0","22.0","6","486","63.59","89.51","14.34","19.62","13.50","16.46","85.19","48.77","12.35","8.85","1.44","0.82","4.32","1.44","0.82","3.50","5.56","13.37","8.02","5.35","7.82","1.03","16.67","2.88","1.85","3.09","2.88","1.44","6.79","3.09","3.50","0.62","1.03","0.41","13.37","0.00","0.41","0.62","1.65","12.35","1.65","2.67","2.06","3.09","2.06","2.88","2.88","0.82","1.65","0.41","1.44","0.21","1.03","0.00","0.00","8.64","1.85","2.06","2.88","3.09","0.41","1.23","13.99","1.85","12.14","0.62","7.00","4.73","1.03","0.62","0.21","2.26","4.32","0.41","0.82","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.00","21.19","8.23","4.73","0.21","0.00","0.41","0.21","0.41","3.91","3.09","0.00","0.00","2061","7.1","16.193548387096776","639","486","36","83.15","8.8","5.0","8.23","6.5","86","7.5","14.478189300411524","295","15.32","27","0.49","0","19","9","29","0","52","32","0","2","11","62","58","0","21","1","0","43","10","24","0","1","1","17","0","30","10","9","2","27","16","3","2","0","10"

Picture this scenario: You’re in the middle of dinner with your man, and he rushes outside for an “emergency” call. Normally you wouldn’t care, but this is the fourth time it’s happened! Suddenly you get a sick feeling in your stomach, and it’s not from the food.

By now, you’re finally convinced your man is cheating. But you need proof. Here’s your chance to get it.

“See who he’s been calling or texting behind your back. It’s as easy as typing in a phone number.”

Introducing the controversial new website that will blow the lid off his affair. It’s called Reverse Phone Lookup, and it will help you track down who your man’s been calling or texting. Like we said, cheaters hate this website.

If you think your man’s got a secret, use this tool right now.

See who he’s been calling or textingbehind your back. It’s as easy as typing in a phone number and he’ll never find out.

Still not sure you’re ready for the truth? Check out these telltale signs your man’s a cheater. Chances are, he’s guilty of all of them.

He’s Secretive With His Smartphone

Anyone with a smartphone is spending more time online than ever before. If your man wants to fool around, he’s got a million ways to do it–and they’re all at his fingertips. Look at his texts and see who and what he’s been texting behind your back. You may be surprised at what you find.

He’s Extra Sensitive About Privacy

Cheaters work overtime to cover their tracks. You have to be smarter than them. Look out for new hobbies your man won’t tell you about. Or excuses like, “I just need to be alone.”

Then use Reverse Phone to look up calls he’s made on his phone. Maybe “Brad from work” is actually a Michelle from Tinder.

He Hits The Gym All The Time

In the past, you’ve hinted he could lose some belly fat. But he’s never listened. Now, out of the blue, he’s started hitting the gym hard. What’s changed? Him. Because if he wants to cheat, this is his mating season. He’s bulking up so he can lure the hottest girls to his bed.

He’s Distant

If your man’s doting on someone else, he won’t be as affectionate toward you. And he’ll be moody. He’ll get upset over nothing, and he’ll blame you for everything. Why does it feel like someone flipped a switch on his emotions? Because your man’s got someone on his mind. And it’s definitely not you.

Find out who’s taking up all his attention.

He Smells Different

Trust your instincts and your senses. If your man smells different, it’s because he’s spending his time somewhere else. And he’s trying to throw you off track.

Maybe he’s showering at his side chick’s place. Or you’re picking up the scent of her perfume. When your gut and your senses tell you something’s wrong, listen. Then uncover the truthfrom Reverse Phone.

He Deletes Texts

You know you’re not the only one he’s calling. But you can’t prove it. Because the last time you snuck a peek at his phone, the call and text logs were empty. Just wait a couple days, and grab his phone again (sooner or later you’ll catch him slipping). When you look up the numbers, you’ll expose the identity (and address!) of his “special someone.”

Let Reverse Phone do the secret sleuthing for you! Look up any number you want. No one will ever find out.

Everyone’s eyes wander from time to time. But not everyone strays. Make sure you don’t get caught in a love triangle you never wanted to be part of. With Reverse Phone, you’ll have the upper hand again.

Find out the truth in minutes, before he plays you for a total fool.","2014-12-09 00:00:00","0","49.0","21.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","59.0","41.0","0.0","164.0","7.0","22.0","6","643","30.79","99.00","8.88","21.01","10.37","14.93","90.67","57.39","21.31","15.40","0.16","0.16","7.93","6.69","0.47","5.75","5.60","13.37","10.42","5.29","7.15","2.33","21.15","6.07","3.11","1.87","0.62","1.71","5.75","2.64","2.95","0.31","1.40","0.47","25.82","0.00","0.00","0.47","8.71","15.86","2.64","1.87","2.18","3.89","3.42","4.51","5.91","1.87","2.02","1.09","1.87","1.09","0.31","0.16","0.47","5.75","1.09","1.71","1.56","1.24","0.47","2.95","14.93","2.80","14.46","0.93","7.62","6.38","0.78","0.62","0.47","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.95","8.71","3.58","0.16","0.00","0.47","0.47","0.00","1.56","8.40","0.62","0.00","2720","6.43","11.813559322033898","791","643","60","94.45","6.8","2.7","7.93","5.4","92","4.833333333333333","12.00317262830482","319","11.44","1","0.57","0","26","1","49","0","69","33","2","1","7","95","36","1","20","0","0","79","36","42","2","0","13","12","0","38","28","21","13","33","27","1","8","0","4"

"http://tmzbreaking.com/all-americans-to-receive-microchip-implant-by-2016-by-way-of-obamacare/","All Americans To Receive Microchip Implant By 2016 By Way Of Obamacare","NBC has recently predicted that in 2016, all of America will be tagged with microchips. They will be implanted to help identify individuals immediately. According to the report, the technology is used to answer one question, “Am I who I say I am?”



Some worry, however, that the RFID Microchip will give the government too much power, allowing them to track every move. In some states, like Virginia, legislation is in process to stop this from happening. The report also reveals an RFID Brain Chip that has been developed and is currently being tested on several humans. Proof the RFID Microchip is in Obamacare below:



It was reported that the use of Micro-Chips in Bill H.R. 4872 was located on Page 1014 under “National Medical Device Registry” it tells about a “Class II Device That is Implantable” and yes, they passed the bill. Read Page “1014″ In The H.R. 4872 Read Class II Special Controls Guidance For FDA Staff

With the RFID Microchip they can track the movement of the people that are implanted. They can also control the money and food of the people. It is also reported to be possible to even kill the people that don’t obey. The HR 3962 Bill is an exact copy of the HR 3200 bill in with the exception of just a few words removed concerning the RFID Microchip but the ability to Chip Every Citizen of the United States is still in the bill.

Big name entertainers included on Mark’s list include Ludacris, Bow Wow, Method Man, Ja Rule, Scott Storch, Young Buck, Beanie Sigel, Lil Flip and others.

Scott Storch

Mark uses well publicized news articles to back up his claims.

“It just goes to show that many of these rap stars who fall victim to this system,” Mark says. “They become willing Illuminati icons. Willing servants of this satanic, mind numbing, materialistic, mentally controlling system. And then they just become victims of it. Most of these rappers really are just actors. A lot of the jewelry they have is just fake or rented. A lot of the assets that they have on MTV Cribs… I don’t know if that show is even on any more, but a lot of those cars are just rented or leased for the weekend while they shot the episode. Even some of the houses. They didn’t own the house. They were renting the house for maybe six months or a year.”

"http://tmzbreaking.com/lol-drunk-sarah-palin-gives-speech-on-impeaching-obamavideo/","LOL: Drunk Sarah Palin Gives Speech On Impeaching Obama(VIDEO)","At the Western Conservative Summit this last week, Sarah Palin drunkenly doubled down on her calls for impeachment after a string of word soup tailored together from past conservative talking points. Am I being critical of Palin’s intelligence while she stumbles through this 30 minutes speech by calling her “drunken”? No. I do believe that Palin is 99% moron, but this one appears to be a moron that had a few too many to drink that evening before they got up for their speaking engagement.



The speech seemed to have been written by some neo-libertarian tribute to Ayn Rand by offering a protagonist “the forgotten man”. Her speech didn’t ever cover one issue, but instead turned Tea Party talking points into a macabre poetry slam competition. Palin says absolutely nothing of substance in her speech aside from her general feelings about society and her hatred of the other side of politics.

The only thing that seems certain in Palin’s world is that Obama is evil and facts are relative. Her drive towards impeachment in the drunken speech strings together random accusations as public facts (most of which have been debunked). Palin even mentions the 2008 “loophole” signed by former President Bush to give refugee status to children as a reason to impeach Obama. Because she is just that dumb… and most likely drunk.This video is 30 minutes of “are you fucking kidding me?” that is only topped off by the introduction to Palin which labels her as the “most influential woman in the history of the republican party”. That doesn’t help the republicans in their defense of the “war on women” at all.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/wiz-khalifa-arrested-for-tax-evasion-after-blowing-2-million-on-hoes-weed/","Wiz Khalifa Arrested for Tax Evasion After Blowing 2 Million On Hoes & Weed","The internet was abuzz today with more news regarding the divorce of pop icons Wiz Khalifa and wife Amber Rose, famous for something or another. It is reported that Khalifa has secretly depleted all of the couple’s wealth spending most of it on an exuberant amount of weed and hoes which were to be used on Khalifa’s extravagant hanging marijuana garden.

Khalifa had no comment for reporters as he stuffed what appeared to be a trash bag full of snapback hats into the backseat of a Mazaradi as men, appearing to be IRS, removed the rims and tires from the vehicle.

“You can’t take that,” yelled Khalifa as the men carried away a red, wooden snow sled from Khalifa’s youth. As he saw the men haul away the childhood toy, a slow tear rolled down Khalifa’s cheek realizing that he had spent so much of his life chasing paper and seeking fame that he had let his prime years slip through the cracks of his fingers.

When asked about Khalifa’s newfound poor status, wife and soon-to-be divorcee Amber Rose responded, “I knew Wiz was spending too much when he hired Malcolm Jamal-Warner to dry our hands in the restroom. Luckily, I’ve already arranged a new celebrity marriage to a fellow named Nick Canon? I don’t really know him, but whatever, my agent says it’s a good career move for whatever it is I do.”

Last seen sobbing in what was presumably a bed made of taxidermied endangered animals in throwback jerseys, Khalifa could only let out the quiet, gentle sigh, his lips forming the word “rosebud” which we can only assume is Khalifa’s favorite strain of marijuana.","2014-09-27 00:00:00","0","30.0","20.0","3.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","64.0","41.0","0.0","168.0","7.0","22.0","6","280","80.99","72.80","3.82","20.37","31.11","23.21","78.21","47.86","12.14","6.43","1.79","0.71","0.36","3.57","0.00","5.71","7.86","13.93","8.21","3.57","5.00","1.07","15.36","5.36","2.14","2.86","0.00","2.50","3.93","1.79","2.14","0.36","0.36","0.71","9.64","1.79","0.36","0.71","5.00","6.43","1.79","0.71","0.36","2.50","0.36","1.43","3.93","1.79","1.07","1.07","1.79","1.43","0.36","0.00","0.00","5.71","1.79","0.00","2.86","0.71","0.36","7.14","7.14","0.36","9.29","1.79","3.93","3.93","2.14","2.14","0.71","2.14","0.00","0.00","0.71","0.36","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","15.00","2.86","5.00","0.00","0.00","0.36","0.00","1.07","2.14","3.57","0.00","0.00","1248","8.53","36.25","396","277","9","57.13","14.1","12.9","10.51","16.0","59","16.0","22.83985559566787","190","31.88","5","0.46","0","7","0","26","0","32","22","0","1","3","48","24","0","17","0","0","16","6","10","1","0","3","6","0","12","17","8","12","6","6","3","2","0","2"

"http://tmzbreaking.com/george-w-bush-arrested-for-possession-of-cocaine/","George W. Bush Arrested For Possession Of Cocaine","One of the most notorious Presidents in history of The United States of America is back in the spotlight, but not because of his politics. George W. Bush was arrested in a Dallas suburb late Tuesday evening after a routine traffic stop uncovered over an ounce of cocaine in his glove compartment.

Dallas police say they pulled over Bush after he made a right turn without signaling. Officers report they were surprised when seeing it was the ex-president, but felt something was off about his behavior. They say Bush seemed under the influence of a narcotic, and the officers on-scene asked to search the car. Curiously, Bush consented, and police found the narcotics.“We pulled over the truck and were about to write a simple traffic ticket and things escalated fast,” said officer Charles Cane, a veteran officer with the Dallas Police Department. “At first my partner and I were stunned with who was in the truck ,and [Bush] began to crack jokes and asked if we wanted to take a picture with him. I noticed he was sniffling quite a bit and the glaze on his eyes screamed that the was under the influence.”Cane said that once the officers uncovered the cocaine, Bush tried to bribe them to keep from getting arrested. When that failed, he turned to threats and rambling, reportedly saying that he would ‘get the FBI to kick their a–’ and that ‘Presidents can break any laws they want.’

“I broke so many laws when I was in office, and I didn’t see you coming to try to arrest me then!” Bush shouted at police officers. “I’ve been doing coke for decades! I used to blow lines out of a Skull & Bones in New Haven tittie bars when you were making nice in your diapers, kid. You just want your name in the papers next to mine.”

“It was a tough arrest to make, but I didn’t become a police officer to make easy decisions. He begged me over and over to let it slide, then he offered me money, then he called me an ass—-, but that is the way the law goes. We don’t offer special treatment to anyone in Dallas.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/floyd-mayweather-knocked-out-in-sparring-session-while-training-for-pacquiao-fight/","Floyd Mayweather Knocked Out In Sparring Session While Training For Pacquiao Fight!","Las Vegas – Recent reports out of a gym in Las Vegas have reported that a strange smelling Italian/Irish immigrant by the name of Peter McFarboroni has knocked out the undisputed, undefeated boxing great Floyd Mayweather.

Where the greats have failed, this man who many thought was simply the gym’s manager, succeeded by knocking out Mayweather in a mere sparring session while he is preparing for his upcoming Pacquiao match with what McFarboroni called a haymaker. “Jumpinbegonias,” the near Leprechaun exclaimed as he saw the stars in Mayweather’s eyes as the champ spun around six times, stuck out his tongue, and collapsed to the ground.

“I threw him off his game by saying he could not read which made him drop his guard and get angry, then all I had to do was dodge to the right, block, back, back, and then punch him in his weak spot Next thing you know, the lad’s down for the count,” said McFarboronni as he slid back into his pink jogging suit and proceeded to start mopping the sauna before the gym’s closing hours.

Mayweather has claimed that the fight never happened because it was never sanctioned. This is however the first time an unsanctioned bout did not land Mayweather behind bars. [Continue Reading]

"http://tmzbreaking.com/u-s-plans-to-nuke-dallas-to-stop-spread-of-ebola-virus/","U.S. Plans To “NUKE” Dallas To Stop Spread Of Ebola Virus","Upon discovering the first U.S. ebola carrier in the city of Dallas, Texas, the United States has announced plans to safely eradicate the city by means of a human nuclear incineration device in fear that the disease might spread past city limits to infect people or because it’s Dallas and that sounds like a lot of fun.

Recently, Richard Burroughs, head director of the CDC stated, “I had a conversation with President Obama and we both agreed that the best course of action we could take would be to nuke Dallas…because of ebola of course.”

Although several health experts have already said the chance of ebola spreading on a mass scale are very slim. “You have a better chance dying of influenza in Dallas than of ebola,” said Matthew Graves, an expert in pandemic infections for Doctors without Borders. He continued, “but, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t blow up Dallas. If you’ve ever been there, it’s nothing but assholes and garbage piles.”

In a special State of the Union address, President Obama went live on television and on-line, with the broadcast being purposefully withheld from airing on Fox News in order to assure that no residents of Dallas would hear the news. In his address, President Obama stated, “men and women of America, it comes to me with great pleasure to announce that although ebolaactually did manage to make its way to the United States, it thankfully made its way to none other than Dallas, Texas and as a preemptive safety measure, I have ordered the United States Airforce to unload a small nuclear payload on the center of the city which will eradicate this city of assholes from our great nation. Oh, and it will ensure the disease doesn’t spread or something like that. You remember Outbreak.”

It has been reported at this time that the jets have taken off, but the city of Dallas stays committed in resolve to be a city full of self-absorbed, narrow-minded douchebags to the very end. One business man said with a smirk, “I’d like to see them try” right before his entire skeleton was pulverized to a fine ash by the blast.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/woman-accidentally-shoots-herself-with-gun-she-bought-for-ferguson-riots/","Woman Accidentally Shoots Herself with Gun She Bought For Ferguson Riots","As the Grand Jury decision on whether or not to indict Ferguson,MO police officer Darren Wilson in the death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown draws near, people around the area have begun to load up on firearms and ammunition. While it remains to be seen if the panic is warranted – everyone from community leaders to President Obama have stressed the need for peace following the announcement – the added guns in the hands of people who may not know how to properly use them has already seen at least one casualty.

St. Louis police are reporting that a 26-year-old woman has accidentally killed herself with a gun she had purchased in anticipation for Ferguson riots.

The accident occurred when the car the woman, identified as Becca Campbell, was riding in rear-ended a car in front of them. Typically a fender bender would not cause loss of life, but the woman’s gun discharged in the collision and the bullet struck her in the head.

According to KMOV:

The boyfriend, who wasn’t identified, told police that the couple had bought a gun because of fears of unrest related to the pending grand jury decision on the shooting of Michael Brown, the sources said.

He told investigators that as they drove late Friday night, the victim waved a gun, jokingly saying the couple were ready for Ferguson, the sources said.

He ducked to get out of the way of the gun and accidentally rear-ended another car. He said the accident caused the gun to go off and she was struck by a bullet in the head, the sources said.

Guns, already a problem for America more generally, are becoming an increasing concern for residents and law enforcement around Ferguson. As tensions rise – and urged on by a giddy media which can’t help but stoke the flames in pursuit of ratings boosts – the number of scared people buying firearms to “protect” themselves from their neighbors is skyrocketing. One Ferguson gun store owner told reporters that his sales have gone up by around 700% this month.

In a sign of just how bad it has gotten, store owners, like the one mentioned above, are now beginning to close up their shops and ship out their lethal stock so no more weapons can find their way onto the streets in the coming weeks. It’s a testament to the very real fear people feel that even the promise of large profits can’t entice gun shop owners from ignoring pleas from law enforcement and staying open for business.

Whether or not violence erupts after the decision, the fact that hundreds of more guns are now in the community is a problem that will likely plague Ferguson long after the protests end.

…At least that’s the case according to the manager of his former Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood castmate and “friend” Ray J.

During last night’s airing of the show’s reunion special, Cash Jones took to Instagram to expose the rapper for carrying on sexual activities with other men, and putting a slew of Black women “at risk.”

“Walked in the studio, and seen some sh*t I [didn’t] want to see” he posted. “Be who [you’re going to] be, kick the closet doors down and come out switching.”

MASIKA TUCKER TALKS YUNG BERG INCIDENT: ‘IT WAS NOT AN ABUSIVE SITUATION’

No word has been given if Cash is retaliating against Berg for his fall out with Ray J‘s ex-girlfriend Teairra Mari—the former Roc-A-Fella Records singer who Berg alleges performed a sex act on him while they were recording music together.

“In the past, no one would ever think of putting Martin Luther King Jr. on one of the dollar bills, but now since inflation is making the dollar more and more worthless, there’s really no reason not to because these things aren’t nearly worth as much anymore,” said Lord Snoot Rothschild, international banker and one of the chairmen of the board of the Federal Reserve.

“We need a dollar for the modern American so we’re imagining a twenty dollar bill with the face of Martin Luther King Jr. boldly featured, a five dollar bill with the face of Caesar Chavez, and a one dollar bill with America’s greatest hero Hulk Hogan,” said Fagan Rockefeller, another chairman on the board of the Federal Reserve as he dumps thousands of America’s old dollar bills into the roaring fire of his Connecticut home. “It’s not like you use those dollars anyways when you’ve got a mountain of gold stored in Sweden,” added Rockefeller.

“This Barrack Obama ten dollar bill will surely let them know that there is absolutely nothing to worry about. America is doing fine. Just check out the radnew colors on these dollars, “Rothschild cackled as he proceed to wipe his ass with what one can only assume was the fabled million dollar bill.","2014-11-15 00:00:00","0","30.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","59.0","41.0","0.0","164.0","7.0","22.0","6","257","90.26","57.71","7.72","39.70","28.56","19.46","80.16","47.47","7.78","3.50","0.00","0.78","0.78","1.56","0.39","4.28","10.12","14.40","6.61","5.45","4.67","2.33","10.51","4.67","3.50","0.78","3.89","2.33","3.11","1.95","1.17","0.39","0.00","0.39","5.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.33","10.12","2.72","2.33","1.17","0.78","1.95","1.95","2.33","0.78","0.78","0.78","1.56","1.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.28","0.78","0.00","2.72","0.78","0.00","3.50","6.61","0.39","10.51","1.17","3.89","5.45","1.56","0.00","0.39","9.34","0.39","0.00","1.17","0.39","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.39","14.40","3.50","4.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.11","3.11","0.00","0.00","1192","8.19","37.857142857142854","365","257","9","59.37","12.1","12.1","10.91","15.5","51","15.833333333333334","21.37774319066148","161","31.0","0","0.45","0","6","6","33","0","36","12","2","1","4","43","34","1","9","0","0","9","2","14","1","0","1","4","0","9","10","6","3","9","7","0","1","0","1"

He seems like a pretty patriotic guy in this video. Hey says we have the right to get rid of our current government.

Here are some of his important quotes from the speech.

“contractors are going to come in – maybe me.” –

“They’re going to kill you. That person sitting next to you won’t be sitting there because they’re going to be gone because somebody like me is going to come in and kill you. ”

“The new constitution is all ready to go. They only need the right incident to bring it down and they’re working on that right now. We’re not very far away from an event that’s going to bring what you call, martial law, that term will never be used by the way Emergency Police Powers will be.”

During the speech he said he still carries a secret clearance and had just left Fort Leonard Wood (military base in the Missouri Ozarks). He said he gets briefed every six months.

Here’s some more quotes.

“The news media is going to start banging on something – could be Ukraine, could be we don’t know. That’s how psychological warfare works. They talk about THIS and this is happening over here. It’s called a distraction.”

“So number one is – there’s going to be an emphasis on an international event – the news media is going to pound it, pound it, pound it. The second thing is you’re going to see a group or a person guilty of racism or something along those lines and they’re going to start pounding on that. They want your attention over here. The third thing you’re going to start seeing is people will be arrested for domestic terrorism. The fourth thing you’re going to see and this is what I’m going to talk to the ladies about – it’s what I call ancient hate, ancient madness, ancient revenge. When these things start to happen, people are going to start rioting. The EBT cards are going to shut down. Can you imagine what’s going to happen in St Louis County when the EBT cards go down, when the ATM machines don’t work?”

“When the inner cities start to erupt, people are going to start killing people they don’t like”.

“Right now in the United States, most Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs and Lieutenants and above will go to the FBI academy. When they go to the FBI academy, they come back brainwashed for some reason. Now I know that the St. Louis County police has that policy, I do not know about the rest of them but every Sheriff will go to the FBI academy.”

“Incidentally, there is a movie out with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, it’s called Escape…that boat exists. It’s real. That boat does exist. I’m telling you for a fact.”

“So I have to get permission from the Army to do this. I’m theirs, they own me.”

Okay so how does a “patriot” go from telling the truth about what’s going to come to actually being a part of the event he said was coming to America! Now for the record, I have found out that Dan Page did tell everybody after that speech that he was going to work for law enforcement and it’s probably safe to assume that he lived in the St. Louis area since the speech he gave to the oath keepers was in the St. Louis area and by his own admission he was checking in with Fort Leonard Wood which is in the Missouri Ozarks. So that’s not a huge deal.

But what is a HUGE deal is when Dan Page tells us exactly what is going to happen in 2012 and then is a part of it all in 2014! He tells us in the speech that he still checks in with Fort Leonard Wood for a briefing every six months and he still has an active secret clearance! That’s not typical of a person that is retired at all. You don’t just go back to your base and get briefings after you retire! He even says at the speech that they “own him”. He had to get the okay for him to speak to them. Why would somebody that is “retired” say that because you’re free to speak to anybody you want when you retire.

He’s involved in the CNN psyop that looks totally staged! How did he go from being a “good guy” to part of the “bad guys”? Did he go to the FBI academy after 2012 that he admitted that for some reason everybody came back brainwashed? And in the last video on this page, Dan admits that he worked in special forces and his specialty was psychological warfare (at about the 16:30 mark of the speech video) where he learned how to destroy a nation from within without direct military contact! What are the odds of this? Was he going back to his base at Fort Leonard Wood every six months to reinforce his brainwashing?

I believe this is VERY important information! Was Dan Page completely mind controlled at the FBI Academy or through Fort Leonard Wood? I don’t know what this all means but what does seem absolutely clear is that the Ferguson event is a STAGED event and Dan Page knew all about something just like this that would come. How did he know this unless he had access to their plans? He seems to be following the script he talked about in 2012! That’s the big deal here as well as his background in psychological warfare.

Video that ties Dan Page the “patriot” to the Cop Part of the CNN Psyop. This is a MUST SEE! There’s no doubt this is the same man! Same voice, and Dan admitted he was going to be a law enforcement officer and he was from the area!

This is a RED ALERT! Get this post out to everybody through social networks and email lists. I don’t believe in coincidences such as one of the main players at Ferguson being trained in Psychological Warfare and admitting there was major brainwashing going on in the police departments and then being part of it all! Who knows if Michael Brown was mind controlled to get aggressive with a cop or if they just were waiting for a white cop to kill a black kid before they sprang into action. It really doesn’t matter at this point because we now have the proof that this entire thing was scripted and they want to start using “Emergency Police Powers” everywhere! Dan Page told us EXACTLY what was going to happen in 2014 back in 2012! He even mentioned that “Ukraine” could be used as one of the two events as well as a racial event! They are using Ukraine and ISIS now as the other event Dan talked about in the speech to the Oath Keepers and Ferguson is being used as the racial event!

Here’s the interview with Dan Page where I found out that he specialized in Psychological Warfare and Asymmetrical Warfare which is “how to destroy a nation from within without direct military contact.” You’ll hear that at about the 16:30 mark in this video. Get the word out everywhere so everybody knows that Ferguson is a staged event! They are following the exact script that Dan Page talked about in 2012!","2014-08-22 00:00:00","0","50.0","28.0","3.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","61.0","41.0","0.0","165.0","7.0","24.0","6","1261","61.27","83.93","25.93","19.83","16.59","12.93","85.41","56.62","15.70","7.77","1.19","0.79","1.35","3.09","1.35","7.93","7.69","15.23","10.55","6.19","5.63","1.35","21.49","2.93","1.51","2.38","1.67","1.82","2.85","1.19","1.59","0.24","1.19","0.00","11.90","0.00","0.40","0.08","3.41","9.91","2.46","1.82","1.03","2.06","2.30","1.59","2.70","1.27","1.43","0.00","0.40","0.32","0.08","0.00","0.00","6.26","0.95","0.48","3.65","0.79","0.40","3.57","14.20","2.93","16.02","4.04","7.38","4.92","2.54","0.71","0.08","0.16","0.00","0.79","0.56","0.00","0.08","0.24","0.16","0.00","14.12","4.04","1.51","0.16","0.00","0.56","1.51","0.00","2.85","3.17","0.32","0.00","5271","6.06","20.0","1607","1265","75","79.7","9.0","6.3","7.6","7.4","127","6.142857142857143","12.775810276679842","439","17.51","32","0.55","0","35","18","134","0","158","66","0","1","11","144","119","2","34","0","0","104","10","58","1","0","6","61","0","68","41","50","17","60","61","11","11","0","16"
"http://tmzbreaking.com/meet-t-bone-a-jailhouse-prisoner-vigilante-who-beats-up-jail-rapis/","Meet T-Bone A Jailhouse Prisoner Vigilante Who Beats Up Jail Rapi**s","Last year I spoke to a guy named Shaun Attwood about making millions on the stock market and plunging it all into a new career as a rave-organizing ecstasy kingpin. One unfortunate side effect of selling drugs on a large scale, I discovered during our conversation, is that if the police find out about it, they’re probably going to send you to jail.

While serving time for his offenses, Shaun saw or heard about numerous rapes of inmates by their fellow prisoners—a major problem that he claimed isn’t getting nearly the amount of attention it should from prison authorities. However, he told me about a friend he made who believes it’s his Christian duty to protect weaker inmates from being sexually abused, and has been stabbed and beaten to within an inch of his life for doing just that.

T-Bone is a six feet five former Marine who’s become something of a legend in the West Coast prison system for taking a one-man stand against rapists in American jails. He’s currently serving time for robbery (he maintains his innocence), so I sent him some questions about his anti-rape crusade and the issues of sexual assault in American prisons.

VICE: Hi, T-Bone. When did you first decide that you were going to make a stand against rapists in the prison system?

T-Bone: It was in 1986, when I saw a young kid of 18 being pushed around for food and being told to smuggle crystal meth and heroin into prison inside his butt. When the kid brought the dope in, the two guys who’d made him do it both got high and raped the kid, which made me decide to take action.

How common is rape in American prisons? As prevalent as TV and movies would have you believe?

It’s very common, and it happens in a variety of ways. When I was in one particular prison here in Arizona, every single night someone was getting raped. All night long, I heard male flesh pounding against male flesh, guys getting fucked up the ass. Anyone who couldn’t fight back was game. The rapists were the size of apes. They’d put the victim in a chokehold to make them unconscious. Regular guys—not homosexuals—were getting punked and were scared to admit it. I also saw big guys kissing little white boys on the lips and neck like they were women. Gang members would sometimes hold someone down and stick things in his ass—stuff like cans, soda bottles, shampoo bottles, broom handles, or metal shanks.

Shaun has told me that your Christian faith played a part in inspiring you to take action against rapists.

My belief in God gives me the divine power to do all things through His spirit. Some people say that God doesn’t hurt people and that I hurt those rapists on my own because I wanted to run things in prison, but I believe that God didn’t tell the rapists I encountered over the years to force themselves on young inmates just because they could. I never ran across the yard and jumped on people because of their behavior; I prayed, I talked to a lot of people on the yard who felt the same way I did, and I asked God for protection.

I’m not a Superman or someone special. God’s power is much stronger than mine, and His will will be done. Making rapists stop hurting other people was God pushing and guiding me. I didn’t win all of my fights with rapists—I almost lost my life more than once when I was stabbed and smashed in the skull with rocks in socks. I believe the only reason I’m alive is by God’s grace.

Yeah, I heard that you sustained quite a few injuries after sticking up for weaker inmates.

As well as being shanked and hit with rocks, I’ve hurt my hands a lot. I’ve been hit hard and had to take it easy for weeks until my body healed from blows and hits to the back of my head. I have several large scars, including one on my shoulder, where I was sliced open. I’ve hurt my feet, knees, elbows, fingers, and toes. I’ve had contract killings put out on me for being outspoken about issues that are common in the joint. I’ve been asked to leave yards. I’ve been locked down because certain people didn’t want me around. I’ve found notes in my cell saying my life is in danger.

How did you end up in prison in the first place?

When I got out of the Marines, I set myself up as a bodyguard, and the cash started rolling in. I invested in the cocaine business and got addicted to it. I’ve lost over 20 years of my life due to the dumb decisions I made on drugs. I’ve hurt my wife and children by putting myself in here. Every time I’ve been released, I’ve come straight back. I’m not making excuses for myself, but most prisoners have drug problems, and the prisons offer no help, drug counseling, or rehabilitation. The system is designed so that prisoners come right back, because it keeps the prison in business. That’s part of the reason why there are more black guys in prison throughout the entire USA than are in college and more than were held under slavery before slavery was abolished.

[Editor’s Note: Ivory Toldson, a professor at Howard University, says the conventional idea that there are more black men in prison than in college is a myth. According to his research, there are 1.4 million black men in college and 840,000 black men in prison.]

Why do you think the US prison system has such a high level of sexual assault compared with the prison systems of other nations?

It boils down to human nature—people don’t care about prisoners. Prison is a smaller version of what our society is like, with its extremes of power and poverty. There are laws in place to protect people in society, but in here, if a guy is forced to have sex, he has nowhere to turn, because if he tells the guards, he’s considered to be a rat, and that’s worse than being labeled a punk. Rats get killed in here. That’s why so much rape goes on, but no one reports it.

Do you think the prison system could do more to protect weaker inmates?

The prison system does nothing to protect weaker inmates. It’s a system that encourages evil.

There are a lot of racial politics within the US prison system—do you ever get any trouble for helping inmates of other races?

Yes, I’ve had to defend myself many times against gang members for helping inmates of other races. Here in Arizona’s prison system, blacks are a minority. I experience pure hatred because of the color of my skin. People seethe with vile contempt and want to kill me because I’m black, but I’m wearing the same clothes and doing the same time as them.

When I first came into the prison I’m currently in, glad to see a black man stop by, I said, “Hey, what’s up, brother?” He replied: “Some of the white boys here are mad at you for smashing some whites who were raping a youngster at another yard. They said that was white-boy business and you shouldn’t be interfering.”

“How many brothers are on this run?” I asked, referring to black inmates. “You’re looking at him,” was the reply. “I guess I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place then,” I said, wondering how best to defend myself.

Did they come after you?

Later that day, I was let out for a shower. Two whites approached me at the steps, making noise to attract my attention. Then, out of nowhere, another white inmate jumped on my back and put me in a strong chokehold—a precision attack. Another guy grabbed my legs and pulled me down. I tried to kick and pull, but someone laid across my legs and twisted my body to an angle that hurt my back. Another inmate held my arms down while lying across my middle. I could tell they’d done this before.

The first guy said, “Pull his pants down.”

They started to yank my pants down, and I couldn’t stop them. One produced a wooden broom handle shaped like a penis at the end. The sight of the phallus made me struggle with all my might, but I was pinned down too strong. Luckily, two Mexicans ran up the steps. One kicked the first guy in the face and I broke loose of the chokehold. He then spun around and stabbed a Mexican in the stomach. I leaned forward and hit the guy holding my legs down in the neck with my right hand. He tried to grab me, but I got a hold of his wrist, turned him over, pushed his arm up behind his back, dislocated his shoulder and snapped his wrist. I smashed his face into the pavement. I hit another guy in the esophagus, and he went down. Then 20 cops materialized out of nowhere.

Jesus. Finally, if you could change one thing about the US prison system, what would it be?

The prison system here has been set up not to allow God in. That needs to change, because God is love, and where there’s love, there’s peace.

Thanks to Shaun Attwood for putting me in touch with T-Bone. You can read about Shaun’s own prison experiences in his new book, Prison Time.

Obama cites one reason for incorporating the island nation: “We need another vacation state.”

Below: U.S. flag redesign compositions to reflect all 51 states

“The tyranny of Fidel Castro can be overlooked now that he has stepped down, and we can take this opportunity to grow our borders for the betterment of our domestic travel options,” the president said. “Hawaii has played itself out. As beautiful as it is, we’ve all been there, done that. We don’t have another domestic tropical island where we can vacation without a passport. We need another. And Cuba is it.”

Currently Americans are not allowed to travel to Cuba; however, if the country does become a part of the United States, Americans will be able to visit the lush Caribbean island restriction free.

Estaban Arnaz, spokesman for Cuba’s president Raul Castro, when asked about becoming part of the United States, said simply, “We’re in.”

“This is yet another attempt by the president to abuse his executive power,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) told reporters, acknowledging that, in fact “the way the president has been able to bend the rules thus far, I wouldn’t be surprised if this actually happens, but in the end, do I care? F*ck no. I’ve never been to Cuba. I’m excited to check it out.”

Although a 51 star flag design is still in the works, the cost of changing the American flag to show 51 stars will be passed on to American workers, in what’s being called “The Star Tax.” FICA deductions will increase 2% beginning in March 2016.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/ferguson-gang-leader-admits-eric-holder-paid-us-to-start-riots/","Ferguson Gang Leader Admits “Eric Holder Paid Us To Start Riots”","Eric Holder’s career has survived a long list of scandals; The 2008 Black Panther debacle, overturning Arizona’s immigration laws and ‘Fast and Furious‘ immediately spring to mind. These, however, pale in comparison to the recent allegations against Holder, the likes of which could easily land the Attorney General behind bars.

Evidence has been uncovered showing Eric Holder contributed funds to Ferguson’s gang population as incentive to loot and spread civil unrest in the area. These angry, government-sponsored terrorists have systematically infiltrated peaceful protests with the intention of escalating the situation and inciting riots.

A local gang leader came forward last week after being arrested during a night of mass-looting. The unnamed criminal is using his information to bargain for a reduced sentence.

Allegedly, Holder’s goal behind pouring the proverbial gasoline on an already volatile scene is to test militarized police response in a martial law scenario. It is also suspected that the riots have been started as the latest in distractions from the diabolical duo of Obama and Holder. This isn’t the first time they have created a media bait-and-switch to cover up any of their numerous crimes and blunders.

Officials have yet to publicly identify the damaging evidence submitted by the gang member, and are still in the process of verifying the legitimacy of said items. Judge Rineheart of the 22nd Circuit Court in St. Louis is presiding over the case, and has reviewed the materials. During a phone interview with National Report Judge Rineheart stated “The evidence I have seen is incredibly convincing.”

Holder is not yet officially charged with a crime, but it’s expected that a warrant could be issued for him within the coming days. Obama’s spokespeople have declined to comment.

"http://tmzbreaking.com/cdc-says-ebola-virus-vaccine-only-works-on-white-people/","CDC Says Ebola Virus Vaccine Only Works On White People","The Center of Disease

Control, which is headquartered in Atlanta, has released a statement saying the trial vaccine for the deadly Ebola virus will only work on those with white skin.

In an excerpt from the statement, the government agency stated, “Early tests of an experimental drug, which would effectively combat the spread of Ebola, have proved successful only in those with white skin — We are working diligently to improve the sample to be able to help all those who are in need.”

The vaccine, which was developed by ThomasSmithCharles in conjunction with the BIP, has began a trial phase. The vaccine uses a strain of a West Nile monkey cold virus called ape multivirus type 5 to deliver benign genetic material of the West African strain of Ebola. The genetic material given to the patient is not able to replicate and poses virtually no health risk. The sample instead strengthens the immune system to fight off the virus. If successful, ape multivirus type 5 could stop the spread of Ebola.

According to the CDC, the trial was doled out 200 people, but only proved effective to those with white skin. Some scientists believe high levels of melanin may somehow be affecting the sample.

Many citizens voiced concern when two white Americans were flown to Emory Hospital in Atlanta and were cured of the deadly disease, while 1,000’s in Africa continue to die. Conspiracy theorists believe the American Government has a cure for the disease, but has no plans to dole it out to Africans.

A Twitter member, who goes by @Sidney_Bingham wrote, “Ebola was a incurable disease when it was killing Africans by the hundreds but now that 2 white people have it suddenly there’s a cure.”

User @J_Nuclear wrote, “Ebola death camps in Africa…..now when white people start getting it all of a sudden an experimental cure comes out.”

With the disease seeming to only work on those with white skin, the conspiracy theorists certainly have been provided with more fodder for their beliefs.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/the-food-stamp-capital-of-the-u-s-is-white-and-republican/","The Food Stamp Capital of the U.S. is WHITE and REPUBLICAN","In spite of the prevailing stereotypes and assumptions about who uses SNAP Food Stamp benefits the most in the United States, the highest usage is not in Compton, Queens, nor the South Side of Chicago. Instead, a city that is 99.22% white and 95% Republican comes in the lead. Owsley County, Kentucky is a community of about 5,000, residents earning the lowest median household income in the country outside of Puerto Rico, according to the U.S. Census.

The decline in the profits from coal, tobacco and lumber industries led to a harsh toll being taken on the community.

Cale Turner, county executive of Owsley County told ABC back in 2010 that economic hardships have led to a high incidence of drug addiction.

“Those with drug addictions end up in prison without effective treatment. And it happens over and over in this community. The drug problem continues to get worse every year.”

Strangely enough, the residents of Owsley County are almost entirely Republican, in spite of the traditional opposition to the Food Stamp program by the GOP. In fact, just last November, residents of Owsley saw their SNAP benefits reduced drastically as a result of Republican opposition to funding the program.

This might rank among the greatest of ironies in history: the Food Stamp Capital of the U.S. is almost entirely white and Republican.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/how-duck-dynastys-phil-avoided-prison/","How Duck Dynasty’s Phil Robertson Avoided Prison For Breaking Statutory Rape Laws","Due to the obsession in American culture with “Duck Dynasty”, most are aware that star Phil Robertson caused a stir last month when his family leaked their own video of him advocating marrying girls when they are 15 or 16 years old. But what many do not realize is that Phil was not simply giving advise, he apparently practiced what he preached, even in violation of state and federal law.

“They got to where they’re getting hard to find, mainly because these boys are waiting ’til they get to be about 20 years old before they marry ’em,” Robertson said in the video clip. “Look, you wait ’til they get to be 20 years old, the only picking that’s going to take place is your pocket. You got to marry these girls when they are about 15 or 16. They’ll pick your ducks.”

Robertson did advise listeners to “check with Mom and Dad about that, of course.” But according to A&E’s website, Robertson is four years older than his wife, Kay and he married her when she was just 16 years old, back in 1966. But this was not when he started dating Kay. In fact, he began dating her since she was 14 years old. She then got pregnant and Phil was apparently forced to marry her when she was 16 in order to avoid going to prison for statutory rape in Louisiana.

Most who tuned in to the controversy surrounding Phil’s comments, on the appropriate “marrying age”, focused on additional comments in the video, like “Make sure that she can cook a meal. You need to eat some meals that she cooks, check that out. Make sure she carries her Bible. That’ll save you a lot of trouble down the road.”

What they didn’t realize is that Phil violated statutory rape laws.

While the federal age of consent is 18, state-by-state the age of consent varies. But not so fast… In Louisiana the age of consent is 17, and there is a 2 year gap that nullifies these laws if the individuals are only two years apart. Phil and Kay are 4 years apart, and Kay was pregnant before ever reaching the age of consent in Louisiana. Their relationship began even before then. Translation: Phil Robertson was guilty of statutory rape, but he dodged facing time for this by marrying Kay.

After Robertson’s comments about homosexuals and African-Americans, A&E promptly suspended Phil Robertson from filming future episodes. But nine days later, the network reversed its decision. The message from A&E was clear: Money talks. Meanwhile, A&E hasn’t apparently had a problem with the fact that Phil violated statutory rape laws and advocated that others do the same.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/the-bubonic-plague-is-back-and-china-has-quarantined-a-whole-town/","The Bubonic Plague is BACK and China Has Quarantined a Whole Town!","An entire town in China has been sealed off, with 151 people placed in quarantine since last week. This move came after a man died of bubonic plague, and others were feared infected, according to Chinese state media on Tuesday.

Their are 30,000 people living in the quarantined region of Yumen in the northwestern province of Gansu. None of them are currently allowed to leave. Police were set up at roadblocks on its perimeter, telling motorists to find alternative routes, according to state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV).

Earlier this month, the 38-year-old victim was said to have found a had found a dead marmot, a small hairy animal from the grasslands of the region, related to the squirrel.

After preparing the animal for feeding to his dog, the man developed a fever the same day. His condition worsened after he was rushed to the hospital, and he died last Wednesday.

“The city has enough rice, flour and oil to supply all its residents for up to one month,” state CCTV added.

“Local residents and those in quarantine are all in stable condition.”

A previous report by the China Daily newspaper had reported that “four quarantine sectors” were set up in the city, while CCTV made the quarantine sound a bit more voluntary.

The Plague is categorized as a “Class A infectious disease” in China. The official news agency Xinhua said that this is “the most serious under China’s Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases”.

The “Black Death”, another more well-known name for the infection, is an epidemic disease that killed tens of millions of people in 14th century Europe.

But a more recent pandemic, the Modern Plague, surfaced in China in the 1860s, reaching Hong Kong by 1894, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

“Over the next 20 years, it spread to port cities around the world by rats on steamships,” the CDC says. “The pandemic caused approximately 10 million deaths.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/secret-document-leaked-saying-israel-planned-to-reoccupy-gaza-all-along/","Secret Document Leaked Saying Israel Planned To Reoccupy Gaza All Along","It’s now six weeks into the most recent Gaza conflict that has proven to be immune to cease-fires. Now, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing tremendous pressure in the Knesset and in the security services for a criminal investigation into a leak of a document that reveals that Israel has been planning to reoccupy Gaza all along.

The leak occurred back in early August. A top-secret military briefing was delivered in late July or early August to Israel’s eight-member security Cabinet.

There were more than a dozen people present, and it is believed by the Netanyahu administration that at least one of them had a motive to leak the military’s analysis. But strangest of all, the prime suspect, according to reporters who have spoken to participants, is now looking like Netanyahu himself.

“Every political reporter that you ask will confirm to you that this leak came from the prime minister’s office,” a senior correspondent, Ben Caspit of the right-wing daily Ma’ariv said on August 6, the day after the leak was first reported on local Israeli Channel 2 News.

Since then, the same leak has hit nearly every other Israeli news outlet.

The leak tells us a great deal about the Gaza campaign and what the intentions were behind it. It also highlights the sharp divisions within the Israeli leadership as to how to respond to Hamas.

The topic of the briefing specifically was the challenge of reoccupying Gaza and disarming Hamas through such an occupation. The briefing explained that after taking over, Israel would certainly face violent chaos for several more years until the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet are able to get an intelligence network in place and thereafter “stabilize Israeli rule.”

The briefing acknowledge that IDF soldiers will face a high risk of kidnapping throughout the span of these years.

On August 5, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni stormed out of a Cabinet meeting after hearing the leaked report, “stormed back in” to confront Netanyahu. She demanded that every Cabinet member be given a polygraph test.

There are several theories about who is responsible for the leak. Those who think Netanyahu is behind it think that he wanted to create the appearance that the army forced him keep military options “limited.”

Others believe the leaker wasn’t Netanyahu at all. The most well-known Haaretz military analyst Amir Oren, said that “One branch of the defense establishment suspects that the mole’s last name rhymes with the name of a certain country with which Netanyahu is obsessed.” This would suggestion that either Erdan or Lieberman are behind the leak, as both rhyme with “Iran.”

The previously “behind-the-scenes” dispute between the CIA and Congress overflowed into public view today when the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee accused the CIA of breaching constitutional principles, and federal law in their efforts to undermine an investigation into the agency’s controversial interrogation program.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) publicly called out the CIA for secretly removing documents, as well as searching committee-used computers and further attempting to intimidate Congressional investigators. The Director of the CIA John O. Brennan denied these allegations.

One senator exclaimed that if the accusations are true, “this is Richard Nixon stuff.”

Brennan said that “when the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong.”","2014-03-11 23:27:33","0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","2.0","0.0","61.0","65.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","2.0","2","156","89.15","69.60","10.47","25.77","19.50","32.05","73.72","44.87","9.62","2.56","0.64","0.00","0.64","0.00","1.28","7.05","9.62","12.82","5.77","3.21","7.05","0.00","10.90","3.21","1.92","2.56","0.64","0.64","3.85","1.92","1.92","0.00","0.64","0.00","5.77","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","5.77","1.92","0.64","0.64","1.92","1.92","0.64","1.92","1.28","0.64","0.00","0.64","0.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.69","0.00","0.64","5.13","0.64","1.28","4.49","7.05","0.64","10.90","1.28","6.41","3.21","7.69","0.00","0.64","1.28","0.00","0.00","1.28","0.00","0.64","0.00","0.64","0.00","16.03","5.13","2.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.56","3.85","0.64","1.28","0.00","839","10.01","31.4","259","152","7","40.99","15.2","12.9","15.9","16.4","51","13.375","24.101052631578952","117","27.8","8","0.45","0","5","1","19","0","19","11","0","0","1","18","22","0","12","0","0","3","2","5","0","0","2","2","0","3","7","7","4","6","3","0","1","0","3"
"http://politicalblindspot.com/racist-open-carry-ar-15-protest-results-in-arrests-warrants-and-charges-filed/","Racist ‘Open-Carry’ AR-15 ‘Protest’ Results In Arrests, Warrants and Charges Filed","Last week a group of four Caucasians paraded around the streets of Cincinnati, Ohio armed with AR-15s. They claimed they were engaged in an “open carry protest,” but throughout the YouTube video of the event, they can be heard saying racial slurs over and over. It is clear from the video that the group was trying to intimidate members of the largely African American Price Hill community, through which they were “marching.”.

Now, one of the four has been arrested and charges of menacing and stalking have been filed against him.

One of two men, out of the group of four, which included two women, took a video of their East Price Hill “open carry” march, where the group passed the District 3 police headquarters.

“Broad day, you see this? Walking down the street with a AR-15,” the man filming the ordeal said. Police later identified as Jesse Deboard, who said he was “exercising his Constitutional right.”.

After they posted the video on YouTube of their encounters during the “march” with Cincinnati police, the incident took center stage on social media.

The police can heard saying “Like you said, it’s your right to do that, it makes no sense to me I mean, unless you just want attention and us to stop you and ask you. I just don’t understand it, that’s all. I’ve seen enough of these YouTube videos where everybody just tries to get the cop to stop them.”

The group can be heard bragging: “Open carry in the state of Ohio, the cops can’t do nothing”.

Deboard says to potential YouTube viewers: “still want that drama, though.”

“This is going on YouTube, n*gga, world star,” Deboard yells to a passing group of African American men.

But now, the 23-year-old Deboard has been arrested and charged with menacing by stalking as well as a violation of a protection order.

“Bouta go cop 2 ar-15s brand new in the box with front grips rail mounts extra clips and a thousand rounds of 556 shells not ta mention 2 Canon t3i cameras && 2 crotch rockets & thats just starting our morning! ‪#‎Realmfsdorealthings‬,” Deboard, said.

Warrants have also been issued for Chris Masters and Christina Tharp. The fourth person in the group has been identified as Stephanie Coverman, but there is no word on whether a warrant will be issued for her yet or not.

While Ohio does allow for open carry, things get a little more precarious when one is speaking about unholstered weapons. In a “ready position” a weapon is no longer regarded as being “carried” but instead potentially be used to menace or threaten. The group of four racist friends might have wanted to peruse the Ohio Revised Code a little more carefully before forming their own make-shift “protest”.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/radio-host-says-ebola-is-a-cleansing-force-that-will-kill-homosexuals-and-atheists/","Radio Host Says Ebola Is a ‘Cleansing Force’ That Will Kill Homosexuals and Atheists","The now infamous Christian radio host Rick Wiles often says some pretty crazy stuff. But this time he has topped even his own level of crazy which listeners (enthusiasts and those who tune in for a laugh), have come to expect. While Wiles often says some pretty inflammatory things, this time he has transcended all levels of cruelty and insensitivity, claiming that the Ebola virus which has been ravaging Africa, is in fact a cleansing force.

“This Ebola epidemic could become a global pandemic and that’s another name for plague,” Wiles said on his “Trunews” talk show.

“It may be the great attitude adjustment that I believe is coming,” Wiles carried on. “Ebola could solve America’s problems with atheism, homosexuality, sexual promiscuity, pornography, and abortion.”

Wiles continued with the insane rants, claiming that the virus did have a downside. While it would kill everyone that Wiles doesn’t like, it would – he was certain – allow President Obama to declare martial law on Americans.

“If Ebola becomes a global plague, you better make sure the blood of Jesus is upon you, you better make sure you have been marked by the angels so that you are protected by God,” Wiles cautioned. “If not, you may be a candidate to meet the Grim Reaper.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/republican-candidate-says-gays-should-be-stoned/","Republican Candidate Says Gays Should Be Stoned","It sounds like satire, but it’s sadly not. Oklahoma state house candidate, Republican Scott Esk wrote on Facebook just last summer that homosexuals are “worthy of death” and should be stoned.

He further claimed later that violence against gays is “in the old testament under a law that came directly from God.”

The fact of the matter is considerably more ambiguous. Scholars of religion point to numerous interpretations of the passage, and note that fact that Rabbis of the Second Temple Era, 2,000 years ago, were utterly silent about carrying out such a death sentence for homosexuals. This would seem to indicate that the infamous Biblical passage had less than lethal interpretations historically.

Esk’s messages on Facebook were commentary on a story about Pope Francis asking “who am I to judge” gay priests. Apparently Esk’s answer was that he was not only the judge of homosexuals, but the jury and executioner as well.

A commenter asked, “So just to be clear, you think we should execute homosexuals (presumably by stoning)?” Esk responded to this in the affirmative.

“I think we would be totally in the right to do it,” he replied. “That goes against some parts of libertarianism, I realize, and I’m largely libertarian, but ignoring as a nation things that are worthy of death is very remiss.”

“If men wink at such perversions, God may have no choice than to judge such nations with calamities.”

Later, a local magazine editor asked Esk to clarify. He then explained that this was “God’s law” but that God has “no plans to, you know, reinstitute that in Oklahoma law,” further confirming Esk’s delusions that he has two-way communications with the “Man upstairs” (if such an analogy suits you).

“I do have some very huge moral misgivings about those kinds of sins,” he continued.

In spite of being pro-execution for homosexuality, Esk describes himself as “100% pro-life” and “100% Traditional Family Values” on his campaign website. As well, in spite of his clarification that God doesn’t want to implement Biblical law in Oklahoma, his website (Esk’s, not God’s), reads: “I look forward to applying Biblical principles to Oklahoma law.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/police-say-drones-continue-to-appear-at-crime-scenes/","Police Say DRONES Continue To Appear At Crime Scenes","Police have been reporting that drones are showing up more and more at crime scenes. The trend began earlier this year, but police say that far from slowing down, it has gotten much worse. This highlights the problem of rampant drone ownership and the potential abuses of the devices. Furthermore, it is serving as a wake-up call to many regarding the inherent abuse-prone nature of drones.

But the drone proliferation is far from something police are just complaining about, they are also actively participating in the drone race. Departments all over the country have been purchasing the devices to monitor towns and often the inner city. But when the drones are being used by others – presumably reporters, more often than not – the police seem to suddenly shift gears about the growing popularity of the devices.

“Here was a dead body still on the scene. We had covered it the best we could,” Lt. Brian Foley, a Hartford police spokes man, said. “You don’t want the family to see that.”

Hartford officers questioned a man who they believed operated the drone from nearby. He identified himself as an employee of WFSB-TV but claimed he was not working for the news agency that day at all.

Klarn DePalma, said “We don’t even own a drone,” the news spokesperson said.

In all, the FAA said that it has issued dozens of warning letters to drone operators. These can include orders to stop operations, but often do not.

Two years ago, Congress passed a law requiring the FAA to integrate unmanned aircraft of all sizes into the domestic airspace by late 2015. That deadline will likely pass without compliance being widespread.

For now, the FAA says they will focus on small drones that are flown under about 400 feet, for enforcing existing laws, and pushing for new ones.

Drones hold appeal for journalists because they would allow new perspectives and access, particularly in areas that are not reachable by helicopter or could pose dangers to people.

Matt Waite, a journalism professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln says that they, along with the University of Missouri-Columbia were ordered to stop flying drones outdoors until obtaining official government authorization.

Waite founded the university’s Drone Journalism Lab back in 2011. He said that once permission for commercial drone use is granted, journalists will need to consider important ethical issues, including the psychological distress the use of drones might cause to victims and their families.

“What is a permitted risk? What is a responsible risk? Those two may be two different things,” Waite explained.

“This is why you’re going to see journalists getting in more trouble,” he continued. “As a journalist, what’s the point of going to the trouble and getting pictures if you’re not going to publish?”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/police-stand-by-arrest-of-innocent-man-with-0-0-breathalizer-results/","Police Stand By Arrest Of Innocent Man With 0.0 Breathalizer Results","Larry Davis was arrested last January when police say he ran a stop sign. According to the arresting officers in Texas, Davis was “drunk.” The only problem is that Davis says he wasn’t and volunteered to take a field sobriety test. The “Breathalizer” test results said that Davis had a 0.0 result, demonstrating that he was as far from drunk as possible, according to the test.

Now police are standing by their drunken driving arrest of Davis, even though his Breathalizer and addition blood tests showed he was not intoxicated.

Since the blood test results have come in, Davis has requested that his name – and record – be cleared. Still, the arresting officer’s supervisor said he supports the decision to arrest Davis, in spite of the clear evidence that he had done nothing arrest-worthy wrong.

Neverthless, Cmdr. David Mahoney, of Austin police said that, “If there is someone who is possibly impaired, we don’t want them driving. We need to get them off the road, so that was probably (the officer’s) mindset.”

Davis, on the other hand, said “I was arrested for nothing, really. It was suspicion of drunk driving, which I wasn’t so I was surprised and hurt at the same time.”

Watch the dashboard camera video footage below and see for yourself. If you agree with Davis, help get the word out. This man’s name needs to be cleared!

"http://politicalblindspot.com/state-supreme-court-rules-you-can-be-forced-to-decrypt-data-on-laptop-or-phone/","State Supreme Court Rules You CAN Be FORCED To Decrypt Data On Laptop Or Phone","Thanks to Edward Snowden’s revelations about the NSA’s virtually limitless spying capabilities, Internet security experts have been emphasizing the importance of encrypting data on laptops, phones and portable drives.

But now the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has just ruled that a criminal defendant can be legally forced to decrypt the contents of their electronic devises.

The ruling comes in conclusion to a case where a lawyer was arrested back in 2009 for allegedly participating in a mortgage fraud scheme. Leon I. Gelfgatt, the defendant, admitted to the Massachusetts state police that he had done work with the company Baylor Holdings.

He asserted that the correspondences related to these dealings were encrypted on the hard drives of all of his computers and that he would not decrypt them, though he was able to if he wanted to.

The MJSC, the highest court in Massachusetts, asked whether entering the password to decrypt these contents was an act of self-incrimination, and a violation of Gelfgatt’s Fifth Amendment rights.

But in a 5-2 decision, the court rules that this did not violate his rights, and that he could in fact be legally forced to decrypt the information.

“Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the factual statements that would be conveyed by the defendant’s act of entering an encryption key in the computers are ‘foregone conclusions’ and, therefore, the act of decryption is not a testimonial communication that is protected by the Fifth Amendment. The investigation by the corruption, fraud, and computer crime division of the Attorney General’s office uncovered detailed evidence that at least two mortgage assignments to Baylor Holdings were fraudulent,” the MJSC’s ruling concluded.

“During his postarrest interview with State police Trooper Patrick M. Johnson, the defendant stated that he had performed real estate work for Baylor Holdings, which he understood to be a financial services company. The defendant informed Trooper Johnson that he had more than one computer at his home, that the program for communicating with Baylor Holdings was installed on a laptop, and that ‘[e]verything is encrypted and no one is going to get to it.’ The defendant acknowledged that he was able to perform decryption. Further, and most significantly, the defendant said that because of encryption, the police were ‘not going to get to any of [his] computers,’ thereby implying that all of them were encrypted.”

“According to the Commonwealth, the encryption software on the computers is virtually impossible to circumvent. Its manufacturer touts the fact that it does not contain a ‘back door’ that would allow access to data by anyone other than the authorized user. Thus, the Commonwealth states, the files on the four computers cannot be accessed and viewed unless the authorized user first enters the correct password to unlock the encryption,” the ruling continued.

Justice Barbara Lenk wrote the dissenting opinion in the case, saying “On this view, he would not be asserting that he owned them, had exclusive use and control of them, or was familiar with any of the files on them; that certain files contained the incriminating evidence sought; or that the documents were authentic. Such is far from the case.”

“In taking this view of the matter, the court maintains that the defendant merely would be entering a password, which he would not disclose to the Commonwealth, into the encryption program, and would not thereby be selecting and producing any documents. Such an artificial distinction between the act of entering the decryption key and the inevitable result of decrypting the devices, and thereby producing the files for inspection, obfuscates the reality of what the defendant is being compelled to disclose.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/steubenville-rape-case-charges-dropped-for-two-defendants/","Steubenville Rape Case Charges DROPPED For Two Defendants","Charges were dropped this past week, in the case against two school employees involved in the Steubenville, Ohio rape case. The two were charged during an investigation into whether other laws were broken in the commission of the rape of a 16-year-old girl by two now former high school football players in the small Ohio town.

Among those charged was strength and wrestling coach as well as elementary school teacher Seth Fluharty who were accused of failing to report the August 2012 rape.

The Elementary school principal Lynnett Gorman had additionally been accused of failing to report rumors of a teen drinking and sex party back in April 2012. This party, however, was unrelated to the West Virginia girl’s rape.

Now, the Ohio attorney general’s office has confirmed that misdemeanor charges of failure to report child abuse and neglect have been dropped, as of June 20. This came after Fluharty and Gorman were said by prosecutors to have met conditions of deals to avoid prosecution.

Gorman performed 40 hours of community service at a rape crisis or victim assistance center. She also had to talk to teachers and administrators in Steubenville about the importance of reporting crimes like the one she helped to cover up.

She was also instrumental in encouraging the school system to host a speaker from the Ohio Alliance Against Sexual Violence during Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April, but this was merely a condition of the charges being dropped, rather than a gesture of good faith.

Fluharty, as well, was made to complete 20 hours of community service at a domestic-violence shelter as well as attending an anti-sexual violence seminar at Steubenville city schools.

Gorman and Fluharty are only two of six people charged following a grand jury investigation which kicked off on March 17, 2013.

That was when two of the players engaged directly in the notorious rape were convicted. Attorney General Mike DeWine said a continued investigating has been necessary to ensure the community and the nation know that justice had been done, following allegations of cover-up.

The trial of district superintendent Mike McVey is still ahead, set for August 18 in Jefferson County Common Pleas Court.

The district’s former technology director, William Rhinaman, faces a court date that has still not been set. Stay tuned…

"http://politicalblindspot.com/superbowl-seasons-dirty-secret-and-the-congressman-who-just-exposed-it/","Superbowl Season’s ‘Dirty Secret’, and the Congressman Who Just Exposed It","There is a dirty secret about Superbowl season that the mainstream media and the NFL would have swept under the rug. Some media outlets have even been scrambling to “debunk” the “myth” of higher child sex-trafficking rates in cities hosting the Superbowl, during the time surrounding the event, as well as during other major sporting events.

But Representative Ted Poe (R-Texas) believes that this is a very real problem and phenomenon. He has been reaching across the aisle in order to get some legislation passed that would do a lot for human rights. This legislation deserves our support regardless of what city and what events may or may not be related to human trafficking and sex abuse.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/supreme-court-delays-gay-marriages-in-virginia-at-the-last-minute/","Supreme Court Delays Gay Marriages in Virginia at the Last Minute","Just one day before marriage licenses were to be provided to gay couples in Virginia, the Supreme Court decided to delay same-sex marriages without providing any explanation. In addition to stopping many of the same-sex weddings planned on August 21st, the order prevents the state from recognizing gay couples married out of state.

This comes as a surprise as the court had ruled that Virginia’s same-sex marriage ban was against the constitution. Expressing its opinions in a statement, the Asheville-based Campaign for Southern Equality wrote, “This means that couples in the Virginias and the Carolinas cannot immediately exercise their fundamental right to marry as recognized by the Fourth Circuit.”

“We are disappointed in today’s action taken by the Court. Every day that same-sex couples in the 4th Circuit – and across the country – are not able to marry, LGBT families are harmed,” the statement continues. “But we remain hopeful that the Supreme Court will take up a marriage equality case in short order.”

Virginia is expected to have around 7,100 same-sex couples married within three years of the change in law. However, when they will be recognized by the state and given the rights they deserve is yet to be determined.","2014-08-21 21:00:32","0","31.0","5.0","159.0","1.0","31.0","0.0","237.0","163.0","54.0","156.0","0.0","33.0","3","207","96.98","68.54","64.25","52.99","23.00","28.02","85.02","45.41","5.80","2.42","0.00","0.97","0.00","0.00","1.45","3.38","10.14","17.39","7.25","2.90","4.35","1.45","11.59","7.73","5.31","0.48","2.42","2.42","3.38","2.42","0.97","0.00","0.00","0.48","8.21","4.83","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.63","4.35","0.97","0.97","0.97","0.97","2.90","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.28","0.00","0.48","5.31","0.48","11.59","5.80","1.45","2.42","0.97","0.97","4.35","7.25","1.93","16.91","1.45","8.70","5.80","0.97","1.45","0.48","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.98","4.35","3.86","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.90","2.90","0.97","0.00","0.00","1002","8.34","29.857142857142858","304","202","9","57.2","12.5","10.8","12.89","14.0","46","12.75","20.06891089108911","128","26.57","1","0.45","0","4","6","24","0","29","11","0","0","2","33","19","1","12","0","0","4","2","6","0","0","1","8","0","9","8","4","12","6","6","1","0","0","1"
"http://politicalblindspot.com/outrage-as-george-zimmerman-signs-autographs-at-orlando-gun-show/","Outrage as George Zimmerman Signs Autographs at Orlando Gun Show","Last Saturday, George Zimmerman showed up at an Orlando, Florida gun show to sign autographs. The killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin greeted people and signed autographed photos of him posing with his dog.

The New Orlando Gun Show was held at the Arms Room store, but was originally scheduled to be held at the Majestic on John Young Parkway. When people heard about Zimmerman’s appearance, however, the feedback was overwhelmingly negative.

The organizers of the show said the venue canceled late Thursday after Zimmerman’s planned appearance sparked community outrage.

“They told us they canceled for community pressure,” Mike Piwowarski, a gun show organizer and dealer, said. “They were getting phone calls and backlash, and didn’t want that kind of person there.”

Piwowarski said said that he is suing the gun show for estimated $300,000 in lost gun sales, due to the insistence on having Zimmerman appear. This insistence made for a tiny turn out, and thus huge losses in sales to those who paid for tables at the show.

Lines to meet Zimmerman were tiny throughout the duration of the show. It seems that amongst gun owners, there aren’t as many people who support George as would like the public to believe.

Zimmerman offered to return the favor and support Piwowarski’s gun business, which led to today’s appearance, he said.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/no-westboro-baptist-nuts-are-not-going-to-iraq-to-protest-isis/","No, Westboro Baptist Nuts Are NOT Going To Iraq To Protest ISIS","Sorry to disappoint everyone, but no the Westboro Baptist hate group members are not heading to Iraq to face of with Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). A few days ago, some readers had asked us why we had not reported on the “news” that the controversial “church” was headed to the Middle East to protest “Islam” and the killing of Christians by ISIS. Our answer was simple: we didn’t see any evidence that this would really happen and didn’t want to give in to the group’s constant ploys for attention. But now, the false claim has been circulating virally – as so many false stories tend to do – so we thought it would be a good idea to set the record straight.

The rumor was started, then quickly circulated throughout social media, after the hate group said they would take up an offer from comedian Adam Hills to fly the anti-gay trolls to Iraq, where they could protest the terrorist group ISIS.

Hill told members of the hate church to “put your money where your mouth is.” He offered to fly them all the way to Iraq on his dime so they could protest against the killing of Christians by ISIS.

“I’ll even fly them first class and pay the carbon offset,” he continued the offer.

But perhaps to his surprise, the hate group jumped at the officer. So Hill sadly informed viewers that he was not actually going to do this, saying instead that he would take the moral high ground and donate the money to raised for the flights to St Jude Children’s Research Hospital, a charity Robin Williams was a supporter of.

Hill knew this would particularly aggravate the Westboro Baptist hate group, since the branded Williams a “f** pimp.”

Hill said that the goal was to “spread love instead of hate” through the donation, made in the name of the late actor.

About the author: M.B. David is the author of several scholarly works on Middle Eastern politics, history and religion, such as People of the Book: What the Religions Named in the Qur’an Can Tell Us About the Earliest Understanding of “Islam” as well as the recently published Sci-Fi novel Sleeper Cell 2240: Memoires of the 21st Century Interplanetary Revolution. He is currently working on his doctorate, writing a dissertation focused on the non-profit Hashlamah Project Foundation and associated global study circles.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/new-ceasefire-agreed-upon-has-the-war-on-gaza-really-ended/","New Ceasefire Agreed Upon, Has the War on Gaza REALLY Ended?","In breaking news, a long-term truce has been agreed to by both Israel and Gaza alike, bringing what many claim sounds like a real end (for the time being) to the War against Gaza. The truce has been agreed upon by Israel, as well as Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas, who leads the Fatah party from the West Bank.

The ceasefire was announced by Egypt and went into effect at 16:00 GMT.

“We have responded to the Egyptian proposal for a complete and comprehensive cease-fire, which starts at 19:00 Cairo time,” Fatah President, Mahmoud Abbas, said. “There will be a complete stop in fighting.”

Comments from Hamas as of yet are unclear, however, the truce comes as Israel conceded to all of the demands being made by Hamas.

Israeli official confirmed to Reuters that Israel had in fact accepted the Egyptian proposal, which includes the ten Hamas demands, for a “for a complete and unlimited-in-time ceasefire” Gaza ceasefire.

“Israel accepted already the Egyptian proposal on July 15. Israel has always supported an unconditional, open-ended ceasefire,” the official told Reuters.

A Palestinian official also told the AFP that all parties “agreed a permanent cease-fire, a [deal to] end the blockade and a guarantee that Gaza’s demands and needs will be met.”

In spite of all of this, however, shortly after the ceasefire was scheduled to take effect, sirens went off in southern Israel. No rocket attacks were reported, however, the sirens indicated they had in fact been lanuched. So it remains to be seen whether this agreement will in fact last.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/killing-theft-senates-proposal-to-disable-stolen-cell-phones/","Killing Theft: Senate’s Proposal to Disable Stolen Cell Phones","In a debate that shows us how much influence technology has over our society, lawmakers have begun discussing the possibility of mandating an added “kill switch” to cell phones. This switch would allow people to remotely disable their cell phone and wipe it of all personal data. Privacy has become a serious concern among many as technology continues to advance, (an issue recently highlighted through the recent revenge porn issue, which also caused the government to write new laws). Now, four Democratic senators have declared this issue serious enough that it’s time for change. So, what’s the plan, and how will it likely play out?

Protecting Privacy

If nothing else, installing a kill switch in every manufactured cell phone will protect people’s privacy. As long as you know somebody has taken your phone before they get too deep into its contents, you can guarantee they never will by destroying it all. This can help stop victims from getting blackmailed, having bank or credit card information stolen, or even having their contacts’ information compromised.

Of course, the most common information theft is financial. But other privacy issues come up as well. Thieves can steal your identity or even destroy your online persona altogether, and it can be very difficult to bring them to justice within the confines of the law. All accounts, profiles, and business connections relying on the internet can disappear in a matter of minutes, and there’s not much users can do about it.

Discouraging Theft

Senators have proposed this bill primarily to discourage people from stealing cell phones. Most people who steal phones don’t concern themselves as much with the content on the phone (though some certainly do). They either want to use the device for themselves, or, even more often, sell it. Triggering a kill switch would greatly reduce the resale value of any phone; a black market industry that has exploded over recent years.

If you recently bought an iPhone from cell phone providers such as T-Mobile, you may have experienced their milder version of a “kill switch” with iOS 7. Apparently Apple has implemented an Activation Lock feature making it “impossible” to reactivate a stolen phone without the linked Apple ID and password.

A Big Business

Serious thieves make big bucks from stolen cell phones. The dirty business costs consumers over $30 billion dollars every year while simultaneously endangering the security of its victims. According to the FCC, almost one-third of all thefts involve cell phone theft. In major cities, that fraction goes up. Both New York City and San Francisco have reported more than half of all robberies involving cell phones. In fact, it’s so common that they now refer to cell phone theft as “Apple Picking.” In Oakland, it’s estimated that 75 percent of robberies involve cell phones.

Trends show that smartphones should only continue to become ubiquitous. According to InformationWeek.com, 1 billion smartphones shipped out in 2013. This an increasing number of people people have cell phones, meaning more available victims for thieves in the cell phone taking business. If the nature of the market doesn’t change in some way, theft will continue to rise.

The Debate

Not everybody agrees that installing a kill-switch would benefit consumers and stop thieves. In fact, the technology could lead to further abuse of smartphones. Technology laws have many gray areas and, due to the nature of the subject, investigators tend to have a hard time covering all intended areas. The senate proposed the law to help protect the consumer, but if the consumer doesn’t have complete control over the situation, are they really protected?

The bill’s text has yet to be released, so nobody can say exactly what’s on it, but many believe it would put some power in the hands of the police. Mobile companies argue that making the kill switch part of police procedure could cause loads of issues. Other government or law enforcement officials could even take advantage of the technology. And don’t forget hackers; no technology out there can completely guarantee safety from hackers. In fact, it’s happened already; just ask Mat Honan, who tried out Apple’s wiping feature.

What might come of this bill? Technology continues to create challenges for our country’s lawmakers, and all we can do is continue to experiment with them and do our best to adjust accordingly. Hopefully, the bill takes into consideration all possibilities, making sure we don’t end up with more security breaches than we already face.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/kkk-calls-for-violence-against-latino-immigrants-leave-the-corpses-laying-on-the-border/","KKK Calls For Violence Against Latino Immigrants: ‘Leave the corpses laying on the border’","The infamous Ku Klux Klan organization recently defended the call from their self-described “Imperial Wizard” for “dealing” with the thousands of young Central American immigrants coming to the United States by “shooting to kill”, right at the border.

“To me, they’re breaking the law when they come here,” a hooded man said to Al-Jazeera news.

The man, identifying himself as Robert Jones said, “if we can’t turn them back, I think if we pop a couple of them off and leave the corpses laying on the border, maybe they’ll see that we’re serious about stopping immigration.”

Jones said that his specific branch of the KKK is known as the “Loyal White Knights.”

During his 10-minute interview, below, the KKK “Wizard” also said, from a remote field in North Carolina, that the current wave of refugees from El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras is dramatically increasing KKK membership.

“We get thousands of people calling us a day, sending money, donations,” he claimed. “People want to see more rallies. They’re begging us to come to their town.”

“These people are criminals to begin with when they come to our country,” he said to interviewer Robert Ray. “When they come here and cross our borders illegally, they’re breaking the law. What makes you think they’re going to continue to stop breaking the law once they get here? They’re going to continue breaking the law once they get here.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/lawmaker-introduces-bill-to-legalize-shooting-pets/","Lawmaker Introduces Bill To Legalize Shooting Pets","A bill has recently been introduced a by an Oklahoma legislator that allows pet-owners to “dispose” of animals by shooting them. State Representative Steve Martin sponsored the bill. He believes that the new measures put forth in HB 2613 are an effective solution for “euthanasia” practices already in place throughout the state.

“Euthanizing your own animal with a firearm in Oklahoma is done all the time,” Representative Martin said. “People have animals that, for one reason or another, they’re either sick or old or for some reason, not suitable to go to a new home, and it is as painless to euthanize an animal with a firearm, if it’s done humanely, as any other method.”

Current protections mandate that pets can only be shot in cases of self-defense or defense of livestock. But HB 2613 would remove that requirement. It would also not mandate that pet-owners to seek alternatives to shooting pets. If a pet owner wants to shoot an animal under their care, they would be allowed to.

The bill also seeks to reduce the penalties for a number of animal cruelty crimes. This includes laws against animal neglect.

Cynthia Armstrong is the director of the Oklahoma Humane Society. When asked about bill, she said that it is likely to lead to a number of unforeseen problems.

“What if somebody tries to shoot an animal with a gun and kill it with one shot but they miss, or the animal moves?” Armstrong said in an interview with News OK. “The unintended consequences of what he’s doing are greater than a ‘problem’ [Martin] is trying to solve.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/israel-forcibly-injected-african-immigrants-with-birth-control-report-claims/","Israel Forcibly Injected African Immigrants with Birth Control, Report Claims","Last weekend, a report was released revealing that African immigrants to Israel have been subjected to forced sterilization (even if temporary). The controversial move has outraged many in Israel, and abroad, who learned that the government had implemented mandatory contraceptive injections, effectively amounting to forced sterilization. Still, this story has not caused much of the stir in American media where it has barely been mentioned.

Of those thought to have been subjected to the program, 130,000 Ethiopians, most of them Jewish, live in Israel, have seen a birth rate decline by at least 20 percent. Talk of such forced sterilization amongst Ethiopian Jews in Israel has been discussed for years now. But the new report corroborates what Ethiopian women in Israel had been saying all along.

The Israeli news source Haaretz claims that one Ethiopian immigrant recalled doctors injecting her with a birth control cocktail, who claimed that “people who frequently give birth suffer.”

For the State’s part, Israel has acknowledged the issue yet says it did nothing wrong. It has, however, said that it will explore institutional changes in healthcare for immigrants.

Israel’s health minister has since said that gynecologists have now been ordered “not to renew prescriptions for Depo-Provera for women of Ethiopian origin if for any reason there is concern that they might not understand the ramifications of the treatment.”

That such practices would occur in Israel of all places is particularly shocking, considering the fact that this practice was widely used by the Nazis throughout the Holocaust.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/israeli-peace-protest-grows-to-7000-in-tel-aviv-before-police-shut-it-down/","Israeli Peace Protest Grows To 7,000 in Tel Aviv Before Police Shut It Down","Some have estimated the protest yesterday in Tel Aviv at 7,000. Others, have said it was only 5,000. Both of these are much higher than the original estimates of 3,000 that came in as the rally kicked off yesterday.

The crowd was composed of Israeli peace protestors against the war in Gaza, marching under the banner, ”No more deaths – Israeli-Palestinian peace, now.”

The rally took place at Rabin Square in central Tel Aviv, even as police tried in vain to shut it down, citing “security concerns.”

The protest saw a line up of pro-peace speakers such as Hadash MK Dov Khenin, who is an Israeli and Palestinian veteran from the organization Combatants for Peace, as well as Yifat Solel, the head of the Meretz party’s anti-occupation forum.

Another speaker, from the Parents’ Circle, Ben Kfir’s daughter was killed in a Hamas suicide bombing in 2003. All of these speakers said that the government’s claim that there is “no partner for peace among the Palestinians” is patently false.

While Sulaiman Khatib, co-founder of Combatants for Peace, spoke, an increasingly smaller group of neo-fascist “Jewish Defense League” counter protesters yelled “Death to Arabs.”

By 10 p.m. the protest had gained increasing numbers, when police finally said they had to disburse the crowd and cancel further demonstration. The police claimed “Hamas rockets” would soon be raining down upon Rabin Square. But this, of course, never happened.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/isis-comes-to-the-west-threatens-public-beheadings/","ISIS Comes To The West, Threatens Public Beheadings","A British ISIS member calling himself al-Britani has threatened to stage executions in Trafalgar Square in London. The name Al-Britani is widely believed to be an alias of Abu Rahin Aziz, 32, who fled from the United Kingdom back in March after he being charged over a gang attack on a ­soccer fan in London.

The self-described ISIS member ran websites in the UK that claimed affiliation with the international terror group, and was part of a group calling themselves Muslims Against Crusades. The latter group torched a wreath of poppies on Armistice Day in 2010, while yelling insults during the ­two-minute national moment of silence holding placards that read: “British soldiers burn in hell.”

Now, another affiliated British national fighting in Syria has vowed to bring terrorism back to the UK. He said that ISIS will stage public executions in London’s Trafalgar Square, according to reports from the Sunday People publication.

Using the pseudonym Abu Dugma al-Britani, the self-described ISIS member has issued a series of chilling online vows to wage what he called “holy” war on British soil.

The father-of-one used Twitter to warn: “Downing Street will be a base for Muslims. Trafalgar Square is where public executions will take place. Army of Islamic State is coming.”

He also boasted that ISIS was set to “conquer” the White House in the United States. Watch the report below for more information…

He further tweeted: “USA your interference will trigger many more 9/11 twin towers attacks and your brave boys returned in body bags.”

"http://politicalblindspot.com/isis-in-the-west-bank-not-hamas-first-claimed-responsibility-for-kidnapping-those-israeli-teens/","ISIS in the West Bank, Not Hamas, First Claimed Responsibility For Kidnapping Those Israeli Teens","There has been a lot of buzz in the Israeli media this week. The claim has been that Binyamin Netanyahu was “right all along” to bomb the civilians of Gaza. Why? Because Hamas was indeed behind the kidnappings of those three Israeli teens in the West Bank: Eyal Yifrach, 19, Gilad Shaar, 16, and Naftali Fraenkel, 16. At least that’s what’s being said…

Now bear in mind that the West Bank is not Hamas turf, it is Fatah: the same Fatah that Hamas went to war with in the Battle of Gaza. But nevertheless, Netanyahu claimed it was Hamas’s fault.

Many who know the region and politics of the groups involved said that this was out of character for Hamas who we would have expected to have used the teens for a prisoner “swap”. As well, for weeks – months even – Hamas not only never claimed this was their handiwork, they denied it outright. Had they been responsible, one would have expected Hamas to have taken credit right from the start, as they so often do.

But one group that did claim to be in the same neck of the woods was ISIS, and even though it received relatively little press internationally, they were the first to claim responsibility for the kidnapping and murder of these boys. A pamphlet issued by the so-called “Islamist State in Iraq and Syria” or “ISIS” and circulated around Hebron, claimed responsibility.

While Netanyahu fixated on Hamas, however, ISIS has been building in Iraq and even still in the West Bank, whereas Hamas has claimed that they will fight ISIS if they try to enter the Gaza Strip and lay down roots there.

Instead of paying a bit of attention to this, Israeli hawks have been hyper-fixating on a YouTube video of Saleh Arouri, an exiled Hamas official, who told a conference in Turkey on Wednesday that Hamas’ military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, carried out what he described as a “heroic operation”. But as an organization and party, Gazan Hamas, and their Qatar-based leader Khaled Meshaal, has still rejected this claim over and over again. Western media has ignored that pesky fact.

“It was an operation by your brothers from the al-Qassam Brigades,” Arouri said, in spite of the fact that no one else in Hamas agreed with this claim.

In November 2013 three ISIS agents were killed in the Hebron area. The pamphlet released by ISIS right after this kidnapping in the West Bank said that the three kidnapped boys were in direct retaliation for the killed ISIS members. In fact, one of those ISIS members who was killed, Mohamed Nairukh, had been expelled from the ranks of Hamas’ Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades due to his radical religious beliefs and objection to Hamas’ political involvement. This would seem to back up Hamas’ claims that they will fight any ISIS encroachment into the Gaza Strip.

While the ISIS cells in the West Bank likely are not directly emanating from the organizational structure in Iraq and Syria, they are instead probably an existing cell which has adopted the ISIS name, marching under its banner. Something similar happened two years ago, when Palestinian groups carried out operations under the banner of the Nusra Front, which had risen to prominence in the Syrian civil war as the leader of the rebels. Similar groups operating in Sinai and Gaza such as Ansar Beit al-Maqdas have claimed affiliation to Al-Qaeda, but not been under any such direct leadership.

Arouri has long been recognized as part of the dying hardline camp of Hamas. It is not outside of the realm of reason to suggest that now, late in the game, he is trying to attribute credit for this kidnapping for the group which has been increasingly moving away from policies that he favors.

Either way, the fact is that it was this ISIS cell which claimed responsibility. Whether ISIS’s claim is true or not, what we know for sure is that it is only now, very late in the game that Arouri apparently tried to rake in credit for an attack that the mainstream organization of Hamas has affirmed they had nothing to do with.

It would seem that now would be a good time for reconciliation, not just lasting, permanent reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah (without interference), but also between the Palestinian Unity government and Israel. Whatever each side thinks about one another, there is a much worse enemy – by all standards – who has infiltrated the region now.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/human-rights-violations-in-local-county-jails-could-you-be-next/","Human Rights Violations in Local County Jails – Could You Be Next?","If you’re not a jail bird, but you find yourself headed to jail, one would think that you would be afraid of the other inmates. In Riverside County however, the opposite is true. Inmates, both felons, petty criminals, and violent prisoners from California’s Prison population (freed into CA county jails by AB 109) are afraid of the Corrections Officers. This is for good reason. Incredible brutality is directed towards the sickest and most weakened inmates on a regular basis.

In order to understand the root of this unrivaled hostility, you must first go back to AB109, better known to inmates as Fed Kicks. AB109 was a legal fight for the rights of California Inmates, most notably Riverside County inmates, to receive adequate healthcare within the corrections system. If the state was unable to comply, the courts said, then tens of thousands of inmates would have to either be freed or alternatively housed. This was just a symptom of a larger problem; asking for medical care while within the Riverside County Jail System was akin to asking for punishment and even torture by corrections officers. Begging for much needed emergency care was a recipe for brutal punishment, such as solitary confinement, safety cells, being stripped naked and forced to lie in the cold, often wet grass outside, or even being forced to endure tasings and brutal beatings. But mostly, medical emergencies, if not met with open hostility and anger, were ignored.

I was witness to much intolerable and savage treatment within the Riverside Couny Jail system when I was incarcerated for missing a court date. I was in Riverside County Jail from 01/13/2014 to 01/30/2014. During this time, I experienced much brutality and torture because I had a broken foot along with a blood disorder which caused me to need blood transfusions almost bi-weekly. Little did I realize at the time just how close to losing my life I came. Once released, I required immediate hospitalization and an emergency blood transfusion.

Because I requested medical care for my broken foot while incarcerated, I was forced to run laps, climb up and down stairs, and lift heavy objects such as bed mattresses so the guards could laugh at my agony. Eventually I collapsed completely and could not walk again for more than a week. When I still insisted that my foot was broken, (later X-rays revealed that the 5th Metatarsal was fractured because of a tumor related to my blood disorder) I was stripped of my clothes and physically thrown into a “safety cell”, which is a rather deceiving term for a cement room with an excrement crusted hole in the floor instead of a toilet. The walls and floor are covered with human feces, vomit, blood and worse. I was thrown into this cell naked and shivering, while frigid air was forced into the room, so as to intensify the punishment. There I languished for 36 long hours in unspeakable agony, alternately begging for my medications, food, water, and warmth. I cried even for a simple blanket to cover my nakedness.None of the above was given. The humiliation is a scar I’ll never forget.

This sort of punishment, better defined as a sort of a sensory deprivation chamber, is outlawed as Torture by the Geneva Conventions. Yet, it is regularly employed in the Riverside County Jail System as a tool to control and abuse inmates who may per chance ask for medical help. I wish to add that I have never raised my voice, cursed, threatened myself or anyone else, or acted disrespectful during any of this time. All of my entirely sane and peaceful actions are on tape for anyone to witness. This is not to say that I am a saint- but I was understandably scared into total submission!

When I was brought back to my bunk, the CO’s made sure I was transferred to the upper tier as well as the upper bunk. This was unquestionably a strong statement on my asking for medical help for the broken foot. The CO’s had made an example of me; don’t ask for medical help.

Shortly thereafter the girl in the cell next door to me began moaning and crying. She was a petite 18 year old, and pregnant for the first time; she was also clearly near her due date. She cried and pleaded over the intercom that she was bleeding. She told them she was having contractions.

The guards ignored her.

When her cries became louder and more excruciating, the other inmates began making noise as well to attract the attention of the Corrections Officers. Still, we were all ignored. Finally after a full three hours of torturous sounds and horrifying gasping, in what seemed like the sounds of death, we heard- a baby crying! The poor girl had given birth in her cell, and still was being completely ignored by the CO’s! It took a full half hour after the birth of her infant child for the officers to realize that something serious had occured on their watch. Eventually, but with no sense of urgency- the paramedics arrived to transport the young mother and child to the hospital.

Meanwhile, the afterbirth and blood still lay sticky and stinking in the cell, as the guards shoved two more inmates into the chamber and locked the door. Not a word was said about infectious diseases, pathogens, or the danger of the open blood and bodily materials that fouled every surface. (The cell was a complete mess by that time; it looked as if someone had exploded inside.) In fact the inmates who were forced to endure these conditions were punished soundly for voicing their concerns. Ironically, neither inmate had even been charged with a crime yet, or seen the judge within the 72 hours the county has to decide whether to charge an inmate or not. Hence, two innocent women were put at risk to their lives in this insane asylum of a jail system.

The most tragic part of all this treatment is that the girl who gave birth was back in her cell within 12 hours and forced to clean the entire mess up herself. No cleaning supplies were given.

These things, along with uncountable others, such as being forced to run around naked and lay in the grass naked while the bunkers were being “raided” by the deputies, and that in 40 degree weather at 3 o’clock AM, make this a story which is must be told. There are currently an estimated 40,000 men and women incarcerated annually in these jails, according to the Jail Information Management System of Riverside County. Many of these people haven’t had their day in court yet- or are in the midst of court proceedings. This means that they are, by legal and constitutional definition, INNOCENT. Still, for the ones who have already been judged guilty and are serving out their time, is it really okay for society to allow the systematic torture, even death, of our fellow human beings?

One man in the male bunkers at Larry D. Smith Correctional facility died on Christmas day. He had been “shanked” (stabbed) by other inmates and was bleeding profusely when he pleaded for medical help from the jail staff. However because the officers ignored him, he went back to his bed and died there, alone. Stabbed and ignored, on Christmas day, this man bled to death. Not one officer bothered to check on him for three full days. It was only on the third day that they finally realized that the man had died much, much earlier.

This is why I’m coming out and telling my story. These things are what I bear witness to. This is what is happening in our own country, our own backyard. The Riverside County Jail system is one of the largest in the United States- yet it is being run unquestionably as brutally as any concentration camp that ever existed. The only difference is that, at least in the United States, the truth can’t be buried so easily.

ADDED 02/10/2014- I have neglected to tell the story of the dying woman who was detained at the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility. This woman should not die without her story being told. All human beings deserve at least some dignity in both life and in death.

This woman had full blown AIDS and was coughing up blood constantly wherever she went. She was unable to even communicate with Corrections Officers because she appeared to have some sort of a seizure or brain disorder that caused intermittent unconsciousness. She would fall when getting out of her bed, while attempting to shower, and blood gushed out of her mouth when she brushed her teeth.

Watching her die was tragic. However this woman was housed in a bunker with 63 other uninfected women! She was rapidly dying, but her residence in this intensely crowded area was putting every one of those 63 other souls at risk of contracting HIV. Perhaps if she had not been experiencing the contagious symptoms of full blown AIDS, she would not have been a danger. However the amount of blood and other bodily fluids that poured of her body- DID put everyone at unreasonable and unnecessary risk. Nonetheless, the requests of other inmates to move her or to be moved elsewhere were ignored or met with solitary confinement and Safety Cells. I’m not sure if this woman is still alive or not, but to put an entire bunker of women, some innocent, some guilty- but upon which the death penalty had been not been imposed, was and is the most egregious charge in this entire I-report.

As a society, we can’t afford to just ignore these things. We MUST insist that the serious human rights violations I’ve witnessed be investigated. We MUST stand up for the civil liberties and the most basic rights of society’s weakest members- or we risk an armed and vicious state being run under our very noses, and inhumane conditions into which we may find ourselves thrown at any time.

Ask yourself: is a parking ticket, a missed court date, jay walking even, a crime severe enough for you to be subjected to Capital Punishment in the same form of HIV infection, as these 63 women have been? While in jail I’ve observed the petty charges being lobbed against these women. It’s not just believing what they say they’ve been charged with. It’s sitting in court in shackled hands and feet, and listening to the judge list the charges. Riverside County has been notorious for jailing people for the slightest of infractions. It is rumoured that each arrest results in a significant monetary gain for the police department. I’m not sure if this is true or not, but one thing I am absolutely certain of, is that many of these women were charged with such petty “crimes” such as jay walking, posession of drug paraphernalia (perhaps a bong or pipe), or riding an unregistered bicycle. Many more walked away without any charges at all. Yet they spent 72 hours or more- incarcerated in the brutal conditions I have listed.

If we ignore Riverside County’s criminal conduct and flagrant human rights violations, then we must understand that the next person arrested while walking the dog peacefully may be you. The next county that decides to capitalize on the smallest and pettiest of misdemeanors may be yours. These are not just anonymous women. These are your sisters and brothers, your mothers and fathers, your best friends. These men and women are you.

Once you realize just how close you are to being locked in a safety cell for 36 hours for no fathomable reason, only to be released without charges 72 hours later, (that is, if you are not booked on a Thursday or Friday- which means 5 days of incarceration- or on a long weekend, which could be 6 days or more) then you can begin to understand the depth of this problem. You might lose your job, custody of your children, your community reputation. All of these things are enough to scare any reasonable person into action.

But the most forceful and urgent reason of all is, you may lose your life.

It could be you sitting next to that unfortunate woman with full blown AIDS. Or it could be you bleeding in the bunk after being stabbed by one of the more violent prison inmates released into the county jail population. These concentration camps are overflowing. So just remember this:

If we don’t take action- YOU could be next. If you feel strongly about this story, PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION!

"http://politicalblindspot.com/got-rape-insurance-michigan-law-effective-today-says-you-better-have-already-signed-up/","Got ‘Rape Insurance’? Michigan Law Effective Today Says You Better Have Already Signed Up","A law requiring Michigan woman to purchase an insurance rider if they want their private health insurance to cover abortions takes effect today.

Michigan’s Right To Life, anti-abortion organization admits that the law won’t reduce the number of abortions. So why have they been pushing the “Rape Insurance”?

Opponents of the law call it “a direct attack on women” and note that it could cost women tens of thousands of dollars for procedures that in some cases are even a medical necessity.

The law got its name, as it would require the rider even in cases of rape or incest. State Sen. Gretchen Whitmer (D-East Lansing) said last winter that she had been raped 20 years ago, and that she “can’t even begin to imagine now having to think about the same thing happening to my own daughters” in Michigan’s anti-abortion climate.

Now that the law has taken effect, women who have not purchased the add-on riders ahead of time will not be reimbursed if they have an abortion, for any reason.

But to complicate matters, no providers plan to offer the rider after the law takes effect, according to the state’s Department of Insurance and Financial Services spokesman Caleb Buhs.

Seven providers told the state that they would provide the riders, but only as part of of employer-sponsored plans. Anyone who purchases insurance as an individual, will not be able to obtain coverage for abortions under any circumstances – again – including in cases of rape and incest.

On the other side of the debate, Right to Life Michigan spokeswoman Genevieve Marnon said, “Do we anticipate this will lower abortion rates? No. But … it’s one thing for you to pay for your abortion and another thing for me to have to pay for it.”

What are your thoughts?

"http://politicalblindspot.com/french-protesters-hurt-pro-gaza-peace-movements-by-adopting-nazi-salutes-and-attacking-synagogues/","French Protesters Hurt Pro-Gaza Peace Movements, by Adopting Nazi Salutes and Attacking Synagogues","Paris, France saw several thousand gathered in Place de la République, to protest the Israeli War on Gaza. But these protests, coming to a culmination on Saturday, in spite of a state ban on the demonstration, have taken an ugly turn.

While many protesters stayed focused on criticizing the Israeli State itself, chanting “Israel is an assassin, Holland is an accomplice” and “we are all Palestinians,” some were seen gesturing the quenelle, a reverse Nazi-salute, according to the AFP.

“This event is illegal, but for us it is more than legitimate. This is to show our solidarity with people who are now being massacred,” Hugo, a New Anti-Capitalist Party (NPA) activist, said to the AFP. But the protests are being used as anecdotes throughout the world, suggesting that the pro-Palestinian voices in France are anti-Jewish, not just against Israel’s operations in Gaza.

France has Western Europe’s largest Jewish and Muslim populations, and a history of oppressing North African Muslims during the colonial period. Some suggest that this is behind the French instances of anti-Jewish attitudes and adoption of Nazi salutes, saying that this is not the norm in protests for Gaza outside of France.

Two banned pro-Gaza protests had huge turn outs last weekend, both in Paris and Sarcelles, to the north. Disappointingly, both degenerated into violence and attacks on Jewish synagogues, further harming the movement for Gazan civilians.

This weekend, police called literally “called off” a demonstration against the War on Gaza, citing “security risks.”

The protest was set in Tel Aviv during Shabbat on Saturday, and into the evening and new week. Some 3,000 people had already gathered in Rabin Square though, and called off or not, they were there, ready to rally against the war.

This week, only a meager few dozen hawks could be seen holding a counter-demonstration nearby.

The police claimed they tried to keep a distance between the two sides. But before long, four demonstrators were arrested, after police accused them of “acting violently.”

No further details about the nature of their actions would be given by Israeli police, even when it was requested.

At first police banned the rally, but when Israeli peace protestors refused to leave and noted the temporary cease fire, police reluctantly agreed that the protest could go on.

“The war is taking a heavy toll in lives and injuries on both sides, in destruction and horror, in bombings and rockets. We answer this by taking a stand and making a demand: end the war now!” the organizers of the rally wrote on the event’s Facebook page.

“Instead be being drawn, again and again, into more wars and more military actions, it is now time to lead the way to dialogue and political settlement. There is a political solution. What price must we pay – the people of the South and the other residents of Israel, and the people of Gaza and the West Bank – until we reach that solution? Together, Jews and Arabs, we will overcome occupation and war, hatred, incitement and racism – and offer a path to life and hope.”

If you think these voices for peace, amongst the Israeli population are being marginalized and censored from corporate, mainstream media reporting, then help get the word out. As the protesters in Israel say, this is the “Israeli Spring”, and apparently, it will not be televised.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/rick-perry-post-insulting-meme-oops/","Did Rick Perry Just Drunk Tweet?","Texas Governor and former Presidental candidate Rick Perry just can’t stop with the gaffes. This time it’s on twitter.

Sunday night, Governor Rick Perry tweeted an insulting meme of Democratic district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg. Lehmberg is at the center of Perry’s indictment on felony exploitation of power charges.

The meme has a photo of a wide-eyed Lehmberg with the quote, “I don’t always drive drunk at 3X the legal blood alcohol limit…but when I do, I indict Gov. Perry for calling me out about it. I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas.”

Lehmberg plead guilty to driving drunk in April 2013 and did a few weeks of jail time. She did not resign from her position.

Perry’s tweet was immediately retweeted more than 600 times. Perry later deleted the tweet, posting an apology.

“A tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized,” he wrote from his twitter account around 9 p.m. Sunday. “I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down.”

Perry, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, was indicted last month by a state grand for his decision to veto funding for a public corruption investigative unit for Lehmberg’s office.

Perry said that he wouldn’t support such an initiative “when the person charged with ultimate responsibility of that unit has lost the public’s confidence.”

This tweet is just the latest in a long line of gaffes from Perry whose most notable gaffe is likely his declaration of ‘Oops’ upon failing to recall the 3 federal agencies he would like to eliminate during a 2012 Presidential debate.

The state-owned television network has often been accused of covering up anything that might cast the Russian government in an unfavorable light.

Wednesday, Wahl explained that as the granddaughter of Hungarian refugees who fled the Soviet Union, she could no longer “be a part of a network that whitewashes the actions of Putin.”

“I am very lucky to have grown up here in the United States,” Wahl said. “I am the daughter of a veteran,my partner is a physician at a military base, where he sees everyday the firsthand accounts of the ultimate prices that people pay for this country.”

More than her comments about America, however, Wahl said that her biggest complaint with the network is their active white-washing of president Vladimir Putin’s actions.

“That is why personally I cannot be part of a network that is funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of Putin. I am proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth. And that is why after this newscast I am resigning,” Wahl concluded.

Watch the video of Wahl quitting on the air below.

"http://politicalblindspot.com/navy-exorcist-elected-to-colorado-legislature-believes-president-obama-possessed-by-demons/","Navy Exorcist Elected to Colorado Legislature; Believes President Obama Possessed By Demons","What is the surest sign that the recent elections were a blowout for democrats? The fact that Colorado has elected an exorcist who believes President Obama may be possessed by demons. He beat his democratic opponent by nearly 40 points.

Gordon “Dr. Chaps” Klingenschmitt, is an anti-homosexual, religious activist who brags of having once tried to rid a woman of the “foul spirit of lesbianism” through an exorcism and who proclaims that our foreign policy must be based on the Bible.

Kligenschmitt also stated that the Affordable Care Act causes cancer. But, the icing on the cake may be the book he wrote in which he claims the President might be possessed by devils. The remedy? A good old fashioned exorcism of course.

Amazon describes Kligenschmitt’s book as an examination of “the policies and actions of Barack H. Obama… to help us discern what spirits are actually manifesting inside the soul of the 44th president of the United States.”

Unfortunately, this perspective isn’t as radical as it seems; a 2012 Public Policy Polling survey indicated that demon possession is believed in by the bulk of Americans.

Still, Republicans by and large have distanced themselves from the demon rhetoric of the recently elected lawmaker.

“Gordon does not speak on behalf of the Republican party,” Colorado GOP Chairman Ryan Call told the Denver Post.

Neveretheless, Kligenschmitt does speak for at least the 17,000 in Colorado who elected him to the state legislature.

That is a drop of 13 percentage points from the 39 percent favorability in April 2010.

The poll involved online interviews with 1,012 adults. And even when you count the poll’s margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points, Obama’s signature legislation is now a sinking ship.

The poll also showed that only 13 percent think Obamacare will be completely repealed.","2014-03-28 14:04:25","0","7.0","1.0","15.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","44.0","38.0","0.0","67.0","0.0","2.0","2","87","85.40","78.96","15.63","46.99","17.40","21.84","66.67","41.38","5.75","2.30","0.00","0.00","1.15","0.00","1.15","3.45","8.05","11.49","5.75","8.05","5.75","0.00","10.34","1.15","0.00","1.15","11.49","6.90","1.15","1.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.05","0.00","1.15","1.15","0.00","4.60","2.30","0.00","0.00","1.15","1.15","1.15","4.60","2.30","1.15","1.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.30","1.15","0.00","0.00","1.15","0.00","1.15","8.05","1.15","11.49","2.30","3.45","4.60","2.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.15","0.00","1.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","12.64","5.75","2.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.30","0.00","2.30","0.00","0.00","406","8.65","18.0","126","84","6","65.73","10.1","7.6","11.24","9.2","23","6.0","18.552380952380954","72","17.6","1","0.37","0","4","11","8","0","9","4","0","0","1","18","9","0","5","0","0","2","0","6","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","1","3","3","2","0","0","0","1"

“My son is gone. He’s dead. Nobody has been standing up to say it’s their fault.”

“Why were those decisions made,” Smith continued. “Not a bunch of baloney that they have been handing out. But why were those decisions made? It’s just a whole bunch of lies because nobody has talked to me about anything. Not about anything,” she yelled.

“Yes I’m upset. And I think I’ll be upset until the day I die. They Don’t care,” Smith shouted. “They don’t give a damn. You would think that after all this time, all I’ve asked for is for Hillary to give me a telephone call and tell me what happened. If it’s classified, fine. Whisper it in my ear. But just tell me.”

In a recent interview with ABC News’ Diane Sawyer, former Sec. of State Hillary Clinton said she left security decisions in Benghazi up to the “experts” in the field. “I’m not equipped to sit and look at blueprints to determine where the blast walls need to be, where the reinforcements need to be. That’s why we hire people who have that expertise,” Clinton said.

“She gets to know,” Smith added, “everybody else up there in the big shot wing gets to know, but the mother of the son that got killed is not allowed to know these things.”

The CNN anchor then told Smith if she could ask Hillary Clinton one question, what would it be.

“Why did she not give security,” Smith replied, “to those people that were there? She sent them in there to do whatever it is that they were supposed to do.”

“Why can’t they just tell me the truth? That’s something that should be allowable,” Smith said as the interview ended. “She doesn’t care, she wants to be president.”","2014-06-17 17:17:00","0","13.0","3.0","15.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","48.0","43.0","0.0","73.0","0.0","4.0","4","325","34.30","66.67","16.17","16.91","11.61","15.38","87.69","56.92","19.38","9.54","4.00","0.31","0.31","2.77","2.15","9.85","5.85","12.62","12.92","4.62","4.00","3.69","26.46","2.46","1.23","3.69","0.31","1.85","4.92","2.15","2.77","0.62","1.85","0.00","15.38","1.23","0.00","3.08","0.92","14.77","3.38","3.08","2.77","2.15","1.23","3.69","3.38","0.31","3.08","0.00","0.31","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.15","0.31","0.00","3.69","1.23","0.92","8.62","17.23","0.92","9.54","0.62","5.54","3.38","1.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","0.62","0.31","0.00","0.31","0.00","0.00","28.31","7.69","6.15","0.00","0.00","0.92","0.00","0.00","8.62","4.92","0.00","0.00","1383","6.18","14.782608695652174","407","325","27","84.68","8.2","4.4","8.45","6.2","40","3.9000000000000004","11.723076923076924","184","13.61","9","0.56","0","7","1","28","0","31","12","0","0","5","40","30","0","12","0","0","35","2","13","0","0","2","15","0","26","25","3","12","13","13","4","3","0","7"

He also added that Dick Cheney has for the last six years been “attacking the administration for not doing an adequate job cleaning up the mess that he made. And I think it’s unseemly.”

MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, in response, cited a CNN story from 2004 with the headline: “Clinton defends successor’s push for war.” The CNN article quotes Clinton saying, “I have repeatedly defended President Bush on Iraq.”

“This is collective amnesia on the Left,” Scarborough said noting that Bill Clinton and other Democrats stopped supporting the Iraq war after it became less popular among Americans.

“If there’s somebody who knows something about unseemly, it’s Bill Clinton,” Cheney said in response.","2014-06-27 15:49:06","0","18.0","6.0","23.0","1.0","8.0","0.0","64.0","59.0","0.0","116.0","0.0","6.0","5","184","82.15","54.33","19.13","1.00","16.73","25.54","75.00","45.11","10.33","3.26","1.09","0.00","0.00","1.63","0.54","7.07","7.07","13.59","9.78","2.72","3.26","2.17","19.57","2.72","1.63","0.54","1.09","1.63","7.61","1.63","5.98","0.54","3.26","0.00","7.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.63","9.24","2.72","2.17","2.17","2.17","0.00","2.72","2.17","0.00","2.17","0.00","0.54","0.54","0.00","0.54","0.00","9.24","0.00","0.54","5.98","0.54","2.17","8.15","8.15","0.00","13.04","1.63","7.07","4.35","3.26","0.00","0.00","1.63","0.54","2.17","0.54","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","25.00","5.98","5.98","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","7.61","4.89","0.00","0.00","892","8.67","27.571428571428573","276","184","11","62.98","12.2","8.6","12.29","11.2","49","6.833333333333333","19.33217391304348","124","24.14","6","0.44","0","2","2","15","0","27","12","0","0","2","28","37","2","1","0","0","10","0","7","1","0","1","2","0","3","11","9","6","4","9","0","1","0","0"

Their solution?

Form a new one called the State of Jefferson.

“We have the water, forests, timber, we have the minerals. We have unspoiled agricultural land,” said secession proponent Aaron Funk of Crescent City. “We would be the wealthy state if we were allowed to go back and use our natural resources ourselves.”

There are thirteen northern California counties full of residents who say they are fed up with being taxed, over-regulated, and under-represented by state lawmakers.

Some say they are tired of talking and are ready to act. “It’s a lot of broad promises about things being better and representation being better,” Kevin Hendrick a Del Norte resident told kcra. “But the more they talk, the less clear it becomes about how that’s actually going to happen.”



And now it’s up to the people. Residents in Del Norte and Tehama counties will vote on forming a new state in June of this year.

"https://dailysurge.com/2014/03/the-ideological-bigotry-must-end/","The Left’s Ideological Bigotry Must Be Opposed, Condemned and Stopped","It’s frightening to watch emboldened progressives in the era of Obama. Before, liberals at least had to pretend and hide their bigotry. Now it’s out there for the whole world to see. Obama’s leftists in government are leading the way.

The abuse suffered by conservative groups at the hands of Internal Revenue Service, at the behest Obama administration flunkies, shows the level of contempt, disdain, and apathy liberals in government have for those with whom they disagree. In a memo, unearthed by a House committee, IRS operatives in Washington D.C. targeted the Tea Party and other conservative groups, knew the action was illegal and tried to cover it up with new regulations that would codify their illegal targeting as official policy of our government. We have seen that extremist liberals favor and support using our government to target their political opponents. New York Senator and all around thug, Chuck Schumer, stood before the press and openly called for this illegal targeting.

Senate Democrats, facing tough elections this year in the wake of their support for the destructive Obamacare law, want the Internal Revenue Service to crack down on so-called “outside groups,” expected to spend millions of dollars to hold these same politicians accountable in November.

These extreme left-wingers, who now run government, feel they’ve been given the nod to treat conservatives unfairly because Obama and his Democrats have referred to us as “enemies,” “hostage takers,” “people with bombs strapped to their chest,” “arsonists,” “terrorists,” “anarchists,” “racists,” and “EXTREMISTS.”

The liberal’s ideological bigotry doesn’t stop with government.

An ultra-liberal group, the NAACP, had one of its representatives refer to GOP Senator Tim Scott, a black man, as a ventriloquist’s “dummy.” The “Reverend” William Barber, director of the North Carolina NAACP, didn’t stop there. On a recent conference call Barber said of the GOP, “They frantically seek out people of color to become mouthpieces for their particular agenda.”

This form of ideological bigotry is unacceptable in America. The very idea that one’s ideology is formed by the color of one’s skin is dumb, offensive and runs counter to the message of a genuine civil rights leader, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King.

Dr. King said, “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”

Mr. Barber needs to be reminded that people of color are capable of making up their own minds as to which ideology fits their own circumstance and upbringing. I can assure Barber that we have the knowledge, intelligence and for the time being, the freedom, to choose our own path.

The “mainstream” press has been silent on liberal efforts to institutionalize unfairness against conservatives. Liberals’ efforts to replace racial bigotry, with the chains of ideological bigotry, are contemptible. Our heritage, culture and value as citizens are in no way changed by our political beliefs. No legitimate government uses its power to silence dissent. All people of good will should reject the message of hate and division pushed by Obama, Democrats and other extremist progressives.","2014-03-10 18:42:46","0","14.0","3.0","15.0","0.0","8.0","0.0","48.0","43.0","0.0","70.0","0.0","4.0","4","526","94.80","78.22","10.00","7.92","21.04","26.62","76.62","44.49","9.13","4.94","0.57","1.52","0.00","0.19","2.66","4.18","7.60","16.92","6.27","1.52","4.37","0.95","11.22","3.99","2.09","0.76","0.76","1.52","5.51","1.90","3.42","0.57","1.71","0.57","9.32","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.76","6.08","2.28","1.14","0.95","0.00","0.57","1.14","3.61","1.71","0.76","1.14","1.71","1.14","0.38","0.00","0.19","10.84","2.85","1.33","6.27","0.19","0.76","3.61","6.65","0.76","10.46","1.33","6.46","2.66","4.94","0.38","0.19","1.14","0.19","0.00","0.38","0.38","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.91","5.51","7.41","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.57","5.32","2.09","0.00","0.00","2628","8.78","26.8","823","522","26","51.07","13.3","11.1","13.34","13.5","137","6.0","20.53808429118774","305","24.2","10","0.46","0","16","5","48","0","69","51","0","3","6","86","53","3","41","0","0","12","19","10","0","0","5","20","0","21","13","7","15","16","12","2","2","0","1"

Former “American Idol” runner-up Clay Aiken turned in his paperwork at the State Board of Elections today. Akin is running in the 2nd District against the seat’s current occupant Republican Renee Ellmers.

Klay Aiken, 35, an openly gay, government-centric liberal Democrat, and who was born and raised in Raliegh, North Carolina will have to win the Democratic primary less than 10 weeks away.

“I am comfortable with myself. I am comfortable with the campaign we’re running,” Aiken said. “I am positive that people are going to vote for the person who they think will do the best job, who they think can win in November.”

Aiken’s campaign page covers a mix of issues. He supports raising the minimum wage, planting this political position on emotionally-fertile ground saying, “it is unconscionable that many Americans work 40 hours a week and still do not make enough to support their families.” On jobs and the economy, Aiken’s support for more “investments in infrastructure” is as predictable as it is problematic.

Clay Aiken does, however, support, “cutting payroll taxes in half for the first $5,000,000,” and said lawmakers should, “offer payroll tax holidays for employers that add new workers.” And on education Aiken supports, “tuition tax credits to working adults who return to school,” tax credits that already exist and are used mostly by younger people.","2014-02-27 20:45:59","0","9.0","3.0","15.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","50.0","43.0","0.0","69.0","0.0","4.0","4","227","86.83","68.59","31.22","97.65","20.64","26.43","77.09","41.41","9.25","4.41","1.76","0.44","0.00","0.88","1.32","4.85","5.73","13.22","7.93","1.76","4.41","0.44","14.98","6.17","3.52","1.76","3.52","1.76","6.17","5.73","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.37","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.88","5.29","0.88","0.88","0.88","0.44","0.44","1.76","1.32","0.00","1.32","0.00","0.44","0.00","0.00","0.44","0.00","8.81","0.88","3.08","5.29","2.20","0.44","3.52","11.89","1.76","15.42","2.20","7.05","6.17","10.57","2.20","0.44","5.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","24.23","4.85","8.37","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.32","7.05","1.76","0.44","0.44","1092","8.91","28.875","331","222","11","59.43","12.4","10.0","12.94","13.2","60","7.0","20.890810810810816","158","26.0","3","0.41","0","7","6","14","0","24","23","3","1","4","29","25","1","16","0","0","10","2","8","0","0","1","5","0","9","5","8","3","13","8","2","4","0","0"

Last week the Arizona state legislature passed a bill that would allow business owners in that state to refuse service to gays and lesbians based on the business owner’s religious beliefs.

Both US Republican Senators from Arizona John McCain and Jeff Flake tweeted objections to the bill SB 1062, and urged Arizona Governor Jan Brewer to use her veto power to strike down the bill.

“It’s different than the situation that you had in the Jim Crow South where you had state sanctioned discrimination that was flatly unconstitutional. And there is a governmental in insuring that African Americans could travel in the south, which you could do if no hotel or no restaurant would serve you.

Mere days after President Obama addressed a Florida high school on the importance of education, he delivered to America a clear example of why education is, in fact, so important.

As a dog owner and lover, I have to say that this is just sad, not to mention, it reflects poorly on the “legalize” movement as a whole. Here we have the unintended consequence of several things:

Legalized pot. Increased pot use. Stupidity.

The canines are getting into the stoners’ edibles, and the prognosis is not good. Dogs weigh far less than human beings, so even a small amount of marijuana that would have little effect on a person can cause major damage to a pup. Symptoms of dogs who have gotten hold of, for example, a “special brownie”, can vary from disorientation to seizures and even comas. And that can last for DAYS. Vets say they’ve been seeing a large uptick in these cases in Denver since January 1st.

Let’s use some common sense, folks. Keep your supply where the four-legged ones can’t reach it. That is, assuming you’re clear-eyed enough to do that. Fido is counting on you.","2014-02-28 12:00:07","0","8.0","1.0","15.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","43.0","42.0","0.0","67.0","0.0","2.0","2","162","77.60","78.90","20.47","16.88","12.46","15.43","83.33","50.00","11.11","4.32","0.62","1.23","1.85","0.00","0.62","6.79","8.02","13.58","10.49","3.70","4.32","1.85","16.05","6.79","2.47","1.23","0.62","3.09","4.32","1.85","2.47","0.00","0.62","0.62","9.88","0.62","1.23","0.00","0.00","11.11","2.47","3.70","0.62","2.47","0.62","2.47","3.70","1.85","1.23","0.00","4.32","0.62","2.47","0.62","0.62","6.79","1.85","0.00","2.47","1.85","0.62","1.85","14.20","0.00","11.11","1.23","6.79","2.47","1.23","0.62","0.00","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","22.22","8.02","6.17","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.23","2.47","3.09","0.62","0.00","703","7.55","12.76923076923077","219","160","12","74.9","9.3","6.1","8.92","7.2","33","7.333333333333334","15.57","124","12.23","2","0.48","0","4","2","19","0","18","14","1","0","5","25","8","0","12","0","0","7","1","9","0","0","0","5","0","10","2","4","4","8","5","1","1","0","1"

"https://dailysurge.com/2014/06/california-public-employees-making-bank-on-pensions/","California Public Employees Making Bank On Pensions","In 2013, as a reward for thirty years of humble public service, retired LAPD Assistant Chief Tony Varela took home a pension payment of $983,319. Two fellow assistant chiefs took home over $850,000.

Their takes, while the highest, were hardly unique. With benefits factored in, 96 retired workers in California took home at least $500,000 in pension payments last year. Almost all of them were police and fire-fighting higher-ups, though some merely held mid-level ranks such as lieutenant.

According to the Census Bureau, as of 2012 the per capita income in California was $29,551, meaning such pension bombs amount to over 15 years of earnings for the typical Californian.

The sky-high pensions paid out to California’s public sector workers in 2013 were revealed in freshly compiled data released by the California Policy Center (CPC).

The primary culprit behind the largest payouts is a program called DROP, heavily used by police and firefighters in Los Angeles as well as public employees in San Diego and other California cities.

DROP stands for Deferred Retirement Option Plan, and is available to employees who have worked for at least 25 years and reached 50 years of age. Under the program, an employee can “retire,” but then immediately return to work for five additional years and be paid both a salary as well as their pension, which is placed in an account that earns a guaranteed 5 percent interest per year. When the employee finally retires for good, they receive the accumulated amount in one giant lump-sum payment, and then continue to receive their standard pension for the rest of their life.

“I don’t know anybody that would think it’s fair to be paid to work and to be retired from the same job. It goes against the very definition of retired,” CPC president Mark Bucher told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

In Los Angeles, where the biggest DROP boons are found, the program was created in 2000 to help keep veteran officers on staff following a major police scandal. However, in 2008 a sunset clause was removed, meaning that without action by lawmakers the program is permanent. While the program was promised to taxpayers as “cost-neutral,” it actually is only cost-neutral for police and firefighter pension funds. No data has ever been made public about the program’s general cost to city finances. A first-ever study of the program was recently completed, but is still under evaluation by city officials.

Even without DROP, however, there are 8,437 retired public workers in California earning at least $100,000 off of ordinary pensions, according to Bucher. Fifty-four are above $200,000. In comparison, the average annual Social Security benefit is a scant $15,528, for workers whose benefits only become fully available at 65.

Bucher said that employees collaborate to ensure they can retire with the most lucrative pensions possible.

“In the last year, what they’ll do is make sure that all the overtime is given to the person retiring,” he said. Since pensions are based on peak earning years and take overtime into account, retirees can boost their annual take by a 25 percent or more.

Pensions aren’t the only way public employees are engorging themselves. Ordinary salaries can be sky-high as well. In Alameda County, County Administrator Susan Muranishi took home $657,000 in combined pay and benefits, while assistant county manager Donna Linton netted $338,000. All told, 21 county administrative officers earn over $200,000, enough to put them in the 95th percentile for all earners in the United States.

"https://dailysurge.com/2014/03/washington-now-company-town/","Washington is Now a Company Town","Much has been said recently regarding D.C.’s partisan brinksmanship. We can’t get anything done because “evil” Republicans are obstructionists. I would argue that quite the opposite is true; there’s far too much bi-partisanship in Washington, D.C. There is no such thing as a Republican or Democrat anymore.

Washington has become a company town.

Today’s Washington, D.C. consists of a one party system made up entirely of elitist, establishment, crony, politicians, whose sole aim is to stay in power. Once elected, their goal is to get re-elected and never leave town, whether it’s on Capitol Hill or at a cushy K Street lobbying firm. We have way too much bi-partisanship in Washington because politicians couldn’t care less about the voters they are supposed to serve.

One needn’t look any further than the recent vote in Congress to raise the debt ceiling. America is approaching $18 trillion in debt, and yet Congress votes in lockstep to give Mr. Obama a blank check without so much as a debate about it.

Think about that for a moment. No one, save for Ted Cruz, even sounded the alarm.

Democracy is indeed messy. The framers of the Constitution wanted drawn out debate. They wanted partisanship, if you will. They didn’t want lawmakers to rubber stamp laws. Partisanship is a good thing. It’s what the Founding Fathers would have wanted; it’s what constitutional government is all about. Partisanship is why a grassroots movement such as the Tea Party scares the hell out of the establishment and it’s why the media seeks to marginalize it.

Make no mistake about it. What we have now in Washington is a one party system of inside the beltway political elites who don’t give a damn about “We the People” who elect them.","2014-03-09 11:06:27","0","10.0","3.0","15.0","0.0","8.0","0.0","46.0","43.0","0.0","70.0","0.0","4.0","4","299","69.45","60.56","6.08","20.69","13.59","20.74","78.26","49.50","10.03","3.68","0.33","1.34","0.33","0.00","1.67","6.35","8.36","13.04","10.37","6.69","4.35","3.34","17.06","5.02","2.68","3.01","2.34","2.68","5.02","2.34","2.68","0.67","1.00","0.00","8.36","0.33","0.00","0.00","0.33","12.04","0.67","2.01","3.34","2.68","1.67","3.01","1.00","0.33","0.67","0.00","1.00","0.00","0.00","0.67","0.33","8.70","2.34","1.34","4.01","1.67","0.33","3.01","13.71","0.67","11.04","1.34","7.02","3.01","3.34","1.00","0.00","0.67","0.33","0.00","1.34","0.67","0.33","0.67","0.00","0.00","20.40","9.03","4.01","0.00","0.67","0.00","0.00","1.00","1.34","4.01","0.00","0.33","1373","7.59","14.761904761904763","424","292","24","67.55","9.7","6.9","10.54","8.0","62","4.555555555555555","15.373150684931506","190","14.05","8","0.49","0","5","5","30","0","33","24","1","0","4","46","33","2","10","0","0","17","1","16","1","0","2","7","0","15","7","3","7","12","19","0","5","1","2"

"https://dailysurge.com/2014/03/whew-five-second-rule-real/","Whew! The Five-Second Rule Is Real! » DailySurge","It’s an age-old question that’s been debated by scientists for decades now:

Is The Five-Second Rule for real?

You know The Five-Second Rule. It’s that classic urban legend that says food dropped on the floor is still “safe” to eat, as long as you pick it up before the passage of–you guessed it–five seconds. It’s based on reports that germs take at least six seconds to transfer from one surface to another. Well now, a new study conducted by final-year Biology students at Aston University in Birmingham, England, has concluded that this is, in fact, a legit claim! What a relief!

On the heels of their in-depth probe, they report the following:

Time is a significant factor in the transfer of bacteria from a floor surface to a piece of food.

The type of flooring the food has been dropped on has an effect, with bacteria least likely to transfer from carpeted surfaces and most likely to transfer from laminate or tiled surfaces to moist foods making contact for more than 5 seconds.

Hallelujah! Now we can all feel free to chow down on that delicious floor-spiced bagel, right?

Well, maybe not. This may provide some new “scientific evidence” that Five-Second Rule proponents can point to as they munch on a mouthful of Linoleum-Flavored Nachos…but there will always remain others who will never be convinced. Consider this Clemson University study conducted back in 2007:

So, the new Aston study will undoubtedly have its detractors…and that means it’s up to you to decide whether a Bologna and Hardwood Sandwich is something you want in your life. Some of the other interesting findings from the new study:

87% of people surveyed said they would eat food dropped on the floor, or already have done so.

55% of those that would, or have, eaten food dropped in the floor are women.

81% of the women who would eat food from the floor would follow the 5 second rule.

Well played, Aston students. Well played. Using women to further the cause, when here I had always thought this was exclusively a man’s game. Truly genius.

Now, take 6 minutes out of your day to watch George Carlin wax poetic about germs:

"https://dailysurge.com/2014/02/democrats-like-nancy-pelosi-hate-marriage/","Why Democrats Like Nancy Pelosi Hate Marriage","WARNING: this video contains disturbing images.

“Why would you get married? Why would anybody get married,” asked House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Putting aside the fact that the 73-year-old Congresswoman has, herself, been married for five decades, Democrats don’t want you to marry. And, of course, it’s political.

But don’t take it from me.

Shortly after John Kerry’s ‘2004 presidential defeat, Mark Mellman a season Democratic pollster reported that Kerry had won unmarried voters by 18 points to Bush’s 15 point win of married voters resulting in a 33 point marriage gap. “Never-marriad women are one of the most Democratic segments in the population . . . 63 percent of them identify as Democrats and our data suggests about two-thirds voted for Kerry,” Mellman confessed.

But Mellman was just getting warmed up. “Non-marriage is on the rise,” he wrote. “Divorce, later marriages, increased life expectancy, and other forces have led to a decline of more than 25 percent since 1970 in the proportion of Americans who are married.” Mellman’s conclusion? “Mobilizing culturally progressive or economically hard-pressed singles should be a key priority for Democrats.”

And there you have it. Don’t work, don’t save, don’t get married, vote Democrat, and die.","2014-02-26 12:00:10","0","11.0","4.0","15.0","0.0","7.0","2.0","48.0","43.0","0.0","70.0","0.0","4.0","4","203","73.23","81.24","7.40","34.31","12.69","28.57","77.34","40.89","8.37","3.94","0.49","0.49","1.48","0.99","0.49","4.43","4.93","11.82","9.36","3.45","4.43","2.96","16.26","3.94","2.96","1.48","5.42","2.96","3.45","1.97","1.48","0.49","0.00","0.00","12.81","5.42","0.00","0.99","0.49","11.33","1.48","2.96","2.46","1.48","0.99","2.46","2.46","0.99","0.00","1.48","0.49","0.00","0.49","0.00","0.00","13.30","5.42","2.46","3.94","3.45","0.49","4.93","10.34","0.49","11.33","1.97","5.91","3.94","4.43","0.49","0.49","0.49","0.49","0.49","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","30.05","7.88","7.88","0.49","0.00","0.99","0.00","2.96","5.42","4.43","0.00","0.00","1004","8.82","13.25","302","197","16","67.45","10.0","6.9","13.5","10.4","57","5.625","18.493604060913704","151","12.56","1","0.42","0","8","11","11","0","23","17","1","0","3","33","23","4","13","0","0","10","1","6","0","1","1","3","0","7","8","3","9","9","4","0","1","0","2"
"https://dailysurge.com/2014/06/clintons-finally-ready-political-fight-benghazi/","Are The Clintons Finally Ready for a Political Fight Over Benghazi?","Ever since Benghazi first became a hot-button issue in Washington, Hillary Clinton has been struggling with how to handle her past failure in light of an impending run for the White House in 2016. At first, she thought she could get away with staying on the same page as the administration, blaming the terrorist attack on a YouTube video, just as Ambassador Susan Rice and Barack Obama himself had done. According to author Ed Klein’s new book, “Blood Feud,” Bill Clinton wanted Hillary to resign from her post at that exact moment, so as not to get caught up in the whole YouTube fabrication. But Hillary ultimately continued operating in her position, and when that lie eventually proved less than fruitful, she tried to ignore the incident altogether. But eventually, she was called to testify before Congress, and that’s when her most unfortunate and arrogant “what difference does it make” response was on display for the whole world to see. Since then, the former Secretary of State has been at a loss for what to do. Daily Surge’s own Jason Mattera confronted her just two weeks ago, and she was back to ignoring the thing. On her book tour for “Hard Choices,” her explanations for Benghazi have been uneven, to say the least. But that’s mainly because she hasn’t been truly challenged on it yet, and it certainly doesn’t hurt that she has had certain members of the media in her corner who really should know better.

With all that said, it’s only logical that Bill Clinton has been deployed to handle this one. On Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” we got to see a much more in-depth version of David Gregory’s interview with the former president, and one of the key moments can be seen above, as Clinton remarked:

“When ten different instances occurred when President Bush was in office where American diplomatic personnel were killed around the world, how many outraged Republican members of Congress were there? Zero.”

Those are among the strongest words we’ve heard from The Clintons on Benghazi so far, politically speaking. I’ll save the accuracy of that comment for a separate post. After all, it only makes sense to attack one’s critics as hypocrites when there’s no good explanation for the original blunder. But is it a sign of what’s to come? Will we see Hillary take up this mantle personally and start attacking Republicans for her own mistakes? Or will she be content simply letting Bill fight her battles? “What difference does it make” may have been enough for Hillary to skate through on in early 2013, but it’s clear that both of the senior Clintons now realize that the way they respond between now and the next presidential election WILL make a difference.

This is getting juicy, folks.","2014-06-30 05:00:41","0","10.0","5.0","15.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","50.0","43.0","0.0","70.0","0.0","4.0","4","467","73.84","67.35","28.32","2.69","23.35","22.06","86.30","52.03","11.13","5.14","0.21","0.64","0.00","4.07","0.21","6.00","6.42","16.49","9.85","6.00","6.64","0.86","16.70","6.85","4.50","2.78","1.93","2.36","6.42","1.93","4.50","0.43","2.14","0.86","8.35","0.21","0.00","3.85","0.21","11.35","2.14","2.14","0.86","0.86","2.36","3.43","4.50","1.93","1.07","0.86","0.86","0.21","0.21","0.00","0.43","7.92","1.28","1.50","4.07","1.50","0.43","6.21","9.42","1.93","16.70","0.86","8.14","7.71","3.64","1.28","0.21","0.64","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.06","3.43","5.35","0.21","0.00","0.86","0.00","0.43","2.57","3.21","0.00","0.00","2168","8.21","25.36842105263158","661","465","19","63.53","12.2","10.5","11.09","13.6","99","16.333333333333332","20.316129032258065","283","23.53","2","0.51","0","15","6","42","0","65","39","2","2","5","48","49","1","16","1","0","22","10","30","1","1","3","15","0","24","25","9","14","7","15","0","5","0","8"
"https://dailysurge.com/2014/03/bipartisan-capitulation-iranian-nukes/","Bipartisan Capitulation on Iranian Nukes","One of the major themes of my new book, Iran’s Final Solution for Israel, is the abject failure of imagination regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran, which transcends the political and ideological Republican/Democratic party, and Right/Left, divides.

Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the craven capitulation to Obama administration demands that Congress “butt out” of the “P5 +1” sham agreement process which has provided dangerous U.S. and international validation of Iran’s uranium enrichment program.

As reported by Al-Monitor yesterday (3/27/14), House lawmakers are crafting a “bipartisan” bill targeting Iran’s jihad-terror “proxy” Hezbollah, having acquiesced to the Obama administration’s demand not to address Iran’s relentless pursuit of nuclear capabilities, whose ultimate goal has long been acknowledged to be the production of nuclear weapons. The Hezbollah-limited focus, though allegedly “in the works for several months,” in reality represented bipartisan subservience to Obama administration wishes, gaining momentum, after Democrats acceded to the Obama administration’s request that Congressbutt out of the multiparty nuclear negotiations with Iran. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has blocked a vote on a bipartisan Iran sanctions bill that has garnered 59 cosponsors, and the House has also lifted the pressure since passing its own sanctions bill on a 400-20 vote last summer.

Pressed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, during hearings on February 4, 2014, U.S. chief negotiator with Iran Wendy Sherman conceded that the P5 + 1 agreement, failed to “shut down” Iran’s continuing development of ballistic missiles. These weapons, which have long range capabilities, are the preferred devices for delivering a nuclear payload. Senator Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the committee’s ranking member, raised the appropriate questions, interspersed with relevant commentary:

Why did you all not in this agreement in any way address the delivery mechanisms, the militarizing of nuclear arms, why was that left off since they [Iran] breached a threshold everyone acknowledges.? They can build a bomb. We know that. They know that. They have advanced centrifuges. We have a major loophole in the research and development area that everyone acknowledges. We are going to allow them over this next year to continue to perfect the other piece of this, which is the [nuclear] delivery mechanism. Why did we do that?

Within 2-weeks later, Ms. Sherman admitted that if Iran’s nuclear program was only for peaceful purposes, the Islamic Republic “does not need” the fortified, underground uranium enrichment center at Fordow, or its plutonium heavy-water reactor at Arak.

One would have hoped that Wendy Sherman’s candid February 2014 acknowledgments strengthened the resolve of those U.S. lawmakers who have questioned the sobriety of the P5 +1 interim deal with Iran. Those hopes have now been dashed by our Congressional “hollow men/The stuffed men.”

Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Deputy Commander Brigadier-General Hossein Salami made the following comments at a conference held in Tehran, which aired on Al-Alam TV on March 11, 2014:

Despite the geographical distance, we are attached to the hearts of the Palestinians. How is it that our slogans and goals are identical to the slogans and causes of the Palestinians? Why do we strive to become martyrs and risk our lives for the Palestinian cause? The answer is that the religion of Islam has designated this for us – this goal, this motivation, this belief, this energy – so that we, here, can muster all our energies in order to annihilate the Zionist entity, more than 1,400 kilometers away. We are ready for that moment in the future.

The Left says either the good general Salami doesn’t mean any of this, i.e., it is just “cultural bluster”—which of course shouldn’t be criticized at any rate, because that would be “racist.” The openly antisemitic hard Leftists admit they just don’t care if Israel is annihilated in a nuclear jihad.

Conservative “Iran shenasans”—(alleged) “Iran experts”—say he’s simply “distorting” Shiite Islam and we must be patient, support the Soylent Green Movement of Iranian Jeffersonian Democrats, and “regime replacement” will solve the Iranian nuke and all other such problems engendered by the “distortion of Shiite Islam.” Ignore the hard data that show 83% support for Sharia in Iran—that too is “racist”—or if not racist, “Islamophobic”

Till now, those are your Iran policy options from the ones who control such discourse—and current or planned actions—on the Left and Right.

"https://dailysurge.com/2014/03/yourmomcares-team-obama-enlists-celebrity-moms-pimp-obamacare/","#YourMomCares: Team Obama Enlists Celebrity Moms to Pimp ObamaCare","The Obama administration is in panic mode ahead of its self-imposed March 31st Obamacare enrollment deadline. Just days after President Obama’s “Between Two Ferns” flub, the White House has released a brand new pro-Obamacare video starring the mothers of Adam Levine, Jonah Hill, Alicia Keys, and Jennifer Lopez.

This latest ad campaign is likely too little too late. A huge problem with Obamacare, (and boy are there problems), is that Obama’s team has failed to get enough young, 18-34s–and usually healthier–people to sign up for plans on the state or federal exchange. Despite Obamacare marketeers’ best efforts, since October 1, the percentage of those coveted youngsters who have enrolled remains at an abysmal 25 percent. And without an adequate amount of young “invicencibles” enrolled to help offset the (generally) higher healthcare costs of the older and sicker, Obamacare is headed for financial collapse.

This week’s first star-studded Obamacare push purportedly sent some 19,000 people straight through to Healthcare.gov. That would be swell, if you define success down. People visiting Healthcare.gov–even if they sign up–is worthless if they aren’t picking plans and paying their premiums–which is another huge problem.

But hey look, a cool rich celebrity singer’s mommy.

And another.

This isn’t the first time team Obama has looked to America’s moms to help sell this train wreck. Last December First Lady Michelle Obama met with a group of mothers at the White House and urged them to talk about Obamacare’s benefits “in the grocery store” and elsewhere in their day-to-day lives. And now the Obama White House is at it again. Only this time, the First Lady brought some friends along for the ride.

This latest approach to sell Obamacare isn’t likely to persuade young people, but it is good for mockery.","2014-03-14 10:47:24","0","16.0","3.0","15.0","1.0","11.0","0.0","51.0","43.0","0.0","69.0","0.0","4.0","4","306","88.63","72.17","36.66","16.43","19.12","23.53","78.43","41.18","7.19","1.96","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","1.63","5.23","6.21","13.40","5.88","3.59","5.23","1.31","10.13","6.54","2.61","0.65","3.27","2.61","4.58","1.96","2.61","0.33","0.33","0.65","10.46","1.31","0.33","1.96","0.33","8.17","0.65","0.65","2.29","3.27","0.00","3.59","2.29","1.96","0.00","0.33","1.31","0.00","0.98","0.00","0.33","12.75","2.29","4.58","5.56","1.96","1.31","1.31","8.17","0.98","16.99","2.29","5.23","9.15","4.58","1.31","0.98","2.94","0.00","0.00","0.65","0.00","0.00","0.33","0.00","0.00","19.28","5.88","4.90","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.96","1.96","3.27","1.31","0.00","1467","8.6","19.6875","420","292","16","69.82","10.4","8.1","13.34","12.6","75","8.8","19.59397260273973","203","18.62","1","0.4","0","13","8","29","0","31","26","4","3","1","48","44","0","21","0","0","6","3","16","0","0","3","10","0","10","6","4","8","6","12","2","1","0","0"
"https://dailysurge.com/2014/06/cnn-will-charlie-rangel-lose-seat/","CNN: Will Charlie Rangel Lose His Seat?","One can only hope for something so sweet.

And yet it certainly stands to reason that Charles Rangel, after 22 consecutive victories, could be defeated tonight by his primary opponent and State Sen. Adriano Espaillat.

All the experts and pundits were certainly caught completely off guard when a politically unknown college professor named David Brat beat the powerful House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Those same experts and pundits were also surprised by David Jolly’s narrow defeat over Democrat Alex Sink in Florida’s special Congressional election.



Just two years ago, Espaillat came within 1,000 votes of sending Rangel packing.

“He has become a liability for the Democratic Party. He can no longer go across the country to campaign to be in the majority,” Espaillat said. “He served 44 years, but he hasn’t been effective since he’s been censured.”

Espaillat has a point. Charlie is dirty. In 2010, Rangel was found guilty of 11 ethics violations. He was also censured for those violations, which is the harshest form of punishment he could face just short of expulsion from Congress.

And when Charlie Rangel is not being an unethical clown (which is never), he’s somewhere not representing the interests of his constituency. In 2009, the national poverty rate was 14.3%. In 2010, in New York 15, Rep. Rangel’s district, the poverty rate was 24.3%.

And of course there’s Charlie Rangel’s repulsive addiction to calling Americans he disagrees with politically, racists. Rangel’s latest hate-filled tirade against the tea party found him comparing the political group to the murdering, Palestinian terror outfit Hamas.

Yes, Espaillat is a Democrat and would be just another rubber stamp devoted to pleasing his party leaders. But, at the very least, he’s not a littering, unethical pile of excrement like Charlie Rangel.","2014-06-24 15:30:28","0","14.0","3.0","15.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","55.0","43.0","0.0","73.0","0.0","4.0","4","294","73.84","63.31","3.19","31.57","14.00","28.91","72.45","44.22","7.82","4.76","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.76","0.00","2.72","6.46","11.90","10.20","5.10","4.76","2.04","12.93","6.46","2.38","1.36","4.42","2.04","7.82","4.08","3.74","0.68","1.70","0.00","7.82","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.76","8.84","1.70","1.02","1.70","1.36","1.70","2.38","0.68","0.00","0.34","0.00","1.36","0.34","0.34","0.00","0.68","9.18","1.36","2.38","7.14","0.34","0.68","5.10","7.14","0.68","12.24","1.36","6.80","4.08","3.40","1.02","0.34","0.68","0.00","0.34","0.34","0.00","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.00","20.07","7.14","6.46","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.34","1.36","3.40","0.68","0.68","1473","8.04","17.0","448","292","20","65.12","11.6","7.8","12.98","10.9","68","8.9","17.155068493150686","199","16.33","0","0.41","0","9","15","22","0","29","20","0","3","5","39","45","1","14","0","0","12","3","22","0","0","0","6","0","7","15","7","12","3","11","3","0","0","2"
"https://dailysurge.com/2014/06/colorado-campus-gun-ban-proposal-dropped-by-its-own-supporters/","Colorado Campus Gun Ban Proposal Dropped By Its Own Supporters","A Colorado ballot initiative to ban concealed weapons on university campuses may have more than enough signatures to head to voters in November — but its supporters are pulling the plug to avoid bringing gun rights supporters to the polls.

It’s a measure of how radioactive an issue gun restrictions can be for liberal or moderate candidates.

After Colorado enacted two controversial laws in 2013 limiting the number of rounds magazines can hold and requiring universal background checks, two Democratic state senators who supported the measures were recalled from office. A third resigned rather than face her own recall, leaving Democrats with just a one-seat majority in the state senate.

That senator, Evie Hudak, created a stir when she told a campus rape survivor that having a gun when she was attacked wouldn’t have made her safer.

The woman had been testifying on a bill to ban concealed weapons on college campuses, which was ultimately killed by the bill’s sponsor before being revived as a possible ballot initiative.

Safe Campus Colorado, the group behind the ballot proposal, now doesn’t want its issue to become a lightning rod in what is already turning out to be a heated campaign season.

“It became evident over the past few months that last year’s gun violence prevention legislation was being used as a political football in a number of Colorado candidate elections,” the group’s director Ken Toltz said in an email to The Daily Caller News Foundation.

“We are non-partisan and don’t want this important issue to be caught up in the candidate campaigns, so [we] made the very difficult decision not to submit our petitions for this November’s ballot,” he said.

Safe Campus Colorado clearly had momentum. The deadline for submitting the required 86,105 valid signatures is still more than a month away. Most initiatives collect at least 30 percent more than is needed to account for some that inevitably are found invalid. Toltz said his all-volunteer group spent less than $10,000 gathering signatures.

Dave Kopel, the research director for the libertarian Independence Institute — and an attorney who is representing several plaintiffs in a lawsuit to overturn the controversial laws from 2013 — told Colorado Public Radio the decision to stand down is a “huge victory” for supporters of gun rights.

“It’s eminently sensible and prudent for the Democratic establishment in Colorado in 2014 to say we don’t want a gun ballot issue out there,” he told CPR. “Whatever happens with that ballot issue, it’s going bring more pro-gun voters to the polls and then once they are at the polls to vote on the gun issue, they will probably vote also in the candidate races for the more pro-gun candidates.”

Toltz told TheDCNF that his group would continue to advocate for changes in the concealed weapons law.

“We found statewide support for adding colleges and universities to the already existing exceptions in the concealed carry permit law and will continue building awareness and support for a change to the law,” he said.

"https://dailysurge.com/2014/06/colorado-gun-laws-upheld-as-constitutional/","Colorado Gun Laws Upheld As Constitutional","A federal judge upheld Colorado’s controversial new gun control laws Thursday, ruling that limits to the size of ammunition magazines and requirements for universal background checks are not unconstitutional.

In her 50-page written ruling, U.S. District Chief Judge Marcia Krieger took pains to note that her ruling wasn’t an “opinion as to whether a law is ‘good’ or ‘bad,’ ‘wise’ or ‘unwise,’ ‘sound policy’ or a ‘hastily-considered overreaction,’” but merely a ruling on its constitutionality.

“A law may be constitutional, but nevertheless foolish, ineffective, or cumbersome to enforce,” she wrote.

In her ruling, Krieger wrote that the plaintiffs — which included Colorado sheriffs acting in private capacity, several gun-rights and/or shooting organizations and firearms-parts businesses — could not prove that the ban on magazines that hold more than 15 rounds would prohibit gun owners from adequately defending themselves.

“Despite more than 40 years instructing individuals and law enforcement in defensive firearm use, the Plaintiffs’ expert witness, Massad Ayoob, identified only three anecdotal instances in which individuals engaging in defensive use of firearms fired more than 15 rounds, and not all of these successful defensive actions involved semiautomatic weapons,” Kreiger wrote.

The three examples included a gun store owner defending against a robbery by firing more than 100 rounds from two fully automatic weapons, a watch store owner firing more than 15 rounds from more than one semiautomatic handgun, and jewelry store owners who got into a shootout with potential robbers defending themselves with several revolvers.

“Of the many law enforcement officials called to testify, none were able to identify a single instance in which they were involved where a single civilian fired more than 15 shots in self-defense,” Kreiger wrote.

Krieger also cited a lack of evidence during the two week trial showing that requiring background checks under the new law infringed on any of the plaintiffs’ Second Amendment rights, noting that one witness who testified moved to Georgia and doesn’t plan to return to Colorado.

Another installs scopes and sights on customers’ firearms and sometimes keeps the weapons for longer than 72 hours, the grace period before which a background check is needed to make the transfer legal.

But the judge wrote that it was unclear if the plaintiff needed to keep the weapons longer than 72 hours due to necessity or out of convenience. Regardless, she wrote, there was very little threat of prosecution if it’s the former.

In fact, no one has been arrested or prosecuted under either law, which is among the reasons most of the state’s elected sheriffs opposed them the first place. Several, including Weld County Sheriff John Cooke, have flatly said they wouldn’t enforce them.

“While we respect the judge’s ruling today, we believe that it is plainly wrong on the law and on the facts,” Cooke said at a press conference Thursday, as reported by the Denver Post.

“[The laws] are still unenforceable,” he said. “And that is borne out in that there has not been one arrest on these two laws to date.”

The Post reported that the plaintiffs will open a new legal challenge in the 10th Circuit.

"https://dailysurge.com/2014/04/alex-jones-latest-conspiracy-theory-glenn-beck-works-obama/","Alex Jones’ Latest Conspiracy Theory: Glenn Beck Works for Obama","World class 9/11 Truther/all-around conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is never at a loss for words, and that was certainly the case as he climbed aboard his Cliven Bundy high horse, slamming Glenn Beck for not backing the man who turned out to be a racist bigot. According to Alex, Beck is a “Benedict Arnold” who has somehow teamed up with the Obama administration in order to supposedly slander the good name of the Nevada rancher.

According to Alex Jones’ Infowars:

Glenn Beck, who fancies himself a libertarian, is working with corporate media insiders and a former CIA employee who flaunts his membership in the globalist Council on Foreign Relations. The objective of this group at the very heart of Beck’s operation, now readily apparent following the Cliven Bundy standoff, is to portray the Nevada rancher as a racist zealot, a member of a dangerous and outlaw sovereign citizen movement, and inseparable from violent and conspiracy crazed “militia” domestic terrorists. Beck’s campaign mirrors that of the Obama administration, Eric Holder’s Justice Department and the liberal media intelligentsia.

Got all that?

Jones and his team are charging that Beck is not the libertarian he claims to be, and that he doesn’t believe in the U.S. Constitution. I guess all of those countless hours Beck spends teaching Americans about the Constitution are merely one gigantic ruse then? I am completely confused, especially considering that Alex Jones has also been accusing Beck of listening to the Alex Jones Show and copying it. So, wouldn’t that make Jones the original “Judas Goat” then? My head is spinning.

Beck and company are exploiting a carefully crafted meme manufactured in the intervening years since the Oklahoma City bombing by the Southern Poverty Law Center in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the establishment media. They are using this government created and SPLC disseminated mythology to foment discord within the patriot movement and also set the stage for a false flag event that will serve as a coup de grâce that will destroy the movement. The correlation between the Obama administration, the Justice Department and Beck became obvious as the standoff progressed, most notably when Beck began to repeat government talking points to attack Bundy and his supporters.

Well that’s…an interesting angle. What Jones and Kurt Nimmo of Infowars are saying, in essence, is that Glenn Beck’s entire persona was crafted out of whole cloth as a disguise for a much more devious hidden agenda–so hidden, in fact, that Beck will never actually reveal to anyone that he’s been punk’ing the country all along, and has put millions of dollars into The Blaze Radio Network just so he can secretly act as a tool of the Obama administration. I’ve heard a lot of whoppers in my day, but…damn.

Now, there could be an entirely different and far more reasonable explanation for these outrageous claims–something called “jealousy.” Note the comments from Alex about Glenn’s radio affiliates in the beginning of the above clip. It sounds just a wee-bit like someone wanting desperately to be Top Banana–as if Beck is cramping the style of Jones and his so-called “liberty movement.” But who am I to assign such a motive to a guy asking “innocent questions”?

Just personal preference here, but I think I’ll come down on the side of the commentator who ISN’T defending a racist twit.","2014-04-28 05:00:51","0","16.0","8.0","15.0","1.0","7.0","0.0","48.0","43.0","0.0","70.0","0.0","4.0","4","576","87.83","62.28","7.43","28.66","26.18","26.04","73.96","46.88","8.51","3.47","1.39","0.00","0.00","1.91","0.17","5.03","10.42","13.19","6.60","4.69","6.77","1.22","10.76","4.17","2.60","1.39","0.69","2.60","4.51","2.26","2.08","0.52","1.04","0.17","7.47","0.00","0.35","0.00","2.26","9.20","2.08","1.04","0.87","2.08","2.60","1.56","1.74","0.69","1.04","0.00","0.87","0.35","0.35","0.00","0.17","7.64","1.39","1.39","4.34","0.35","0.87","2.26","6.25","1.04","10.07","1.56","5.56","2.78","4.17","0.69","0.17","0.52","0.17","0.00","0.35","0.17","0.00","0.00","0.17","0.00","14.41","3.82","4.17","0.35","0.00","0.69","0.00","0.52","2.08","2.43","0.00","0.35","2791","9.16","29.45","888","565","22","45.39","14.6","13.3","12.77","15.6","152","16.833333333333332","23.041061946902655","327","26.05","12","0.46","0","22","3","69","1","68","38","0","0","5","91","88","3","18","3","0","15","7","33","3","1","3","14","0","14","11","21","11","18","17","3","7","0","1"

Bill O’Reilly was referring to Mattera’s confrontation with Hillary Clinton last week, in which he asked the former Secretary of State to inscribe a copy of her “Hard Choices” memoir to the late Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

The all-seeing, all-knowing, all-wise Factor Man was absolutely incensed by the notion that Mattera would do such a thing. It’s “ambush journalism,” decried O’Reilly’s lap dog guest Martha MacCallum. “Cheap stuff,” added Bill. This twosome seemed angrier at Jason’s brand of journalism than they were at the fact that it was Hillary Clinton who was largely responsible for the death of her own friend in Benghazi. I guess “ambush journalism” is perfectly acceptable if you spend most of your time embarrassing sexy college coeds for “Factor” ratings or track down Obama’s illegal immigrant uncle in a liquor store, but if you do the same to a political figure essentially running for president, shame on you.

In any event, if journalists in D.C. were confronting Hillary rather than coronating her, Mattera wouldn’t have to. And O’Reilly knows this. His stunt tonight was nothing more than a televised wet kiss to Hillary Clinton in order to score an interview with her.

Ambassador John Bolton took to the airwaves this morning on Blaze radio affiliate, AM 700 KSEV in Houston and blasted President Obama’s foreign policy record. Bolton had plenty to say about Secretary of State John Kerry’s puzzling comments that compared U.S. ally, the Jewish state of Israel, to the old racist South African policy of “apartheid.”

Some of the Ambassador’s strongest condemnations came from the revelation that State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki, in response to continued belligerence from Russia in Ukraine, took to twitter to partake in “hashtag diplomacy.”

Bolton said of the tweeting, “I love children, I just don’t think they should be in charge of foreign policy” Leading Democrats didn’t hesitate to come out hard against Kerry’s insane apartheid gaffe. California Senator Barbara Boxer slammed Kerry’s comments as “nonsensical.”

Congressman Steve Israel took his criticism a step further saying Kerry was “painfully wrong.”

"https://dailysurge.com/2014/06/curious-release-of-bowe-bergdahl/","The Curious Release Of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl","Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, an American POW, was turned over by the Taliban after five years in captivity in exchange for five notorious Islamic militants who had been held at Guantánamo Bay.

The search for Bergdahl began soon after he went missing on June 30, 2009. Various news outlets have been putting out false information regarding this story. Why?

In the weeks before his “capture,” Bergdahl had made statements suggesting he was gravitating away from the army and towards desertion.

He had been acting strange, telling people in his unit he wanted to “walk the earth,” and kept a journal writing about how he was meant for better things. No one thought anything about it. He was considered a little “out there”.

He detailed his disillusionment in an email to his parents three days before he went missing. “I am sorry for everything here,” he wrote, “these people need help, yet what they get is the most conceited country in the world telling them they are nothing and they are stupid.”

In another email he wrote, ” I am ashamed to be an American. And the title of US soldier is just the lie of fools,” he concluded, ” I am sorry for everything. The horror that is America is disgusting.”

Later he took some water, a compass and a knife, left his weapon, and departed. Later that day, a drone and four fighter jets began to search for him.

Weeks of searching turned into months. The military pushed his parents and fellow soldiers to sign non-disclosure agreements. The US government knew full well that he had deserted.

There is no way to know what he told the Taliban. The truth is we lost good men trying to find him. PFC Matthew Michael Martinek, Staff Sgt. Kurt Robert Curtiss, SSG Clayton Bowen,PFC Morris Walker, SSG Michael Murphrey, 2LT Darryn Andrews were all KIA from his unit.

Sgt. Bergdahl should be tried under UCMJ for being a deserter and judged for what he did. Bergdahl is not a hero, he is not a soldier. He failed his brothers. Now sons and daughters are growing up without fathers who died because of him and he will have to face the truth someday.","2014-06-02 15:42:16","0","14.0","3.0","15.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","46.0","43.0","0.0","70.0","0.0","4.0","4","369","71.69","92.44","3.05","4.16","13.18","21.14","82.66","51.49","14.91","10.57","0.81","0.81","0.00","7.86","1.08","4.34","7.05","13.01","9.21","3.25","3.52","1.63","19.24","3.79","2.44","1.90","1.90","1.36","5.96","1.90","4.07","0.54","0.81","1.90","16.80","1.63","0.27","0.27","9.21","8.67","2.98","1.08","0.81","1.36","1.63","0.81","0.81","0.81","0.00","0.00","0.54","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.27","7.32","1.90","1.36","3.79","1.08","0.27","9.21","6.50","0.81","13.82","2.44","6.50","4.88","1.63","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.27","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","17.62","7.32","5.96","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","0.27","3.79","0.00","0.00","0.00","1627","6.94","14.192307692307692","487","369","25","81.83","9.2","5.5","9.16","7.9","60","10.2","14.424065040650408","226","13.27","13","0.48","0","11","7","32","0","37","15","1","0","2","46","43","0","22","0","0","30","8","11","0","1","3","8","0","9","30","15","12","9","8","1","5","0","2"
"https://dailysurge.com/2014/06/death-and-taxes-colorado-sees-good-and-bad-of-pot-legalization/","Death And Taxes: Colorado Sees Good And Bad Of Pot Legalization","Five months after Colorado began selling marijuana to adults in state-sanctioned retail stores, the state has collected at least $12.6 million in tax revenue, created thousands of new jobs and seen crime fall in Denver, where most marijuana retailers are located.

Critics, however, seize on incidents of over-ingestion by people new to marijuana, some evidence of increased seizures of Colorado pot in neighboring states and a rise in emergency room visits for children who’ve accidentally ingested marijuana as evidence that legalization has been a failure.

The biggest problems involve marijuana edibles, food products that are infused with marijuana’s active ingredient, THC. Edibles come in many forms and can pack a punch that isn’t felt by the user until up to an hour after ingestion, leading some to over-indulge.

The most high-profile incident was in March, when a 19-year-old University of Wyoming student, in Colorado for spring break, ate more than the recommended portion of a marijuana cookie and began behaving erratically before he fell to his death from a hotel balcony.

The coroner’s report cited “marijuana intoxication” as a significant contribution to his death.

A month later, a man shot and killed his wife after eating marijuana-laced candy, but the connection between the two hasn’t yet been established. He may also have taken prescription pain medication, according to reports.

Both deaths have been used by critics to loudly denounce Colorado’s ground-breaking effort to regulate a substance that is still illegal in 48 states and at the federal level.

“We’ve seen lives damaged,” said Kevin Sabet, of the anti-marijuana group Project SAM, in comments to The New York Times. “We’ve seen deaths directly attributed to marijuana legalization. We’ve seen marijuana slipping through Colorado’s borders. We’ve seen marijuana getting into the hands of kids.”

But the Times also noted that a lack of hard data about the new industry’s effect on health and the community’s well-being, despite such lurid examples.

Proponents of legalization say they are isolated incidents that ignore the overwhelming number of marijuana customers who have partaken in the state’s newest and most controversial offering with no problem.

“Every major institution said this would be horrible and lead to violence and blood in the streets,” attorney Brian Vicente told the Times. “None of that’s happened. The sky did not fall.”

Crime in Denver, however, has fallen.

Violent crime, robberies and assaults are down 5.6, 4.8 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, from the same period in 2013, according to statistics compiled by Vox. Crime in Denver overall is down 10 percent, the Times reported. Both news outlets stressed that it’s too soon to attribute the statistics to marijuana sales.

Recently, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who opposed Amendment 64, which legalized marijuana, admitted that pot sales haven’t negatively impacted Colorado’s business reputation.

Still, state leaders have recognized the need to tweak the new law, by tweaking packaging and labeling requirements for edible products, for instance. Legalization proponents say adjustments to the law are not only inevitable, but invited by those in the industry.

“Marijuana was illegal for 80 years,” Vicente told the Times. “Now it’s legal, and everyone’s just trying to figure out how to approach these new issues.”

The Colorado experience — watched not only by federal authorities, but by other states — has been positive enough that voters in five other states are likely to weigh in on their own legalization initiatives. They include Alaska, California, Arizona, Oregon and Maine, according to NBC.

There’s no doubt that chronic stress can have a very visible effect on not only how we feel on a day to day basis, but also how we look and age accordingly.

We then come to an interesting question, how much would a high stress job like the presidency of the United States have on a person?

Well in this time lapse created by YouTube user Diran Lyons, we see how President Barack Obama has aged since he took office back in 2009.

According to some researchers, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process. It seems as though something like that would make some sense, but you never know the extent of the process until you see it for yourself.

In the video, a series of photos taken of Obama are shown back to back in chronological order. As the video goes on, you can see a clear difference in his face. The lines are more defined and his hair is definitely a little more snowy.

While the jury is still out on whether chronic stress actually ages a person for sure. This seems to be pretty compelling evidence for the case and for some researchers it may be the perfect case study.

“You see it over a term,” geriatric physician Ronan Factora told the Washington Post. “It’s a good study of chronic stress on a person’s overall health.” So just remember to not stress out all the time if you want to stay looking young and feeling healthy.

Teaching Satanism is school sounds like the stuff out of a horror movie. But a US court ruling on religious freedoms has enabled devil worshipers in Florida to hand out educational material to kids in state schools. They won the right to “treat all faiths equally.”

Military vehicles are being transported through our city streets which are now owned by our police departments. Our police departments are receiving military gear which some say is part of the preparation for martial law.

In the state of Ohio alone, they have received more than $67 million worth of military equipment from the Department of Defense over the last several years. Well on their way to losing the public’s trust.

Manhattan Beach middle school has many parents upset as they came home with studies of the Quaran.

"http://dailybuzzlive.com/guy-changed-name-jose-joe-job-offers-started-rolling/","This Guy Changed His Name From José to Joe","This Guy Changed His Name From José to Joe And The Job Offers Started Rolling In. In a world where employers say that they are unbiased when hiring employees, it’s kind of hard to believe them when applying for jobs with no phone calls back. Most would think that maybe their experience wasn’t up to par or that maybe they already hired for the position you wanted. Well one man found that it was something as simple as changing his name, then all the jobs started calling him back.

José Zamora was searching for a job for months and had an everyday morning routine. He would go onto his computer and search the internet for jobs and apply for anything that he might be qualified for. To his estimate he says that he sent out between 50 to 100 resumes a day, which is an insane amount. He did this though with no return. Not a single call back and he was getting frustrated.

One day though Zamora decided to change one little thing on his resume. He dropped the S out of José and became Joe. About a week after doing so he says that his inbox was full. Nothing else was changed in his resume and it showed that employers were judging him just based on his name alone. I guess the name Joe just sounds a little more “whitewashed.”

Applying for jobs online seems like the perfect way for employers not to judge you based on how you look, but it has been shown in some studies that this is exactly the opposite. One study even found that applicants with white-sounding names received 50 percent more callbacks than applicants with black-sounding names. To quote Zamora from the video below, “Sometimes I don’t even think people know or are conscious or aware that they’re judging, even if it’s by name, but I think we do it all the time.”","2014-09-05 03:09:38","1","19.0","4.0","9.0","1.0","15.0","0.0","46.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","322","50.01","79.90","22.46","25.77","18.94","16.15","91.30","54.97","16.77","9.01","0.93","0.31","0.93","5.59","1.24","7.76","5.59","13.66","7.76","6.21","6.83","2.17","16.46","4.66","2.48","1.55","2.48","2.80","1.24","0.62","0.62","0.00","0.31","0.31","14.60","0.00","0.31","0.00","6.21","16.15","3.73","2.17","1.24","4.66","1.86","4.35","4.97","2.17","2.17","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.04","0.31","0.00","3.11","0.62","0.00","7.14","7.45","0.62","14.29","2.48","6.83","6.21","6.52","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.31","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.31","0.00","10.87","5.28","2.17","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.62","1.24","1.55","0.00","0.00","1368","7.03","20.5","413","321","17","77.67","9.6","7.1","8.41","8.9","50","8.8","15.790529595015578","198","19.0","4","0.51","0","12","7","24","0","47","15","1","1","3","37","17","0","17","2","0","27","9","22","1","0","2","8","0","9","23","12","6","12","9","1","0","0","4"
"http://dailybuzzlive.com/government-admits-fake-vaccine-operation-gather-dna-public/","Government Admits To Fake Vaccine Operation To Gather DNA From Public","Government Admits To Fake Vaccine Operation To Gather DNA From Public. The White House has officially admitted they carried out a scheme in the Middle East during their free vaccination programs. They were not giving free vaccinations at all. What they were doing was stealing DNA samples from the public as part of the so-called “war on terror.” The DNA was used to identify suspected terrorists who would then be targeted to be killed by the United States. According to The Guardian, “CIA agents recruited a senior Pakistani doctor to organize a vaccine drive in Abbottabad, even starting the “project” in a poorer part of town to make it look more authentic.” As the New York Times reported in 2011, “In the months before Osama bin Laden was killed, the Central intelligence agency ran a phony vaccination program in Abbottabad, Pakistan, as a ruse to obtain DNA evidence from members of Bin Laden’s family thought to be holed up in an expansive compound there.” In case you’re wondering how a vaccination program could harvest DNA, it’s a pretty simple process. The Guardian explains, “Nurses were trained to withdrawal some blood in the needle after administering the drug.” well, if it makes you feel better the White House has stated it will no longer use fake vaccination programs as a tactic in “war on terror.” That we, the American people, and the rest of the world can now trust this promise… that they will no longer harvest the DNA of our children.

So, do you trust that promise? Could the US vaccination scheme be used to gather DNA on Americans? It is really no longer an outlandish question. The White House has already admitted to doing it on foreign soil. So how do we know that the same thing has not been, or will not be, conducted on US soil and aimed at Americans? Most Americans have already accepted the fact that injections and vaccinations are a requirement. We cannot enroll our children in most school without vaccinations, when flu season comes around most of us rush out for that yearly flu shot. So as long as a DNA harvesting campaign is framed in the language of “public health,” resistance will be virtually nonexistent. For example, there has not been one polio outbreak for over 35 years in the United States. But every year Americans are still being vaccinated against the polio disease. Flu shots have scientifically been proven to have almost zero efficacy and accomplish nothing in nearly 99 out of 100 people who receive them. Also the CDC openly admits flu shot still contain toxic mercury, a documented neurotoxin heavy metal that destroys brain tissue. Even still, the majority of Americans received that shot every year.

It turns out that the best defense against infection diseases are:","2014-06-30 21:55:25","1","19.0","6.0","9.0","0.0","16.0","0.0","47.0","20.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","469","85.73","75.26","39.49","22.47","18.76","21.54","81.24","49.25","8.10","3.62","0.00","1.71","0.64","0.00","1.28","4.48","9.17","14.71","9.38","5.12","4.69","2.13","14.29","6.61","4.26","1.28","1.28","2.56","5.76","2.77","2.99","0.64","1.07","0.00","9.17","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","11.09","3.20","1.49","0.85","2.56","1.71","2.56","1.28","0.85","0.00","0.43","3.41","0.43","2.99","0.00","0.00","8.32","2.56","0.85","3.84","0.85","1.07","4.05","8.74","1.07","14.50","1.71","8.32","4.90","3.84","0.43","0.85","0.64","0.00","0.85","0.21","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.00","13.43","4.69","4.05","0.21","0.00","0.64","0.00","0.21","2.99","0.64","0.00","0.00","2203","7.84","23.6","691","468","25","60.95","11.7","9.4","10.85","10.8","97","7.25","17.770598290598294","273","21.1","12","0.46","0","6","6","50","0","56","21","1","4","8","76","41","8","18","0","0","19","3","35","3","0","5","13","0","23","14","10","21","11","13","1","3","0","3"
"http://dailybuzzlive.com/farmers-monitoring-cows-digestion-windows-sides/","Farmers Monitoring Cows Digestion With ‘Windows’ In Their Sides","Farmers Monitoring Cows Digestion With ‘Windows’ In Their Sides.

Farmers and researchers have fit several cows with cannulas on their sides. Cannulas are holes that are cut directly into the cows digestive track in order to see how food is being processed.

They say that monitoring the energy efficiency of cows helps improve farming methods as well as the environment. Animal rights activists have criticized the activity, calling it cruel and inhumane.

Once the cannula is surgically placed on the cows side, they are sent to graze for a period of time and then examined.

In order to do the examination, farmers must removed the plug and manually reach in to pull out the grass and oat mixture from the cows rumen.

The grass is then separated from the liquid by being squeezed out through a strainer, which then allows the researchers to analyze the contents.

Farmers and researchers claim that the cows feel no pain when being examined. They say the cows are anesthetized during the surgical procedure and are not at all uncomfortable.

They also claim that the cows have a longer lifespan due to the care that they are given.

"http://dailybuzzlive.com/dna-proved-hes-father-courts-say-still-owes-30000-back-child-support/","DNA Proved He’s Not The Father, But Courts Say He Still Owes $30,000 In Back Child Support","DNA Proved He’s Not The Father, But Courts Say He Still Owes $30,000 In Back Child Support.

A court DNA test proved that Carnell Alexander is not the father, even the mother now agrees he is not the father. However, a court is still demanding that Alexander pay over $30,000 in back child support.

The state of Michigan is giving him a choice, pay the $30,000 or go to prison. These are the only two choices he has, even though everyone involved in the story, including a paternity test, the child’s mother and the court, recognize that the baby is not his.

“I feel like I’m standing in front of a brick wall with nowhere to go,” Alexander told Detroit news station WXYZ.

Alexander told the news station that he learned about a paternity case against him in the early 90’s after a police officer called him a deadbeat dad during a traffic stop. The officer also informed him that there was a warrant out for his arrest for unpaid child support.

“I knew I did not have a child, so I was kind of blown back,” Alexander said.

Alexander has been fighting since then to clear his name, with little success. Here is how it went down: the state claims that, in 1987, Alexander fathered a baby. The state also claims that it sent several notices to an address on file and that Alexander ignored these notices. Alexander says that he never got the notices because they were sent to an address where he no longer lived. When he heard about the child, he went to court.

“And when I was telling them in court that it was not my child, they told me it was too late to get a DNA test,” Alexander told reporters.

At the time, Alexander didn’t know the location of the woman who claimed he was the father of the child, and with only sporadic work, lacking a full-time job, he had no money.

He eventually ran into a friend who knew where the mom was, and they got a DNA test. The test proved that Alexander had a 0% probability of being the child’s father. According to the woman, the child’s actual father was also in the child’s life.

Alexander took all of this information to the court, but the judge was unfazed.

“Case closed. I got a pay for the baby,” Alexander told WXYZ.

According to the new station, the court hinged its decision on a summons that was reportedly delivered to Alexander’s father’s house informing him about the paternity case. The process server for the court turned in a document claiming that Alexander was served a summons but refused to sign it.

“I wasn’t there. I couldn’t refuse to sign,” Alexander said.

WXYZ investigated Alexander’s claims and found that on the date the server claimed he served the document, Alexander was serving time at the Michigan Department of Corrections for a crime he committed as a young man.

So how did this happen? Years ago, Alexander’s ex-, had a baby. She did not know who the father was, but she knew she needed help caring for the child. When she applied for welfare, her caseworker told her that she needed to name the father in order to receive assistance.

“That was the only way I could get assistance,” the woman said. She said she had no idea that the state would go after Alexander for child support. “Everything is my fault that I put him through,” she said.

She even asked the court to forgive his debt, and they did, but only the portion that was to be awarded to her. Alexander still owes around $30,000. Alexander is refusing to pay and he is being threatened with jail time.

“We know this is not my child, so let’s do what we need to do, what’s right,” said Alexander.","2014-10-30 17:29:59","0","34.0","22.0","9.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","45.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","652","68.76","88.70","10.57","42.47","17.16","17.02","83.74","54.60","14.88","9.20","2.30","0.46","0.00","5.67","0.77","5.67","11.50","10.89","7.98","6.13","4.60","2.45","17.64","1.69","0.77","1.84","1.84","0.31","2.15","1.53","0.61","0.15","0.31","0.00","19.33","3.22","0.31","2.76","6.13","9.82","3.68","0.61","1.07","0.46","1.69","2.91","1.69","0.15","1.38","0.15","0.77","0.00","0.77","0.00","0.00","6.90","0.77","0.46","4.45","1.23","0.61","9.66","6.90","0.31","11.35","1.84","5.37","4.60","3.37","0.00","0.46","1.38","0.00","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","18.56","5.67","6.60","0.15","0.00","0.15","0.00","0.31","2.45","2.45","0.00","0.77","2763","6.46","17.57894736842105","829","647","37","79.09","8.5","6.6","8.58","8.6","80","8.9","13.945904173106648","275","15.89","19","0.52","0","14","12","82","0","71","21","0","0","2","137","42","0","10","0","0","54","11","31","1","0","1","20","0","22","72","14","7","8","19","3","5","0","7"

"http://dailybuzzlive.com/mike-brown-autopsy-released-showing-shot-6-times/","Mike Brown Autopsy Released, Showing He Was Shot 6 Times","Mike Brown Autopsy Released, Showing He Was Shot 6 Times. The execution of Mike Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was killed by police officers, has been sparking protests around the nation since his death on August 9. According to The New York Times, his autopsy was released on Sunday that shows he was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. The medical examiner’s report states that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting that his head was in a downward position when it struck him and caused his fatal injury, according to Dr. Michael M Baden, the former Chief Medical Examiner for the city of New York, who flew to Missouri on Sunday at the family’s request to conduct a separate autopsy. Brown, 18, was shot four times in the right arm, which indicated that all the bullets were fired into his front. The bullets do not appear to have been shot from close range because there was no gunpowder residue present on his body. However, Dr. Baden did not have access to his clothing to determine whether or not gunshot residue existed there.

Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr said on Sunday that the Justice Department would conduct its own autopsy due to the “extraordinary circumstances involved in the case and at the request of the Brown family.” The preliminary autopsy results have finally brought the family and the community the many unanswered questions they’ve been waiting for since Mike Brown’s death on August 9. The police department has come under harsh criticism since then for refusing to clarify the circumstances of the shooting and for responding to protest with military style operational gear. “People have been asking how many times was he shot? This information could have been released on day one,” Dr. Baden said in an interview after performing the autopsy. “They don’t do that, even as feelings build up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.”

Dr. Baden said while Mike Brown was shot at least six times, only three bullets were recovered from his body. Baden has not yet seen the x-ray showing where the bullets were found, which would clarify the autopsy results. Nor has he had access to witness and police statements. Dr. Baden provided a diagram of the entry wounds, and noted that six shots produced numerous wounds. Some of the bullets entered and exited several times, including one that left at least five different wounds. “This one here looks like his head was bent downward,” she said, indicating the wound at the top of Mr. Brown’s head. “It can be because he’s giving up, or because he’s charging forward at the officer.” He stressed that this information does not assign blame or justify the shooting.","2014-08-18 16:11:59","0","17.0","5.0","9.0","0.0","15.0","0.0","47.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","471","87.09","67.97","22.97","8.19","21.41","23.35","81.10","47.13","8.92","4.46","0.00","0.21","0.00","3.82","0.42","4.46","8.92","13.38","9.13","2.76","4.46","1.70","12.95","3.82","2.12","1.70","3.18","1.70","2.34","0.42","1.91","0.21","1.06","0.00","8.92","0.42","0.00","0.21","3.61","9.13","2.55","2.55","0.85","1.49","0.21","2.76","3.82","2.55","0.85","0.42","3.40","1.91","1.70","0.00","0.00","5.31","0.85","0.64","3.82","0.42","0.00","7.43","4.88","0.42","15.92","1.27","8.92","6.16","2.55","0.42","0.42","0.00","0.00","2.55","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.07","5.73","4.67","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.00","0.42","2.12","1.91","0.00","0.00","2189","7.6","25.263157894736842","675","469","24","68.6","12.2","8.5","10.73","11.1","89","12.125","17.390618336886995","247","22.95","2","0.46","0","10","14","48","1","60","26","0","3","4","61","54","0","26","1","0","14","10","16","0","0","2","12","0","16","33","17","20","9","12","3","2","0","3"

Now-a-days everyone wants to go green and help safe the environment.

They also want to have an energy source that is renewable and clean. Well this couple may have figured out a way to make sustainable living a real reality.

What did they do to make this possible? Well they invented something amazing which they refer to as Solar Freaking Roadways.

This technology would replace every roadways, sidewalks, recreation areas, parking lots, etc. with solar panels. Now these solar panels won’t be boring solar panels either.

They will have micro processing units and LED’s that can be programmed to create patterns on the surfaces of the hexagonal shaped pieces. Yeah that’s another thing too, these solar panels are comprised of different hexagonal pieces that interlock together.

Now let me tell you what both of those things mean: First it means that we won’t have to repaint any roadways or recreational areas ever and secondly it means that is a piece of the road gets cracked or becomes unresponsive all you have to do is change out a piece of the road instead of paving the whole thing over.

This would greatly decrease traffic congestion and make visibility a lot better at night. Now that’s just the smaller plus side.

The biggest benefit of course is the fact that they are solar panels. If every roadway was replaced with solar panels we would produce three times the amount of energy that we use per year.

That would replace our need for all fossil fuels, including gasoline. Car companies could make cars that would be charged by these roadways as you drive or even in your driveway when your at home.

The video below goes into even greater detail about how these could change everything. So check it out below and if you like the idea check out the Indiegogo campaign that is trying to get this initiative off the ground.","2014-05-27 20:30:18","0","28.0","6.0","9.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","46.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","330","52.29","71.76","30.14","76.23","16.50","18.79","84.24","53.64","16.36","5.15","0.30","1.21","1.82","0.00","1.82","11.21","6.67","12.12","10.91","5.15","5.45","0.61","16.67","4.24","2.42","1.52","0.61","5.15","3.94","3.33","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","6.36","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.36","2.12","3.94","3.94","3.64","2.42","2.42","0.61","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.61","0.00","0.61","0.00","0.00","6.67","1.82","1.52","2.12","1.52","0.30","0.61","12.42","1.52","16.97","3.03","10.30","3.64","1.21","0.91","0.61","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.21","0.30","0.00","0.30","0.61","0.00","10.61","5.76","2.12","0.30","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.61","0.00","1.52","0.00","0.00","1526","7.72","16.75","450","328","20","71.75","9.9","7.3","10.38","9.5","68","4.0","16.852682926829267","204","15.3","1","0.47","0","10","1","41","1","33","22","3","1","10","44","12","0","25","0","0","17","3","16","0","0","3","9","0","27","5","8","6","14","12","8","2","0","2"
"http://dailybuzzlive.com/man-gets-arrested-aggressively-mopping-floor/","Man Gets Arrested For “Aggressively Mopping” Floor","Man Gets Arrested For “Aggressively Mopping” Floor. There sure are a lot of weird things to get arrested for, but I think that this one has to take the cake.

A man named John Thornton, 30, visited the Double Tree Hotel in Bristol, Connecticut on Monday night and got aggressive with an employee of the hotel. Why you might ask? It seems as though Thornton didn’t like the way she was mopping the floor.

Thornton eventually grabbed the mop from the woman and began “mopping aggressively” according to police. Even though the floor was clean, the cops still arrested the man for breach of peace.

According to investigators, the 27-year-old employee was mopping the floor when all of a sudden Thornton became “unruly” and grabbed the mop.

He then began to become more and more aggressive with not only his mopping, but also the woman. Thornton had ignored the woman telling thin to stop mopping and instead backed her into a corner.

Clearly the victim was shaken and crying when the police arrived and she told them that she wished to press charges against the unruly man.

Only being charged with breach of peace the police detained Thornton and put him in the squad car where he began threatening the officers. This ultimately led to a second charge of second-degree threatening.

Thornton posted his $20,000 bond and must appear in court on October 27.","2014-10-16 21:39:14","0","21.0","4.0","9.0","0.0","13.0","0.0","45.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","238","87.78","70.77","18.16","1.76","17.00","19.33","83.61","48.32","7.56","5.04","0.42","0.00","0.42","3.78","0.42","2.52","11.34","12.18","5.04","6.72","7.56","0.84","15.13","3.78","1.26","1.68","3.78","2.10","6.30","1.68","4.62","1.26","2.52","0.42","9.66","0.00","0.42","2.94","3.78","9.24","1.68","0.84","0.84","1.68","1.68","3.36","1.68","0.42","0.00","1.26","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.42","6.72","0.42","0.00","4.20","1.68","1.26","7.98","4.20","1.26","14.71","2.52","5.88","6.30","2.52","0.84","0.84","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.29","5.46","3.36","0.00","0.00","0.42","0.00","1.26","2.52","0.84","0.00","0.42","1084","7.23","17.071428571428573","327","234","14","71.44","10.1","7.4","10.44","9.7","41","6.142857142857143","15.688547008547008","148","15.93","2","0.44","0","11","5","29","0","26","12","1","0","2","37","18","0","5","0","0","11","2","13","1","0","0","8","0","8","21","11","7","3","3","0","0","0","4"
"http://dailybuzzlive.com/new-law-gives-weed-poor-berkeley-ca/","New Law Gives Weed To The Poor In Berkeley, CA","New Law Gives Weed To The Poor In Berkeley, CA. Starting next summer, a California city will be offering a unique benefit for low-income residents. What’s the benefit you ask? Free marijuana! This will be available to residents of Berkeley that make less than $32,000 per year, or $46,000 per family per year.



Although you may be jumping for joy, there’s only one stipulation. You have to have your prescription for medical marijuana, aka medical marijuana card. Have that though and you will be able to get it for free from any of the dispensaries operating within the city. This is due to a law that was unanimously passed by the city council, in which all dispensaries must set aside 2 percent of their pot for distribution to the poor. Sounds like a sweet deal right? Not everyone is on board with the plan however.



Bishop Ron Allen, who is the head of the International Faith Based Coalition, told Fox News, “It’s ludicrous, over-the-top madness.” He continues, “Why would Berkeley City Council want to keep their poverty-stricken, under-served high, in poverty, and lethargic?” Even so many supporters argue that marijuana is looked at as medicine in the state of California and poor people shouldn’t be kept away from it due to lack of funds. Darryl Moore, who is one of the council members who passed the law says, “Basically, the city council want to make sure that low-income, homeless, indigent folk have access to their medical marijuana, their medicine.”



Even the mayor of Berkeley had something to say about the issue, “There are some truly compassionate cases that need to have medical marijuana, but it’s expensive. You hear stories about people dying from cancer who don’t have the money.”



Some dispensaries already do this sort of compassionate giving. Sean Luse who is the chief operating officer of Berkeley Patients Group dispensary says, “We do this on our own, so we certainly welcome the city mandating all dispensaries create these sorts of programs.” She did however add that she feels one percent rather than two percent would be a more appropriate target. Well either way, it’s a law now. So we’ll see how this all plays out.","2014-09-07 00:58:27","0","25.0","4.0","9.0","0.0","16.0","0.0","47.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","374","72.73","86.93","3.92","79.41","17.00","20.59","85.29","47.86","11.76","4.55","0.00","1.07","1.60","0.80","1.07","7.22","6.68","13.64","10.43","5.61","3.74","0.80","17.38","4.81","2.41","2.41","2.41","4.01","6.68","4.81","1.87","0.00","0.53","0.53","12.30","0.27","0.00","0.53","0.27","10.70","0.27","1.60","2.41","2.14","2.14","2.94","2.41","0.53","1.34","0.27","3.21","0.27","2.67","0.00","0.27","9.89","2.67","1.07","4.81","1.34","0.27","2.41","12.30","1.60","10.43","0.80","6.68","2.94","3.48","2.41","0.80","3.21","0.53","0.27","0.27","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.27","0.00","20.05","4.81","7.22","0.00","0.00","0.80","0.27","1.60","2.67","2.14","0.00","0.53","1713","7.26","22.470588235294116","531","366","21","62.27","11.9","8.9","11.02","10.5","64","6.357142857142857","15.954535519125683","229","20.18","1","0.46","0","5","9","38","0","45","29","1","0","7","56","33","0","19","0","0","16","6","20","1","0","1","12","0","16","9","7","6","18","14","4","6","0","2"
"http://dailybuzzlive.com/ebola-patients-transferred-fema-camps-georgia/","Ebola Patients Transferred To FEMA Camps In Georgia – Get Ready, It’s Coming","Ebola Patients Transferred To FEMA Camps In Georgia. Get Ready, It’s Coming

We have all heard about the FEMA Camps, the Georgia Coffins and Georgia Guidestones. We have seen pictures and videos on the internet and have read all sorts of things about them.

However, many people just consider these reports rumors or conspiracy theories. But when the nation’s condition moves beyond having only a few victims to tens of thousands of victims, isolation will quickly turn to quarantine. Currently, there is legislation sweeping the country attempting to make vaccinations mandatory to hold a job or avoid being quarantined. Federal authorities believe that about 65% will voluntarily show up to various public venues, such as schools, and willingly take the vaccine. DHS estimates that about 35% of the country will resist taking the coming vaccines and that enforcement mechanisms will be instituted.

The spread of Ebola will devastate the health care system. If one Ebola patient shows up at a hospital emergency room, that one patient potentially has the ability to get the entire hospital shut down and quarantined. Healthcare workers will quickly try to prevent Ebola victims from coming to the hospitals, by pushing them out into FEMA camps.

When Ebola strikes in massive numbers here in The US, the changes in the handling of Ebola patients has already been planned for through a series of legal action since 2003. The Executive Order, entitled Revised List of Quarantinable Communicable Diseases allows for the “apprehension, detention, or conditional release of individuals to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of suspected communicable diseases.”

On a Fox news panel discussion program Outnumbered, Stacy Dash expressed what government officials want as well, “I think they should set up special centers just for Ebola in each state. They shouldn’t be letting people go to regular hospitals, where it could be spread. For this specific disease we should have a special facility with specially trained people in each city. That way it’s not spread, and when the person walks in, they know what they’re looking for, they know if they find it, they know how to contain it. And they know how not to infect themselves.”

What Dash just described are FEMA camps. They are already in place, we have tried to warn you. Around the United States has millions of FEMA coffins being stored. Is the Ebola virus pandemic a weapon of mass distraction? Are you prepared? TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY!

You can’t hide from cops with license plate scanners. Police across the United States are using automatic cameras to read and snap digital photos of millions of license plate to help solve crimes, serve warrants and collect delinquent child support.

License plate scanners are “in effect, government location tracking systems recording the movements of millions of innocent Americans in huge databases,” said ACLU staff attorney Catherine Crump. “This is a way to track all Americans all the time, regardless of whether they are accused of any wrongdoing,” said Crump. “The most widespread location tracking technology you’ve probably ever heard of.”

The ACLU reports that the cameras are located in 38 states and the District of Columbia. The plate scanners generally are mounted on the rear fender trunk or roof of police cars and parking enforcement vehicles.

Some also are mounted on road signs, toll gates and bridges. The plate data includes a specific location and can be, via a separate police inquiry, correlated to personal data in the state motor vehicles registration records. Police say the devices are effective at finding stolen vehicles and cutting auto theft rates.

However, if you have a warrant or a owe back pay child support this is definitely a cause of concern for you. You will be pulled over and immediately detained, booked and jailed. In most states, delinquent child support warrants are “No bail warrants”, and you may be held indefinitely until funds are provided to the custodial parent.

We live in a society where people will brag they have 4000 friends, spend all day talking about their day in posts, telling their “friends” how much they “like” what they said and posting photos of what they ate for dinner.

But yet they communicate all of this without ever opening their mouth, or being in the presence of a single person. For some it’s done behind closed doors, in a state of complete loneliness.

You text “I love you” to a loved one without them ever hearing your voice, you fall in love with people you have never seen. It’s a soulless connection.

No way to hear the truth, pain, empathy or frustration in someone’s voice, the true connection has been lost. All of this technology we have is just an illusion, when you step away from this fantasy world you have created, for some they are just alone.

Look Up is a film about social media and how it has stripped our lives of the true emotion and reality that we face every day.

Written and performed by Gary Turk, is a lesson taught to us about the amount of time we spend trying to connect with people who aren’t really there. The true result of us spending the majority of our time on social media, is that we are spending our time alone.

NBC’s coverage of “Life in the US in 10 years time” gives an eerie prediction of what it will be like for Americans, as each and every one of us will be micro-chipped by 2017.

They say it will be used as a high-tech device to help identify individuals immediately. It will help answer one question, “Am I who I say I am?”

Many companies and devices already use retina scans and fingerprint scans to identify individuals. But that was just a buildup to the real tracking device the government wants to implant in all Americans by 2017.

In some states, people are fighting against this process fearing that RFID micro-chipping will give the government too much power to control the American people.

Think about it, if you have this implanted into your body the government will know where you are at all times, what you purchase, where you live, who you are with and what your day-to-day activities are.

There is nothing that you do that will be hidden.

The RFID microchip section in the ObamaCare law is located in Bill HR 4872 and located on page 1014 under the National Medical Device Registry.

It describes a Class II device that is implantable and is now legally enforceable after the passing of this law.

After hearing a Reno bar was flying a Mexican flag over an American flag, an angered U.S. Army Veteran took matters into his own hands.

He drove to the bar and cut down the flags in front of a stunned group of Hispanic patrons.

The U.S. Constitutional code prohibits raising the flag of any other nation above the American flag.

Broussard pulled up his truck to the Cantina El Jaripeo near downtown Reno, cut the rope that anchored the flags and pulled them down from the makeshift flag pole. He left the Mexican flag on the ground, with the U.S. Flag in hand.

When the cameras stopped rolling, eyewitnesses say Broussard came back and started shouting that Obama was the anti-Christ and that this was all his fault.

Buildings in Ferguson, Missouri burn as riots follow the Grand Jury decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson for the murder of Michael Brown.

Firefighters are trying to extinguish the many fires that have been set by protesters furious and disappointed about the decision that was announced on November 24, freeing officer Wilson of any further charges.

Officers have warned they will not hesitate to use deadly force on any protesters unwilling to comply with their orders. Deadly force according to the Code of Federal Regulations, means that force which a reasonable person would consider likely to cause death or serious bodily harm. It’s use under this code they will justify their actions of extreme necessity, without first using lesser means.

Officers will have their choice of which weapon they will use for whatever situations they may face without fear of being prosecuted. They have been given authority to use whatever measures they deem appropriate, taking protesters dead or alive. They will be armed with rubber bullets, wooden bullets, tasers, pepper spray, tear gas and of course hand guns and assault rifles.

Advice from authorities is “either stay home or act right.”

Video footage taken shows the violence happening right, now not only in Missouri, but across the country as people react to the decision.

"http://dailybuzzlive.com/rent-baby-newest-government-funded-program/","‘Rent-A-Baby’ – The Newest Government Funded Program","‘Rent-A-Baby’ – The Newest Government Funded Program.

A new government funded program allows couples to “rent” babies before deciding whether to have a child of their own. The newborns are taken from publicly funded homes for unwed mothers shortly after birth and placed into the homes of married adults.

Here’s how it works: For $5000, couples get to rent a baby for up to eight weeks. The couple can renew the lease or the baby is returned and sent to another couple for the same length of time. Most babies will live with six different couples during their first year, at which time they can be put up for permanent adoption. The $5000 rental fee goes to the unwed mothers’ homes.

“There are thousands of young, double income couples who are undecided about what they want to do with their lives,” says Dr. Audrey Hollings, a psychologist who helped pioneer the program, known as the Parental Skills Training Project (PSTP). “PSTP offers couples (straight or gay) an opportunity to see, firsthand, what caring for a baby involves and it allows them to make an informed choice. Another plus is that it supports badly needed homes that are for unwed mothers who would otherwise have no place to go.”

Single women who can prove they are financially solvent, can also rent a baby. “It works great because you can take the baby during the week and give it back on the weekends when you want to go out with your friends,” said Mindy Walton of Chicago.

“PSTP has its critics, and I’m one of them,” said child psychologist Dr. Thomas Westmore. “PSTP is not accepted by everyone who cares about children. It’s placing money over the welfare of our nation’s kids. No child should be in the home of a couple who is not 100% sure they want one. And it is disgraceful to simply rent a baby to anyone who can afford the price. Babies are highly impressionable in those early months. They form a mental imprint and believe these people are their parents. To tear them away as often as six times in one year is nothing short of abuse.”

But Dr. Hollings and her fellow supporters of PSTP say it’s better than putting the babies in orphanages or foster care while they’re waiting to be adopted. In just one month since its inception, PSTP has generated more than $1 million and childcare professionals in Australia, Great Britain, and Canada are looking to adopt the program.

What do you think? Is Rent-A-Baby a good idea or not?

Previously we brought you a story that alerted consumers that 3 out of 4 gas pumps in America are rigged to give you LESS than what you are paying for. We Now Have PROOF!

A Las Vegas man, James Hern, posted a video this week as he was attempting to fill his gas tank at an AM/PM gas station. The gas station is located in North Las Vegas on the corner of Ann Rd and 5Th St.

Hern paid for his gas, lifted the nozzle and before he could even put it in to his gas tank, the meter started moving. That’s when he began filming the incident.

His Facebook Post noted, “All my friends please watch. Tha f*ck is this? SMH don’t use AMPM on Ann and 5th.”

The bill went over $10.00 and he did not even pump one drop of gas in to his tank.

Have you ever noticed that their stories are all the same?

Since the concept of journalism began, governments have liked to control some of the processes that go into reporting.

When someone gets caught breaking into your house and you have them at gunpoint, I’m sure you expect a little pleading or begging to let them go or not to shoot. This Florida man tried to bargain with the people he attempted to steal from, but it wasn’t your typical kind of trade. He offered to mow their lawn if they’d let him go.



25-year-old Bryan Remley broke into a couple’s house in St. Petersburg, Florida on August 28. He was caught rummaging through the living room by 31-year-old Joseph Cihak. Cihak had gotten up at around 4:30 a.m. to use the restroom when he found Remley. He conveniently had his gun on him because both him and his wife, Colleen Traversa, always take a handgun with them if they leave the bedroom at night. Once spotted, Remley charged at Cihak and two shots were fired. At this time Traversa was calling the police.



They held Remley there at gunpoint until the police arrived. Within that time though, Remley tried to bargain with the couple, saying that he would cut their grass if they would just let him escape. Clearly the two refused and Remley, since he was carrying a small knife on him at the time, was charged with armed residential burglary and violation of probation.","2014-09-07 22:43:36","0","18.0","4.0","9.0","0.0","15.0","0.0","47.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","233","69.64","88.51","14.27","6.59","15.53","17.17","79.40","51.07","15.02","12.45","0.43","0.00","1.72","6.44","3.86","2.58","6.01","14.59","7.73","3.00","7.30","0.86","15.88","0.86","0.00","0.86","3.43","0.86","2.58","0.43","2.15","0.00","0.43","0.43","15.88","0.43","0.00","0.43","6.87","9.44","0.43","1.29","3.00","3.43","1.29","4.29","0.43","0.00","0.43","0.00","0.43","0.00","0.43","0.00","0.00","7.30","0.43","0.86","3.86","1.72","0.43","7.30","3.86","0.86","18.88","3.86","8.58","6.44","2.15","0.00","2.15","1.72","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.02","6.87","4.29","0.43","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.72","0.00","1.72","0.00","0.00","1007","7.3","18.307692307692307","303","228","15","81.43","8.2","5.7","8.87","7.9","42","5.785714285714286","15.44842105263158","152","17.38","1","0.48","0","8","7","18","0","34","11","0","0","2","33","25","0","3","0","0","23","6","6","0","0","1","8","0","14","18","6","4","6","2","0","0","0","2"

Republican Joe Barton, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, grilled Cheryl Campbell, Senior Vice President of CGI Federal. This is the company that built the Obama Care Health Insurance Exchange Website.

Barton questioned Campbell on hidden language in the source code on the site that says applicants have “no reasonable expectation of privacy.”

Barton showed Campbell an image of the website coding that included this warning, and she confirmed that she knew it was there. However, she insisted that in developing the site the way it did, her company was simply following “a set of rules and regulations” sent out under their contract by the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services.

“This is the part of the sign-up that is hidden,” said Barton. “The applicant does not see this, but it is in the source code, and what the blue highlighted area that’s been circled in red says is: ‘You have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transmitting or stored on this information system.'”

The HIPPA privacy rule “establishes national standards to protect individuals medical records and other personal health information and applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically.” Barton said, “If that is designed to protect the patient’s privacy, and this explicitly says in order to continue, you have to accept this condition that you have no privacy, or no reasonable expectation of privacy.”","2014-07-22 20:33:34","0","24.0","8.0","9.0","1.0","14.0","0.0","47.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","253","78.43","66.81","7.26","55.58","25.30","30.04","77.87","46.25","12.25","3.16","0.00","0.00","1.19","1.58","0.40","9.09","7.51","11.46","6.72","1.58","5.93","1.98","12.65","2.77","0.00","0.40","0.00","1.19","2.77","1.98","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","8.30","0.00","0.00","1.58","0.00","11.07","3.56","2.37","1.98","2.37","1.19","3.16","5.14","3.16","1.98","0.00","2.77","0.00","2.77","0.00","0.00","5.53","0.79","0.40","3.16","0.00","1.19","4.35","7.91","1.58","9.09","0.79","7.11","0.79","4.35","0.00","0.40","1.19","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","17.00","3.95","5.93","0.40","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.40","5.14","1.19","0.00","0.00","1308","9.34","31.875","409","252","10","45.9","15.6","13.1","14.34","16.6","71","6.833333333333333","23.349841269841274","153","26.75","3","0.46","0","13","0","34","0","26","12","0","0","0","44","37","0","14","0","0","10","1","6","0","0","2","5","0","5","16","4","5","5","11","4","1","0","0"
"http://dailybuzzlive.com/hobby-lobby-still-covers-vasectomies-viagra/","Hobby Lobby Still Covers Vasectomies And Viagra","Hobby Lobby Still Covers Vasectomies And Viagra. On Monday the Supreme Court ruled in the favor of the craft store chain Hobby Lobby. They are NOT required to provide the emergency “morning after” pills and intrauterine devices for its workers health insurance plans. Many are yelling ‘Hypocrisy’ as Hobby Lobby has given no indication that it plans to stop helping its male employees obtaining erectile dysfunction treatments such as Viagra. The craft store chain, which is owned by evangelical Christians, now does not have to pay for contraception for its female employees. Apparently it is prohibited by its owner’s religion. However, pills and pumps that help stiffen their male employees is perfectly acceptable to the evangelical Christian craft store owner. This has many people outraged and taking it to social media:

According to Huffington Post, last year a federal court granted Cathlic groups the right to opt out of providing coverage for contraceptives that they equated with abortion or sterilization, such as IUDs and vascectomy. But the groups were happy to flip the bill for treatments that could lead to procreation, such as Viagra. Julie Rovner, a reporter at NPR, wrote a blog post in February 2012 explaining where Catholic groups drew the line on sexual health coverage. “The answer on Viagra coverage is usually yes, Catholic leaders say and they argue that’s neither hypocritical nor sexist. Procreation is something that the Catholic Church encourages. And Viagra and other erectile dysfunction drugs can be of help.”

Although a provision in the Affordable Health Care Act requires corporations to offer insurance plans that meet minimum coverage standards, the owners of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Store, a Pennsylvania wood manufacturer, challenged the provision. They argued that the provision violated their religious freedom. Evangelical Christians have long argued that a pill that could disrupt the first stages of pregnancy amounts to murder. They believe life begins at conception and any disruption of that is equal to an abortion, even pills such as Plan B, Next Choice for Ella. These pills prevent a woman’s ovaries from releasing an egg that could be fertilized after unprotected sex. With all that being said, Hobby lobby has still has not explained why it does not object to covering the cost of its male employees vasectomy. The company has not released any statement as of yet.

There have been awful rumors going around the Internet that Jay-Z has been cheating on his wife Beyoncé with Mya. To Mya the rumors were so ridiculous she chose to ignore them. But when some die-hard fan started making death threats, her manager Mike Killmon, suggested that Mya break her silence. According to New York Daily News, Mya spoke this week and forcefully denied a long-term affair with Jay-Z. “Someone walked up and asked her about it while she was accepting an award at a church,” her manager, Mike Killmon said. “At first it was just ridiculous, but then some die-hard fan started making threats. She really couldn’t care less about the rumors, but she wanted to set the record straight when the after effects started to become troublesome.”

Mya Harrison, the 34-year-old vocalist, decided to speak up when an Instagram follower asked her point blank if she was Jay-Z’s “side chick.” Mya replied, “Never did, never was, never will. I place second to no one, pay my own bills, have my own label, own a management company, rely on God only and respect myself and marriage way too much for nonsense.” Mya blamed “illegitimate, thirsty sources with no facts.”","2014-07-06 02:53:49","0","18.0","4.0","9.0","0.0","15.0","0.0","45.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","218","59.96","79.55","18.39","1.26","18.17","18.35","81.65","43.12","10.09","7.34","1.83","0.00","0.00","5.05","0.46","2.75","5.05","10.55","6.42","6.88","6.42","2.75","15.60","4.13","0.92","1.38","1.83","1.83","6.88","1.83","5.05","0.92","3.67","0.00","15.14","0.92","0.46","5.50","0.46","10.09","1.83","2.29","1.38","1.83","1.83","2.29","2.75","0.00","1.83","0.92","0.46","0.46","0.00","0.00","0.46","10.09","1.83","1.38","6.42","0.46","1.38","8.72","4.59","1.38","16.06","0.92","5.96","8.72","3.21","0.46","0.00","0.92","0.92","2.29","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.39","5.50","7.80","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.67","4.59","1.83","0.00","0.00","961","7.74","24.666666666666668","292","210","12","70.63","10.5","7.8","10.61","10.2","43","7.0","17.19047619047619","149","22.56","5","0.43","0","7","1","16","0","18","18","0","0","1","29","33","1","9","0","0","11","7","10","1","0","2","7","0","10","23","6","2","3","2","1","0","0","3"

Facebook, along with the Drug Enforcement Agency, will be implementing the Facebook Drug Task Force or FDTF designed to arrest those who buy and sell narcotics while using the online social networking site. According to HempBeach.com, it will be monitoring all postings and messages created by its users. Chairman and Chief Executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg spoke with CNN about the FDTF. “The task force was created to keep users of Facebook safe,” Zuckerberg said. “The FDTF will be working directly with the drug enforcement agency and local law enforcement agencies. We are going to put away the bad guys.” Zuckerberg continued to say, “online crime has risen to all time highs. As the world’s number one social networking site I feel it is our job to protect our users from such deadly things as drugs.”

A spokesperson for the DEA told reporters, “I am thrilled. Were going to get all of the drug pushers and dope addicts off Facebook once and for all. The marijuana junkies think they can socialize online with their fellow druggies, well, not on my watch. We are going to read their messages, were going to build cases against them, and were going to put them all in prison. It’s going to be beautiful.” A member of Anonymous, 26-year-old Tom Dwan, spoke with MSNBC about drugs on Facebook. “Everyone should protect themselves by downloading and using TOR, it’s that simple,” Dwan said. “This hides your identity on the Internet. Another suggestion I can make to avoid trouble is, don’t talk about drugs on Facebook. Yes, someone is reading what you are typing. Don’t talk about sketchy stuff unless you don’t mind someone else reading it.” Anonymous is a loosely associated international network of activists and hacktivist entities. Facebook has set up a 24 hour hotline to answer any questions or comments.

Greene stunned her audience and coworkers Sunday night by revealing live, on-air, that she was the owner of the Alaskan Cannabis Club. This club is an organization that connects Medical marijuana cardholders with ‘kush’. Greene announced “As for this job, not that I have a choice, but … f*ck it. I quit.”

Greene says that she would be devoting all of her energy to “fight for freedom and fairness, which begins by legalizing marijuana in Alaska.” She then walks off-camera, leaving the anchor stunned and speechless, stuttering into her next segment.

On Greene’s Indiegogo page, she goes into more detail about her mission, mocking “prohibitionists” who use “fear mongering” tactics and “don’t know how to use Google.” In a Reddit thread, a former employee of Greene’s spoke out against her before deleting this post:







Before Greene’s segment aired, followers of the Alaska cannabis club sent out posts on Twitter and Facebook urging people to tune in. Greene says her station had no idea what she was going to do. In a statement to KTVA, Green explained her decision to quit on-air, “Because I wanted to draw attention to this issue. And the issue is medical marijuana. Ballot Measure 2 is a way to make medical marijuana real. Most patients didn’t know the state didn’t set up the framework to get patients their medicine. If I offended anyone, I apologize, but I am not sorry for the choice I made.” KTVA says Greene has been “terminated.” CLICK HERE —> TO LIKE DAILY BUZZ LIVE ON FACEBOOK!","2014-09-23 18:38:20","0","26.0","9.0","9.0","1.0","16.0","0.0","48.0","14.0","0.0","74.0","0.0","10.0","5","289","81.48","69.82","28.81","15.95","16.06","21.45","78.89","45.33","14.19","7.96","2.77","0.00","0.69","4.15","0.35","6.23","5.19","14.53","5.88","1.04","4.50","2.08","16.96","4.50","2.42","2.08","0.35","1.73","4.15","1.38","2.08","0.35","1.04","0.35","12.11","0.00","0.35","4.15","0.00","11.07","4.15","2.08","1.04","1.04","0.69","2.77","4.15","0.69","3.46","0.00","2.77","0.00","2.77","0.00","0.00","5.19","2.08","1.04","1.73","0.35","0.00","4.50","10.73","0.69","13.15","1.73","7.27","3.81","2.08","4.50","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.69","0.00","0.69","0.00","0.00","0.00","24.22","6.23","6.23","0.35","0.00","0.00","0.35","1.04","6.23","2.77","0.00","1.04","1306","8.04","22.76923076923077","410","288","17","71.24","10.3","7.5","10.44","9.8","65","7.416666666666666","17.78777777777778","190","20.69","21","0.47","0","8","1","22","1","33","13","1","1","1","50","43","0","11","0","0","17","8","4","0","0","4","10","0","12","14","7","3","12","13","2","4","0","1"

In a press conference last November, Pres. Obama announced plans for a federally funded program that would be available nationwide for all students in grades K – 12.

This program is designated to educate the American children about the fundamentals of the Muslim religion and Islamic belief. This Muslim outreach program is slated to begin in the 2015/2016 school year.

President Obama explained to FOX News why it was important to him for this Muslim outreach program to be implemented, “The Muslim community deserves our full understanding and respect,” Obama said. “We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11 attacks. These folks are not all bad. In fact, most of them are hard-working citizens just like you and me. I encourage every student in America to participate in your school’s Muslim outreach program. Learn about the Muslim community, the beauty of the Sunnah and the magic of the Qur’an.”

There have been mixed emotions by parents and teachers, and this program is highly debated. A teacher at Starks Elementary School in Louisiana, 35-year-old Paul Warner, told MSNBC he is actually excited about this new federally funded program.

“I think anything a child can learn is good. It will help them overcome false stereotypes that the media has helped portray over the years.”

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/judge-pleaded-special-treatment-dwi-charge-dismissed/","Judge Pleads for Special Treatment for DWI, Shows What a Sham the System Is","In America, if you are part of the “justice” system, you are also above it.

San Antonio, Texas – Last month, a judge who pleaded for special treatment during her DWI arrest had her case dismissed and has been able to keep her job.

As we reported in July of this year, a Texas appeals court judge named Nora Longoria was caught going just over the speed limit while traveling drunk in her Lexus late one evening. When she was pulled over by police she immediately flashed her badge and told them that she was a judge.

She had plainly admitted to drinking at least 5 beers before getting behind the wheel, expecting that her badge would grant her extra rights, specifically the right to drive drunk. It is also important to point out that if she said she had 5, then she probably had 12.

She then pleaded with police not to arrest her, and was almost charged with resisting arrest because she wouldn’t allow them to put handcuffs on her.

Please let me go home. I live a couple of miles away … you are going to ruin my life. I worked hard for 25 years to be where I am today,” she told police.

On November 20th, her pleas were answered by Judge Rolando Cantu of the Hidalgo County Court, when he dismissed her case.

Under reason for dismissal it ironically says: “Other; In the Interest of Justice.”

According to Hidalgo County District Attorney Rene Guerra, there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute because Longoria refused a breathalyzer, and did not “seem drunk” in the video where she was yelling at the arresting officers, refusing to be handcuffed, and telling them that they would have to physically drag her to jail if they wanted to arrest her.

“When looking at the video it doesn’t sound to me like she had slurred speech,” Guerra said.

Ironically, when campaigning for her position, one of her posters read “Our 13th court of appeals covers 20 counties … yet we share common hopes and expectations for our legal system … and for the justices who must rule fairly and impartially on the cases that affect our lives, our livelihood and our future.”

In America, if you are part of the “justice” system, you are also above it. Had Longoria been a struggling mother of three, who was driving slightly over the speed limit after having a beer with friends, not only would she have never beaten the DUI charge, but she could have very well ended up with her face smashed in too.

#Ferguson – some turn protest into street festival, others let their frustration out – raise your voice but not your weapons #MikeBrown — denise reese (@denice_ree) October 12, 2014

Earlier in the day, crowds numbering over 3,000, protested against police brutality downtown St. Louis in a so-called ‘Justice for All’ march and rally.



The huge gathering drew civil rights activists demanding for charges to be brought against a white police officer who killed the unarmed African- American exactly two months ago. The protest comes as a part of the Weekend of Resistance scheduled from Friday through Monday.

Local media reported quite a mixed crowd from the scene, as various groups invited people from all across the nation to join vigils and rallies. Some people travelled hundreds of miles to participate in Saturday’s 12 mile hike from Ferguson, Missouri, to a downtown St. Louis plaza.

Popular Hip-Hop artists like Talib Kweli, dead prez, Jasiri X and others are in the St. Louis area to support the crowd.

“We still are knee deep in this situation,” said Kareem Jackson, a St. Louis rap artist aka Tef Poe. “We have not packed up our bags, we have not gone home. This is not a fly-by-night moment. This is not a made-for-TV revolution. This is real people standing up to a real problem and saying, ‘We ain’t taking it no more.’”

The crowd was significantly larger than the ones seen at Friday’s protests in Ferguson and Clayton, Missouri. On Saturday, many protesters moved to the St. Louis neighbourhood of Shaw where another black 18-year-old, Vonderrit Myers, was shot 17 times and killed by an off-duty St. Louis cop in what police described as a return fire.

Police officers in riot gear were on high alert on Saturday, but no violence was reported during another day of a weekend-long series of rallies against racial law enforcement profiling dubbed #FergusonOctober.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/judge-rules-flashing-lights-warn-drivers-protected-free-speech/","Judge Rules Flashing Lights to Warn Drivers Is Protected Free Speech","April 9, 2014

If you associate the First Amendment more with the rarified air of constitutional debate, or powdered wigs and Colonial days, try thinking in more modern terms — say speed traps and blinking headlights.

For most of us, much of the Bill of Rights comes into play infrequently, if ever. A few examples: According to a 2013 survey, only one in three U.S. households are home to a firearm (Second Amendment). And thankfully, protection in our lifetimes against illegal search and seizure (Fourth) or self-incrimination (Fifth) will be more legal theory rather than active tool.

But the First Amendment — the nation’s “blue collar” amendment — goes to work every day alongside us. We regularly, if not daily, use the freedoms of religion, speech, press, assembly and petition to worship as we will, to speak our minds freely, and to ask our elected leaders to make changes on matters of public interest.

There are disputes over the way we apply those core freedoms, sometimes reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. But at other times, the legal collision and decision are more down-to-earth and closer to home. Case in point, Michael J. Elli challenged a city ordinance in his hometown, Ellisville, Mo., that permitted police to ticket drivers who flashed headlights to warn oncoming motorists approaching a speed trap.

About 2:50 p.m. on Nov. 17, 2012, Elli flashed his headlights after passing police. He was stopped and ticketed. Elli faced a $1,000 fine, and later was warned by a municipal judge about a charge of “obstruction of justice.”

The city dropped the prosecution after Elli pled not guilty, and later said it ordered police not to enforce the law. Nonetheless, Elli proceeded with a federal lawsuit. In early February, U.S. District Judge Henry Autrey issued an order to make certain he stopped the “chilling effect” on citizens exercising their First Amendment right of free speech.

Judge Henry’s ruling makes the important point that Missouri law forbids someone from warning of “impending discovery or apprehension,” but specifically excludes telling someone to comply with the law. In other words, communicating “slow down” is protected speech because it encourages safer driving.

An attorney for Elli from the American Civil Liberties Union, Tony Rothert, told The Wall Street Journal’s Law Blog that there was a higher principle involved, too: With rare exception, the police shouldn’t be stopping or prosecuting people because of the content of their speech.

As it happens, along with headlight warnings, other courts have protected a range of “speech,” from the spoken word to expressive conduct, where government may not prosecute.

While it may be rude to do so, and may well mean a risk of arrest before later exoneration, courts have said people can confront police officers using insulting words, hand and finger gestures to a degree more than they could similarly challenge other “civilians.” In City of Houston v. Hill, in 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court noted “a properly trained officer may reasonably be expected to exercise a greater degree of restraint than the average citizen” to such expressive conduct.

The point is not that courts are encouraging us to be insulting or disrespectful to police or other authorities — rather that government, from the lowest to highest official in the land, cannot override our right to speak freely without presenting good reason rooted in law.

In Houston, Justice William J. Brennan wrote that “the right of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state. … The First Amendment recognizes, wisely we think, that a certain amount of expressive disorder not only is inevitable in a society committed to individual freedom, but must itself be protected if that freedom would survive.”

We traditionally celebrate freedom with fireworks on July 4, Independence Day. Maybe an occasional flick or two of the high-beams is in order, too.

A list obtained by the Washington Post gives a glimpse into the future of Police State USA.

The list details the 155 arrests for ‘crimes’ linked to the protests and the subsequent rioting. Those who’ve been watching this scene unfold through the eyes of the mainstream media would probably think that the overwhelming majority of these arrests are looters. Those people would be wrong.

The majority of arrests are for ‘refusal to disperse,’ 123 people are facing that charge. Only 20 were arrested for burglary or possession of burglary tools; four for unlawful use of a weapon, three for assaulting a police officer, two for trespassing on private property, two for interfering with an officer and one for general disturbance of peace, according to the Washington Post.

The Post points out that these numbers are like understated as they do not take into account the many residents and journalists who have been detained and even jailed, but released. Also, these numbers only include those booked and held in St. Louis County facilities and not who has been put into the other municipal jails.

The first four nights of protest resulted in 30 arrests under the oppression….ahem, control, of the St. Louis County Police Department.

When the Missouri State Police took over on Thursday, Aug. 14, and Cpt. Ron Johnson marched alongside the protesters, only a single arrest was recorded between Thursday and Friday.

Those two days were the exception. Since then the St. Louis County PD announced that they were standing down on stopping the looters and cranked up arrests on protesters.

So @stlcountypd says it pulled its officers from Ferguson Market and allowed looters to have their way. PD told by commanders to not engage — FOX2now (@FOX2now) August 16, 2014

According to the Washington Post, arrests have spiked this week, with 17 on Sunday, 30 on Monday, 47 on Tuesday and 28 already as of 5 p.m. on Wednesday.

Police are seemingly fed up with the protesters. Yesterday a video showed Missouri State Highway patrolman, Ray Albers, who was caught on camera pointing his weapon at journalists and threatening to kill them.

He has since become the first police officer to receive any punishment since the shooting of Brown. He is currently on paid vacation, pending an investigation.","2014-08-21 11:28:47","1","21.0","31.0","5.0","1.0","5.0","0.0","59.0","20.0","0.0","169.0","10.0","14.0","15","387","95.91","62.19","25.53","7.72","16.12","26.10","72.09","44.96","6.72","1.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.78","1.03","4.91","8.79","16.28","6.20","2.33","5.17","0.78","10.85","1.81","0.78","1.03","6.20","1.29","4.13","1.29","2.84","0.78","2.07","0.26","5.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.78","5.68","1.03","1.81","0.52","1.03","0.00","1.81","1.55","1.29","0.26","0.00","0.52","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.26","8.27","0.78","0.78","5.68","0.78","0.78","4.65","6.20","0.52","15.50","1.03","6.98","6.46","2.58","0.78","0.26","1.03","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.99","6.98","5.17","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.52","0.78","0.52","0.78","1868","7.83","20.42105263157895","563","386","24","63.59","11.2","8.4","11.71","10.4","83","7.166666666666666","17.04103626943005","232","18.74","4","0.43","0","14","21","43","0","54","16","0","0","2","40","52","1","33","0","0","6","3","15","0","0","5","8","0","8","18","12","15","10","7","0","4","0","1"
"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/jury-rights-activists-refuse-court-bullies-cops/","Jury Rights Activists Refuse To Back Down To Court Bullies Or Cops. Rights = Flexed","Jury Rights activists in the Philadelphia area recently encountered resistance in front of a local courthouse, when they were attempting to educate their neighbors about jury nullification.

Among the activists was James Babb, an organizer behind the recent push to install jury nullification billboards in cities throughout the US.

For those who don’t know, jury nullification is basically the right for any juror to not only judge the facts of the case, but to also actually judge the validity of the law itself.

This means that if a jury feels that a defendant is facing an unjust charge, they actually have the right to rule in the defendant’s favor, even if they are technically guilty under the court’s standards.

People charged with victimless crimes, for example, could be set free, and the laws could be expeditiously changed. If a pattern of acquittals develops in response to repeated attempts to prosecute a statutory offence, this can have the de facto effect of invalidating the statute.

The federal government, and individual state governments are terrified about this concept becoming more mainstream.

This week, James and Andrew Rumbold went to a local courthouse in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where they peacefully handed out flyers informing people of their rights when on a jury.

During this week’s outreach effort, James and his friends were approached by a courthouse employee who insisted that they were not allowed to hand out flyers where they were standing. The employee was identified as Christopher M. Dailey, Director of Bucks County “Emergency Services” Security Division.

James informed Dailey that he was on public property, and that he had every right to do what he was doing. When Dailey realized that he was on camera, he demanded that the group turn their cameras off, but he was then informed that while on public property, it was legal for them to film what was happening.

Next Dailey went inside to call the police. Moments later police arrived on the scene, and knowing that the activists were armed with cameras, the officer was very polite with them. After refusing to give the officers his ID, James continued to insist that he had every right to hand out the flyers on public property, because he was not technically protesting, but simply educating the public about what laws are in existence.

The officer stepped aside for a few moments and eventually came back to inform the activists that there was in fact no law on the books preventing them from doing what they were doing.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/killings-police-utah-outpacing-gang-drug-child-abuse-spousal-homicides/","Killings By Police in Utah Outpacing Gang, Drug, Child-Abuse, and Spousal Homicides","In the past five years, more Utahns have been killed by cops than by gang violence, drug dealers, or from child abuse.

Data from a five-year period is painting a disturbing picture of a deadly trend among Utah police officers.

Up until this year, killings by police officers ranked second only to homicide of intimate partners. However, this year, including a Saturday shooting in South Jordan, deadly force by police surpassed even violence between spouses and dating partners.

As police killings rise, more people are becoming aware and police watchdog groups are saying that it’s time we start treating deadly force by police as a potentially serious public safety problem. The Free Thought Project agrees.

“The numbers reflect that there could be an issue, and it’s going to take a deeper understanding of these shootings,” said Chris Gebhardt to the Salt Lake Tribune, a former police lieutenant and sergeant who served in Washington, D.C., and in Utah, including six years on SWAT teams and several training duties. “It definitely can’t be written off as citizen groups being upset with law enforcement.”

Only one single case of police deadly force in Utah has ever been deemed “unjustified” by prosecutors which was the 2012 shooting of Danielle Willard by West Valley City police.

The Tribune also spoke to Ian Adams, a West Jordan police officer and spokesman for the Utah Fraternal Order of Police who says, “Police are trained and expected to react to deadly threats. As many deadly threats emerge is the exact amount of times police will respond.”

“The onus is on the person being arrested to stop trying to assault and kill police officers and the innocent public. … Why do some in society continue to insist the problem lies with police officers?”

Apparently Adams is unaware of police tendencies to escalate an otherwise peaceful situation into violent one, at the drop of a hat.

As recent FBI data has shown, violence among citizens is at an all time low, while violence by police is at an all time high. To imply that police are justified in 100% of these killings is not only irresponsible but incredibly dangerous.

The death of another human being should be avoided at all costs and when it happens, regardless of whether or not the person wears a badge, there should be a full investigation; by a third party.

“Sometimes the line between is it legal and is it necessary becomes difficult to distinguish,” criminal justice professor at Weber State University, Robert Wadman said. “In the judgment of the officer, ‘Is my life in jeopardy? Yes.’ At that point in time, they’re legally grounded in using deadly force. But the question is, is it necessary? That’s something that needs to be firmly addressed, for example, in training.”

Gang violence in America was once a national conversation and rightfully so. However, with the legalization of marijuana in several states, these cartels are diminishing and their once violent hold is slipping away. They no longer pose such a large threat.

Americans are less violent now than ever before, so why are we seeing an increase in police violence? If the recent events in Ferguson, MO and the heavy militarization among police forces nationwide, have taught this country anything, it’s that we are long overdue for a serious conversation about police reform.","2014-11-23 16:41:58","1","23.0","36.0","5.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","55.0","20.0","0.0","169.0","10.0","13.0","15","556","90.69","64.73","28.69","1.00","19.86","24.28","83.27","46.04","5.94","1.08","0.18","0.54","0.00","0.00","0.36","4.86","7.55","16.01","8.81","3.78","6.29","0.72","12.05","6.29","3.06","1.26","2.16","2.88","6.65","1.26","5.40","1.08","2.52","0.18","6.83","0.18","0.72","0.00","0.00","10.43","1.62","1.98","1.62","1.98","1.62","2.70","1.80","0.36","1.08","0.18","0.72","0.18","0.36","0.00","0.18","13.67","2.70","1.08","8.63","0.36","1.80","2.34","8.27","0.72","14.75","0.90","8.45","5.40","5.94","0.54","0.00","0.54","0.00","1.08","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","16.19","4.86","6.12","0.00","0.18","0.72","0.00","0.18","2.70","1.26","0.00","0.18","2676","8.17","24.434782608695652","845","555","28","59.84","12.5","9.8","11.89","12.2","125","8.1","18.929009009009008","315","22.3","5","0.44","0","19","7","55","0","79","48","1","0","5","85","47","1","37","1","0","13","2","31","4","0","1","13","0","20","9","16","15","19","25","2","2","0","3"
"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/1-cop-issued-80-percent-marijuana-citations-seattle/","1 Cop Issued 80 Percent of All Marijuana Citations in Seattle","Seattle cop responsible for 80 percent of marijuana citations reassigned

July 31, 2014



A Seattle police officer who issued about 80 percent of marijuana citations given in the city thus far in 2014 has been reassigned, officials said. Meanwhile, it was found that African Americans in the city were disproportionately ticketed for pot.

Seattle Police Department Chief Kathleen O’Toole said Wednesday that in the process of compiling the first biannual report on the city’s enforcement of Washington state’s new law allowing recreational marijuana use, her staff found that 66 of 83 citations for illegally using pot in public were given out by one SPD officer.

“In some instances, the officer added notes to the tickets,” O’Toole said in a statement, adding that some notes called for the attention of City Attorney Peter Holmes, called “Petey Holmes” in citations given by the officer.

O’Toole said that in one case, “the officer indicated he flipped a coin when contemplating which subject to cite.”

In another citation, the officer called the state’s voter-approved modification of marijuana laws as “silly.”

O’Toole said the officer’s behavior was reported to SPD’s Office of Professional Accountability, and that he has been removed from patrol duties while an investigation unfolds.

The biannual report, released last week, also showed that African Americans in the city were ticketed disproportionately for using marijuana in public. The report found that 36 percent of such tickets were issued to African Americans, who make up only eight percent of Seattle’s entire population.

An SPD spokesman said the department understands that the number of tickets given to African Americans in the city was disproportionate, Reuters reported. O’Toole said Wednesday that the six-month reports are designed to provide oversight and to signal “anomalies or outliers” in SPD’s enforcement of marijuana laws.

Earlier this month, Washington became the second state after Colorado to allow retail sales of recreational marijuana to adults over 21 years old. Colorado sales started on January 1.

Washington state’s heavily regulated and taxed system that allows marijuana sales was approved by voters in November 2012.

Former District Heights police officer Johnnie Riley was recently found guilty of shooting a handcuffed suspect, and now he’s had his bond revoked after attacking prosecutors during a sentencing hearing.

According to the state’s attorney’s office, several officers were needed to subdue Riley after the attack.

Riley’s attorney said that the outburst was provoked by comments that were made by the prosecutors about how they were going to hold him to a higher standard because of his position as an officer.

His sentencing has now been postponed until October 15th.

Riley was charged with attempted murder after shooting 26-year-old Kalvin Kyle in 2012, Paralyzing him from the chest down. Kyle was shot as he was handcuffed and running away from Riley.

“The police officer had removed his shoes and handcuffed him and searched him, so he didn’t have a weapon. All the officer had to do to stop him was to grab him,” Christopher Griffith, Kyle’s lawyer said.

At a prior hearing, Riley defended himself, saying that it “slipped his mind” that Mr. Kyle was wearing handcuffs.

Riley has a history of police brutality accusations, in 2010 he was accused of pepper spraying a woman at a traffic stop.

March 18, 201

The Kansas House Standing Committee on Corrections and Juvenile Justice has introduced a bill that will require private citizens who file complaints against police officers to sign an affidavit, acknowledging that if their allegations are proven false, they can be charged with perjury, which is a felony charge.

Furthermore, this bill prohibits a Kansas law enforcement agency from opening an investigation into a complaint if another law enforcement agency has already investigated the complaint and found in favor of the officer.

In other words, this bill would allow police departments to arrest the people who file complaints against police officers. In Wichita, Kansas, complaints are almost always dismissed, by the Wichita Police Department, so, according to this bill and its vague wording, the WPD, could now go arrest the people who file complaints against their officers.

People in Wichita are already afraid to file complaints against the WPD, because the department has a well-known reputation for retaliating against those who do, and this bill would render such retaliation legal. Furthermore, the bill clearly prevents an outside agency, such as the Kansas Bureau of Investigations, from opening an investigation into an allegation that the WPD has already ruled upon.

According to the Racial Profiling Advisory Board, the WPD denied 100 out of 100 claims of racial profiling, ruling that each was a “false report”. If this bill had been law when those reports were made, everyone of those 100 people could have potentially faced a felony charge, and no other law enforcement agency would be permitted to investigate the allegations.

Sometimes, we see news stories where bills are badly misrepresented. This is not one of those stories. Here is the full text of the bill:

http://kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/measures/documents/hb2698_00_0000.pdf

Who actually authored this bill remains unclear, as the bill was introduced by the House Committee on Corrections and Juvenile Justice.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/la-paying-5-million-dollar-settlement-executing-unarmed-man-live-tv/","Tax Payers Forced to Pay $5M in Damages After LAPD Executed Unarmed Man on Live TV","Remember that time the LAPD executed a man on live television?

On Wednesday, Los Angeles City Council voted on a five million dollar settlement to his family. The lawsuit filed by the man’s parents, alleged that police were inadequately trained, used excessive force and committed battery and negligence, ABC reports.

Brian Beaird was a 51 year old disabled veteran who was discharged from the National Guard after a botched surgery on a brain tumor in the late 80s. He also suffered from schizophrenia, which may explain his actions that fateful evening.

The incident began on the evening of December 13, 2013, with LAPD in pursuit of his silver corvette for reckless driving. Beaird lead officers on quite a chase, eventually hitting another vehicle in a terribly violent crash.

At some point before the televised execution Beaird reportedly called his 80 year old father to say that police were chasing him and his father urged him to pull over- to no avail, his father then watched his son die on television, he told the Los Angeles Times in heart-breaking detail.

A KTLA helicopter hovered overhead catching every chilling second of the action, clearly not expecting what would happen.

This man, who told his father he was afraid, likely needed help and ran from the car with his hands in the air, he was gunned down by multiple bullets just seconds later.

The well deserved settlement will not be paid by the killer cops but by the people of Los Angeles, once again. Just last month we reported on the 1.8 million dollar settlement that David Perdue, one of several innocent people shot at during LAPD’s vengeful kill mission for Christopher Dorner, will recieve from the tax payers.

“It implicitly says they acknowledge that the shooting was inappropriate and should not have happened,” his lawyer told ABC regarding the settlement. He continued on to say, “it seems to take a video to really force their hand in settling a case like this.”

If people aren’t angry about the brutality itself, maybe its time we start showing them the bills. Perhaps if there was enough outrage and these cops had to start paying these settlements out of their own wallets instead of ours they would be less likely to pull triggers on unarmed men.","2014-08-21 14:44:14","1","18.0","28.0","5.0","1.0","5.0","0.0","51.0","20.0","0.0","167.0","10.0","13.0","15","382","91.17","85.25","8.67","4.51","23.88","24.08","80.63","45.81","11.52","6.54","0.00","0.79","0.00","4.45","1.31","4.97","8.12","14.40","4.97","3.40","2.88","1.31","12.30","2.36","1.31","1.05","2.88","1.57","3.14","0.52","2.62","0.52","1.57","0.52","13.35","1.83","0.00","0.00","6.81","9.16","1.05","1.31","2.09","2.62","1.05","2.36","2.09","0.79","0.79","0.52","2.09","1.05","1.05","0.00","0.00","5.76","1.57","0.52","3.66","0.26","0.26","6.02","3.93","1.57","15.97","2.09","6.54","7.33","3.14","1.31","0.26","1.83","0.00","1.05","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","11.78","3.93","5.24","0.00","0.00","0.26","0.00","0.52","1.05","0.79","0.00","0.00","1809","8.35","25.733333333333334","549","381","17","65.66","12.2","9.7","11.55","12.9","87","6.833333333333333","20.093858267716538","249","23.67","7","0.43","0","7","10","38","0","52","26","0","0","6","67","29","0","20","1","0","15","13","20","1","0","1","9","0","14","24","11","9","4","4","1","3","0","0"

As part of a settlement to a federal civil rights case, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department will be instituting a new policy prohibiting police officers from interfering with civilians who are recording their actions.

According to Indiana Lawyer, the policy change was included in a settlement agreement with Indianapolis resident Willie King who was arrested in February 2011 after he used his cellphone to videotape police officers arresting another man. King was charged with resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and public intoxication.

An officer then ordered King to hand the phone over. When King refused, the officer tackled him to the ground and confiscated his phone.

Following a bench trial that found him not guilty, King filed a federal civil rights case against the city of Indianapolis and the police officers involved in the incident. The lawsuit, Willie E. King v. The City of Indianapolis, Jonathan M. Lawlis, Robert K. McCauley, Brad Alford, Michael B. Wright and David Miller, 1:11-cv-01727, was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division.

King claimed the city and the officers violated his First, Fourth and 14th amendment rights. In addition, he asserted the IMPD used excessive force against him and that he was a victim of false arrest and malicious prosecution.

The settlement was reached within weeks of King’s March 10, 2014, trial date. Along with requiring the city to implement a new policy, the settlement also awarded King $200,000 in damages.

Police Chief Rick Hite now has two months to issue a bulletin informing his officers that they should not stop civilians observing or filming their actions in public, so long as the person filming does not interfere with their duties and keeps a “safe and reasonable” distance.

Chock this one up for a win! The next order of business will be to define a “safe and reasonable” distance as this will likely be the chink in the armor that police will exploit in order to tackle the next youtube vigilante catching their dastardly deeds on camera.","2014-02-28 16:36:09","1","16.0","32.0","5.0","0.0","10.0","0.0","54.0","20.0","0.0","170.0","10.0","13.0","15","346","95.63","78.25","10.84","35.89","18.21","26.88","72.83","40.46","6.94","4.34","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.89","1.45","2.60","10.12","12.72","4.91","1.16","5.49","0.87","7.23","3.18","1.16","0.87","3.76","0.58","2.89","1.73","1.16","0.29","0.29","0.00","10.40","0.00","0.29","0.00","5.78","4.62","1.45","1.73","0.29","0.29","0.00","1.73","1.45","0.29","0.87","0.29","0.58","0.29","0.29","0.00","0.00","13.01","0.00","0.87","11.27","0.58","1.16","2.89","2.60","1.45","13.58","1.16","6.94","4.62","5.49","1.45","0.29","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.58","0.00","0.58","0.29","0.00","0.00","14.74","5.78","6.07","0.29","0.00","0.00","0.29","0.58","1.16","0.29","0.00","0.29","1707","8.23","24.785714285714285","527","341","19","61.77","13.1","9.1","12.58","12.0","80","8.5","18.5441642228739","198","22.5","7","0.4","0","12","13","38","0","38","22","0","0","5","55","54","0","18","0","0","7","8","9","0","0","1","9","0","11","19","14","6","1","3","1","2","0","1"

Company suggests outrage over toddler critically injured by police flashbang grenade will subside when terror group “comes a calling”

PAUL JOSEPH WATSON | JUNE 26, 2014 | Infowars.com

A company that provides video training programs for law enforcement has caused controversy by suggesting that nobody will complain about militarized police in America or examples of police brutality when the ISIS insurgent group “comes a calling.”

A Facebook post by In the Line of Duty even goes so far as to imply that outrage over a recent incident where a 2-year-old had a hole blown open in his chest as a result of a flashbang grenade thrown by SWAT police will disappear once ISIS terrorists enter the United States.

“When this ‘militarization’ of lea’s (Law Enforcement Agencies) affects infants like Bou Bou, the public’s going to be righteously outraged. But, someday, when ISIS comes a calling, who will be complaining then?,” states the Facebook post, which links to a Guardian article about how police departments in the U.S. are becoming increasingly militarized.

ISIS is the insurgent group (aided in part by the Obama administration’s support for radical jihadists in Syria), that recently took control of key cities in Iraq and has been blamed for a number of atrocities.

“Bou Bou” is a reference to the victim of a harrowing recent incident during which a SWAT team member threw a flashbang grenade into the toddler’s crib while conducting an armed raid on a house just outside of Atlanta.

2-year-old Bounkham “Bou Bou” Phonesavanh was severely injured by the blast and remains in critical condition with possible brain damage. “There’s still a hole in his chest that exposes his ribs,” the toddler’s mother wrote in an article for Salon.com. “At least that’s what I’ve been told; I’m afraid to look.”

According to its website, In the Line of Duty “is the only producer of reality-based video training programs for law enforcement.”

Writer William Norman Grigg labels the company, “defenders of the militarized Homeland Security State,” accusing them of making, “the assumption that the public would regard 3:00 a.m. Stormtrooper raids that leave infants with disfiguring injuries (as) simply the price we must pay to be protected from whatever “threats” our rulers can conjure.”","2014-06-26 09:08:47","1","19.0","32.0","5.0","1.0","6.0","0.0","58.0","20.0","0.0","169.0","10.0","13.0","15","383","96.23","79.82","15.39","1.88","31.92","26.37","73.37","42.04","6.27","2.09","0.52","0.52","0.00","0.78","0.26","4.18","10.44","14.88","6.53","3.92","3.92","0.26","11.49","2.35","2.09","2.87","2.35","1.31","5.48","1.31","4.18","1.04","1.83","0.00","9.14","0.26","0.00","0.26","0.78","4.96","1.04","2.35","0.52","1.04","0.26","0.52","1.31","1.04","0.26","0.00","1.83","1.83","0.78","0.00","0.00","8.62","3.13","0.26","4.18","0.26","1.31","2.35","7.31","1.83","14.10","2.61","6.01","4.96","6.01","1.31","0.26","0.52","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.89","4.44","3.39","0.26","0.26","0.26","0.00","1.31","6.01","2.61","1.57","0.78","1854","8.92","49.125","570","374","15","54.66","13.9","11.8","13.29","15.6","96","17.0","22.227379679144388","235","40.62","16","0.41","0","4","8","42","0","56","21","0","1","7","75","48","2","16","0","0","4","5","13","0","0","0","7","0","11","9","12","13","5","20","5","2","0","6"

“I was just praying that they wouldn’t kill me. I just closed my eyes and tried to hold on”

Los Angeles, CA — The Los Angeles Police Department is facing heavy criticism for their brutal ways once again, after allegedly assaulting a handcuffed man and tasing him in both his head and his back.

Unfortunately for the thugs at LAPD, the entire incident was captured on video, though the less-than-noble Chief Beck is refusing to release it- despite claiming he would be providing transparency on the case.

“If Chief Charlie Beck wants to be transparent,” Harper said, “the chief will release it. He has the power to do so no matter what he says.”

Their victim, Clinton Alford, appeared in court on crutches this past Wednesday and alleges LAPD beat him and kicked him in the head repeatedly in South LA after being stopped on a bicycle and arrested for the victimless crime of drug possession.

Alford claims the officers did not say they were police when they yelled at him to stop, so he ignored them and kept riding. When the two officers caught up to him, he says he laid down, put his hands behind his back, and complied- a statement that those who have seen the tape agree happened.

Another patrol car is then seen pulling up and the officer driving gets out and horrifically beats the handcuffed and face down man.

Officer Richard Garcia is reportedly seen kicking and/or stomping on Alford’s head and upper body, then dropping to the ground and assaulting Alford with his elbows, sources told the LA Times.

The Times continued on to report that two sources told them Alford’s head can be seen on the video hitting the pavement from the force of the strikes.

It didn’t end there though, with the two initial officers still restraining him, Garcia leaned his knee into the small of Alford’s back and, for a prolonged period, bounced with his body weight on top of the 22 year old man, the sources said. At one point, even putting his other knee on Alford’s neck.

Throughout much of the attack, the two arresting officers restrained Alford, eventually moving away.

“He had to have stitches,” Lawyer for Alford, Caree Harper told KCAL9. “He has fractures, he has two serious wounds to the head where the Taser was stuck.” “I was just praying that they wouldn’t kill me. I just closed my eyes and tried to hold on,” Alford told the Times.

Concerns have also been raised about what happened once Alford’s limp body was carried into the cop car. The officers reportedly appear to notice the security camera on the wall and Officer Richard Garcia knocks and enters the building shortly after.

This specific division of the LAPD, Newton- appropriately nicknamed Shootin’ Newton, has already been under fire for the recent murders of Ezell Ford and Omar Abrego, who were both unarmed as their lives were taken less than a week and a half apart.

All four officers involved in the arrest and a sergeant who arrived on scene afterward have been suspended with pay as the department investigates the Oct. 16 attack. Alford’s charge of resisting arrest has been dropped.","2014-10-31 11:06:33","1","25.0","30.0","5.0","1.0","8.0","0.0","53.0","20.0","0.0","167.0","10.0","13.0","15","542","83.24","70.38","18.78","5.81","22.58","19.93","80.63","48.52","10.52","7.38","1.48","0.00","0.00","4.24","1.66","3.14","8.67","13.28","7.01","4.24","6.27","0.92","15.13","2.95","2.03","1.48","2.58","1.48","3.69","0.92","2.77","0.00","1.85","0.00","9.78","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.80","4.98","0.37","0.92","0.92","0.74","0.55","2.03","3.87","1.85","1.11","0.92","3.87","3.14","0.55","0.00","0.18","8.67","0.55","0.74","6.83","0.37","0.55","8.30","5.54","1.29","16.97","2.21","9.04","6.27","1.85","0.55","0.00","0.37","0.37","0.55","0.18","0.00","0.00","0.18","0.00","0.00","15.13","4.43","5.35","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.92","2.21","1.85","0.00","0.37","2466","7.64","26.238095238095237","737","540","23","64.54","11.2","10.1","10.74","12.8","97","12.0","18.585185185185185","291","23.67","11","0.47","0","22","11","55","0","59","18","2","0","3","75","59","0","24","0","0","30","13","33","0","0","2","12","0","17","38","22","18","7","22","0","5","0","3"
"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/landmark-supreme-court-ruling-police-warrant-search-cellphone/","Landmark Supreme Court Ruling: Police Need Warrant to Search Your Cellphone","SCOTUS Requires a Warrant to Search a Cellphone

June 25, 2014

The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, stated that the Fourth Amendment requires a search warrant to look at the digital contents of a cell phone that the police have seized incident to arrest. The opinion isRiley v. California, No. 13-132, 573 U.S. ___, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2013 WL 2864483 (June 25, 2014).

The decision was unanimous, with a concurrence by Justice Alito.

Basically, the Court took two cases, Riley and United States v. Wurie, No. 13-212, that had reached opposite conclusions and consolidated them. InRiley, a driver was stopped for expired registration and having a suspended driver’s license. His car was impounded and inventoried, and two handguns were found. A search of his cell phone incident to arrest and other factors led police to believe that Riley was a member of the Bloods street gang. Following a warrantless search of the phone, photographs were located tying Riley to a gang shooting and he was charged with attempted murder and several others crimes. The trial court denied a motion to suppress the evidence and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.

In Wurie, police were conducting routine surveillance and saw Wurie make a drug transaction. Wurie was arrested and his cell phone seized. They searched the phone (an older flip phone) and eventually obtained a search warrant for Wurie’s house based on the warrantless search of the phone. Police seized 215 grams of cocaine, a firearm and other drugs, and cash. Wurie’s motion to suppress was denied, but the First Circuit reversed and vacated the conviction.

Roberts held that the search incident to arrest exception (from Chimel v. United States, 395 U.S. 752 (1969)) did not include the digital contents of a cell phone. Police may examine the phone to make sure that it is not a weapon, but may not search the contents. The claim that the search is necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence is also not valid. Police may place the phone in a Faraday bag to prevent outside signals from reaching it, may turn off the phone, or may remove the battery.

Roberts cited Judge Learned Hand who said in 1926 that it is “a totally different thing to search a man’s pockets and use against him what they contain, from ransacking his house for everything which may incriminate him.” Riley, slip op. at 20 (internal citation omitted). Searching a cell phone is ransacking the house.

“The fact that technology now allows an individual to carry such information in his hand does not make the information any less worthy of the protection for which the Founders fought. Our answer to the question of what police must do before searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple—get a warrant.”Id., slip op. at 28 (emphasis added).

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/landmark-move-la-sheriffs-department-civilian-oversight-board/","“We Did It!” Citizens of LA Create Landmark Civilian Review Board to Force Police Accountability","“It is all about accountability … and constitutional policing”

Los Angeles, CA — After multiple failed attempts to establish an independent, non-police-backed, civilian commission to oversee the LA County Sheriff’s department, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors finally approved the measure on Tuesday.

In a split vote of 3-2, Supervisors Mark Ridley-Thomas and Hilda Solis combined efforts to propose the independent commission. Supervisor Sheila Kuehl backed the plan, while Michael Antonovich and Don Knabe voted against it.

This was an imperative move by the board as the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is and has been rife with corruption.

“We can’t afford to delay any longer,” Solis said. “Across this country, public trust in the people who are charged with keeping us safe has fallen to a low.”

“It is all about accountability … and constitutional policing,” Ridley-Thomas said.

What’s unclear at the moment is how large the commission will be or the scope of their oversight.

According to the LA Times, the precise powers of the commission will depend to a large extent on the new sheriff, Jim McDonnell, who was elected to the job last month after longtime Sheriff Lee Baca resigned in January. The sheriff is an independently elected office, so McDonnell is not obligated to take direction from the supervisors or their oversight commission.

McDonnell takes over the post under an unprecedented degree of scrutiny, including an impending federal consent decree governing mentally ill inmates. Last year, the supervisors appointed a veteran public corruption prosecutor to be the department’s inspector general.

Many of the commission’s details, including how many members it will have, the scope of its powers and its relationship to the new inspector general’s office, remain to be worked out. A panel including the sheriff and other county officials will issue recommendations within three months.

In 2011, a temporary Citizens’ Commission for Jails Violence was established and made several recommendations in response to the horrific jail conditions and the maltreatment of mentally ill inmates.

However, according to the Los Angeles Daily News, implementation of several of those changes is still under way.

That is why many supporters of this new commission are pushing for subpoena power. The Daily News reports that backers of the idea said that even an advisory-only board would offer community members a critical voice and a forum for grievances, but today many demanded that the civilian commission be given subpoena power and should not include any current or retired members of law enforcement.

The concept of excluding current and former law enforcement members is a huge move as it is usually the retired police officers within the unions that have so much sway over cops regaining their jobs after being fired for abuse.

Sheriff Jim McDonnell, who has only been in the post for a little over a week, expressed his support for the civilian commission, but he questioned the subpoena power.

Of course the commission is not without criticism by people who apparently think that oversight is somehow a negative approach to police accountability. Supervisor Antonovich came out in opposition stating the the board would be “a step backwards,” saying that some of the department’s “darkest days” took place under multiple layers of oversight.

According to the Daily News, other opponents of a civilian board, including a representative from the Citizens’ Commission for Jail Violence, said such a commission would have no authority over the elected sheriff without changes to state law. Other critics said a civilian panel could dilute the efforts of Inspector General Max Huntsman.

However, it was Huntsman who has expressed his willingness to work under a board that has the power to fire him. Huntsman noted that the board must have complete access to the department however, in order to successfully implement such measures.

“The issue of access … is absolutely critical,” Huntsman said. Success would depend, he said, on “whether or not what they have to say is welcomed by the department.”

While this is a significant step forward in the efforts of police accountability, it still has a long way to go. But third party, non-police related, boards such as this one, are the only way to stop these completely unaccountable, massive rights violations by police departments.

What good are lapel cams and microphones if the cops are disabling them? Why aren’t they being fired for this?

“No one likes to be monitored,” says Sid Heal, recently retired commander who evaluated technology during his decades-long tenure at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. And? If you do not want to be filmed and recorded don’t be a cop.

According to the arstechnica.com, The Los Angeles Police Commission is investigating how half of the recording antennas in the Southeast Division went missing, seemingly as a way to evade new self-monitoring procedures that the Los Angeles Police Department imposed last year.

The antennas, which are mounted onto individual patrol cars, receive recorded audio captured from an officer’s belt-worn transmitter. The transmitter is designed to capture an officer’s voice and transmit the recording to the car itself for storage. The voice recorders are part of a video camera system that is mounted in a front-facing camera on the patrol car. Both elements are activated any time the car’s emergency lights and sirens are turned on, but they can also be activated manually.

According to the Los Angeles Times, an LAPD investigation determined that around half of the 80 patrol cars in one South LA division were missing antennas as of last summer, and an additional 10 antennas were unaccounted for. Citing a police source, the newspaper said that removing the antennas can reduce the range of the voice transmitters by as much as a third of the normal operating distance.

The Police Commission, an independent body that oversees LAPD policy, was only notified of the situation two months ago. Neither the commission nor the LAPD immediately responded for comment.

Dear LAPD, we do not care if you do not want to be monitored. If you would stop harassing, beating, kidnapping, and killing people for no reason, then, maybe, we will reconsider it. Until then, pipe down and deal with being held accountable.","2014-04-14 14:36:14","1","16.0","31.0","5.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","53.0","20.0","0.0","170.0","10.0","13.0","15","330","88.15","54.82","16.48","30.91","19.41","25.45","75.15","45.45","6.06","2.73","0.00","0.61","0.91","0.30","0.91","3.33","10.91","11.52","8.48","2.12","6.97","2.73","11.82","3.03","1.82","1.52","3.03","1.21","3.33","1.82","1.52","0.00","0.61","0.61","5.76","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.30","8.18","1.52","2.12","2.12","2.12","0.00","3.33","2.42","0.61","1.82","0.00","0.91","0.30","0.61","0.00","0.00","5.76","0.91","0.30","3.64","0.30","0.61","2.73","8.18","0.91","12.73","2.12","5.15","5.76","3.94","1.21","0.00","0.91","0.00","0.30","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","15.45","4.55","6.36","0.00","0.00","0.91","0.00","1.21","0.61","1.82","0.00","0.00","1599","8.71","19.764705882352942","514","325","17","52.09","13.9","10.7","12.42","12.2","85","7.0","20.101538461538464","204","18.0","5","0.45","0","10","6","40","0","36","14","0","0","4","60","32","0","17","0","1","10","1","14","0","0","1","8","0","16","10","14","17","11","7","3","2","0","2"

Andres Loubriel

June 28, 2014

With the use of computer analytic technology, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is predicting crimes before they happen. The Real-Time Analysis and Critical Response Division in downtown LA is the hub for this activity. The department has rows of crime analysts and technologists who observe news broadcasts, security camera footage, and maps of the most recent crimes in the city. By recording and mapping the data from previous crimes, an algorithm takes that data and estimates the likelihood of a crime occurring in that area again, and when it is most likely to happen.

The algorithm used by the LAPD utilizes what is known as predictive policing. By using years, sometimes decades, of crime data, the algorithm identifies areas with high probabilities of certain crimes. The computer then places a little red box on the navigation systems of patrol cars. Captain John Romero stated that criminals tend to be very territorial, so once they do crime in an area without being caught, they will very likely return there again with the same intention.

The LAPD captain compared the process to a fisherman using a fish tracker to find out where fish will be. Romero stated that the device will help more inexperienced officers know which areas are dangerous and prone to criminal activity. When patrol cars are not answering a radio call, they are paroling these areas, and very often, illegal activity occurs there during their patrol.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/la-cop-justified-actions-ramming-shooting-innocent-man-hunt-chris-dorn/","LA Cop “Justified in His Actions” For Ramming and Shooting at Innocent Man During Hunt For Chris Dorn","(FOX 11/CNS) – A Torrance police officer who opened fire on a pickup truck during the manhunt for former Los Angeles police Officer Christopher Dorner was justified in his actions and will not face any criminal charges, the District Attorney’s Office announced today.

Prosecutors concluded that Officer Brian McGee “did not commit any criminal misconduct” on Feb. 7 of last year when he rammed David Perdue’s truck with a patrol car, then fired three shots through the driver’s side window.

According to a charge evaluation worksheet prepared by Deputy District Attorney Geoffrey Rendon, McGee acted reasonably in light of the ongoing search for Dorner, who had killed two people at that point and went on to kill two others — a Riverside police officer and San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputy.

“McGee’s actions are analyzed based on the totality of circumstances, which include McGee’s knowledge of Dorner’s previous threats and actions in the days and hours preceding these events, which gave rise to an atmosphere of fear and extreme anticipation,” Rendon wrote. “Those circumstances created a situation in which a reasonable mistake of fact, namely that Dorner was driving the truck, nearly resulted in a horrific tragedy.

“Nonetheless, given the circumstances, as detailed above, we conclude that Officer McGee was justified in using force to stop the vehicle and in discharging his firearm. Therefore, prosecution in this matter is declined and this office will take no further action.”

According to NBC Los Angeles, “It was only the poor marksmanship of Torrance officer Brian McGee that led to Mr. Perdue being alive today,” said Perdue’s attorney Robert Sheahen.

In the report, the district attorney found that because McGee and his partner, Erin Sooper, were “anxious” and in a state of “panic,” their attempt to kill Mr. Perdue was justified.

Are they kidding? So since the cop, McGee, who is a professional “law enforcement officer” was anxious and panicked, it is okay for him to have shot at an innocent person?!

This is absolutely horrendous! So if Officer McGee had killed Perdue with one of the 3 shots, would his actions still be justified?

This sets the precedent; if a criminal is on the loose, cops can ram and shoot anyone they want in the hunt for that criminal, and it will be just.

We must not let this stand. These criminals are condoning their own brutal and irresponsible behavior as they kill and brutalize innocent people. Please help to spread the word of this injustice before its too late.

Awareness is the first step to prevention.","2014-01-17 15:00:02","1","19.0","30.0","5.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","55.0","20.0","0.0","170.0","10.0","13.0","15","423","84.34","65.63","17.39","2.60","22.26","25.77","75.18","44.92","9.69","3.07","0.00","0.47","0.00","1.42","1.18","6.62","7.57","12.29","7.09","2.84","5.67","0.95","9.46","2.84","1.18","1.65","1.89","0.47","5.44","1.42","4.02","1.42","1.89","0.24","5.91","0.00","0.24","0.00","1.42","9.46","3.07","3.55","1.42","1.42","1.18","1.42","1.18","0.47","0.24","0.47","0.47","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.00","7.80","0.95","0.71","5.67","0.24","0.71","4.73","4.49","1.42","13.71","2.84","6.62","4.49","2.60","0.00","0.24","0.24","0.00","1.42","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.47","0.00","0.00","17.49","4.02","5.91","0.00","0.24","0.71","0.47","0.00","3.55","1.89","0.47","0.24","2069","8.59","25.352941176470587","633","424","21","59.43","13.0","10.0","12.36","12.7","106","11.75","20.080000000000002","249","23.41","4","0.44","0","15","7","46","0","48","30","0","0","6","69","61","0","21","0","0","10","7","14","0","0","0","10","0","15","28","9","13","7","7","4","3","0","1"

Instead of investigating the officers for their disgusting actions, police are investigating how the video got released.

Mamou, LA — A disturbing video was leaked to the press Monday from a holding cell surveillance camera showing 2 police officers essentially torturing inmates.

The anonymous person who released the video, did so with the following statement.

To whom it may concern:

You will find Police Chief candidate Robert McGee continually tasing multiple inmates in cells at the Mamou Police Department. There is also footage of deceased officer, Joe Deshotel, tasing an inmate in a cell. These files came from the video surveillance at the MPD.

signed -a disgusted and concerned citizen.

The different video clips range from July of 2010 to October of 2010. The clips all present the same scenario, two cops walk up to the cell, open the door and taser the non-violent, non-combative, and otherwise completely peaceful inmates. It is truly disgusting.

KLFY reached out to McGee, who is currently running for chief of police in Mamou, for a statement on the video. He said that he cannot remember the specific incidents, but admits that he and Deshotel did have to use force on inmates from time to time.

McGee claims that this is an attempt to smear him just before the elections.“The timing is right. The election is this Saturday. Why bring up the video now? You (someone) had opportunity to bring up the video during the first election, but now its in a run-off, now it comes out. It looks like someone is aiming to hurt me,” McGee said.

Even if that was the case, that someone is trying to smear him, so what? It still shows him depriving individuals of their civil rights by tasering them for no reason.

McGee also claims that the videos were edited.

In a statement McGee said, “I think the video was edited. Where is the beginning of the video? Why show just that tasing?”

However, the videos show the officers walk up to the cell, open the door and taser non-violent inmates, one of which was even sitting peacefully on his bed! It looks like multiple deliberate and sadistic acts of aggression; aggression that the police chief candidate will never face consequences for, not for the obvious reason of the thin blue line, but because these incidents are outside of the statute of limitations.

Current Chief of Police, Greg Dupuis said he was made aware of the video over the weekend. Dupuis said an investigator contacted him, and he promptly contacted the district attorney. “He advised me that according to the dates, the statue of limitations has run out and we couldn’t file charges. One of the people in the video is deceased and hasn’t worked for me in over three years. The other, hasn’t worked for me in over one year,” Dupuis said via a phone interview.

Dupuis said that he is conducting an investigation, not about the sadistic torturous actions of the officers in the video, but how the video was released.

US pushing local cops to stay mum on surveillance

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration has been quietly advising local police not to disclose details about surveillance technology they are using to sweep up basic cellphone data from entire neighborhoods, The Associated Press has learned.

Citing security reasons, the U.S. has intervened in routine state public records cases and criminal trials regarding use of the technology. This has resulted in police departments withholding materials or heavily censoring documents in rare instances when they disclose any about the purchase and use of such powerful surveillance equipment.

Federal involvement in local open records proceedings is unusual. It comes at a time when President Barack Obama has said he welcomes a debate on government surveillance and called for more transparency about spying in the wake of disclosures about classified federal surveillance programs.

One well-known type of this surveillance equipment is known as a Stingray, an innovative way for law enforcement to track cellphones used by suspects and gather evidence. The equipment tricks cellphones into identifying their owners’ account information and transmitting data to police as if it were a phone company’s tower. That allows police to obtain cellphone information without having to ask for help from service providers, such as Verizon or AT&T, and can locate a phone without the user even making a call or sending a text message.

But without more details about how the technology works and under what circumstances it’s used, it’s unclear whether the technology might violate a person’s constitutional rights or whether it’s a good investment of taxpayer dollars.

“The blocking of the autopsy report of Ford comes on the heels of the release of the autopsy report on Michael Brown which contradicted the police version of how Brown was killed,”

RT.com

Those waiting for the preliminary autopsy report regarding the officer-involved death of a young, unarmed black man in Los Angeles are going to have to wait a little longer, as officials have delayed its release.

According to the Huffington Post, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) have placed an “investigative hold” on the report detailing Ezell Ford’s cause of death in order to preserve the integrity of witness testimony, which is still being gathered.

“Pending further investigative and forensic analysis, the LAPD Force Investigation Division investigators have requested that The Los Angeles County Coroner place an investigative hold on the pending autopsy report,” the police department said on Monday.

Speaking with NBC Los Angeles, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said the department is looking for additionally witnesses before the report is out in the public eye, adding that its release could potentially influence any statements given.

“The witness pool is very shallow at this point,” he said. “I want to make sure we can get folks, we can get their unvarnished statements.”

Though this type of delay is not uncommon, the LAPD has already been criticized by the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, which connected the decision to the Michael Brown case unfolding in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown was killed by a police officer just two days before Ford, and his death has triggered continuing protests against police brutality and excessive force.

“The blocking of the autopsy report of Ford comes on the heels of the release of the autopsy report on Michael Brown which contradicted the police version of how Brown was killed,” the roundtable’s Earl Ofari Hutchinson said on Monday. “The blocking of the release Ford autopsy report further fuels suspicions about the LAPD’s version of the Ford killing.”

As RT reported previously, the 25-year-old Ford was fatally shot by police after an “investigative stop” by police resulted in a “struggle” that saw Ford end up face down on the ground. Ford, who suffered from mental problems and was unarmed, was then reportedly shot in the back multiple times despite witnesses claiming he was complying with police.

“They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications. Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that — that this child has mental problems,” an unnamed man claiming to be Ford’s cousin told local KTLA News.

“The excessive force … there was no purpose for it. The multiple shootings in the back while he’s laying down? No.”

The LAPD disputes this version of events, and has said Ford attempted to take an officer’s gun as he struggled with police.

Fate is now doing a LIFE sentence for pot, and he is not the only one.

The number of people in jail for a plant is staggering. At any one time, 59,300 prisoners charged with or convicted of violating marijuana laws are behind bars. Of those, 17,000 are behind bars for possession ONLY, not trafficking. Dozens of people are doing life without parole.

Enforcing marijuana laws costs an estimated $10-15 billion in direct costs alone. Not to mention the sustained costs of incarceration of the individual who has done nothing to harm anyone. It is estimated that the money spent enforcing useless marijuana laws is double what we spend on education in this country.

The list below should serve as a wake up call to everyone. When a person is found to be in possession of a plant and locked in a cage for it, society has lost its way.

The war on drugs is criminal. Since when did “The pursuit of happiness” become “the pursuit of what we say you can do for happiness and anything else will get you locked in a cage”?

The people at The Human Solution are dedicated to trying to stop this horrible injustice. They have put together a database of people serving many types of sentences for the non-crime of marijuana possession and distribution. Please visit their page and show your support.

Welcome to our POW page. This is a list that is on-going and constantly changing. We call our brothers and sisters in jail/prison for a plant a POW, why? Well, President Nixon declared a WAR on Drugs- and sadly the Federal Gov’t considers cannabis a drug. So, cannabis supporters are targeted out –raided, arrested, convicted, and jailed. This is a list of our POW 420′s doing time for a plant. We got brothers and sisters on this list doing 1 year to LWOP (Life With Out Parole)- Yes, I just said LIFE for pot. We encourage and strongly support you putting POW’s on our list and helping THS keep the most up-dated POW list. But, most importantly pick up a pen and paper and write to a pow today.

—On a side note..as this list is always in the works..we ask that you help us keep this list update by helping us edit the articles we have written about theses POW’s and submit new POW’s -thank you..THS…

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/lies-lapd-officer-recorded/","How Many Lies Can This One LAPD Officer Tell While Being Recorded?","“I can’t turn this camera on and off” as he turns the camera on and off.

Los Angeles, CA — Police accountability specialists Daniel Saulmon, AKA Tom Zebra, along with Ricky Munday, were responding to complaints of people being harassed by police in South Central Los Angeles when they ran into Officer Wank.

As Munday and Saulmon were biking down the road, they had to swerve into traffic to miss a patrol car that was blocking their path. After they passed the patrol car, Officer Wank came very close to the bikers, at which point Munday told him to slow down.

Wank did not like the fact that these two bikers dared to tell him to slow down, so he pulled in front of them and made the unfortunate choice to try and detain this professional cop watching duo.

The funny thing about officer Wank, (besides his infelicitous patronymic) is that he likes to lie.

Upon the initial confrontation, Wank was very aggressive, getting in the face of Munday and shoving him. Once they let the officer know that he was being filmed he completely changed his demeanor, the shoving turned into hand gestures and the yelling became affable chatter.

Two more officers arrive and the conversation escalated a bit.

“You guys yelled at me, I got out of the car to make sure you’re alright,” said Wank, as if to imply that he pulled over and shoved Munday, almost knocking him off of his bike, for his own safety.

If you pay attention closely you will notice that at the 00:38 mark in the video, Wank can be seen turning his body camera on. Amazingly enough Munday and Saulmon noticed this as it was happening.

“Pay attention and listen to me,” Sergeant Wank said. “Everything we do is recorded. It’s not about whether we are.”

“It wasn’t recording when you got out of the vehicle,” noted Munday.

“Of course, it is, the light is green,” Wank said.

“You still have an on and off switch,” Saulmon said.

“You can’t turn it off from here, no,” Wank lied again, “You can push all you want, but you can’t turn it off, there is no on and off switch.”

Now for the hilarity! At 2:25 in the video Wank claims that pressing the button has no effect and he cannot turn off his camera, yet the green light on the camera clearly goes out and then comes back on after he presses the button.

Eventually the group exchanges cards and the interaction is over.

According to PINAC, anticipating a civilian complaint after committing assault and battery and wanting witnesses to confirm his side of the story, Sergeant Wank gathered contact information from two sheriff’s department officers who arrived on the scene.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/lying-cops-show-people-losing-trust-law-enforcement/","These Lying Cops Show Exactly Why So Many People are Losing Trust in “Law” Enforcement","“You can do a u-turn to avoid these checkpoints and we won’t pull you over” —say the police just before pulling people over for doing a u-turn to avoid the checkpoint.

Murfreesboro, TN — A video uploaded to YouTube Saturday epitomizes the reason why police departments nationwide are losing the trust of the ones they ostensibly “protect.”

In fact the very idea that police protect you is a misconception as they will seldom prevent violence. They normally show up after the violence or crime has been committed and then try and find a culprit, or not.

The average response time to a 9-1-1 call is 10 minutes nationwide. In some cases the dispatchers do not even take the caller seriously and the victim ends up dead, when a crime could have actually been prevented.

The reality is that police act as revenue collectors for the state and are there to enforce the law only.

They most assuredly do not “protect and serve.” If you doubt this claim simply refer to Warren v. District of Columbia, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the police do not have a constitutional duty to protect a person from harm.

The officer in the video below affirms this obligation to uphold “the law,” no matter its morality. When one of the men filming asks the officer if he swore an oath to uphold the constitution, the officer says yes but his job is to enforce the law only.

This obligation to enforce the laws, no matter how unscrupulous, encourages police officers to lie and deceive otherwise good people. In the video below this deception is rife throughout.

The makers of the video, purplehat1991, describe the details of this incident:

The day after Thanksgiving, police checkpoints took place all around Tennessee, where they manufacture probable cause with false drug dog alerts, saying “I smell alcohol,” etc. . . in order to force people into detainment. They also have a trailer nearby to strap people down and forcibly take their blood without their consent.

The police accuse the driver of drinking and make him perform a series of tests in order to travel the public roadway freely. (He had not been drinking whatsoever) We catch their lies on camera and then we catch them lie again later when we get out and film THP cruisers going after people that were legally turning around to avoid the “voluntary” checkpoint.

Without further ado, here are another myriad of reasons of why not to trust police. Make sure to watch it all the way to the end.","2014-11-30 13:18:30","1","20.0","31.0","5.0","1.0","5.0","0.0","56.0","20.0","0.0","169.0","10.0","13.0","15","429","88.44","69.60","19.55","13.21","20.43","20.05","82.52","51.28","9.09","5.83","0.23","0.93","1.40","0.93","2.33","3.26","11.19","13.99","6.06","5.13","6.06","2.56","10.72","2.56","2.10","1.86","1.17","1.63","4.66","1.86","2.80","0.93","0.23","0.23","9.09","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.17","10.02","1.17","2.80","0.93","2.10","1.40","3.50","2.33","1.40","0.70","0.00","1.17","0.23","0.47","0.00","0.70","12.12","1.17","0.47","6.53","1.17","3.03","1.40","7.93","1.17","12.82","2.10","5.83","4.43","4.66","2.80","0.00","0.23","0.23","0.23","0.70","0.00","0.47","0.23","0.00","0.00","13.52","5.36","3.50","0.23","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.93","2.80","0.23","0.47","0.00","1959","7.83","21.5","615","426","21","67.79","11.7","8.8","10.5","11.3","86","8.5","18.195117370892017","254","19.25","4","0.49","0","14","5","58","0","44","16","0","1","3","79","14","0","25","1","0","20","5","33","0","0","5","19","0","28","7","9","7","17","11","2","0","0","7"

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/joke-mind-thinks-protecting-serving/","What A Joke. Who in Their Right Mind Thinks This is “Protecting & Serving”?","Is this what police departments nationwide have been reduced to?

June 21, 2014

The war on drugs has become a literal joke.

Two young men who had just gotten off of work decided to stop and get some gas.

One of the young men said the band name “Nickelback” and was overheard by one of Idaho’s finest.

The Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office cop officer quickly began ‘protecting and serving’ by harassing these young men, because he thought he heard “nickel sack.”

Seriously, you cannot make up this absurdity. So what if they actually said nickel sack? Does it really matter?

Another local department’s website describes Marijuana as such:

Marijuana is the mind-altering substance produced from a plant with the scientific name Cannabis Sativa. The drug is used because its primary active chemical, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). It may induce relaxation and heighten the senses.

Who in their right mind thinks it is okay to harass, detain, kidnap, and even kill someone who wants to partake in a substance that “may induce relaxation and heighten the senses”?

Those who would lock someone in a cage for possessing or ingesting a plant that makes them feel good are the real criminals!

The two young men in the video below did one thing right, they filmed the interaction. Other than that they consented to searches, answered questions, and engaged the cops who would have otherwise let them go, or made out to be the fools they are after ordering a search warrant and finding nothing.

Here are your tax dollars at work.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/louisiana-cop-resigns-texts-nggers-pulling-ferguson/","Cop Resigns over Texts About ‘N*ggers,’ ‘Pulling a Ferguson’","A Baton Rouge police officer has resigned after it was discovered that he allegedly sent a string of extremely racist text messages.

When the messages were exposed, Michael Elsbury, who has been with the department for about 15 years, resigned.

Saturday night Mediaite posted a photo of Elsbury on their twitter.

Even though he resigned, Elsbury still faces a criminal investigation, according to Cpl. Don Coppola, a Baton Rouge Police Spokesperson.

The allegations surfaced Wednesday when NAACP state President, Ernest Johnson, said he was shown these racist texts which were allegedly sent by a Baton Rouge cop.

The text read, in part, “They are nothing but a bunch of monkeys. The only reason they have this job is the n*gger, n*gger in them.”

Further on in the texts Elsbury allegedly sent, he says, “I wish someone would pull a Ferguson on them and take them out. I hate looking at those African monkeys at work… I enjoy arresting those thugs with their saggy pants.”

Sadly this only confirms the view of police that many minorities already have; maybe now those who do not directly experience the plight of racism through a badge, may be more aware of its existence.

At least this racist cop is off the streets…for now anyway.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/lose-lawsuits-assault-stay-force-police/","Lose Two Lawsuits for Assault, Stay on the Force, That’s How the Police Do It","As a patrol officer in Minneapolis, Michael Griffin is paid at least $60,000 a year, but he is much more expensive to the city’s tax victims than his salary alone would suggest. Two lawsuits filed against Griffin for crimes committed off-duty will cost more than $400,000.

Last month, the city council approved a $140,000 payout for attorney fees in the case of Ibrahim Regai, who was punched and kicked by Griffin following an incident in a bar. Griffin, who was off-duty, took offense at something Regai said, followed him to another club, beat him to the ground, called another cop, and charged the victim with assaulting an officer. The charge was dropped after video evidence demonstrated that Griffin lied about the incident.

In a second episode, Griffin got into an argument at a bar with three men. After they left, Griffin called another officer to the scene to detain them. Griffin assaulted two of the men, knocking one of them unconscious then picking him up and kicking him in the face. The victim, Jeremy Axel, suffered a concussion and had to have several teeth replaced.

Despite losing the subsequent lawsuit, Griffin is still on the force, and hasn’t faced criminal charges. This is typical of Minneapolis, which has made nearly 100 payouts totaling $14 million for police misconduct since 2006.

As is the case nearly everywhere else, police in Minneapolis have a tendency toward “privileged” criminal violence while off-duty. Former Minneapolis Police Sgt. David Clifford was recently sent to prison after being convicted of first-degree assault in an unprovoked attack on a 40-year-old man.

The victim in the June 2012 attack, Brian Vander Lee, is a father of four who employed in the productive sector. He was talking on a cell phone when Clifford confronted him at a table outside a bar and grill. The SWAT operator, who took offense over something Vander Lee had said, hit him with a punch to the head that knocked him to the ground. As a result of falling head-first onto a concrete surface, the victim suffered trauma so intense that it required two brain surgeries and 40 hours on life support.

The heroic SWAT operator who sucker-punched the unarmed and puzzled victim – and then, displaying the valor for which his profession is celebrated, ran away — insisted that he acted in “self-defense.” Last July he was sentenced to at least twenty-five months in prison.

Although Minneapolis police are bold as Achilles in their dealings with unarmed, non-threatening bar and restaurant patrons, they are much more reserved when dealing with violent criminals. Rafael Lopez was robbed and severely beaten by a gang of at least 10 men on the street outside the Aqua nightclub in Minneapolis — less than ten yards away from the 1st Police Precinct station.

Bruised and bloodied, Lopez attempted to enter the station to file a complaint, only to be met by Officer Aaron Hanson, who angrily told him to leave. As Lopez tried to explain what had just happened to him, two of Hanson’s comrades “came out, put their gloves on and were yelling at me, telling me to get out,” he later recalled.

Lopez had tried to help a friend named Josh Rivera, who was beaten even more severely than he had been. Desperate for assistance, Rivera’s wife Magdalena called 911 A few minutes later – long after he could have provided any help – Officer Hanson ambled outside. After Magdalena described what had happened to her husband and their friend, the officer blithely explained “that he didn’t need to deal with this because it happens all the time,” she testified in an official complaint. Without offering to call an ambulance, or even asking if anybody had been seriously hurt, Hanson quickly retreated into the station and locked the door behind him. It was “literally 10 seconds and he was already going back inside,” Magdalena observes.

Later that morning, Lopez went back to the station to file an incident report.

“He figured police surveillance cameras on the street and at the police station captured the assault,” related the St. Paul Pioneer-Press. “He hoped the videos would lead to the identity of the assailants, whom he suspected were members of a gang because they were all wearing white and red shirts. It turned out he wasted his time.”

A few days after the September 2, 2011 assault, the Minneapolis PD dispatched an official notice to Lopez informing him that “this case does not meet our threshold for investigative assignment at the present time.”

The gallant men of the Minneapolis PD couldn’t be bothered to investigate a violent gang rampage that took place less than thirty feet from a precinct station – in full view of the department’s surveillance cameras. But they can be counted on to mulct the productive citizenry on behalf of the municipal government that pays them, and whose subsidized insurance indemnifies the victims of criminal acts committed by law enforcement officers when they’re off the clock.

“If you’ve got nothing to hide, you’ve got nothing to fear,” right? Here’s how that works in reality. (via Reason)

On Jan. 5, 2012, Paul Valin called the police to report he’d found a backpack containing what he believed to be meth-making equipment. That simple act of good citizenship landed his and wife Cindy’s house on the National Clandestine Laboratory Register [NCLR], the federal Drug Enforcement Agency’s list of meth labs.

Valin spotted a backpack in a river while kayaking. He took it home and opened it up looking for some identification that might point to its owner. Instead, he found tubing and chemicals. Being a good citizen (with nothing to hide), he called local law enforcement who came and removed the backpack… and then put him on a federal list that put his house in the same category as property where drugs had been seized (you know, as opposed to voluntarily and proactively given to police officers).

The NCLR’s website openly admits that no federal agency verifies the information being forwarded to it. Valin’s house was added to this list by local law enforcement, who filled out a standard form that failed to note that Valin had found the backpack and at no point had the “drug lab” ever crossed the threshold of his house (it had been in the back of Valin’s pickup the entire time).

Once Valin was made aware of his home’s placement on this list by a local TV reporter, he contacted the DEA in hopes of being delisted.

Valin sent an email to the DEA explaining the facts of his case and asking that his address be removed from the NCLR. The reply he received three weeks later was not encouraging. An unsigned email from [email protected] explained that Valin’s address had been listed because of a Clandestine Laboratory Seizure form the DMPD submitted to the DEA following the collection of the backpack. According to the email, the DMPD officer who filled out the report had checked the boxes for “abandoned lab” and “boxed lab,” but didn’t include any other information, such as where and how Valin found the backpack.

The email also stated that the DEA was only the “caretaker” of the NCLR site and, again, pointed out that it doesn’t perform any sort of verification of submitted forms. According to the email, Valin had a couple of options: persuade the Des Moines, IA police department to contact the DEA and straighten out its paperwork error or have a local health agency declare his home free from drug contamination.

Unsurprisingly, the DEA’s suggestions were both dead ends.

The second option isn’t possible. No local or state health agencies in Iowa conducts such inspections. The state hasn’t even set any standards for what constitutes meth-related contamination. Valin hasn’t had much luck with the first option, either. He’s still waiting for a reply to the voicemails he left at the DMPD phone number he was told to call.

The good news is that someone finally decided to do something about this error. Special Agent Eric Neubauer of the El Paso branch of the DEA took the Des Moines Police Dept. investigative report (which detailed the whole chain of events) provided to him by Iowa Watchdog and used that info to delist Valin’s home. The DMPD still hasn’t explained why the details on its internal investigative report failed to make their way onto the form sent to the DEA — an omission that put Valin’s home on a national “drug lab” watchlist for two years.

John Vibes

July 17, 2014



A man in Virginia that was charged for firing a gun at police who were attempting to enter his house in the middle of the night, unannounced, has finally been exonerated in a jury trail. Not only did police not announce themselves, but they were also at the wrong address.

Last January, Brandon Watson, of Portsmouth Virginia heard his back door rattling, and saw shadowy figures dressed in black in his back yard. He grabbed his legally owned firearm and went to go see what was going on.

When Watson approached his back door he announced himself and yelled that he was armed. Just then, two laser beams drifted across the room and stopped on his chest, at which point he fired a warning shot in response.

Brandon explained to a local reporter, “We ran upstairs very quickly … she saw guys in all black from right here in this window looking down. I announced myself, ‘Who is that? Who is that? I have a gun.’ And as soon as I said that, two red laser beams were on my chest, so I looked at the red laser beams on my chest, and I fired a warning shot,” Watson said.

After firing a single shot through the window, Watson ran across the street to get help from a neighbor. When he returned to his house he was surrounded by police and they ordered him to drop his weapon, which he immediately did.

“They said, ‘we just got news you shot at an officer.’ I said, ‘An officer? Nobody came to my door. What do you mean an officer? I didn’t know there were any officers in my backyard,’” he told WAVY.com.

Following the intrusion, Watson was arrested and charged with reckless use of a firearm.

In the year and a half since the incident, there have been a number of court cases, the first of which Watson was found guilty by a judge. After appealing his case, Watson finally got a his trial in front of a jury, who threw his charge out after deliberating for less than an hour.

The jury caught the officers in multiple lies throughout the course of the trial, and were struck by the fact that this whole thing could have been prevented had the officers been competent enough to respond to the correct house.

The fact that this jury was so skeptical of the police and felt sympathy for Watson’s situation, is a positive indication that the hearts and minds of the average people are starting to understand the dangers of the growing police state.

"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/man-faces-jail-time-installing-wind-turbine-property/","Man Faces Jail Time For Installing Wind Turbine on Own Property","A Minnesota man is risking jail time by refusing to remove a wind turbine from his property. The local government and a few nosy neighbors have been disputing the construction of this turbine for over 4 years, since it was built in 2010.

Jay Nygard actually owns a company called Go Green Energy, which sells wind turbines in other areas of Minnesota, but he isn’t able to do so in Orono where he lives because of permit and licensing laws. These are the same laws that are preventing Nygard from building on his own property.

In recent years there have been at least 8 lawsuits back and forth between Nygard, the local government and his neighbors. The neighbors claim that his windmills are an eyesore and a nuisance, but in reality it isn’t actually any of their business.

Nygard has the right to do whatever he wants with his own property, but unfortunately in a democracy such as the United States, the property rights of an individual can be overridden according to the whims of politicians and the demands of uninvolved third parties.

Earlier last month, a district judge representing the local government demanded that Nygard and his wife remove the turbine. The judge threatened to throw the man in jail if he left the turbine on his property, but Nygard is standing his ground and refusing to give in.

“They seem to think they can control our property, and what we do on our property is their business,” Nygard told the Star Tribune. “It’s my right to have it.”

“I’m ready to go to jail for everyone’s right,” he said. “If that’s what it takes, that’s what I’ll do.”

Last week we reported on a similar case of a 9-year-old boy in the suburbs of Kansas City who opened up a free library in his front yard, for anyone in his neighborhood to use, and it got shut down by the government and by neighbors who could not mind their own business. Like Nygard, the young boy has been unfazed by the government bullying and has already been thinking of ways that he can beat the system.

President Barack Obama bowed, looking delighted.

His greeter, after all, was a 55-inch-tall, give or take, humanoid robot with the look of a diminutive Star Wars storm trooper.

“It’s nice to meet you, too,” Obama said, pausing to watch the robot, named ASIMO, perform during a tour of the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation.

Despite Obama’s background in constitutional law, there’s a presidential geek side that always seems charmed, if not bemused, by technological advances.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/double-standard-just-make-fair/","The Left’s Infuriating Double Standard! Just to Make Things Fair?","So, even though this has been a fantastic week for myself, I decided that I needed to live up to my reputation here at Clash and hurt some feelings. I really do dislike taking these liberals apart every week, I swear. That’s why for about the last month I have been trying to head into some other equally important topics. However, I have given all the religious and dating advice that I have so I am reverting back to the evil little Conservative devil that I am. I’m not going to pretend that this is going to change anyone’s mind, but honestly this is about telling the truth to those who care about hearing it, not begging liberals to be reasonable.

Let’s get started hurting feelings. As you can tell by the title, America has become all about the double standards. Everybody has double standard that applies to them and unfortunately they will always be there. Societal stereotypes and double standards are just one of the many ills we have to deal with in our culture. We aren’t going to change these double standards without some real social reforms that, frankly, I don’t see on the horizon. The double standards we can change are those at the political level.

Let’s start with my favorite. Before Barack Obama’s name dried on the office of the President he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. So, President Obama the savior of America, was such a man of peace that he got the trophy before he ever played the game. To this day it is still trumpeted as such an accomplishment.

Well, why don’t we look at the world and see what the president of peace has done now with six years in office. Barack Obama carried on the policy of drone strikes from George Bush with all of the veracity of Michael Moore on all you can eat night. In his almost six years in office Barack Obama has launched eight times as many drone strikes in non-theater countries as Gorge Bush did in eight years. These drone strikes have killed more than 2,400 people. More than ten percent of the people killed have been deemed innocent civilians.

Barack Obama has carried out a campaign of regime change across the Middle East and now into Eastern Europe. In each one of these countries we have seen massive violence against the civilian population as well as the Christian population. More than one hundred thousand dead in Syria, Christians burned to death in Egypt and United States personnel brutally murdered and dragged through the streets of Libya. An event by the way that marks the first time American bodies have been dragged through the streets of Africa since the last American Messiah, Bill Clinton, had us tied up in Africa.

Now Barack Obama and his bimbo friend Victoria Nuland have sent Ukraine on a collision course with civil war.

However in all of this, I still hear that Dubya, Cheney and Rummy are war criminals. George Bush is a war criminal for starting the war and Barack Obama is a patriot for never closing GITMO and bombing countries we aren’t at war with. Since Obama took the oath in 2008 there hasn’t been a single world conflict that there isn’t a red white and blue signature on. President Obama has killed more civilians with his regime change and meddling than any other president in history, yet George Bush is a Nazi war criminal?

Clive Bundy is walked into making an ill-advised and terribly worded statement about slavery. He said some unadvisable and, frankly, incorrect things about slavery.

However, unlike some of the conservative media and gutless members of the Senate, one of which would never have my vote in a primary, I am not going to distance myself from his fight and issue. Instead, I want to talk about the double standard.

Harry Reid used this same evil term “Negro”. Lucky for Harry that Barack Obama was so magnanimous to publicly pardon him and give him the nod. Because, you see, in American culture today you can say whatever racist garbage you want as long as you have the blessing of a popular black guy or if you are a popular black guy. Chris Rock referred to the President of the United States as our first “zebra president” and no one batted and eye. What if Rush Limbaugh called President Obama a Zebra?

I could list a hundred instances in which white and black liberals are allowed to say anything racist that they want; or that black hip hop artists are allowed to use the “N” word with impunity more than three hundred times in a sixty minute album. The race card is a double standard. If we really hate racism so damn much, why do we glorify it in our movies, music and political dealings? Why do we allow people who do nothing but push those who are racists to the top of the media stack, unless they are white or their name is David Duke? If it is protected speech for Barack Obama’s pastor and mentor to say that the death of more than three thousand Americans is “America’s chicken’s coming home to roost” than why isn’t David Duke afforded the same protection?

We can do this all day but the final piece of my own personal puzzle for this week is less about politics and more about us as people. Who remembers Treyvon Martin? Treyvon was killed and the NAACP and all their hommies at the New Black Panther Party showed up in the small town of Sanford. Hell, half the country ran to defend Treyvon and his civil rights. Since then an uncountable and frankly nauseating number of young white men and women have been actually murdered by out of control African-American teenagers for their wallets, purses, cellphones and sometimes for no other reason than they are out for a jog. Where are all these people who cared so much about civil rights? When are we going to stop these ridiculous excuses for evil people and stop blaming everything but the root cause which is the disgusting society that we not only live in but also built with all of our liberal niceties?

Why is George Bush a war criminal? Why can’t everyone be protected under the first amendment? Why isn’t every American’s right to life and safety protected? I can answer all three questions easily. It’s a double standard just to make it fair. Barack Obama, Jeremiah Wright and Treyvon Martin are all afforded liberties that we are not. You see, liberals in America have set up a paradigm in our country that says only certain people are deserving of these various “passes” from the rules because they are a minority or because they are sixteen or, my favorite, because they are our first minority president and the only reason I have a problem is because he is a minority.

If you guys don’t believe me, when you read the news today just ask yourself. The answer you will come to is that it is a double standard just to make it fair. President Obama inherited a mess, Jeremiah Wright was a product of the racial 1960’s and Treyvon Martin was just an innocent kid skipping home with Skittles. They need the extra help just so it’s fair. Well, here is a dose of fairness. We are living in a time that no longer abides this fairness, from here on in, those of you who want everything to be fair do all of us a favor and grow up. You want life to be fair, stop searching for racism and the ills of the last century. Honestly, it went out of style with The Gap and is equally unattractive.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/even-little-league-actively-promoting-socialism/","Even Little League?!?! Actively Promoting Socialism","As a mom, I am overly sensitive about everything that goes on in our culture because it is important to me to know and understand everything that will influence the thinking, and thus actions, of my children. They are sponges; so as a Christian, I am cautious about what my children watch, whom my children play with, and where they get their information.

Don’t get me wrong, we are not a family that is hiding from the culture. We are training our children to engage the culture with the beliefs we choose to instill in them. We aren’t hiding from the evils of the world; we are training our children to rid society of evil. So, in today’s world of social media, educational entertainment, and SmartPhones that my two year old can navigate better than I can, I must be vigilant about what they consume because, as you know, they consume EVERYTHING; and I want to make sure that the foundations of what we believe are the bedrock of their thinking and acting.

In particular, I am on the lookout for anything that might smack of a liberal agenda, anything that smacks of a communist agenda, etc. What I have found is that even the sweetest of cartoons are training our children to defy their parents. What I have found is that even the nicest of parenting magazines are training parents to allow their children to be in charge. What I have found is that even Little League Baseball (or most other children’s sports…just pick one) is conditioning our children to embrace, accept socialism.

OK, now I know I’ve gone too far accusing the Little League. What could possibly be wrong with a bunch of sweaty boys hitting a ball and running around some bases with their dads? We don’t actually play Little League; we’ve entered the soccer world so I guess I’m officially a soccer mom. However, one of my dearest friends has a boy who plays Little League on a team that his father coaches. Awww, the picture of family goodness oozes out of that whole scenario. I love it!

But a couple of weeks ago, my friend, whose permission I got to quote this, posted the following on Facebook: “My husband overheard the following by a player on [my son’s] baseball team yesterday when they were losing, ‘What does it matter if we win or lose, we get a trophy anyway.’ …And the comments are too many to count.”

End of article…need I say more?! That statement should tell you everything you need to know about how strong the pull of socialism is on the next generation. Was this kid serious? What seven year old thinks that way? What seven year old doesn’t want to WIN?! I don’t know about you, but my five year old wants to win. We want him to win. We encourage him to work hard, train to win.

Now don’t flip out on me and go the other direction and think that we are those crazy screaming parents who will do anything to make sure their kids win. We training our son to be a good team player, enjoy the game, and show respect to the other players…win or lose. But the last thing we want him to walk away learning from sports is that it doesn’t matter how hard he works because everyone gets the same reward.

That is socialism! Everyone gets the same thing regardless of how hard they work. Everyone IS rewarded whether they have done anything or not. Don’t worry; you don’t have to work; the powers that be will make sure you get your fair share. Just imagine if corporate America thought like the Little League. Those businesses and the employees of those businesses wouldn’t last more than a week.

Call me crazy; but if my son gets a trophy with all the other kids in his soccer league, we’ll be sure to explain to him in great detail that this is not how the world works. My son, since he was four, has been explaining to random strangers that “if you don’t work, you don’t eat.” That may sound intense for a child that young; but if parents don’t actively, strategically, and intentionally train their children to resist and understand the falsehoods of socialism, the system will easily transform them into communists.

Simple as that.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/everyone-look-pro-abortion-pelosi-washes-feet-immigrant-children/","Everyone! Look! Pro-Abortion Pelosi Washes the Feet of Immigrant Children","It’s already well established that those on the left are notorious for making up the rules as they go along, especially when it comes to Christianity, a religion they typically view with derision. Therefore, the only conclusion one can come to is that Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi, both of whom profess to be Christians, must think that just as they believe the Constitution is a living/evolving document, the Bible is also open to being revised to agree with the left’s progressive agenda.

Take Nancy Pelosi, please…er I mean, for instance. This is a woman who calls herself a Catholic yet she is a vocal proponent of abortion on demand, which even the most ardent abortion supporter, if honest, would admit is considered murder by the God who “knit us together in our mother’s womb” (Ps 139:13).

The only explanation for liberals considering themselves people of faith while putting their approbation on abortion and other anti-Biblical lifestyles is that they’ve managed to convince themselves that their morally-relativistic opinions and self-aggrandizing actions take precedence over the inerrant, unchanging tenets of God’s word.

It could be that, while in the process of revising the Constitution and misinterpreting the Bible, the Obama and Pelosi types have convinced themselves that good deeds cancel out bad ones.

Think about liberals’ habit of making sure the world knows about every act of look-at-me benevolence they bestow on the less fortunate. Clearly Scripturally illiterate, Bible-revisers are no doubt unaware of what God says about public exhibitions of giving and caring.

Unbeknownst to progressives, the goal is not to broadcast good deeds or seek worldly praise, but rather to serve God in secret where only He sees and rewards.

As they make sure everyone notices and responds to their self-indulgent acts of kindness with applause, liberals relish being showered with praise for empathetic acts that they’re certain far surpass actions and gestures by people they know nothing about, but still deem hardhearted.

The only explanation for such bizarre beliefs and behavior is that liberals must think that in the mind of God “altruistic” policies such as issuing food stamps cancel out the slaughter of 60 million unborn human beings.

It’s either that, or by attempting to influence large numbers of clueless people through public displays of mock Christianity, pro-abortion liberals gain the consensus they think enables them to publicly refer to themselves as Christians.

A person calling him- or herself a Christian while supporting laws that are diametrically opposed to the Word of God illustrates the level of delusion under which those who “clean the outside of the cup, but are full of robbery and wickedness” operate (Luke 11:39).

As for Barack Obama, it’s already confirmed that he lies, cheats, abuses the sick and dying, tramples on religious freedom, mocks Bible-believing Americans, supports Planned Parenthood, and puts his approbation on babies born alive in botched abortions being left to die without water, warmth and oxygen. Yet, all he has to do is quote a couple of lines of Scripture at a prayer breakfast and his admirers insist he is a Christian.

In like manner, on Holy Thursday, Nancy Pelosi, who besides abortion and gay marriage also stands on the side of illegal immigrants’ breaking the law, decided to make a public mockery of Jesus’, the humblest of kings, washing the feet of His disciples prior to being crucified and suffering on Golgotha’s hill.

Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a woman who has zero problem with the termination of the lives of unborn children, displayed her own version of Holy Thursday compassion by joining San Francisco Bishop Marc Andrus to wash the feet of immigrant children at Saint John the Evangelist Episcopal Church.

Then, after humbly kneeling, silver ewer in hand, with classic “look-at-me” liberal self-promotion Nancy proudly announced her foot-washing theatrics on Twitter.

Could it be that in Ms. Pelosi’s mind, washing the feet of two children makes up for the death of the 3,000 pre-born children in America who died on the same day Nancy the Foot Washer was scrubbing the toes of a couple of kids who miraculously, no thanks to her, made it out of the womb alive?

With that said, Nancy, Barack and every other so-called “caring’” liberal on the planet can call themselves anything they want. They can feed the poor, care for the sick, wash feet, and even quote Scripture, but if they support the anti-life, pro-death agenda of the left, according to God’s word they typify those whom the One who can see hearts addressed when He said:

“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside is full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.”","2014-04-20 20:42:32","0","41.0","19.0","8.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","83.0","52.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","20.0","10","817","90.72","82.39","6.69","60.58","37.14","24.24","80.66","47.74","10.89","5.39","0.37","0.24","0.37","1.84","2.57","5.51","7.96","16.16","5.26","3.67","5.63","0.61","12.00","3.92","1.71","2.08","1.47","1.10","5.51","3.67","1.84","0.12","0.86","0.24","11.75","0.49","0.00","1.10","1.22","8.81","2.82","1.10","1.35","1.10","1.59","2.08","1.71","1.10","0.37","0.24","4.53","1.59","2.33","1.10","0.49","7.22","1.22","1.47","3.79","1.10","0.37","2.08","8.45","0.24","9.91","1.10","6.24","2.57","1.59","0.24","0.24","0.12","4.41","1.47","0.49","0.00","0.12","0.12","0.24","0.00","16.40","2.69","6.98","0.37","0.00","0.12","0.12","2.20","1.47","1.84","0.49","0.12","3927","9.09","37.63636363636363","1180","795","23","44.82","14.2","15.6","13.18","20.1","188","13.25","25.29911949685535","439","32.73","2","0.45","0","30","10","77","0","116","64","1","1","8","118","70","3","61","0","0","44","9","29","0","1","4","22","0","24","15","30","14","31","28","4","11","0","3"

Why would anyone even ask Mr.Bundy to comment on such things? As if what Cliven Bundy thinks about the state of the “Negro” in America has any bearing on property rights, or the fact that the federal government has sent S.W.A.T. teams to collect a million dollar tax bill. Even famous “Negro” Wesley Snipes was politely led off to federal prison for a tax evasion of well over 2 million dollars.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/fort-hood-gun-free-zones-progressive-insanity/","Fort Hood, Gun-Free Zones and ‘Progressive’ Insanity","They say that lightning never strikes twice in the same place. Not true. It does if you stand high atop a cliff’s edge waving a lightning rod above your head during a thunderstorm. In fact, in the unlikely event you survive the first strike, it’ll keep right on striking until you climb down.

So-called “gun-free zones” are lightning rods for mass murder. It’s time we climbed down from the cliff’s edge.

America mourns yet another needless and preventable mass shooting at Fort Hood, Texas. When will gun-grabbing liberals learn?

In a blunt and provocatively titled, though well-reasoned post, submitted shortly after Wednesday’s shooting, Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft charged: “Obama Is Responsible for Latest Fort Hood Murders – Still a Gun-Free Zone.”

Wrote Hoft:

In 2009 Islamist killer Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army major and psychiatrist, fatally shot 13 people and injured more than 30 others at Fort Hood, Texas. Fort Hood was a gun-free zone. Hasan reportedly screamed, “Allahu Akbar!” as he committed his mass murder. …

Barack Obama termed this Islamic terrorist attack “workplace violence.” Complete lunacy. After the first mass killing nothing changed. Fort Hood is still a gun-free zone. President Bill Clinton’s gun-free policies are still in place. Today there was another mass shooting at Fort Hood. Soldiers were told to take cover and hide like cowards as a crazed gunman shot at least 14 Americans on base. The shooter, Ivan Lopez, then shot himself in the head. These deaths are the result of failed policies. These deaths are the result of a dangerous “gun free zone” policy. The Obama administration is responsible for this mass shooting. They witnessed this before. They didn’t learn a thing. Gun-free zones are death zones,

concluded Hoft.

Of course, no one but Ivan Lopez is responsible for his own horrific crimes. Still, this Obama administration is likewise responsible for its own criminally horrific incompetence.

By maintaining his demonstrably failed “gun-free zone” policy at Fort Hood (and anywhere for that matter), Obama may as well have beckoned: “Hey, would-be mass murderers, we’ve still got some unarmed soldiers here. Come and finish ‘em off!”

This president is undeniably culpable. His reckless insistence upon preserving this obtuse, liberal – but I repeat myself – gun-grabbing policy rendered defenseless, once again, the fine servicemen and women of Fort Hood. It kept in place the same mass-murder-rich environment in which Nidal Malik Hasan committed the first Fort Hood “fish-in-a-barrel” soldier hunt.

And the only people surprised are you gun-control nutters.

Here’s the thing about liberalism, which is really cultural Marxism, euphemistically tagged “progressivism”: It’s never worked and it never will. It can’t. It’s a material impossibility.

“Progressivism” can no more work than can one answer a nonsense question like, “How big is blue?” As with all similar such humanistic efforts to achieve a man-made earthly utopia, “progressivism” is a hopeless non-starter.

Why? Because “progressivism” is utterly detached … Keep Reading the Rest at: Fort Hood, Gun-Free Zones and ‘Progressive’ Insanity

CNSNews – In 20 percent of American families in 2013, according to new data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), not one member of the family worked.

A family, as defined by the BLS, is a group of two or more people who live together and who are related by birth, adoption or marriage. In 2013, there were 80,445,000 families in the United States and in 16,127,000—or 20 percent–no one had a job.

Clash Daily Contributor

Did you catch the newest Leftist buzzword? “Equal Pay!”

They’re actually quite good at this, those Leftists, because they understand how easily manipulated the low-information voters are, and they know how chanting such slogans so conveniently riles up their voter base, which really begs the question: is the pathetic performance of America’s public schools a feature or a bug for Leftists? But I digress.

Let’s recall some of those buzzwords of the past that cropped up just before important elections: “War on Women;” “Income Inequality;” “Vote Suppression;” etc.

“Sustainability” is another buzzword that Glenn Beck and others have thoroughly vetted. Each of these buzzwords and concepts can easily be refuted with some simple facts and logic, but Leftist mobs aren’t into facts and logic. It’s much more fun for them to chant the slogans and enjoy the surge of self-righteousness their “fight the Man” moment brings them.

Meanwhile, the nation suffers under the Leftist Man.

“Vote Suppression” is an Orwellian double-speak buzzword used to hide what’s actually going on when people don’t have to show ID to vote. What’s actually going on is voter fraud. The nation suffers because the wrong people get voted in when they win by voter fraud. And if the wrong people are no longer afraid of ever losing at the ballot box because voter fraud guarantees their re-election, the Republic is finished.

“War on Women” is just a stupid slogan. So we on the right dismissed it at first, forgetting how stupid people can be. There sat that wealthy, 30-something-year-old student, Sandra Fluke, such a strong, independent, full of grrrrrl-power feminist, who was suddenly shocked to find out that her Catholic university didn’t want to pay for her birth control , and she was helpless, helpless I tell you, under such militant oppression, because she couldn’t afford birth control. We laughed, because shouldn’t powerful independent women be able to pay for their own birth control? But it worked for way too many voters.

Throw in some awkward statements about “legitimate rape” by a Republican running for office, and the “War on Women” buzzword took hold, even as Democrat women swooned over Bill Clinton’s convention speech (ah yes, Clinton, whose treatment of individual women somehow never reflects on all Democrat politicians the way Todd Akin’s comment reflected on all Republicans). Women who shrieked that Republicans were conducting a “War on Women” voted for Bill Clinton, Anthony Weiner and Bob Filner’s party. The “War on Women” buzzword brought too many hysterical, unthinking female voters into the Democrat camp. And here we all are, women too, languishing economically and culturally under President Obama’s sixth year in office.

“Income inequality” is truly a dangerous buzzword. America rose in greatness as her people worked to follow their dreams and trusted that hard work would be rewarded. Government tampering with “income inequality” amounts to pure wealth transference. Sane people understand that a plumber, a farmer, an electrician, a construction-site foreman, or someone with a degree in a STEM field, is much more useful for civilization than someone with no skills who cannot find higher-payer jobs, or someone with a degree in “gender studies” and “community organizing.” Someone who earned a useful STEM degree and/or proved they have beneficial, productive skills deserves a higher income than someone who basically partied at college for 4 years and comes out at the end with a huge debt load and a useless ability to parrot dumb Leftist slogans about “cisgender oppression,” and wussily mews about “trigger warnings”. Take away the incentive of a STEM major to work hard because she/he will only earn as much as a “community organizer,” and America will go down.

Government enforcement of “income equality” will reduce individual incentive and America’s exceptional-ism to the point that we might as well just concede that the USSR finally won the Cold War. “We pretend to work and they pretend to pay us” was a wry Soviet workers’ expression that will become our own. (An aside: did any of you mark how President Obama summed up his interview with the Pope? Hint: he used the buzzword “income inequality.”)

Now the latest buzzword: “Equal Pay” … for equal work. Yes, indeed, that’s fair. But if the work that women do isn’t equal, women should not be paid equally. If women actually do work that is equal to the work men are doing, but earn less for exactly the same output, then why wouldn’t greedy capitalists hire only women? The simple fact is, women in the workforce statistically have different jobs than men in the workforce, and not all jobs earn the same wages. A teacher doesn’t make the same income as an engineer. A secretary doesn’t make the same income as a boss. A nurse doesn’t make the same income as a doctor. A lawyer who works much less hours than her male colleagues because of all the time she needs to spend with her children will not be paid the same as those male colleagues, or rise in rank at the same pace. She’s doing less productive work for the company than the men are. Simple. It’s obvious to the thinking minds among us, but not to the slogan-chanting Leftist crowds.

Just think of all the delicious lawsuits headed companies’ way with the laws about “Equal Pay” that the Obama administration is pushing. Lawyers will benefit, certainly, and some of their litigious-happy clients, but not the average working person (no, not even women). Companies will go down as they’re fettered with more red tape and profit-reducing policies, and more men will check out of the workforce if they find themselves carrying the heavy loads for companies, having to take up the slack for women who work much less hours and are much less productive but still receive the same salary as the men. “Equal Pay” is also just mere wealth transference, in the end. Only there’s nothing “mere” about it. It will kill the economy.

Leftist buzzwords: we roll our eyes when we hear them, we laugh sometimes, we’re incredulous at other times because we can’t believe people are this ridiculously dumb so as to believe them. Yet the buzzwords work on the mobs that the Leftists control.

Leftist buzzwords indicate where the country is going when Leftists win. The buzzwords warn us about what’s coming. And we all know there’s more to come.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/giddy-western-states-move-take-federal-land/","GIDDY UP: Western States Move to Take Over Federal Land","Like a mustang tied to a fence post, many westerners for years have resisted Uncle Sam’s control of land they say more properly belongs to states or counties – or to nobody at all except the ranchers, miners, and loggers who work the land for its natural resources.

The tussle over Cliven Bundy’s 400 cows – grazing on federal land, although he refuses to pay the required fees now amounting to more than $1 million – sharpens this debate, which has featured state legislators, county officials, environmentalists, and federal judges (all of whom have ruled against Mr. Bundy).

In Salt Lake City Friday, representatives from Utah, Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, Oregon, and Washington met for a “Legislative Summit on the Transfer of Public Lands.”

“Those of us who live in the rural areas know how to take care of lands,” Montana state Sen. Jennifer Fielder said at a news conference. “We have to start managing these lands. It’s the right thing to do for our people, for our environment, for our economy and for our freedoms.”

In other words, today’s revival of the “Sagebrush Rebellion” is as much about political philosophy as it is about great stretches of the largely-arid territory west of the 100th meridian splitting the Dakotas and running down through Texas.

Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, will be nominated to take her place, according to multiple White House sources.



The White House press office announced Thursday night that he would announce the nomination at 11:00 a.m. Friday, a few hours before he departs for fundraisers, and a speech to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, in New York City.

Sebelius was not expected to remain in the Obama administration through the end of the president’s second term, and several news outlets reported late Thursday that a White House official said she told Obama in March that she would be ready to leave ‘once open enrollment ended.’

She said in an interview with The Huffington Post on March 31, however – the last day of that six-month period – that she would stay at the top of the HHS organizational chart until Obamacare’s second open enrollment period arrived in November.



‘I’m in,’ Sebelius said then. But now she’s out.

The timing of her departure is designed to allow her to leave with a scrap of honor, coming just a week after Obama announced that his administration had exceeded its target of 7 million enrollees after months of fiasco.

The White House aims for her resignation to soften the constant barrage of controversies connected with the president’s flagship policy.

Republicans were quick to pounce Thursday, confounding those hopes.","2014-04-11 10:08:10","0","34.0","17.0","8.0","0.0","18.0","0.0","82.0","52.0","0.0","143.0","0.0","20.0","10","258","97.47","71.95","32.15","32.42","23.45","24.03","79.46","41.86","8.91","5.43","0.39","0.00","0.00","5.04","0.00","3.49","8.91","16.28","4.65","1.16","3.10","0.39","10.85","5.04","1.55","0.39","3.49","1.16","1.94","1.16","0.78","0.00","0.00","0.78","7.75","0.00","0.00","3.88","1.16","3.88","0.00","0.78","1.94","0.39","0.00","1.16","4.26","1.94","1.55","0.78","0.78","0.39","0.39","0.00","0.00","5.43","0.00","0.78","5.04","0.39","0.00","3.88","5.43","1.55","23.64","3.49","7.75","11.63","5.81","0.00","1.94","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.57","4.65","4.26","0.39","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.39","0.78","3.10","0.00","0.00","1269","8.61","29.333333333333332","396","257","11","56.18","13.9","11.2","12.94","14.6","62","10.3","21.009805447470818","163","24.78","2","0.43","0","5","6","25","0","36","18","0","0","4","38","50","1","8","0","0","8","7","6","0","0","1","10","0","11","15","4","5","1","4","0","1","0","0"
"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/gop-civil-war-three-kinds-republicans/","GOP CIVIL WAR: THREE KINDS OF REPUBLICANS","Reading from the Wall St. Journal, John McCain famously referred to tea-party supporters as hobbits. I’m not sure that a troll calling me a hobbit is an insult, but to build from the metaphor, it took a union of elves, dwarves, and men to slay the dragon and stay the war. I’ll leave it to the reader to sort out just who is who.

I must begin with an admission: I am a proud Republican. I wasn’t always able to say that and in the chance that you may stop reading at this point, allow me to qualify that statement by first saying that John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Myth McConnell and John Boehner are a constant source of agita. My feelings toward them verge on loathing. Now let me draw out the distinction.

There are three basic categories of Republicans: Party, Platform, and Independents. Let’s start with the “Party” Republican. The “Party” Republican is like the annoying frat boy; he wears his jersey and is only consumed with winning positions of power. He’s a team player when it is to his benefit. The team mascot here is not the elephant, it’s the RINO. The “Party” Republican won’t fight for every Republican nor will he stand for the Party’s principles. As a matter of fact, he’ll sabotage Republicans that threaten the status quo and his position, and principles are not something to emulate as much as they are obstacles to overcome. There will be times when the “Party” Republican will even work with Democrats against “Platform” Republicans. (See Mark Kirk in Illinois and the Pennsylvanian Republican Party in the last gubernatorial election.)

The “Party” Republican will only stand for “the pursuit of happiness,” and in that way, he’s no Republican at all – he’s a Whig. He will embrace terms like “fiscal conservative” because he doesn’t have the testicular fortitude to stand for the Life and Liberty of the unborn. He will mock the idea of a “one-issue” voter, completely ignoring the fact that the Republican Party was born on one issue – and it wasn’t the flat tax.

Now let’s describe the Independent. The “Independent” Republican is a new phenomenon. He was born out of frustration of seeing the “Party” Republicans ruin the label. Hypocrisy, corruption, and the “old-boy” network have this Republican too embarrassed to continue to carry the name, so although he votes “for and with” Republicans over 90% of the time, he won’t admit to it in public. It’s like the Christian who stops going to church and bitches about “organized religion;” they still believe in God, but they can’t stand his followers. “Independent” Republicans don’t want to be in the team picture with the frat boys.

Then there is the “Platform” Republican, of which, I include myself. I was never a “Party” Republican because I grew up watching what these types tried to do to Ronald Reagan. After Bush the senior, I became an “Independent” Republican and probably would still be one if I didn’t start to meditate on the founding of the Party and the Party’s platform. When you read the party platform and know the party’s history, what’s not to love?

The Republican Party was founded on the principles enunciated in the Declaration of Independence: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.”

They realized that “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness” were not to be pitted against one another but must be equally honored and ultimately extended to the black man. The Republican enshrined in its platform the most beautiful reflection of what America should be if we took our founding documents seriously. It still does.

Listen to how the platform describes two issues that “Party” Republicans are trying to hide from today -The Sanctity and Dignity of Human Life and Preserving and Protecting Traditional Marriage:

Faithful to the “self-evident” truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed . . . The institution of marriage is the foundation of civil society. Its success as an institution will determine our success as a nation. It has been proven by both experience and endless social science studies that traditional marriage is best for children.

The Republican Platform, like The U.S. Constitution and The Declaration of Independence, is a document worth fighting for and standing behind. Pretenders that call themselves “Republicans” and “Americans,” but abandon the principles that make one such, should not determine our legacy or our children’s destiny. Because lesser men actively oppose these documents is no reason for the faithful to abandon the cause.

A most depressing thing it is to read the current Republican platform and then survey the men and women who are supposedly representing it. The difference between the two platforms is that The Republican Platform is a brilliant reflection of our founding documents while the Democrat platform is straight out of the pit of hell. The problem is that there are so few Republicans who honor their platform while the Democrats stand by theirs almost to the letter. In this way, the Democrat politician is more faithful to his charter than is the Republican.

If the “Party” Republicans succeed in pushing the “Independents” and the “Platform” Republicans from the party and they abandon the platform – that will be the day they become the New Whig Party. That will be the hour that I take my allegiance elsewhere. Until then, I will fight. And I will shout from the rooftops that the “Platform” Republican is the true Republican. Time to take our party back!

A wise man once said that “To view true Christianity, one must nearly ignore all Christians.” In light of today’s “Republicans,” I would paraphrase that and say, “To view true Republicanism, one must nearly ignore all Republicans.”

I love my party not because I love Boehner, Graham, and McCain; but in spite of them. I love my party because its platform is beautiful and honorable and deserves a vigorous defense.

I ask you, do you hate America because Barack Obama and the left have desecrated the nation with foolish and corrupt leadership or do you still love America for what she was, what our Founder’s intended her to be, and what you hope to reclaim one day for your children and children’s children?

It’s tempting to walk away from a disaster, I know; but I ask you to simply read our founding documents once more, to live by them, and to demand it of those that represent you.

Don’t “We the People” owe it to God and country? Don’t we owe it to our fathers and our sons, to fight for the right to live free?

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/gun-free-zones-shooting-ranges-criminals/","Gun-Free Zones: Shooting Ranges for Criminals","I recently heard someone refer to gun-free zones as “shooting ranges for criminals.” After experiencing violent, unthinkable tragedies at Fort Hood in Texas and a Pennsylvania high school within just one week, the controversial yet unavoidable issue of personal protection is once again at the forefront of the political scene. The New York Times published an article on April 9th titled “Again, President Obama Offers Comfort at Fort Hood After Soldiers Are Killed.” More like, “Again, President Obama Used a Solemn Ceremony to Push His Radical Unconstitutional Agenda.”

In his usual glib and monotone reading of the teleprompter, the President spoke to mourners about the ongoing pain Fort Hood has experienced since the 2009 shooting spree by “radical” Muslim military psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, who mercilessly claimed 13 American souls

.

Obama went on to say: “This tragedy tears at wounds still raw from five years ago. Once more, soldiers who survived foreign war zones were struck down here at home, where they’re supposed to be safe. We still do not know exactly why.”

Well, POTUS, the difference between protecting America in a foreign war zone and domestically is the presence of firearms for protection. You see, America has become its own little war zone because the mentally ill and evil are preying on everyone and anyone, knowing full well their prey cannot protect themselves. This is partly why they do what they do. Fatalities do not mean anything to them, so why are we continuing to allow innocent people to die at their hands? Why are military members, some of our most trusted keepers of freedom, not entitled to protect themselves against those who wish to harm them? The left is perfectly fine with the military possessing firearms abroad and their security teams armed, but who is protecting those who protect us?

The glaring contradiction that “gun-free zones are safer” is the undeniable fact that in more instances than not, a gun has actually ended the attack either directly or indirectly. Indirectly meaning a firearm was brandished and the perpetrator either committed suicide or surrendered. The Fort Hood tragedies in 2009 and 2014, the D.C. Navy Yard shooting earlier this year, Clackamas Town Center mall shooting in 2012, the New York AT&T store shooting in 2010, and the Trolley Square shooting in Salt Lake City in 2007, are but a few of the numerous violent attacks that have been subdued by a firearm. Are liberals going so far to say that had these firearms not been used to subdue the suspect(s), lives would have not been saved? Whether liberals and anti-gun advocates like it or not, guns save lives.

It is incredibly ignorant, in fact dangerous, to believe that it’s perfectly acceptable for law enforcement, military (abroad, of course) and Congressional security teams should be permitted to use firearms to protect them, yet a law abiding American citizen cannot. Can you imagine if another military officer at Fort Hood or a firearms trained faculty member in Pennsylvania were packing heat and could have ended the bloodbath before lives were lost? It’s an atrocity to continue to allow places like military bases, schools, malls and other public places to remain gun-free with the unthinkable acts that are being committed on a regular basis in this country. We’ve seen all too often, when these horrendous tragedies occur seconds count, but the cops are minutes away.

I know what liberals are thinking right now, “Oh okay, so the answer is to just give everyone a gun?!” Not so fast. Let’s take a look at Obama’s old stomping grounds and city with the highest crime rate in the country, Chicago. Last year, the Illinois legislature passed a bill allowing concealed carry. The Chicago Police Department recently released statistics showing that during the first quarter of 2014 the city has experienced the lowest murder rate since 1958. Although the concealed carry permits weren’t issued until February 2014, the correlation between the presence of concealed carried firearms and reduced murder rate is glaring.

Concealed carry and potential lower crime rate doesn’t end there. Recently, Detroit Chief of Police James Craig, as reported in the Detroit News, supports citizens to conceal carry, stating, surprise, surprise, that it actually deters crime. Craig explained that while working at the Los Angeles Police Department he was not a proponent of concealed carry but after moving to Portland, Maine he noticed the increase of law abiding citizens concealed carrying actually did, in fact, deter crime.

Are bad things going to happen? Yes. Are they going to happen without our being able to control them? Of course. But the difference between a gun rights advocate and a gun control advocate is the gun rights advocate believes not in limiting personal freedom, but confronting and, if necessary, using force against the proponent of that violent crime. We cannot prevent evil from happening because evil will take on endless shapes and forms. It’s “kids” playing the knock out game, students stabbing each other, home invasions…things that scissors and rape whistles can never be expected to stop. Not only is the suggestion of using these useless devices to stop a crime completely idiotic, it’s downright insulting.

So wise up libs, and try to at least grasp the cold hard fact that if you don’t want to be staring down the wrong side of a barrel or on the receiving end of a knife, a firearm to protect you and your family at least provides the reassurance that you have a standing chance to survive and possibly save lives. Without the ability and right to possess a firearm, citizens become vulnerable to all that is a threat to free will, freedom, and personal safety.

If you cannot find it in yourself to own a firearm, you do not have the right to take away mine much less a member of our military. My lady hero and idol Miranda Lambert said it best in her song “Time To Get a Gun”:

“Well I think it should be up to me ‘cause when it’s all said and done

Somebody’s gotta walk into the night and I’m gonna be that one

It’s time to get a gun”

http://youtu.be/lWP2eTynavY?t=25s

During a ‘Hashtags & Headlines’ event at the Paris Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Reid referred to Bundy supporters as “Nothing more than domestic terrorists,” adding, “I repeat: what happened there was domestic terrorism.”

Reid was referring to the stand off on Saturday in Bunkerville where Bundy supporters, some of whom were armed, forced Bureau of Land Management agents to back down and release around 380 head of cattle belonging to Bundy that had been seized over the course of the previous week.

Reid claimed that Bundy viewed the United States as a “foreign government,” while accusing his supporters of goading violence.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/heads-hate-crime-reporting-act-one-limit-free-speech/","Heads Up: Hate Crime Reporting Act–One More Limit on Free Speech","This country’s primary foundation was built on freedom. The Founding Fathers deemed freedom so essential to the republic they built that they created the 1st Amendment to ensure that all citizens would forever be able to speak their minds freely—even if it was against those who governed them. In fact, freedom of speech was one of the primary motivating factors of the Pilgrims to leave England and start a new, free life here. Despite dark times in this country’s past that certainly did not abide by this virtue, I’d say we’ve done a pretty darn good job at maintaining Americans’ God given rights.

Want to call the President an idiot? Go ahead. Feel like running down the street in a Speedo? More power to you, bro. You’re allowed to protest, gather, and proclaim your opinions without the fear of your government punishing you or limiting your right to free speech. With freedom comes the good, the bad, and the sometimes very ugly—no matter what. The 1st amendment doesn’t come with exceptions and it has not waivered when the message is unpopular or controversial. Compared to how people are living and being treated in places like Syria for merely existing, we Americans have it made.



Unfortunately, this country has experienced a trend in recent years of government officials and politicians pushing to limit our 1st amendment right (among other rights) An extremely concerning and potentially dangerous piece of legislation was recently introduced by Senator Edward Markey (D-MA) and Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) called the Hate Crime Reporting Act of 2014 (S.2219 and H.R 3878) According to Markey, the bill would

examine the prevalence of hate crime and hate speech on the Internet, television, and radio to better address such crimes. [It] would create an updated comprehensive report examining the role of the Internet and other telecommunications in encouraging hate crimes based on gender, race, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation and create recommendations to address such crimes.

Markey is either confusing “hate speech” with “free speech” intentionally, or he’s so inept he’s not educated himself properly on the Bill of Rights. What exactly does Markey interpret as “hate speech” and why do he and his fellow Dems believe they are the deciders? Is it Phil Robertson expressing his religious beliefs on homosexuality (yet also stating that he loves all of humanity? Man, that is SO hateful!) Is it someone denouncing Islam because of the seemingly endless acts of violence its members commit against innocent people constantly? Or, maybe the vile comments of Alec Baldwin and the Commander in Chief’s position on gay marriage prior to his evolving? And let us not forget the fiery rhetoric of Louis Farrakan, Al Sharpton, or Reverend Wright with regard to race and their vision of social justice?

Why on God’s green earth would increased monitoring and regulation by an already inept government be effective in reducing the presence of hate speech and hate crimes on the Internet, television or radio? We’ve already seen examples of real law enforcement’s failure in preventing tragedies like the Boston Marathon bombings last year. Despite the Tsarnaev’s mosque having direct ties to terrorism and numerous red flags, the FBI was still unable to prevent the brothers from carrying out their heinous acts.

I believe it speaks volumes on the direction of this nation when a career politician who’s mostly known as a warm body occupying a suit dares to throw this type of legislation on the table. We’ve seen the blatant and mostly unchallenged abuse of power this federal government has displayed recently and the mere suggestion of increased monitoring and regulation is downright frightening.

It is not up to Markey and his liberal big brother cronies to determine what constitutes hate speech versus free speech. These suggestions are coming from a political party that calls a defiant Nevada rancher a “domestic terrorist” and thinks Phil Robertson is a homophobic bigot yet refuses to denounce a religion which brutally murders women, children, Christians, homosexuals, Jews, to name just a few. The left is so quick to introduce legislature like the Hate Crime Reporting Act, hailing hate crimes as a dangerous epidemic, yet true tragedies like the 2009 Fort Hood massacre are labeled as “workplace violence” or ignored all together, like the Benghazi attack. If those don’t qualify as hate crimes, I don’t know what does.

As it often does with the left, the truth behind this piece of legislature is cleverly hidden underneath good intentions. The unsettling truth behind Markey’s “good intentions” is clear–regulate and limit speech of those with differing opinions. Our Founding Fathers created the Constitution to protect this country from politicians like Markey and Jeffries.","2014-04-26 12:20:40","0","34.0","23.0","8.0","0.0","19.0","0.0","82.0","52.0","0.0","134.0","0.0","20.0","10","784","85.83","69.96","12.71","9.90","23.76","28.06","80.87","45.41","9.06","4.08","0.38","0.89","0.77","1.15","0.89","4.97","7.78","13.78","6.38","3.57","6.76","1.28","12.37","4.85","2.55","1.53","0.64","1.02","8.67","3.70","4.97","0.77","2.93","0.38","8.80","0.89","0.13","0.26","2.04","10.84","1.91","2.04","0.89","2.68","1.91","3.32","3.44","1.02","1.91","0.38","1.28","0.13","0.38","0.51","0.13","10.08","2.42","2.04","4.34","0.77","0.89","3.19","8.04","0.38","10.59","1.40","5.74","3.44","2.93","1.02","0.38","0.77","1.40","0.38","0.51","0.26","0.13","0.00","0.00","0.00","14.41","3.19","4.34","0.00","0.00","1.02","0.13","0.26","1.53","2.42","1.28","0.26","3929","8.74","24.303030303030305","1210","777","34","48.23","14.0","12.2","13.35","14.6","195","12.0","21.19861003861004","443","22.06","12","0.43","0","36","8","78","0","86","73","2","0","4","127","68","5","48","0","0","29","13","50","0","0","2","24","0","27","15","26","18","20","29","3","6","0","5"
"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/hey-big-govt-jackasses-control-borders-ranchers/","HEY, BIG GOV’T JACKASSES: ‘Control Our Borders, Not Our Ranchers!’","LAS VEGAS (CBS LAS VEGAS/AP) — The rural Nevada showdown between federal government officials and militia members protecting rancher Cliven Bundy has evolved into a battle of government “tyranny,” with many newly arriving militiamen rolling in to draw a line in the dirt about 70 miles northeast of Las Vegas.

Many with camouflage clothing and burly beards, the militiamen coming from as far as Montana are being welcomed by Bundy’s local family and friends who have already set up camp on the sun-scorched plot of land to protest the Bureau of Land Management’s controlling of the 150 miles of desert where Bundy says his family has ranched for decades – long before the BLM was created.

“This is a better education than being in school! I’m glad I brought you. I’m a good mom,” Ilona Ence, a 49-year-old mother from St. George and Bundy relative who brought her four teenage children to the ranch, told the Las Vegas Sun. “They’re learning about the Constitution.”

Ence’s teenage sons posted up a sign on the land voicing their opinion of what the federal government officials should be doing: “CONTROL OUR BORDERS! NOT OUR RANCHERS!”

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/hey-jeb-meant-35-acts-love/","HEY, JEB… IS THIS WHAT YOU MEANT: 35 ‘Acts of Love’","Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush insisted that many of the instances of illegal immigrants coming into the U.S. were “acts of love.” Though many of the human beings who enter the U.S. illegally or overstay their legally permitted time in the U.S. are doing so to earn more resources and provide for families, many of the illegal immigrants who come into the U.S. are doing so for highly criminal reasons–a fact often left out of the discussion or otherwise barely mentioned.

Breitbart Texas has provided 35 of these other “acts of love” for our readers.

1. Mexican Cartel Assassin Confirmed 11 Kills on US Soil, Confessed to More Jose Manuel Martinez, a Mexican cartel assassin, had at least 11 confirmed kills. He is originally from Mexico but obtained legal status in the U.S.

2. Illegal Immigrant Allegedly Tried to Kill Texas Border Agent An illegal immigrant fought with a U.S. Border Patrol agent and allegedly attempted to take the agent’s gun and kill him. The illegal immigrant allegedly attempted to choke the agent as well.

3. Previously-Deported Illegal Alien Convicted of Child Human Trafficking An illegal immigrant operated a stash house in Houston, Texas containing two children and 24 others. The victims were held hostage in the underwear, occupying locked rooms with boards over the windows. Authorities described the living conditions in the home as ‘deplorable’.”

4. 27 Illegal Aliens Convicted on Child Sex Crimes Arrested Near Border The majority of the illegal immigrants arrested in this instance had committed sexual crimes and assaults against children. Various charges against the individuals included felony child sexual contact, lewd acts with a child, sexual exploitation of a child, and sexual assault of a child.”

5. Human Smuggler Jailed for Raping Illegal Immigrant An illegal immigrant from Guatemala was arrested and accused of raping a woman before and after they illegally crossed the U.S./Mexico border.

6. Texas: 50 Illegal Immigrant Convicted Criminals Arrested in Three Days Nine of the captured aliens had previously been deported from the United States. One of the illegal immigrants was a Mexican national arrested in San Antonio who was previously convicted of sex crimes involving a child.

7. Two Mexican Nationals Arrested for Running Alleged Stash House on TX Border – An alleged 90 illegal immigrants passed through a residence in one month. The home was operated by two Mexican nationals who were illegally in the U.S.

8. Border Patrol Agent Attacked and Almost Shot by Illegal Immigrant An illegal immigrant punched a U.S. Border Patrol agent all over his body and repeatedly choked him. During the altercation, the agent’s service pistol accidentally fired into the air twice.

9. Graphic Images Justify Border Patrol’s Use of Deadly Force Against Rock Attacks Illegal aliens routinely cross into the U.S. from Mexico and assault U.S. Border Patrol agents with rocks and boulders.

10. Another Mexican National Sentenced for Murdering Border Patrol Agent An illegal immigrant who was on supervised release for smuggling human beings into the U.S. from Mexico helped lure, trap, and murder a U.S. Border Patrol agent on U.S. soil in an effort to steal night-vision goggles.

11. 100% Increase in Previously-Deported Sex Offenders Returning from Mexico One sector of the U.S./Mexico border has seen a 100% increase in the number of illegal immigrants, previously deported for criminal sexual offenses, apprehended while attempting to illegally re-enter the United States.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/hey-new-york-times-bundys-black-bodyguard-claims-rancher-racist/","HEY, NEW YORK TIMES: Bundy’s Black Bodyguard Claims Rancher is NOT Racist","Despite a collection of seemingly racist rants about ‘negros,’ slavery and ‘picking cotton,’ not everyone thinks Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy is a racist, and one of the people defending the one-time far-right-wing folk hero is one of his bodyguards – who happens to be black.

Jason Bullock has been at Bundy’s side since his battle with the federal government began heating up in late March. According to Bullock, the man he’s come to know over the last month is not a racist.

In fact, Bullock says he would take a bullet for Bundy.

Bullock was recently interviewed by CNN and asked, ‘You’re protecting this man and he’s wondering whether African-Americans would be better off as slaves. How does that strike you?’

‘It doesn’t strike me any kind of way,’ Bullock answered. ‘This is still the same old Mr. Bundy I met from the first day of all this happening.’

Bullock says the things Bundy has been saying – ‘wondering’ if ‘negros’ were better off under slavery, and comparing himself to civil rights hero Rosa Parks, for example – don’t offend him.



‘Mr. Bundy is not a racist. Ever since I’ve been here he’s treated me with nothing but hospitality,’ Bullock told the reporter. ‘He’s pretty much treated me like his own family.’","2014-04-26 12:21:02","0","31.0","17.0","8.0","0.0","18.0","0.0","81.0","52.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","20.0","10","212","68.69","66.45","18.25","42.91","17.67","19.34","77.83","48.11","11.79","8.02","2.36","0.00","0.94","4.72","0.00","3.77","6.60","13.21","11.79","2.36","4.72","2.83","19.81","3.77","3.30","1.42","1.89","1.42","3.77","2.36","1.42","0.00","0.94","0.00","11.79","0.47","0.00","0.00","5.66","12.74","2.83","1.89","1.42","3.30","2.36","3.30","1.89","0.47","1.42","0.00","0.94","0.47","0.47","0.00","0.00","7.55","0.94","1.42","3.77","1.42","0.94","4.25","11.79","0.00","13.21","0.47","5.66","6.60","1.42","0.47","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","25.94","6.13","4.72","0.00","0.00","0.47","0.00","1.89","4.25","8.49","0.00","0.00","959","7.65","20.181818181818183","289","212","13","71.85","9.9","7.3","10.61","9.6","43","8.3","16.633207547169814","144","18.73","3","0.47","0","6","3","18","1","25","15","2","0","2","33","23","1","7","1","0","15","3","10","0","0","3","4","0","4","10","11","5","3","15","0","1","0","1"
"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/homeschooling-last-bastion-political-tolerance/","Homeschooling: The Last Bastion of Political Tolerance","If you listen to anyone from the NEA, you’d think that homeschooling is the last place where you would find open minded, politically tolerant people being raised and educated. In fact, the usual terms heard are “ignorant”, “closed minded” or “sheltered” or worse. Tolerance, defined as “sympathy or indulgence for beliefs or practices differing from or conflicting with one’s own”, is something better embodied by homeschooled children over those who weren’t. It’s a statistical fact.

The National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) discussed a study published by the Journal of School Choice: International Research and Reform regarding whether students who were homeschooled were put at a disadvantage when it came to being civil and tolerant. The study in fact found that homeschooled students were more politically tolerant than those who were either educated in public schools or even private schools.

Albert Cheng, study author, used a tool called the “content-controlled political tolerance scale” which gave each respondent a list of popular social and political groups, like Democrats, Republicans, gay rights activists and conservative Christians. The respondent was then asked to choose the group whose beliefs were the most opposite theirs. Next, the respondent was asked if they were willing to extend basic civil liberties to that opposing group. They were asked to agree or disagree with statements such as “The government should be able to tap the phones of the group you oppose”, “Books that are written by members of this group should be banned from the public library”, “I would allow members of this group to live in my neighborhood” and so forth. Obviously this measures how people identify with others as human beings who just have different views or dehumanize them as an enemy not deserving basic civil rights.

Study participants were from a private university in the western United States, with disparate backgrounds and educational experiences. The prevailing thought would be that children who are exposed to people of different ethnicities, faiths and political backgrounds would be more tolerant of differences because they were used to them. This was not the case. What Cheng found instead were two different things.

First he found that private over public doesn’t increase or decrease political tolerance. Students from both public and private schools had the same levels of tolerance. The second finding, though, was the surprise. Homeschooled children were more politically tolerant than those who weren’t, and the longer they were homeschooled the more tolerant they were.

While Cheng didn’t suggest a causal relationship between schooling and political tolerance, there are two theories as to reasoning behind the results. The first reason is that students who are homeschooled tend to have a greater degree of self-actualization. Homeschooled children get personalized instruction that enables them to be taught a more consistent worldview. The second reason, and I believe the most important, is that the very religious values disparaged by those against homeschooling, teach our children the true definition of tolerance – respect for differences without having to accept them as being ok.

The study flies in the face of the NEA supported view, as written about by Dr. Rob Reich in a piece entitled Educational Leadership, where he says that a state run public school “is one of the few remaining social institutions – or civic intermediaries – in which people from all walks of life have a common interest and in which children might come to learn such common values as decency, civility, and respect.” He also posits that children being taught by parents or places of worship “cannot become what they should without the oversight of the state and institutional schooling.” The hubris of the ivory tower in action. Big Brother watching doesn’t make us more civil.

As a parent of children who went to public schools, I’m not surprised by these findings. I was blessed that my children attended good public schools in a conservative county. While the state in which I live is very liberal, by and large the teachers in our county are more conservative. Most tend to give lip service to the left leaning and liberal educational ideas proliferated by our state and federal boards of education. I know of several teachers in our area who talk the Common Core talk, but walk a very different walk. They continue to teach our children in the ways they know from experience work, whether it fits Common Core or not.

It can’t be emphasized enough either that the participation level of parents also weighs into this equation. Parents need to be in the classroom to see what is being taught. They need to ask their kids about lessons, look through textbooks and talk to their children about the differences between what is taught and what they believe. I caught several instances where textbooks were wrong or biased about a subject. Other times it was a difference in belief on a moral subject. I used those times to educate them about our beliefs, always emphasizing that no matter what, if someone is different: has different ideas, looks or faiths, it is NEVER ok to treat them badly.

The great experimentation of “only schools can teach values” has been proven a vast failure. The college professor who physically assaulted a fourteen year old and called her names because she stood up for her pro-life values; the driver of a car with a “coexist” bumper sticker who mowed down a pro-life monument; the nasty political trolling and name calling from both sides on any given blog or topic. Public schools certainly aren’t the answer to making it better, and now we have the proof.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/hooray-lois-lerner-held-contemptnow/","‘Bout Time: Lois Lerner Held in Contempt…Now What?","In a vote of 21-12 on Thursday, the House panel found former IRS official Lois Lerner guilty of contempt of Congress. The decision, sometimes appearing to move more slowly than a broken bone knits was, in fact, a meticulously crafted, air-tight package. What makes the contempt decision so compelling is, as The Washington Examiner states: “House Ways and Means Committee Republicans aren’t ruling out the use of the chamber’s “inherent contempt” authority if Attorney General Eric Holder refuses to act on the panel’s accusations against former IRS official Lois Lerner.” But now it goes to Congress. Will The House take the next step?

Unless Eric Holder pursues legal action against Lerner, The House of Representatives has the authority to put Lois Lerner in the slammer for contempt until she cooperates. Since Holder and his cartoon DOJ move at the speed of glacial ice, when they move at all, it’s certain that they won’t. That said, The Washington Examiner elaborates on Congress’ ability to act:

…the House of Representatives has the authority to jail (Lerner) unless she changes her mind about refusing to answer questions about her role in the IRS scandal…what is required for that to happen is for a House majority to vote for a motion holding her in contempt and House Speaker John Boehner to then direct the House sergeant at arms to arrest and confine her… inherent contempt has the unique advantage that it doesn’t require ‘the cooperation or assistance of either the executive or judicial branches. The House or Senate can, on its own, conduct summary proceedings and cite the offender for contempt.

Congress has enacted this right many times since 1795.

The question remains, of course, whether or not Congress will have the stones to take that step. Democrats in Congress are, predictably, frenziedly asserting Lerner’s “rights.” FOX News quotes several. Carolyn Maloney (D., NY): “Guilty or innocent, Ms. Lerner has a constitutional right to remain silent on this issue…” Maloney, with a fanciful fillip to her unwavering hallucination, announced that “if the committee were truly serious about pursuing this case, they would offer Lerner immunity.” Guilty or not, one imagines. Steven Lynch (D., MA): “…said the case would “be laughed out of court.” But what has become absolute dependence by Democrats on the omnipotence of their own bloviating may just backfire this time. Constitutionally, Lerner can’t plead the fifth if she’s waived that right by previously making a statement declaring her own innocence. Which she did. Voluntarily, with no prompting.

In a patented move to obfuscate facts, a tactic that has worked brilliantly for Democrats, ranking member of the Oversight Committee Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Maryland) engaged in a strident war of words with Committee Chairman, Darrell Issa (R., CA). Rep. Cummings, never the sharpest tack in the Legislative toolbox, should have considered reining in his delusional ego. So many smoking guns involving Lerner’s wrongdoing have recently been discharged that the fumes are overpowering. Not the least of which is Congressman Cummings’ own likely culpability in targeting conservative, non-profit groups.

Rep. Issa has accused Rep. Cummings of conspiring with the IRS and has emails to back it up. National Review Online stated on Wednesday:

Issa on Wednesday accused the Maryland Democrat of colluding with the Internal Revenue Service in its targeting of the conservative nonprofit group True the Vote, whose founder, Catherine Engelbrecht, said she received multiple letters from Cummings in 2012 and personal visits from the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Explosives…one of Cummings’s letters, which Engelbrecht received in October 2012, contained questions that closely mirrored those posed by the IRS. Issa details them in his letter, strongly implying that Cummings based his letter on the one Engelbrecht had already received from the agency: Both requested information about the software True the Vote was using for voter registration, about the process the group used to train its employees, and about the vendors it used to obtain voter lists. E-mails unearthed in the course of Issa’s investigation into the IRS’s inappropriate targeting of right-leaning groups show that in January 2013, a member of Cummings’s staff contacted the IRS asking for any publicly available information on True the Vote. The matter was discussed by IRS officials that included Lois Lerner…

The “I-didn’t-do-it” approach by Democrats has been very successful; truth should be better, right? FOX News quotes: “House Speaker John Boehner predicted earlier this week that unless Lerner agrees to cooperate, the full House will support contempt…” Sure. It’s a safe bet that Lerner is banking on Boehner’s Boyz caving in.

We’ve all been to this rodeo before. Let’s see how long it takes Congress to finally hog-tie the calf. If it even wants to.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/hope-bs-voter-fraud-3000-florida-registrations-show-ups-stores-residence/","HOPE & BS: More Voter Fraud As 3000 Florida Registrations Show UPS Stores As Residence","Allen B West – Yet a December 2013 analysis shows more than 3,000 voter registrations statewide listing their residence address at a UPS store, potentially illegally.

Florida Law is clear and, with minor exception, requires that voter registrations listing other than an address of legal residence should not be accepted, because they are “ineligible” (F.S. 98.045 (1)(h)). In fact, it’s actually a felony to willfully submit any false voter registration information (F.S.104.011(2)). Accordingly, if these “ineligible” registrations are found to exist, Florida statutes also provide for their prompt correction or removal (F.S. 98.075(6) & (7)).

So there you go. It’s a felony for this to have happened, but how can it be that a citizen watchdog had to uncover this Florida voter fraud while the people paid with our taxpayer dollars have not a clue? Is it not a mandated responsibility of the Florida State Supervisors of Elections to maintain these voter address rolls? I’d say so.

…In the case of the UPS store registrations, it’s not a recent phenomenon. More than 2,300 of the more than 3,000 recently discovered UPS store registrations had the exact same UPS store listed as their residence at least 15 months prior. Approximately 800 of those 2,300 likely “ineligible” registrations voted in Florida’s during the 2012 General Election.

MONTGOMERY, Alabama — Less than three months before the June primary, four Alabama counties had more voters on their rolls than what the Census Bureau says is their voting age population.

Officials give a number of reasons for that, including under-counting by the census.

Secretary of State Jim Bennett said the discrepancies create opportunity for voting fraud.

“Every duplicate name and every bad address is just an opportunity for crooks to attempt to manipulate our elections,” Bennett said.

Each county has a three-person board of registrars that is responsible for maintaining the voting lists with help from the secretary of state’s office.

It is contradictory to our traditions, and people have to be held accountable.”

He didn’t mean it, which is probably why he used the word “if.” Just a few months later in an interview with his biggest fan, MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, Obama brushed off the scandal as faux outrage from conservative groups while advisers continue to declare the White House had no involvement in the targeting.

“They’ve got a list, and suddenly everybody’s outraged,” Obama said.

Today, IRS officials are still dragging their feet when it comes to getting tea party and other patriot groups their tax-exempt status. One of the largest tea party groups in the country, Tea Party Patriots, waited three years before finally receiving their tax-exempt status in February 2014. Conveniently, the IRS’ slow response to hundreds of groups waiting for an answer comes just before the 2014 midterm elections, when tea party groups could have a big impact.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/hows-something-usefu-cell-phone-cameras-un-involved/","How’s About Doing Something Useful? Cell Phone Cameras and the Un-Involved","In this world, there is hardly anyone without a camera cell phone. The eyewitness to life recorders on our phones have become a common everyday benefit, cameras record the best of our lives, friends out together, selfies, baby births, weddings, and the list goes on and on. There is, however, a dark side. If there is a criminal situation, or crime in progress, or a tragedy, some youthful under 30 year old will be filming video for posterity with their phones.

Ok, you wannabe Steven Spielberg’s, you’re catching and recording useful evidence that law enforcement can use in locating and prosecuting the offender. Yippee, so you think you’re a hero? Not quite, how much better would it have been if you had rendered immediate aid, versus continuing to video and the obvious aftermath with the yellow tape being stretched around the crime scene, and some body lying there. WTH ever happened to the days of rendering aid, damn it!

This new world of the un-involved is shameful and downright disgusting. Hey, did you ever think that the victim could have used some help? Or that maybe the only involved person who stepped into face the aggressors could have used an additional strong arm? Hmmm? We are a society in need of heroes, but certainly we cannot count on you camera-phone-carrying Wimpey’s to be heroes. How has it come down to this? What is the excuse for being so totally void of humanity?

Thankfully there are ordinary people who, when they see a need, they meet the challenge head on. No one has to ask or say a word, they step in and do what needs to be done.

Case in point, a car slammed into a motorcyclist; he then ended up being trapped underneath the car. Then the car ignited, several, and I do mean several men stepped into the situation, tipping the car while others pulled the unconscious kid out from under.

Or a drowning victim caught in a rip tide, sometimes the Good Samaritan dies while trying to assist. I would have to take that chance, because seriously, I could not live with myself if I did not do something to help. In case you’re wondering, filming is not helping.

Or the Highway Patrol officer who is seen in his dash cam video getting jumped on and is in a fight for his life, as several vehicles just speed by. How can anyone just watch someone getting the b-Jesus kicked out of them and not do something? How can people not stop, I just don’t get it.

Thankfully the involved sometimes do show up on a scene. In one case a rather large black female saw what was happening on the side of the highway, and came to the rescue of the officer. What she did kept the attacker occupied until backup got there. Being involved should be ordinary, not extraordinary.

All in all, humanity needs to win out in all our decisions, because that’s what makes us truly human.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/icymi-sen-reid-breaks-ground-nevada-solar-farm-near-bundy-ranch/","ICYMI: Sen. Reid Breaks Ground for Nevada Solar Farm Near Bundy Ranch","Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who was exposed last Friday as the mastermind behind the Bureau of Land Management’s persecution of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, can be seen in this March 2014 photo breaking ground for a new solar farm near the Bundy Ranch, emphasizing that the senator’s plan for solar projects in Nevada wasn’t just limited to the shelved solar farm near Laughlin.

Signaling the first day of construction of the Moapa Southern Paiute Solar Project, which is about 35 miles from the Bundy homestead in Bunkerville, Nevada, Sen. Reid joined representatives from the Moapa Band of Paiutes, executives from First Solar, Inc. and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for the groundbreaking ceremony on March 21.

“First Solar is thrilled to celebrate this important milestone with Sen. Reid and distinguished guests, and honored to work with the Moapa Band of Paiutes on this landmark project,” Jim Hughes, the CEO of First Solar, said at the time.

The development of solar farms just like this one is exactly why Sen. Reid was using the BLM, whose director is Reid’s former senior advisor, to push Bundy out of the Gold Butte area his family has worked for over 140 years.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/indoctrination-reformed-education-hedge-media-bias/","Defying Indoctrination: Reformed Education as Hedge Against Media Bias","It’s time to seriously rethink the way we “do” education in America.

Every student should have a computerized cubicle. Every fact-based course should be taught via video and computerized programmed-learning. Students should progress at their own pace in all fact-based subjects.

Cubicle sessions should be disbursed between group sessions, where topics could be discussed and questions answered by teachers and/or other students.

Kids today are totally comfortable with digital devices, silver screens, video, and computerized information. Continuing to teach via 19th-century methodology is inefficient and less effective.

Each student could have his own computer and cubicle docking-station. Each computer could be backed up automatically. Homework could be done on the student’s computer. Parents could be interconnected to their child’s computer – thus enhancing parental involvement and progress monitoring.

Courses that do not lend themselves to cubicle computerized-learning could be taught via traditional methods.

Values-based courses could be offered via parental preferences, e.g., religion, ethics, philosophy, sociology, economics, etc.

Needless to say, the possibilities are enormous. Courses could be taught by the most competent and effective teachers. See The Teaching Company courses for examples of the quality that could be provided by the nation’s leading teachers.

Sound, effective, truthful education is more important than ever for many reasons – media bias being one of them.

For instance, I had a 2-½ hour drive on a recently past Saturday and Monday morning. I’ve often heard that Public Radio was a liberal-leftist organization; so I listened to WNYC – a Public Radio station serving the greater New York area. I wanted to find out if the claims of Public Radio’s liberal-leftist bias were true – and if so, what they were advocating.

Frankly, I was amazed at how liberal-leftist their programming is as confirmed during my 2-½ hours of uninterrupted listening. It was sometimes subtle, but every program and discussion was tilted left. Under-informed listeners might fail to realize that they were being indoctrinated.

As a 75 year old businessman, I can’t understand this bias. Isn’t it dishonest for a so called “Public Network” to be biased versus objective? Are their producers so insecure in their liberal-leftist beliefs that they cannot provide an honest and balanced perspective? How shameful! How cowardly! How unprofessional!

For another viewpoint, I highly recommend: FOX News Reporting: Enemies of the State — now on YOUTUBE — Parts I, II, III. A must see.

Fox News aired this shocking documentary the other night. It reported on how agencies of the federal government are using their power to abuse and punish American citizens and American businesses which don’t agree with the Administration’s politics, policies, rulings, etc.

This is disturbing and a good illustration of how the USA is gradually becoming a coercive police state.

This program, like many others, is available on YouTube in three parts – I, II, and III. I strongly urge thinking Americans to view it and pass it and this message on to thinking friends and neighbors.

"https://clashdaily.com/2014/04/insanity-inmates-running-asylum-america/","Insanity: Are the Inmates Running the Asylum in America?","by Larry Usoff

Clash Daily Contributor

Are the inmates running the asylum? If you live in, or near, a coal-mining area, you’re probably well aware of the financial impact the coal industry has on that area. Coal has made great strides in becoming “clean”, or at least a lot cleaner than it used to be, when it’s being used. Coal powers a major portion of the energy output of this country, and I don’t know what percentage that might be, but it’s big.

My question is this: why would anyone want to shut down an entire industry, putting thousands of people out of work, decimating the economy of a large portion of the country, in favor of an industry that, for the present, is not working? I think I remember Joe Biden saying “no coal plants” in America, when he was running for vice-president. The green industry, of which the president is so fond, is viable…but just not right now.

Let me give you an example. There are millions of automobiles and trucks moving about this country every day. When they want fuel there are probably hundreds of thousands of places where they can get fuel. Suppose you owned an electric car, and you have a home plug-in for that car. All well and good, but what happens when you travel away from your home area? Will you be able to find a charging station…anywhere?When the day comes when there are charging stations at every GAS station, that might improve the sales of electric vehicles.

There is another problem which the brainiacs don’t seem to be able to solve, and that is the size, weight and charging abilities of batteries. Way back in the 1950’s I think one of the magazines wrote that in the near future electric cars would be able to go hundreds of miles at highway speeds. What happened?

We’re being called the regulation nation…why? Is it because there IS an agenda being used that WILL “fundamentally transform America”, as the president said he’d do? When a law is passed and it has 2700 pages, but the regulations covering it run into the tens of thousands of pages, doesn’t that tell you something? It tells me that industries are being strangled, and in a systematical way, in order to further that agenda.

This president has an ego the size of Texas, and he truly believes that he can accomplish miracles, but the miracles he’s proposing are aimed at bringing the United States down to second, or third-world level. The wrongly-named Affordable Care Act probably cannot be repealed in its entirety, but it can be chopped up, the bad parts defunded and reworked.

We don’t need the United States to be transformed, we need Obamacare to be transformed …into something that IS affordable and does show some CARE. There are doctors in Congress that have put forth good, workable, changes to that law but everything that is, in any way, resistant to everything the White House proposes, is shot down in the Senate by Harry Reid. Senator Reid should retire. He’s outlived whatever qualifications he had originally to be elected to the Senate. Now he is only a political thug, and he’s helping another political thug, the president. Anything that the House of Representitives approves and sends to the Senate, if it offers the tiniest bit of help to America, is deemed dead on arrival by Reid. Why can’t he be forced to resign, or retire? He is the poster boy for term limits in my estimation.

My opinion is just that, my opinion, and there’s a lot that goes on in the world that is beyond my ken. Take the Ukraine as an example. Putin, the president of Russia, is an ex-KGB agent, and he’s shown that he’s smart and ruthless, and that’s a dangerous combination. Our president, who was manipulated into the highest office in the land, has never done anything of real significance, believes that on the strength of his personality, he can calm the stormy seas.

John Bolton, a no-nonsense former Ambassador to the United Nations, said that sending Kerry to negotiate with a spokesperson from Russia about the Ukraine is like sending a cupcake to negotiate with a steak knife. Kerry, or Lurch, was not a good soldier, he was not a good Senator, and he is clearly not a good Secretary of State.

The Russians are not bashful about saying they could go to war with the United States. They, like our Defense Department, run war games on their computers like we do on ours. The difference is that they are willing to take the losses which they estimate could be up to about half the population. The US, for all the talk about our technological superiority, would come out second best in a nuclear war with the Russians…and I suspect that Washington knows this all too well. We do the mealy-mouth thing and talk the talk, but when it comes to walking the walk…well, we DID put sanctions on eleven Russians…that should count for something, right? This country desperately needs a leader, and we don’t have one now.

You want to put people back to work in this country? Let’s see…what needs fixing?There’s several hundred bridges that need to be replaced or shored up…probably hundreds of thousands of roads that need to be repaved. This is not government work, this is state work, county work, city work, so the money should not be going to the federal government to be wasted on projects that idiots dream up for other idiots to activate. Come on, people, use some common sense. Here’s a very simple rule to remember…if it’s not made in the USA, we don’t need it because this country can make anything they want to, and probably make it better than anybody else.

Cheap labor is not the panacea that a lot of business people think it is. Example…do you want Chinese parts, which have been shown to be shoddy and just-plain-wrong, in our fighting aircraft? We have the greatest farming system in the world, but we import a whole lot of stuff. Why? Is the little bit of profit that might be gleaned from overseas labor worth putting Americans out of work?

"http://mrnewswatch.com/unreleased-video-shows-donald-sterlings-ex-mistress-v-stiviano-on-a-racist-tirade-i-dont-understand-black-people/","Unreleased Video Shows Donald Sterling’s ex-mistress V. Stiviano On A Racist Tirade: ‘I don’t understand black people’","Well if this isn’t the pot calling the kettle anti-black.

V. Stiviano, who secretly recorded NBA owner Donald Sterling’s slurs against African-Americans, made a few of her own in two videos made public Saturday by TMZ.com.

“I don’t understand black people,” the 31-year-old model snaps in one clip. “The minute you give them a little bit of money, they don’t know what to do with it.

“They just act crazy. … They’re like, ‘Yo, I wanna put some rims on top of my rims. And my rims are gonna turn around, so I’m gonna call them — what? Spinners.’”

Stiviano, caught on camera during the shooting of a 2011 reality show pilot about gold-diggers, wasn’t finished sounding like Sterling.

“They do stupid s— like that, when there’s people starving around the world,” she announces. “That’s what people want to do with their money?”

In the second clip, Stiviano is riding shotgun while holding an Elmo doll as an African-American friend drives.

Speaking to the stuffed Muppet, Stiviano cracks, “We don’t like black people.”

She is black and Mexican.

Stiviano’s taped conversation with the 80-year-old Sterling turned the Los Angeles Clippers owner into a pariah, leading to a lifetime ban from the NBA and the forced sale of his team. The billionaire real estate mogul was also fined $2.5 million.

Sterling, in yet another secretly taped conversation, claimed his vile remarks were his version of sweet talk as he tried to bed the decades-younger Stiviano.

Stiviano claimed that she never slept with Sterling despite the gifts that he lavished upon her — including $500,000 in luxury cars and a $1.8 million Los Angeles duplex.

Sterling’s wife cut a deal last week to sell the Clippers for $2 billion, but lawyers filed suit on behalf of her litigious husband to fight the sale in court.

Sterling’s lawsuit against the league also seeks to overturn his suspension from the sport, although an NBA lawyer dismissed the move as “entirely baseless.”

Spouse Shelly Sterling seized control of her husband’s enormous holdings after Donald Sterling was branded “mentally incapacitated” by two neurologists who diagnosed him with dementia.

The other 29 NBA owners, who were initially expected to vote this week on whether to oust Sterling, will instead decide on the proposed purchase by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

Mark uses well publicized news articles to back up his claims.

“It just goes to show that many of these rap stars who fall victim to this system,” Mark says. “They become willing Illuminati icons. Willing servants of this satanic, mind numbing, materialistic, mentally controlling system. And then they just become victims of it. Most of these rappers really are just actors. A lot of the jewelry they have is just fake or rented. A lot of the assets that they have on MTV Cribs… I don’t know if that show is even on any more, but a lot of those cars are just rented or leased for the weekend while they shot the episode.

“Freemasonry’s Connection to the Homosexual Movement”

The esoteric all-male group known as Freemasonry (or Masonry) has been connected to homosexuality by a number of researchers.

“Why?” you may ask.

Albert Pike was Sovereign Grand Commander of the (Masonic) Scottish Rite’s Southern Jurisdiction from 1859-1891. He published a book called Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in 1871. Citations from Pike’s magnum opus will be featured here.





FREEMASONS HAVE A SECRET AGENDA



Like other esoteric groups and some fraternities, the Masons have secret doctrines and initiations. The homosexual agenda is hidden from the membership.Now, as Pike mysteriously put it, Freemasonry ""conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it. Truth is not for those who are unworthy or unable to receive it, or would pervert it.""Instead of Masons stating their secrets secretly, they only obliquely impart them. Pike states: ""What the Chiefs of the Order really believed and taught, is indicated to the Adepts by the hints contained in the high degrees of Free-masonry."" Like other esoteric groups and some fraternities, the Masons have secret doctrines and initiations. The homosexual agenda is hidden from the membership.Now, as Pike mysteriously put it, FreemasonryInstead of Masons stating their secrets secretly, they only obliquely impart them. Pike states: ""What the Chiefs of the Order really believed and taught, is indicated to the Adepts by the hints contained in the high degrees of Free-masonry."" Pike again: ""The symbols and ceremonies of Masonry have more than one meaning. They rather conceal than disclose the Truth. They hint it only."" More: ""We have hints, and not details...hints of the true objects and purposes of the Mysteries."" (The ""Mysteries"" are secret Masonic ""Truths"" and secret initiatory rituals.) Pike speaks in enigmas because he can only hint at Masonic secrets. Masons take oaths not to reveal the group's secrets. Upper-level Masons even keep secrets from lower-level Masons. According to Pike, a lower-level Mason ""is intentionally misled by false interpretations [of Masonic symbols]. It is not intended that he shall understand them [the symbols]; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry."" Lower-level Masons are just dupes being used by the upper-level ones, the so-called ""Princes of Masonry."" HOMOSEXUALITY Are Masons using their power and influence to try to spread homosexual ""values""? In the following enigmatic words, Pike seems to be saying that Mason [adepts] engage in homosexual oral sex. He states that an initiate ""commemorates in sacramental observance this mysterious passion; and while partaking of the raw flesh of the victim, seems to be invigorated by a fresh draught from the fountain of universal life....Hence the significance of the phallus."" (p.393) As is his wont, Pike does not explain these words. For example, he does not spell out what he means by ""this mysterious passion."" But elsewhere in the book he twice notes that phallic worship is a part of their ""Ancient Mysteries."" Not only does homosexual sex apparently play a role in Masonry, but so do homosexual orgies. Pike, speaking in general of a newly initiated member, says: ""he mingles with the crowd of Initiates, and, crowned with flowers, celebrates with them the holy orgies."" Needless to say, Pike does not define ""holy orgy."" In at least two other locations in his book he mentions that orgies are associated with Masonic initiations. [Albert Pike pictured below has a reputation for indulging in debaucheries as well as Satanic butchery.

HETEROPHOBIA Now to return to Masonry---which, we should keep in mind---is an all-male group, Pike provides serious evidence of organizational sexism in Masonry via these words: ""The love of woman cannot die out; and it has a terrible and uncontrollable fate."" As usual, he does not explain what he means by this startling statement (but the heterophobic meaning seems obvious enough). Elsewhere he stated that ""Christianity...gave to woman her proper rank and influence; it regulated domestic life."" In some circles, it is a common opinion, misguided or not, that Christianity, especially Catholicism, places women at a lower rank than men because women cannot become priests or bishops or cardinals or popes' and because wives are supposed to be submissive or subordinate to their husbands, generally speaking. In sum, while Pike does not explicitly declare that women are inferior to men, or that they are unworthy of love, but he does seem to strongly hint at that. Freemasonry is still a force in America and the world. The fact that this group is evidently biased against women (who cannot join) and biased in favor of homosexual relationships should not go unnoticed, and neither should the fact this group is using its influence to try to impose pro-homosexual ""values"" on the public. We'll end with a quote from Masonic author Carl H. Claudy: ""The real secrets of Masonry are never told, not even mouth to ear. For the real secret of Masonry is spoken to your heart, and from it to that of your brother [Mason]. Never the language made for tongue may speak it; it is uttered only in the language of the eye, in those manifestations of that love which a man has for his friend, which passeth all other loves, even that of woman."" Note those last four words.","2014-08-16 00:00:00","0","21.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","7.0","0.0","36.0","30.0","0.0","89.0","5.0","2.0","1","989","79.83","74.79","16.97","50.29","19.02","23.96","80.69","50.15","10.72","4.45","0.00","0.40","0.30","1.92","1.82","6.27","7.38","14.16","7.79","3.74","6.07","2.02","12.54","5.16","2.02","1.52","0.81","1.92","3.74","2.53","1.21","0.30","0.00","0.51","12.64","0.30","0.10","0.91","2.73","15.98","4.04","3.24","0.51","3.24","1.92","4.65","1.62","0.61","0.91","0.00","3.74","0.61","0.20","2.53","0.00","7.68","2.83","1.52","3.54","0.20","0.00","1.72","9.20","0.81","9.00","0.61","5.76","2.43","1.11","0.51","0.10","0.20","1.42","0.20","0.20","0.00","0.10","0.00","0.10","0.00","22.24","6.57","5.16","0.71","0.61","0.20","0.00","1.82","4.45","0.61","1.21","0.91","4789","8.0","19.134615384615383","1543","969","57","54.22","12.1","9.9","12.58","11.6","216","5.5","17.71640866873065","431","17.0","8","0.48","0","45","7","95","0","128","73","4","1","10","102","97","3","83","0","0","48","15","60","1","0","1","28","0","42","15","11","32","26","53","4","7","0","4"

"http://mrnewswatch.com/meet-t-bone-a-jailhouse-prisoner-vigilante-who-beats-up-jail-rapis/","Meet T-Bone A Jailhouse Prisoner Vigilante Who Beats Up Jail Rapi**s","Last year I spoke to a guy named Shaun Attwood about making millions on the stock market and plunging it all into a new career as a rave-organizing ecstasy kingpin. One unfortunate side effect of selling drugs on a large scale, I discovered during our conversation, is that if the police find out about it, they’re probably going to send you to jail.

While serving time for his offenses, Shaun saw or heard about numerous rapes of inmates by their fellow prisoners—a major problem that he claimed isn’t getting nearly the amount of attention it should from prison authorities. However, he told me about a friend he made who believes it’s his Christian duty to protect weaker inmates from being sexually abused, and has been stabbed and beaten to within an inch of his life for doing just that.

T-Bone is a six feet five former Marine who’s become something of a legend in the West Coast prison system for taking a one-man stand against rapists in American jails. He’s currently serving time for robbery (he maintains his innocence), so I sent him some questions about his anti-rape crusade and the issues of sexual assault in American prisons.

VICE: Hi, T-Bone. When did you first decide that you were going to make a stand against rapists in the prison system?

T-Bone: It was in 1986, when I saw a young kid of 18 being pushed around for food and being told to smuggle crystal meth and heroin into prison inside his butt. When the kid brought the dope in, the two guys who’d made him do it both got high and raped the kid, which made me decide to take action.

How common is rape in American prisons? As prevalent as TV and movies would have you believe?

It’s very common, and it happens in a variety of ways. When I was in one particular prison here in Arizona, every single night someone was getting raped. All night long, I heard male flesh pounding against male flesh, guys getting fucked up the ass. Anyone who couldn’t fight back was game. The rapists were the size of apes. They’d put the victim in a chokehold to make them unconscious. Regular guys—not homosexuals—were getting punked and were scared to admit it. I also saw big guys kissing little white boys on the lips and neck like they were women. Gang members would sometimes hold someone down and stick things in his ass—stuff like cans, soda bottles, shampoo bottles, broom handles, or metal shanks.

Shaun has told me that your Christian faith played a part in inspiring you to take action against rapists.

My belief in God gives me the divine power to do all things through His spirit. Some people say that God doesn’t hurt people and that I hurt those rapists on my own because I wanted to run things in prison, but I believe that God didn’t tell the rapists I encountered over the years to force themselves on young inmates just because they could. I never ran across the yard and jumped on people because of their behavior; I prayed, I talked to a lot of people on the yard who felt the same way I did, and I asked God for protection.

I’m not a Superman or someone special. God’s power is much stronger than mine, and His will will be done. Making rapists stop hurting other people was God pushing and guiding me. I didn’t win all of my fights with rapists—I almost lost my life more than once when I was stabbed and smashed in the skull with rocks in socks. I believe the only reason I’m alive is by God’s grace.

Yeah, I heard that you sustained quite a few injuries after sticking up for weaker inmates.

As well as being shanked and hit with rocks, I’ve hurt my hands a lot. I’ve been hit hard and had to take it easy for weeks until my body healed from blows and hits to the back of my head. I have several large scars, including one on my shoulder, where I was sliced open. I’ve hurt my feet, knees, elbows, fingers, and toes. I’ve had contract killings put out on me for being outspoken about issues that are common in the joint. I’ve been asked to leave yards. I’ve been locked down because certain people didn’t want me around. I’ve found notes in my cell saying my life is in danger.

How did you end up in prison in the first place?

When I got out of the Marines, I set myself up as a bodyguard, and the cash started rolling in. I invested in the cocaine business and got addicted to it. I’ve lost over 20 years of my life due to the dumb decisions I made on drugs. I’ve hurt my wife and children by putting myself in here. Every time I’ve been released, I’ve come straight back. I’m not making excuses for myself, but most prisoners have drug problems, and the prisons offer no help, drug counseling, or rehabilitation. The system is designed so that prisoners come right back, because it keeps the prison in business. That’s part of the reason why there are more black guys in prison throughout the entire USA than are in college and more than were held under slavery before slavery was abolished.

[Editor’s Note: Ivory Toldson, a professor at Howard University, says the conventional idea that there are more black men in prison than in college is a myth. According to his research, there are 1.4 million black men in college and 840,000 black men in prison.]

Why do you think the US prison system has such a high level of sexual assault compared with the prison systems of other nations?

It boils down to human nature—people don’t care about prisoners. Prison is a smaller version of what our society is like, with its extremes of power and poverty. There are laws in place to protect people in society, but in here, if a guy is forced to have sex, he has nowhere to turn, because if he tells the guards, he’s considered to be a rat, and that’s worse than being labeled a punk. Rats get killed in here. That’s why so much rape goes on, but no one reports it.

T-Bone with his granddaughter in Tucson prison

Do you think the prison system could do more to protect weaker inmates?

The prison system does nothing to protect weaker inmates. It’s a system that encourages evil.

There are a lot of racial politics within the US prison system—do you ever get any trouble for helping inmates of other races?

Yes, I’ve had to defend myself many times against gang members for helping inmates of other races. Here in Arizona’s prison system, blacks are a minority. I experience pure hatred because of the color of my skin. People seethe with vile contempt and want to kill me because I’m black, but I’m wearing the same clothes and doing the same time as them.

When I first came into the prison I’m currently in, glad to see a black man stop by, I said, “Hey, what’s up, brother?” He replied: “Some of the white boys here are mad at you for smashing some whites who were raping a youngster at another yard. They said that was white-boy business and you shouldn’t be interfering.”

“How many brothers are on this run?” I asked, referring to black inmates. “You’re looking at him,” was the reply. “I guess I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place then,” I said, wondering how best to defend myself.

Did they come after you?

Later that day, I was let out for a shower. Two whites approached me at the steps, making noise to attract my attention. Then, out of nowhere, another white inmate jumped on my back and put me in a strong chokehold—a precision attack. Another guy grabbed my legs and pulled me down. I tried to kick and pull, but someone laid across my legs and twisted my body to an angle that hurt my back. Another inmate held my arms down while lying across my middle. I could tell they’d done this before.

The first guy said, “Pull his pants down.”

They started to yank my pants down, and I couldn’t stop them. One produced a wooden broom handle shaped like a penis at the end. The sight of the phallus made me struggle with all my might, but I was pinned down too strong. Luckily, two Mexicans ran up the steps. One kicked the first guy in the face and I broke loose of the chokehold. He then spun around and stabbed a Mexican in the stomach. I leaned forward and hit the guy holding my legs down in the neck with my right hand. He tried to grab me, but I got a hold of his wrist, turned him over, pushed his arm up behind his back, dislocated his shoulder and snapped his wrist. I smashed his face into the pavement. I hit another guy in the esophagus, and he went down. Then 20 cops materialized out of nowhere.

Jesus. Finally, if you could change one thing about the US prison system, what would it be?

The prison system here has been set up not to allow God in. That needs to change, because God is love, and where there’s love, there’s peace.

Thanks to Shaun Attwood for putting me in touch with T-Bone. You can read about Shaun’s own prison experiences in his new book, Prison Time.

"http://mrnewswatch.com/retired-army-general-says-the-mike-brown-shooting-was-staged-martial-law-is-coming-video/","Retired Army General Says The Mike Brown Shooting Was Staged & Martial Law Is Coming (VIDEO)","In the video he explains the dangers that are coming to America and that if we don’t change things at the ballot box we will have to go to the bullet box. He seems like a pretty patriotic guy in this video. Hey says we have the right to get rid of our current government.

Here are some of his important quotes from the speech.

“contractors are going to come in – maybe me.” –

“They’re going to kill you. That person sitting next to you won’t be sitting there because they’re going to be gone because somebody like me is going to come in and kill you. ”

“The new constitution is all ready to go. They only need the right incident to bring it down and they’re working on that right now. We’re not very far away from an event that’s going to bring what you call, martial law, that term will never be used by the way Emergency Police Powers will be.”

During the speech he said he still carries a secret clearance and had just left Fort Leonard Wood (military base in the Missouri Ozarks). He said he gets briefed every six months.

Here’s some more quotes.

“The news media is going to start banging on something – could be Ukraine, could be we don’t know. That’s how psychological warfare works. They talk about THIS and this is happening over here. It’s called a distraction.”

“So number one is – there’s going to be an emphasis on an international event – the news media is going to pound it, pound it, pound it. The second thing is you’re going to see a group or a person guilty of racism or something along those lines and they’re going to start pounding on that. They want your attention over here. The third thing you’re going to start seeing is people will be arrested for domestic terrorism. The fourth thing you’re going to see and this is what I’m going to talk to the ladies about – it’s what I call ancient hate, ancient madness, ancient revenge. When these things start to happen, people are going to start rioting. The EBT cards are going to shut down. Can you imagine what’s going to happen in St Louis County when the EBT cards go down, when the ATM machines don’t work?”

“When the inner cities start to erupt, people are going to start killing people they don’t like”.

“Right now in the United States, most Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs and Lieutenants and above will go to the FBI academy. When they go to the FBI academy, they come back brainwashed for some reason. Now I know that the St. Louis County police has that policy, I do not know about the rest of them but every Sheriff will go to the FBI academy.”

“Incidentally, there is a movie out with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, it’s called Escape…that boat exists. It’s real. That boat does exist. I’m telling you for a fact.”

“So I have to get permission from the Army to do this. I’m theirs, they own me.”

Okay so how does a “patriot” go from telling the truth about what’s going to come to actually being a part of the event he said was coming to America! Now for the record, I have found out that Dan Page did tell everybody after that speech that he was going to work for law enforcement and it’s probably safe to assume that he lived in the St. Louis area since the speech he gave to the oath keepers was in the St. Louis area and by his own admission he was checking in with Fort Leonard Wood which is in the Missouri Ozarks. So that’s not a huge deal.

But what is a HUGE deal is when Dan Page tells us exactly what is going to happen in 2012 and then is a part of it all in 2014! He tells us in the speech that he still checks in with Fort Leonard Wood for a briefing every six months and he still has an active secret clearance! That’s not typical of a person that is retired at all. You don’t just go back to your base and get briefings after you retire! He even says at the speech that they “own him”. He had to get the okay for him to speak to them. Why would somebody that is “retired” say that because you’re free to speak to anybody you want when you retire.

He’s involved in the CNN psyop that looks totally staged! How did he go from being a “good guy” to part of the “bad guys”? Did he go to the FBI academy after 2012 that he admitted that for some reason everybody came back brainwashed? And in the last video on this page, Dan admits that he worked in special forces and his specialty was psychological warfare (at about the 16:30 mark of the speech video) where he learned how to destroy a nation from within without direct military contact! What are the odds of this? Was he going back to his base at Fort Leonard Wood every six months to reinforce his brainwashing?

I believe this is VERY important information! Was Dan Page completely mind controlled at the FBI Academy or through Fort Leonard Wood? I don’t know what this all means but what does seem absolutely clear is that the Ferguson event is a STAGED event and Dan Page knew all about something just like this that would come. How did he know this unless he had access to their plans? He seems to be following the script he talked about in 2012! That’s the big deal here as well as his background in psychological warfare.

Video that ties Dan Page the “patriot” to the Cop Part of the CNN Psyop. This is a MUST SEE! There’s no doubt this is the same man! Same voice, and Dan admitted he was going to be a law enforcement officer and he was from the area!

This is a RED ALERT! Get this post out to everybody through social networks and email lists. I don’t believe in coincidences such as one of the main players at Ferguson being trained in Psychological Warfare and admitting there was major brainwashing going on in the police departments and then being part of it all! Who knows if Michael Brown was mind controlled to get aggressive with a cop or if they just were waiting for a white cop to kill a black kid before they sprang into action. It really doesn’t matter at this point because we now have the proof that this entire thing was scripted and they want to start using “Emergency Police Powers” everywhere! Dan Page told us EXACTLY what was going to happen in 2014 back in 2012! He even mentioned that “Ukraine” could be used as one of the two events as well as a racial event! They are using Ukraine and ISIS now as the other event Dan talked about in the speech to the Oath Keepers and Ferguson is being used as the racial event!

Here’s the interview with Dan Page where I found out that he specialized in Psychological Warfare and Asymmetrical Warfare which is “how to destroy a nation from within without direct military contact.” You’ll hear that at about the 16:30 mark in this video. Get the word out everywhere so everybody knows that Ferguson is a staged event! They are following the exact script that Dan Page talked about in 2012!","2014-08-22 00:00:00","0","50.0","27.0","3.0","2.0","12.0","0.0","64.0","41.0","0.0","167.0","7.0","26.0","6","1261","61.27","83.93","25.93","19.83","16.59","12.93","85.41","56.62","15.70","7.77","1.19","0.79","1.35","3.09","1.35","7.93","7.69","15.23","10.55","6.19","5.63","1.35","21.49","2.93","1.51","2.38","1.67","1.82","2.85","1.19","1.59","0.24","1.19","0.00","11.90","0.00","0.40","0.08","3.41","9.91","2.46","1.82","1.03","2.06","2.30","1.59","2.70","1.27","1.43","0.00","0.40","0.32","0.08","0.00","0.00","6.26","0.95","0.48","3.65","0.79","0.40","3.57","14.20","2.93","16.02","4.04","7.38","4.92","2.54","0.71","0.08","0.16","0.00","0.79","0.56","0.00","0.08","0.24","0.16","0.00","14.12","4.04","1.51","0.16","0.00","0.56","1.51","0.00","2.85","3.17","0.32","0.00","5271","6.06","20.0","1607","1265","75","79.7","9.0","6.3","7.6","7.4","127","6.142857142857143","12.775810276679842","439","17.51","32","0.55","0","35","18","134","0","158","66","0","1","11","144","119","2","34","0","0","104","10","58","1","0","6","61","0","68","41","50","17","60","61","11","11","0","16"

Rapper Lil Boosie finds himself in jail again for marijuana possession. In just less than 48 hours from being released from a Louisiana prison, Lil Boosie has been arrested again for illegal drugs and if found guilty, will receive a minimum of 2 years in prison.

Lil Boosie was just released from prison yesterday after serving a prison term of about 5 years for multiple crimes including illegal drug possession, violation of probation, federal charges on first-degree murder, etc. It is reported that Louisiana police coincidentally happened to be walking down the street as Boosie walked out the door of an apartment “reaking of weed”. The two officers then searched Boosie and found a bag filled with a quarter-pound of weed in his jacket pocket.

According to Louisiana police officer Jack Napier, “I can’t believe he would even dare carry that much marjuana again, well, he was looking for trouble”. Boosie will appear before a judge late March.

This comes just hours after Lil Boosie signed a huge Million Dollar Deal With Rick Ross & Maybach Music. The Bawse Ricky Ross released a statement saying “Deez Ni**az can’t hold Boosie back we bringing them M’s to the courthouse i got a money bag for the homie he be out soon Ugh Bawse”

"http://mrnewswatch.com/iggy-azaela-get-over-yourself-n-im-killin-rappers-like-ferguson/","Iggy Azaela “Get Over Yourself N**** I’m Killin Rappers Like Ferguson”","Iggy Azalea is no stranger to making inappropriate tweets. Some of which have even been called racist by critics in the past. However, if anyone ever had any doubts whether or not Iggy Azalea was a race hater, Iggy went and confirmed it for them with various disturbing tweets after being criticized for not supporting the protestors in Ferguson and New York City. Also, several reports have been released stating that Azalea is “from Australia” and that Australia is “crazy racist.”

“I don’t know what you were thanking, I’m Australian,” she tweeted. She followed that tweet with “curse I am. My people were the rapists and murderers Britain didn’t want,” and “you expect an Ozzie to be respectful we had a law not to feed the black folks.” “When black people started getting all hungry for rights, we just rifled therm.”

Several other tweets followed such as, “we wouldn’t allow anybody but whites in Queensland” and “we took mixed chilrdren from they paren ts.”

Then, she hit everyone with the shocker.

However, black leaders along with civil rights activists in general, while not surprised to hear that a blond-haired Australian girl is also a racist, were surprised that so many people support her music career, follow her on twitter, and even look to hear her opinions on racial matters.

A Ku Klux Klan leader has denounced a fundraiser started by a fringe Klan group in South Carolina for Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Ferguson teen Michael Brown.

Imperial Wizard Chuck Murray, the leader of the New Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, sent out an email last week asking for donations, which was obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hatewatch blog.","2014-08-18 00:00:00","0","38.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","62.0","41.0","0.0","167.0","7.0","26.0","6","66","99.00","91.35","16.48","25.77","33.00","22.73","65.15","31.82","3.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.03","13.64","12.12","3.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","9.09","3.03","0.00","3.03","0.00","1.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.64","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.52","1.52","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","13.64","3.03","4.55","9.09","1.52","0.00","6.06","1.52","0.00","15.15","1.52","7.58","6.06","4.55","1.52","0.00","3.03","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.61","3.03","6.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.52","0.00","0.00","306","9.58","33.5","91","66","2","54.9","0","13.8","11.15","17.7","18","16.0","26.10909090909091","54","30.5","2","0.33","0","0","0","8","0","7","2","0","0","0","9","28","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","3","1","3","1","1","1","1","0","0"

Picture this scenario: You’re in the middle of dinner with your man, and he rushes outside for an “emergency” call. Normally you wouldn’t care, but this is the fourth time it’s happened! Suddenly you get a sick feeling in your stomach, and it’s not from the food.

By now, you’re finally convinced your man is cheating. But you need proof. Here’s your chance to get it.

“See who he’s been calling or texting behind your back. It’s as easy as typing in a phone number.”

Introducing the controversial new website that will blow the lid off his affair. It’s called Reverse Phone Lookup, and it will help you track down who your man’s been calling or texting. Like we said, cheaters hate this website.

If you think your man’s got a secret, use this tool right now.

See who he’s been calling or textingbehind your back. It’s as easy as typing in a phone number and he’ll never find out.

Still not sure you’re ready for the truth? Check out these telltale signs your man’s a cheater. Chances are, he’s guilty of all of them.

He’s Secretive With His Smartphone

Anyone with a smartphone is spending more time online than ever before. If your man wants to fool around, he’s got a million ways to do it–and they’re all at his fingertips. Look at his texts and see who and what he’s been texting behind your back. You may be surprised at what you find.

He’s Extra Sensitive About Privacy

Cheaters work overtime to cover their tracks. You have to be smarter than them. Look out for new hobbies your man won’t tell you about. Or excuses like, “I just need to be alone.”

Then use Reverse Phone to look up calls he’s made on his phone. Maybe “Brad from work” is actually a Michelle from Tinder.

He Hits The Gym All The Time

In the past, you’ve hinted he could lose some belly fat. But he’s never listened. Now, out of the blue, he’s started hitting the gym hard. What’s changed? Him. Because if he wants to cheat, this is his mating season. He’s bulking up so he can lure the hottest girls to his bed.

He’s Distant

If your man’s doting on someone else, he won’t be as affectionate toward you. And he’ll be moody. He’ll get upset over nothing, and he’ll blame you for everything. Why does it feel like someone flipped a switch on his emotions? Because your man’s got someone on his mind. And it’s definitely not you.

Find out who’s taking up all his attention.

He Smells Different

Trust your instincts and your senses. If your man smells different, it’s because he’s spending his time somewhere else. And he’s trying to throw you off track.

Maybe he’s showering at his side chick’s place. Or you’re picking up the scent of her perfume. When your gut and your senses tell you something’s wrong, listen. Then uncover the truthfrom Reverse Phone.

He Deletes Texts

You know you’re not the only one he’s calling. But you can’t prove it. Because the last time you snuck a peek at his phone, the call and text logs were empty. Just wait a couple days, and grab his phone again (sooner or later you’ll catch him slipping). When you look up the numbers, you’ll expose the identity (and address!) of his “special someone.”

Let Reverse Phone do the secret sleuthing for you! Look up any number you want. No one will ever find out.

Everyone’s eyes wander from time to time. But not everyone strays. Make sure you don’t get caught in a love triangle you never wanted to be part of. With Reverse Phone, you’ll have the upper hand again.

Find out the truth in minutes, before he plays you for a total fool.","2014-12-09 00:00:00","0","49.0","20.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","62.0","41.0","0.0","166.0","7.0","24.0","6","643","30.79","99.00","8.88","21.01","10.37","14.93","90.67","57.39","21.31","15.40","0.16","0.16","7.93","6.69","0.47","5.75","5.60","13.37","10.42","5.29","7.15","2.33","21.15","6.07","3.11","1.87","0.62","1.71","5.75","2.64","2.95","0.31","1.40","0.47","25.82","0.00","0.00","0.47","8.71","15.86","2.64","1.87","2.18","3.89","3.42","4.51","5.91","1.87","2.02","1.09","1.87","1.09","0.31","0.16","0.47","5.75","1.09","1.71","1.56","1.24","0.47","2.95","14.93","2.80","14.46","0.93","7.62","6.38","0.78","0.62","0.47","0.47","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","23.95","8.71","3.58","0.16","0.00","0.47","0.47","0.00","1.56","8.40","0.62","0.00","2720","6.43","11.813559322033898","791","643","60","94.45","6.8","2.7","7.93","5.4","92","4.833333333333333","12.00317262830482","319","11.44","1","0.57","0","26","1","49","0","69","33","2","1","7","95","36","1","20","0","0","79","36","42","2","0","13","12","0","38","28","21","13","33","27","1","8","0","4"

Tempestt Bledsoe who played Vanessa on the mega successful cosby series says he Inappropriately touched her one time during a taping.

“I didn’t want to come forward but I just can’t stand by and keep quiet” says Bledsoe. I’m sure I’m not the only one that he has touched this way I mean hell everyone on that show got felt up it was like part of his program ask Lisa.

Tempestt didn’t want to go into great detail but stated that “one day in between takes he asked me to come back to his trailer for some one on one coaching.” He offered me some jello pudding and as I was eating the treat he asked me could he taste my pudding, I said sure and as I offered he said no I’m talking about that Puddy Cat and started rubbing my thigh slowly. I jump up dropped the pudding and ran out of the trailer.

I told my mom that I wasn’t feeling well and went home. I never told anyone and until this day I break out in a sweat whenever I’m around him and haven’t eaten jello pudding since. I’m just glad I’m not the only one and I pray he gets help.

“In the past, no one would ever think of putting Martin Luther King Jr. on one of the dollar bills, but now since inflation is making the dollar more and more worthless, there’s really no reason not to because these things aren’t nearly worth as much anymore,” said Lord Snoot Rothschild, international banker and one of the chairmen of the board of the Federal Reserve.

“We need a dollar for the modern American so we’re imagining a twenty dollar bill with the face of Martin Luther King Jr. boldly featured, a five dollar bill with the face of Caesar Chavez, and a one dollar bill with America’s greatest hero Hulk Hogan,” said Fagan Rockefeller, another chairman on the board of the Federal Reserve as he dumps thousands of America’s old dollar bills into the roaring fire of his Connecticut home. “It’s not like you use those dollars anyways when you’ve got a mountain of gold stored in Sweden,” added Rockefeller.

“This Barrack Obama ten dollar bill will surely let them know that there is absolutely nothing to worry about. America is doing fine. Just check out the radnew colors on these dollars, “Rothschild cackled as he proceed to wipe his ass with what one can only assume was the fabled million dollar bill.","2014-11-15 00:00:00","0","30.0","18.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","62.0","41.0","0.0","166.0","7.0","24.0","6","257","90.26","57.71","7.72","39.70","28.56","19.46","80.16","47.47","7.78","3.50","0.00","0.78","0.78","1.56","0.39","4.28","10.12","14.40","6.61","5.45","4.67","2.33","10.51","4.67","3.50","0.78","3.89","2.33","3.11","1.95","1.17","0.39","0.00","0.39","5.06","0.00","0.00","0.00","2.33","10.12","2.72","2.33","1.17","0.78","1.95","1.95","2.33","0.78","0.78","0.78","1.56","1.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","4.28","0.78","0.00","2.72","0.78","0.00","3.50","6.61","0.39","10.51","1.17","3.89","5.45","1.56","0.00","0.39","9.34","0.39","0.00","1.17","0.39","0.00","0.39","0.00","0.39","14.40","3.50","4.67","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","3.11","3.11","0.00","0.00","1192","8.19","37.857142857142854","365","257","9","59.37","12.1","12.1","10.91","15.5","51","15.833333333333334","21.37774319066148","161","31.0","0","0.45","0","6","6","33","0","36","12","2","1","4","43","34","1","9","0","0","9","2","14","1","0","1","4","0","9","10","6","3","9","7","0","1","0","1"

"http://mrnewswatch.com/watch-ignorant-mississippi-folks-explain-why-they-hate-obama-video/","WATCH: Ignorant Mississippi Folks Explain Why They Hate Obama (Video)","Why are so many white, poor, rural men conservative, even though liberal policies would help them?

And why do they hate President Barack Obama so much?

Scroll Down for Video…

These questions have baffled liberals for ages. In 2012, Bill Maher sent documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi out to ask them. She went to a rural part of Mississippi — the poorest and most conservative state in the Union — and talked with some white guys of varying ages and income levels.



What these southern men have to say might not surprise you, but you’ve got to give them props for being so affable and upfront with the daughter of Rep. Nancy “Devil Woman” Pelosi (D-Calif.)



Most striking is how even the least fortunate of these men stoically accepts his economic fate, and how deeply and sincerely these men cherish their beliefs — which seem so grim, heartless, and unappealing to the rest of us.Watch these white, rural men explain why they’re so conservative.White, conservative men explain why they hate Obama:

“One thing, he’s named ‘Obama’”

“This is America. Our president should be American. Not Muslim.”

Why they hate Obamacare even though they need healthcare:

I hate Obamacare. It’s retarded.

Back when i was growing up, and my parents were growing up, and my grandparents were growing up, we didn’t have all that and people still made it. And back then, people pulled their own weight, they didn’t sit around waiting for everyone else to take care of them.

Why they don’t want the government to fix the economy:

It’ll take care of itself. You put God in the saddle, it’ll all be okay.

Why they vote Republican even though it hasn’t worked for them:

But it COULD [work]. It hasn’t, but it could.

We would rather go broke and die hungry than to give up our moral beliefs.

Pelosi’s most baffling exchange was with a chatty, tooth-challenged man who said, “I don’t care for the government.” When an astonished Pelosi reminded him that he’s on food stamps, the man replied:

“Yeah, but I think I deserve food stamps. I have no employment.”

Since 51 percent of people in the state of Mississippi are female, and 37 percent are African American (according to the U.S. Census), we wish Pelosi had also talked with some women and blacks. Nonetheless, Pelosi’s interviews shed a fascinating light on how these white, male conservatives think.","2014-07-27 00:00:00","0","46.0","19.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","2.0","66.0","41.0","0.0","167.0","7.0","32.0","6","401","30.40","83.46","10.48","21.92","16.71","17.96","82.79","50.37","14.71","8.98","2.00","1.50","0.75","1.25","3.49","5.74","3.99","10.72","9.23","7.73","8.48","2.24","19.45","3.49","1.50","3.74","1.00","3.24","4.74","2.24","2.49","0.00","1.25","0.50","15.96","0.75","0.25","1.25","3.74","13.47","2.24","2.99","2.24","2.00","0.75","3.99","2.74","2.00","0.50","0.25","1.25","0.25","0.00","0.00","1.00","7.23","2.49","0.75","3.49","0.75","0.00","4.49","11.22","1.50","8.73","2.00","4.74","2.49","3.24","0.75","0.00","1.75","1.50","0.25","0.75","0.25","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.00","23.69","6.73","6.48","1.25","0.00","0.50","0.00","0.50","2.74","3.99","1.00","0.50","1831","7.23","21.94736842105263","534","400","25","80.62","10.0","6.0","10.96","9.7","71","7.833333333333334","15.5","241","18.95","9","0.49","0","19","4","28","0","34","35","0","3","5","38","37","0","28","0","0","38","7","25","0","1","3","9","1","15","19","7","6","31","9","1","2","0","12"
"http://mrnewswatch.com/secret-to-sell-your-soul-to-satan-is-revealed/","Secret To Sell Your Soul To Satan is Revealed","You can have power, wealth, an attractive mate and virtually anything else you ever dreamed of – by selling your soul to Satan! But how?

You must know what you’re doing when you make the deal or Satan will cheat you blind. That’s the word from Dr. Rex Touth, expert on satanic rituals and author of How to Negotiate Unholy Contracts.

Dr. Touth cites cases dating all the way back to the 16th century in which humans have agreed to spend eternity in Hell when they die in exchange for earthly pleasures while they’re alive.

“Human history and world literature are teeming with stories like that of Germany’s Dr. Faustus who sold his soul,” says Dr. Touth. “Our own American statesman Daniel Webster once debated Satan in a landmark soul-selling case in which he renegotiated the contract and had it overturned.

“Thousands have gained riches and fulfilled their fantasies.”

Here are some tips from Dr. Touth on how you can take advantage of the same opportunity:

1. SET THE DEAL UP PROPERLY. There’s a right and wrong way to make contact with the Devil. The right way is to be alone in your room, close your eyes and say, “Satan, I summon you. I have a quality soul to sell if the price is right.” It may take dozens, even hundreds of tries but at all costs, avoid sounding desperate or needy. He’ll show up eventually.

2. DEAL FROM A POSITION OF POWER. By far the biggest mistake people make is to underestimate how badly Satan wants their soul. It’s like precious gold to him and he’ll pay anything to get it. When he appears, get him to make the first offer, then up it.

3. GET THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Remember, you’re going to burn in Hell forever. So no matter how badly off you are now, demand the best. For instance, even if you feel unlovable and desperate with loneliness, don’t just say, “I want the most gorgeous woman on earth and I want her to be madly in love with me.” Instead, add, “In fact, throw in 100 other women as well so I can pick and choose according to my mood.”

4. REMEMBER TO DEMAND THE LIFE-EXTENSION CLAUSE. Satan won’t tell you if you don’t ask but you can get a guarantee of 300 years of youthful life before you go to eternal damnation. Why enjoy a mere 75 or 80 years of reckless living when you can get 300?

Religious groups worldwide are trying to ban Dr. Touth’s book. “This kind of trash is spiritual dynamite,” says a spokesman for the North American Council of Churches and Synogogues. “We can’t, in good conscience, let people read how to destroy their almighty souls.”

But Dr. Touth says we should all be aware of the facts so we can make an informed decision. “It’s your soul,” he says. “Do waht you want with it.”","2014-08-01 00:00:00","0","38.0","18.0","3.0","0.0","11.0","0.0","62.0","41.0","0.0","167.0","7.0","24.0","6","486","63.59","89.51","14.34","19.62","13.50","16.46","85.19","48.77","12.35","8.85","1.44","0.82","4.32","1.44","0.82","3.50","5.56","13.37","8.02","5.35","7.82","1.03","16.67","2.88","1.85","3.09","2.88","1.44","6.79","3.09","3.50","0.62","1.03","0.41","13.37","0.00","0.41","0.62","1.65","12.35","1.65","2.67","2.06","3.09","2.06","2.88","2.88","0.82","1.65","0.41","1.44","0.21","1.03","0.00","0.00","8.64","1.85","2.06","2.88","3.09","0.41","1.23","13.99","1.85","12.14","0.62","7.00","4.73","1.03","0.62","0.21","2.26","4.32","0.41","0.82","0.62","0.00","0.00","0.21","0.00","21.19","8.23","4.73","0.21","0.00","0.41","0.21","0.41","3.91","3.09","0.00","0.00","2061","7.1","16.193548387096776","639","486","36","83.15","8.8","5.0","8.23","6.5","86","7.5","14.478189300411524","295","15.32","27","0.49","0","19","9","29","0","52","32","0","2","11","62","58","0","21","1","0","43","10","24","0","1","1","17","0","30","10","9","2","27","16","3","2","0","10"
"http://mrnewswatch.com/george-w-bush-arrested-for-possession-of-cocaine/","George W. Bush Arrested For Possession Of Cocaine","One of the most notorious Presidents in history of The United States of America is back in the spotlight, but not because of his politics. George W. Bush was arrested in a Dallas suburb late Tuesday evening after a routine traffic stop uncovered over an ounce of cocaine in his glove compartment.

Dallas police say they pulled over Bush after he made a right turn without signaling. Officers report they were surprised when seeing it was the ex-president, but felt something was off about his behavior. They say Bush seemed under the influence of a narcotic, and the officers on-scene asked to search the car. Curiously, Bush consented, and police found the narcotics.“We pulled over the truck and were about to write a simple traffic ticket and things escalated fast,” said officer Charles Cane, a veteran officer with the Dallas Police Department. “At first my partner and I were stunned with who was in the truck ,and [Bush] began to crack jokes and asked if we wanted to take a picture with him. I noticed he was sniffling quite a bit and the glaze on his eyes screamed that the was under the influence.”Cane said that once the officers uncovered the cocaine, Bush tried to bribe them to keep from getting arrested. When that failed, he turned to threats and rambling, reportedly saying that he would ‘get the FBI to kick their a–’ and that ‘Presidents can break any laws they want.’

“I broke so many laws when I was in office, and I didn’t see you coming to try to arrest me then!” Bush shouted at police officers. “I’ve been doing coke for decades! I used to blow lines out of a Skull & Bones in New Haven tittie bars when you were making nice in your diapers, kid. You just want your name in the papers next to mine.”

“It was a tough arrest to make, but I didn’t become a police officer to make easy decisions. He begged me over and over to let it slide, then he offered me money, then he called me an ass—-, but that is the way the law goes. We don’t offer special treatment to anyone in Dallas. I don’t care who you are.”

Representatives for Bush have yet to comment, but bail was set at $5,000 and posted immediately. Bush spent less than 6 hours in a holding cell before being released.","2014-07-31 00:00:00","0","9.0","12.0","3.0","0.0","5.0","0.0","34.0","30.0","0.0","87.0","5.0","2.0","1","406","81.15","69.76","39.85","34.31","19.33","16.01","83.99","52.71","13.79","10.34","3.69","0.74","1.48","2.96","1.48","3.45","8.62","15.27","7.14","2.71","6.90","1.48","17.49","4.19","1.72","1.48","1.48","1.23","2.96","1.48","0.99","0.25","0.25","0.49","11.08","0.00","0.25","0.00","2.96","8.87","1.72","1.97","1.23","1.97","0.00","2.71","3.45","1.23","1.72","0.25","1.48","0.99","0.00","0.00","0.49","10.84","0.99","0.99","8.13","0.74","0.74","8.62","6.40","0.99","15.52","2.46","6.90","6.40","4.68","0.74","0.00","0.49","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.25","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","16.75","5.17","4.68","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.49","0.74","2.96","1.72","0.00","0.99","1726","6.94","25.6875","546","401","22","69.92","10.3","8.0","8.82","8.9","61","8.3","15.364788029925188","233","22.62","11","0.52","0","18","4","39","0","47","18","1","0","2","47","29","1","24","0","0","36","8","15","0","1","3","17","0","20","39","11","10","12","3","0","2","0","4"
"http://mrnewswatch.com/floyd-mayweather-knocked-out-in-sparring-session-while-training-for-pacquiao-fight/","Floyd Mayweather Knocked Out In Sparring Session While Training For Pacquiao Fight!","Las Vegas – Recent reports out of a gym in Las Vegas have reported that a strange smelling Italian/Irish immigrant by the name of Peter McFarboroni has knocked out the undisputed, undefeated boxing great Floyd Mayweather.

Where the greats have failed, this man who many thought was simply the gym’s manager, succeeded by knocking out Mayweather in a mere sparring session while he is preparing for his upcoming Pacquiao match with what McFarboroni called a haymaker. “Jumpinbegonias,” the near Leprechaun exclaimed as he saw the stars in Mayweather’s eyes as the champ spun around six times, stuck out his tongue, and collapsed to the ground.

“I threw him off his game by saying he could not read which made him drop his guard and get angry, then all I had to do was dodge to the right, block, back, back, and then punch him in his weak spot Next thing you know, the lad’s down for the count,” said McFarboronni as he slid back into his pink jogging suit and proceeded to start mopping the sauna before the gym’s closing hours.

Mayweather has claimed that the fight never happened because it was never sanctioned. This is however the first time an unsanctioned bout did not land Mayweather behind bars. [Continue Reading]

"http://mrnewswatch.com/barack-obama-to-declare-cuba-51st-state-in-2016/","Barack Obama To Declare Cuba 51st State In 2016","In a surprise move today U.S. President Barak Obama made a declaration that sent shockwaves down both sides of the House and Senate floor. “It may take my final two years in office, but make no mistake: Cuba will be our 51st state,” Obama said.

Obama cites one reason for incorporating the island nation: “We need another vacation state.”

Below: U.S. flag redesign compositions to reflect all 51 states

“The tyranny of Fidel Castro can be overlooked now that he has stepped down, and we can take this opportunity to grow our borders for the betterment of our domestic travel options,” the president said. “Hawaii has played itself out. As beautiful as it is, we’ve all been there, done that. We don’t have another domestic tropical island where we can vacation without a passport. We need another. And Cuba is it.”

Currently Americans are not allowed to travel to Cuba; however, if the country does become a part of the United States, Americans will be able to visit the lush Caribbean island restriction free.

Estaban Arnaz, spokesman for Cuba’s president Raul Castro, when asked about becoming part of the United States, said simply, “We’re in.”

“This is yet another attempt by the president to abuse his executive power,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) told reporters, acknowledging that, in fact “the way the president has been able to bend the rules thus far, I wouldn’t be surprised if this actually happens, but in the end, do I care? F*ck no. I’ve never been to Cuba. I’m excited to check it out.”

Although a 51 star flag design is still in the works, the cost of changing the American flag to show 51 stars will be passed on to American workers, in what’s being called “The Star Tax.” FICA deductions will increase 2% beginning in March 2016.

"http://mrnewswatch.com/u-s-plans-to-nuke-dallas-to-stop-spread-of-ebola-virus/","U.S. Plans To “NUKE” Dallas To Stop Spread Of Ebola Virus","Upon discovering the first U.S. ebola carrier in the city of Dallas, Texas, the United States has announced plans to safely eradicate the city by means of a human nuclear incineration device in fear that the disease might spread past city limits to infect people or because it’s Dallas and that sounds like a lot of fun.

Recently, Richard Burroughs, head director of the CDC stated, “I had a conversation with President Obama and we both agreed that the best course of action we could take would be to nuke Dallas…because of ebola of course.”

Although several health experts have already said the chance of ebola spreading on a mass scale are very slim. “You have a better chance dying of influenza in Dallas than of ebola,” said Matthew Graves, an expert in pandemic infections for Doctors without Borders. He continued, “but, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t blow up Dallas. If you’ve ever been there, it’s nothing but assholes and garbage piles.”

In a special State of the Union address, President Obama went live on television and on-line, with the broadcast being purposefully withheld from airing on Fox News in order to assure that no residents of Dallas would hear the news. In his address, President Obama stated, “men and women of America, it comes to me with great pleasure to announce that although ebolaactually did manage to make its way to the United States, it thankfully made its way to none other than Dallas, Texas and as a preemptive safety measure, I have ordered the United States Airforce to unload a small nuclear payload on the center of the city which will eradicate this city of assholes from our great nation. Oh, and it will ensure the disease doesn’t spread or something like that. You remember Outbreak.”

It has been reported at this time that the jets have taken off, but the city of Dallas stays committed in resolve to be a city full of self-absorbed, narrow-minded douchebags to the very end. One business man said with a smirk, “I’d like to see them try” right before his entire skeleton was pulverized to a fine ash by the blast.

"http://mrnewswatch.com/lol-drunk-sarah-palin-gives-speech-on-impeaching-obamavideo/","LOL: Drunk Sarah Palin Gives Speech On Impeaching Obama(VIDEO)","At the Western Conservative Summit this last week, Sarah Palin drunkenly doubled down on her calls for impeachment after a string of word soup tailored together from past conservative talking points. Am I being critical of Palin’s intelligence while she stumbles through this 30 minutes speech by calling her “drunken”? No. I do believe that Palin is 99% moron, but this one appears to be a moron that had a few too many to drink that evening before they got up for their speaking engagement.



The speech seemed to have been written by some neo-libertarian tribute to Ayn Rand by offering a protagonist “the forgotten man”. Her speech didn’t ever cover one issue, but instead turned Tea Party talking points into a macabre poetry slam competition. Palin says absolutely nothing of substance in her speech aside from her general feelings about society and her hatred of the other side of politics.

The only thing that seems certain in Palin’s world is that Obama is evil and facts are relative. Her drive towards impeachment in the drunken speech strings together random accusations as public facts (most of which have been debunked). Palin even mentions the 2008 “loophole” signed by former President Bush to give refugee status to children as a reason to impeach Obama. Because she is just that dumb… and most likely drunk.This video is 30 minutes of “are you fucking kidding me?” that is only topped off by the introduction to Palin which labels her as the “most influential woman in the history of the republican party”. That doesn’t help the republicans in their defense of the “war on women” at all.

"http://mrnewswatch.com/2pac-still-alive-new-evidence-emerges/","2Pac Still Alive?? New Evidence Emerges…","On September 13th 1996, American rapper 2pac Shakur was pronounced as being fatally killed by a series of gunshot wounds. Despite this, there is much surrounding his ‘death’ that doesn’t add up. Now you’re probably reading this thinking, this has got to be one of those whacked out ‘conspiracy theories’ going against everything ever officially reported, if he was alive we would know for certain, right? I initially thought the same seeing such claims too. It wasn’t long however, before I found myself uncovering much more about his supposed death and the circumstances situated around it that made be begin to think otherwise. I began to realise that actually, such claims that 2pac may have faked his own death and is still alive may have more truths to them than what first appears, as it is evident that there is more to this story than what was ever officially reported..

It all began a couple years ago when I was on Youtube listening to 2pac and some of his songs. On the sidebar I saw a link titled “2PAC ALIVE 2014 RETURN – MUST WATCH!!”. Of course I thought, another stereotypical video discrediting people questioning real conspiracies and cover-ups. Being a huge 2pac fan I couldn’t help but take an interest in seeing what these people were claiming and so clicked the video anyway. What I saw next could not have surprised me more, as it was suggesting the last known photo of 2pac alive the night he had allegedly been shot, was fake!

Another strong piece of evidence made against the photo is a picture snapped of 2pac and Suge Knight earlier. The night 2pac was ‘killed’, he was at the MGM strip in Las Vegas to see a Mike Tyson boxing match. Interestingly if you look at the picture seen below you will notice something doesn’t add up. It is very obvious if you examine the facial hair on 2pac’s chin, you can see that in the picture where he is in the car his beard is much longer!

Pictured above on the left is the photo in its original form. What stands out about it most is that there are no keys in the ignition! This can be seen clearly from the close up picture to the right. It was reported that this photo was allowed to be taken by paparazzi while 2pac and his manager Suge Knight were waiting at traffic lights. With this in mind, it isn’t possible that the car would have been able to take off without any keys.

Finally, if you didn’t think that was enough, this last piece of evidence against the ‘final’ photo is BY FAR the most compelling as it is quite clear that the photo of 2pac seen is actually his military portrait. Below you can see that this photo has been overlayed on top of the photo where he is seen in the car and is faded out gradually. The results are a perfect match..

If you look at his eyes throughout each frame they remain the same while the lighting changes..

This got me thinking, why on earth would somebody go to the trouble and effort to fake the last photo of 2pac being alive? There would have to be a reason for it, and so lead me to investigate further in finding out what else really happened that night. It turns out there were a number of things out of the ordinary. It was very strange for 2pac not to be wearing his bullet-proof vest as after less than a year earlier, 2pac had survived a point blank shooting in New York. It was because of this he was always seen to be wearing one. According to his cousin, Jamal Lesane: “Normally he wouldn’t leave without it, but this time he left it behind and didn’t have it with him.” E.D.I also claims that night Kastro told 2pac he should put his vest on, but replied “It’s too hot tonight.” Before the alleged shooting that would become known as the fatal night 2pac died, he and his camaraderie of Outlawz and bodyguards made their way across the Vegas strip to a mansion belonging to Suge Knight. According to members of The Outlawz, Suge and 2pac unexpectedly disappeared briefly while the others waited patiently. “I don’t really know what Pac or Suge was doing at the time, I just knew we was waiting and I was ready to go.” Reportedly after about half an hour, with 2pac and the others now ready to leave for a show at club 662, 2pac made an unusual request to his bodyguard, Frank Alexander. “I was walking to the car with Suge and Pac when I was opening up the door to get in the backseat. Then Pac stopped me and said no take the keys and go drive the Lexus with the Outlawz, we’re going to be drinking and you’re going to be the designated driver to drive us back after we’ve finished parting.” This was even more out of the ordinary as 2pac would never go anywhere in public without at least one of his bodyguards for his safety. Given such abnormal circumstances, what happened later involving his ‘death’, was was either very convenient, or a total coincidence.. The story officially reported of 2pac’s death is of he and Suge waiting at more traffic lights along the MGM strip, when a white Cadillac was seen pulling up next to them and began firing shots into their BMW. Frank Alexander was in the Lexus behind 2pac and described the scene as he saw it. “After the Cadillac shot into the car I thought they were dead, my reaction was to run up to the car, but instead the car sped up and took off.” The BMW went onto makes a hard right u-turn and race off in the opposite direction. “I didn’t know what to think, it was a faulk, it was a haze. Were these real bullets? Did they really shoot these guys?..” Frank also made mention that some of the other cars containing security went in pursuit of the white Cadillac, although failed to catch up to it and identify the vehicle plate. To this day nobody knows who killed 2pac and the case remains an unsolved murder. The events that followed suit involved 2pac being rushed to hospital, although the details as to how he arrived and by whom are uncertain due to three different scenarios being relayed by different accounts. According to media 2pac and Suge were found in the BMW with all four tires blown out. An ambulance also apparently arrived on scene shortly after and was said to have rushed 2pac to hospital. Suge describes a different series of events, claiming in an interview he drove 2pac to the hospital himself, he then however is oddly seen changing his story to coincide with that of official media reports! The third and final account is that of a by-stander still on scene when asked on camera what she had just witnessed. VIDEO: “We were pretty far down the street when it happened, we didn’t know if we heard gunshots, we didn’t know exactly what we heard, we heard a lot of screaming and car screeching. We ran up the street as cops were running past us and by the time we got here they were already taking which now I found out is 2pac into the helicopter away.”

Did this person say something she wasn’t supposed to? .. Afterwards nobody else on the scene was further asked for questioning and reports continued to detail 2pac being met by an ambulance at the scene of the broken down BMW.

How much more bizarre could this night get? .. Well as it turns out things were only beginning to get stranger.

Pictured above on the left is a picture of the crime scene where the BMW came to its end. The damage to the rims can be seen from the blown out tires. Pictured to the right is news footage showing investigators examining the supposed car 2pac and Suge were in. Here’s where it gets weird, if you look at the wheels of both cars neither match up.

When both cars are seen from another angle it is unmistakable that these are two totally different vehicles! This begs the question, why was this second car being examined and why was it on the scene??","2014-11-13 00:00:00","0","9.0","11.0","3.0","0.0","6.0","0.0","35.0","30.0","0.0","90.0","5.0","0.0","1","1413","70.52","57.58","47.77","23.55","21.74","16.91","84.71","55.48","13.59","6.51","1.63","0.99","0.78","2.55","0.57","7.08","7.86","15.29","9.84","5.02","5.94","1.70","18.83","5.24","3.33","2.05","0.92","2.55","1.98","0.92","1.06","0.07","0.28","0.07","7.43","0.07","0.07","0.14","2.69","11.75","2.41","1.49","1.56","2.48","1.34","3.96","4.46","3.61","0.71","0.14","1.27","0.57","0.64","0.00","0.07","5.38","1.49","0.50","2.26","1.13","0.35","8.99","7.50","0.64","16.77","3.11","8.28","5.52","1.13","0.57","0.07","0.28","0.00","1.27","0.21","0.00","0.07","0.00","0.07","0.07","12.67","4.60","3.26","0.14","0.00","0.57","0.50","0.28","1.49","1.84","0.00","0.00","6060","6.93","23.866666666666667","1877","1406","65","74.93","10.5","8.2","8.53","10.3","198","8.9","16.273001422475108","556","21.37","34","0.53","0","44","40","150","0","170","78","5","1","16","169","66","0","52","1","0","98","22","84","7","2","20","49","0","54","93","50","52","32","41","4","13","0","14"
"http://mrnewswatch.com/woman-accidentally-shoots-herself-with-gun-she-bought-for-ferguson-riots/","Woman Accidentally Shoots Herself with Gun She Bought For Ferguson Riots","As the Grand Jury decision on whether or not to indict Ferguson,MO police officer Darren Wilson in the death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown draws near, people around the area have begun to load up on firearms and ammunition. While it remains to be seen if the panic is warranted – everyone from community leaders to President Obama have stressed the need for peace following the announcement – the added guns in the hands of people who may not know how to properly use them has already seen at least one casualty.

St. Louis police are reporting that a 26-year-old woman has accidentally killed herself with a gun she had purchased in anticipation for Ferguson riots.

The accident occurred when the car the woman, identified as Becca Campbell, was riding in rear-ended a car in front of them. Typically a fender bender would not cause loss of life, but the woman’s gun discharged in the collision and the bullet struck her in the head.

According to KMOV:

The boyfriend, who wasn’t identified, told police that the couple had bought a gun because of fears of unrest related to the pending grand jury decision on the shooting of Michael Brown, the sources said.

He told investigators that as they drove late Friday night, the victim waved a gun, jokingly saying the couple were ready for Ferguson, the sources said.

He ducked to get out of the way of the gun and accidentally rear-ended another car. He said the accident caused the gun to go off and she was struck by a bullet in the head, the sources said.

Guns, already a problem for America more generally, are becoming an increasing concern for residents and law enforcement around Ferguson. As tensions rise – and urged on by a giddy media which can’t help but stoke the flames in pursuit of ratings boosts – the number of scared people buying firearms to “protect” themselves from their neighbors is skyrocketing. One Ferguson gun store owner told reporters that his sales have gone up by around 700% this month.

In a sign of just how bad it has gotten, store owners, like the one mentioned above, are now beginning to close up their shops and ship out their lethal stock so no more weapons can find their way onto the streets in the coming weeks. It’s a testament to the very real fear people feel that even the promise of large profits can’t entice gun shop owners from ignoring pleas from law enforcement and staying open for business.

Whether or not violence erupts after the decision, the fact that hundreds of more guns are now in the community is a problem that will likely plague Ferguson long after the protests end.

They will be implanted to help identify individuals immediately. According to the report, the technology is used to answer one question, “Am I who I say I am?”



Some worry, however, that the RFID Microchip will give the government too much power, allowing them to track every move. In some states, like Virginia, legislation is in process to stop this from happening. The report also reveals an RFID Brain Chip that has been developed and is currently being tested on several humans. Proof the RFID Microchip is in Obamacare below:



It was reported that the use of Micro-Chips in Bill H.R. 4872 was located on Page 1014 under “National Medical Device Registry” it tells about a “Class II Device That is Implantable” and yes, they passed the bill. Read Page “1014″ In The H.R. 4872 Read Class II Special Controls Guidance For FDA Staff

With the RFID Microchip they can track the movement of the people that are implanted. They can also control the money and food of the people. It is also reported to be possible to even kill the people that don’t obey. The HR 3962 Bill is an exact copy of the HR 3200 bill in with the exception of just a few words removed concerning the RFID Microchip but the ability to Chip Every Citizen of the United States is still in the bill.

…At least that’s the case according to the manager of his former Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood castmate and “friend” Ray J.

During last night’s airing of the show’s reunion special, Cash Jones took to Instagram to expose the rapper for carrying on sexual activities with other men, and putting a slew of Black women “at risk.”

MONA SCOTT-YOUNG SAYS YUNG BERG FIRING WAS NETWORK’S DECISION, SHE WILL MISS HIM

“Walked in the studio, and seen some sh*t I [didn’t] want to see” he posted. “Be who [you’re going to] be, kick the closet doors down and come out switching.”

MASIKA TUCKER TALKS YUNG BERG INCIDENT: ‘IT WAS NOT AN ABUSIVE SITUATION’

No word has been given if Cash is retaliating against Berg for his fall out with Ray J‘s ex-girlfriend Teairra Mari—the former Roc-A-Fella Records singer who Berg alleges performed a sex act on him while they were recording music together.

The 20-year old, who just signed a record deal with Epic, was busted in June, according to TMZ.

The “Hot N****” rapper was spotted by police with a gun while inside a Brooklyn apartment. They went to investigate and found the weapon hidden in a couch.

It was a 9mm Glock pistol, in addition to a magazine with 14 rounds in it. He was charged with felony criminal possession of a weapon.

Soon after the 2012 election, the MSNBC host was summoned along with other “progressive journalists” apparently to pick up the administration’s talking points by hand. And last August, Sharpton sat down with the president in his role as an African-American faith leader to discuss voting rights, closing the gap on education, unemployment, and access to health care.”

This weekend he was a guest at the state dinner for French President François Hollande, and Today Al “Tawana Brawley” Sharpton again shared a table with President Obama and Attorney General Eric “Fast and Furious” Holder, this time to discuss criminal justice reform.

One proposes clarifying the definition of “committed to a mental institution” to include both involuntary outpatient as well as inpatient commitments. The other proposes to give some Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) covered entities “express permission to submit to the background check system the limited information necessary to help keep guns out of potentially dangerous hands.” The administration says that there would be no requirement to report “general mental health visits or other routine mental health care.”

The move was applauded by Democratic leadership, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Did Roger approve this? > RT @Reince Hey Jeff Zucker, we're the Republican Party and we speak for ourselves, pal. cc: @CNN @FoxNews — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 11, 2014

Earlier in the week, Ailes had taken a shot at CNN, telling The Hollywood Reporter that the network had “thrown in the towel” when it comes to news. Ailes noted that CNN and Zucker “had a big hit with a whale one night [the documentary Blackfish]. I guess he’s going to do whales a lot. If I were Discovery, I’d be worried.”

Listen up, Zucker and Ailes: this is how things really are.","2014-01-10 21:06:51","0","26.0","5.0","6.0","0.0","12.0","0.0","65.0","22.0","0.0","139.0","0.0","15.0","9","179","81.75","84.28","21.18","57.46","14.92","16.20","70.95","42.46","10.61","5.03","2.23","2.23","0.00","0.56","0.00","5.59","8.94","10.06","8.94","2.23","5.03","0.00","18.99","2.23","1.12","1.68","1.68","1.12","3.91","2.79","1.12","0.56","0.00","0.00","11.73","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.56","5.59","1.68","0.56","1.12","2.23","0.56","1.68","2.23","0.00","1.68","0.56","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","10.61","6.15","0.00","3.91","0.56","0.00","6.15","9.50","1.12","12.29","3.35","5.03","3.91","2.79","2.79","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.68","0.00","1.12","0.56","0.00","0.00","27.37","6.15","5.59","1.12","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.00","4.47","2.23","1.12","6.15","794","7.1","20.333333333333332","243","180","12","73.17","9.1","6.8","9.56","8.3","31","6.642857142857143","14.88888888888889","122","18.89","10","0.43","0","4","3","19","0","18","5","0","0","0","18","51","0","2","0","0","12","0","1","1","0","1","5","0","5","11","6","5","7","5","0","1","0","2"

On his radio show Monday, Hannity told listeners, “I can’t wait to get out of here. I really can’t. I don’t want to pay their 10 percent state tax anymore. I live in the second-highest property taxed county in the entire country in Nassau County. I can’t wait to sell my house to somebody who wants it. I can’t wait to pay no state income tax down in Florida or Texas.”

Sen. Ted Cruz and Lieutenant Gov. David Dewhurst have already rolled out the welcome mat. Will Hannity take him up on the offer?

Noonan’s theme was “the growing distance between Washington and the public it dominates.” There’s no scoop there, at least to members of the Tea Party, and certainly not to Sarah Palin.

Great article, Peggy, but where the heck were you when I & other commonsense conservatives were sounding the warning http://t.co/tMdB2575Ft — Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) January 31, 2014

Where was she? In 2008 she was enthralled by candidate Barack Obama, whose “victory would provide a fresh start in a nation in which a fresh start would come as a national relief.” In 2012, she said she was privately receiving thanks from conservatives for “her candid and unflattering assessment of the state of the Romney campaign.” Now, in 2014, she seems concerned about a federal government that is larger than ever and out of touch with ordinary citizens. In other words, welcome to the Tea Party.

Palin’s full Facebook post reads:

Great article, Peggy, but where the heck were you when I and other commonsense conservatives were sounding the warning bell in ’08? You joined the “cool kids” in mocking and condescendingly criticizing — ultimately demanding that we “sit down and shut up.” Better late than never, though, Peggy and your ilk, because, meanwhile back in America…

Arizona’s SB 1062, passed by the state legislature but not yet signed by Gov. Jan Brewer, would provide legal protection to people or companies facing discrimination lawsuits if they are acting upon their “sincerely held” religious beliefs. The Arizona Capitol Times provides as an example a widely cited case in which a business refused to provide services for a gay wedding, claiming that same-sex marriage violated their religious beliefs.

The bill has caught the attention of many, as well as celebrities like George Takei and Marlee Matlin.

Well, there certainly was a difference of opinion following Thomas Sowell’s appearance on “Hannity” Monday night. No, it’s not worth killing each other over, but it does point out a dramatic rift in the Republican Party. As Sowell wrote in an op-ed Sunday:

The Republican establishment’s criticisms of Sen. Cruz are criticisms of his rule-or-ruin strategy, which can destroy whatever chance Republicans have of taking back the Senate in 2014 and taking back the White House in 2016. And, without political power, there is no real hope of changing things in Washington. … The Republicans need every vote they can get in the Senate — plus additional votes by defeating some Democrats who are running for the Senate this fall. It can be a very close call. Jeopardizing the reelection of current Republican Senators is an act of utter irresponsibility, a high risk with zero benefits to anyone except Ted Cruz — and the Democrats.

Does Cruz need to continue taking the fight to the Obama administration, or does he need to learn to pick his battles?

The St. Louis Dispatch reports:

An undercover television news story to test security in local schools triggered a lockdown Thursday at Kirkwood High, angering parents and raising questions about media ethics. Students and teachers at the school were huddled in classrooms with the lights off for about 40 minutes Thursday afternoon after a man came into the school and asked to speak with security, then left. The visit was one of five made by the television station to schools in the region aimed at exposing lapses in school security.

The school alerted parents of the situation via social media and telephone.

This is Ginger Cayce. KHS is on lockdown. We do not believe there is any imminent danger. Here is what I know. An man came in and stated that he wanted to talk to security. He gave his name and cell number. When the secretary left to get the SRO, the person left the office and will not answer his phone. This initiated the lockdown.

Wow KSDK, that was a pretty dumb move. Pretty sure you just scared the crap out of a lot of kirkwood high school parents. #StlProbs — Emily Nardi (@EmNEm_17) January 16, 2014

KSDK issued the following statement.

NewsChannel 5 recognizes the importance of safety in our schools. As part of a continuing investigation this afternoon, we visited five local schools. One of our employees assigned to this investigative report visited Kirkwood High School. He entered and walked his way toward the office, asking a teacher for directions after a few minutes. There, he asked if he might discuss the school’s security. He identified himself by name and gave the office his phone number. When the security official could not be reached, our employee left the premises without escort. Approximately an hour later – after our visit – the high school was put on lock down. This lock down certainly was not the intent of our visit. We will report this story tonight on NewsChannel 5 at 10 p.m. NewsChannel 5 will continue to be vigilant when it comes to the safety of our schools and your children within.

The oil price drop that has dominated the headlines in recent weeks has been framed almost exclusively in terms of oil market economics, with most media outlets blaming Saudi Arabia, through its OPEC Trojan horse, for driving down the price, thus causing serious damage to the world’s major oil exporters – most notably Russia.

While the market explanation is partially true, it is simplistic, and fails to address key geopolitical pressure points in the Middle East.

Oilprice.com looked beyond the headlines for the reason behind the oil price drop, and found that the explanation, while difficult to prove, may revolve around control of oil and gas in the Middle East and the weakening of Russia, Iran and Syria by flooding the market with cheap oil.

The oil weapon

We don’t have to look too far back in history to see Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter and producer, using the oil price to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In 1973, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat convinced Saudi King Faisal to cut production and raise prices, then to go as far as embargoing oil exports, all with the goal of punishing the United States for supporting Israel against the Arab states. It worked. The “oil price shock” quadrupled prices.

It happened again in 1986, when Saudi Arabia-led OPEC allowed prices to drop precipitously, and then in 1990, when the Saudis sent prices plummeting as a way of taking out Russia, which was seen as a threat to their oil supremacy. In 1998, they succeeded. When the oil price was halved from $25 to $12, Russia defaulted on its debt.

The Saudis and other OPEC members have, of course, used the oil price for the obverse effect, that is, suppressing production to keep prices artificially high and member states swimming in “petrodollars”. In 2008, oil peaked at $147 a barrel.

Turning to the current price drop, the Saudis and OPEC have a vested interest in taking out higher-cost competitors, such as US shale oil producers, who will certainly be hurt by the lower price. Even before the price drop, the Saudis were selling their oil to China at a discount. OPEC’s refusal on Nov. 27 to cut production seemed like the baldest evidence yet that the oil price drop was really an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and the US.

However, analysis shows the reasoning is complex, and may go beyond simply taking down the price to gain back lost marketshare.

“What is the reason for the United States and some U.S. allies wanting to drive down the price of oil?” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro asked rhetorically in October. “To harm Russia.”

Many believe the oil price plunge is the result of deliberate and well-planned collusion on the part of the United States and Saudi Arabia to punish Russia and Iran for supporting the murderous Assad regime in Syria.

Punishing Assad and friends

Proponents of this theory point to a Sept. 11 meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry and Saudi King Abdullah at his palace on the Red Sea. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, it was during that meeting that a deal was hammered out between Kerry and Abdullah. In it, the Saudis would support Syrian airstrikes against Islamic State (ISIS), in exchange for Washington backing the Saudis in toppling Assad.

If in fact a deal was struck, it would make sense, considering the long-simmering rivalry between Saudi Arabia and its chief rival in the region: Iran. By opposing Syria, Abdullah grabs the opportunity to strike a blow against Iran, which he sees as a powerful regional rival due to its nuclear ambitions, its support for militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah, and its alliance with Syria, which it provides with weapons and funding. The two nations are also divided by religion, with the majority of Saudis following the Sunni version of Islam, and most Iranians considering themselves Shi’ites.

“The conflict is now a full-blown proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which is playing out across the region,” Reuters reported on Dec. 15. “Both sides increasingly see their rivalry as a winner-take-all conflict: if the Shi’ite Hezbollah gains an upper hand in Lebanon, then the Sunnis of Lebanon—and by extension, their Saudi patrons—lose a round to Iran. If a Shi’ite-led government solidifies its control of Iraq, then Iran will have won another round.”

The Saudis know the Iranians are vulnerable on the oil price. Experts say the country needs $140 a barrel oil to balance its budget; at sub-$60 prices, the Saudis succeed in pressuring Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, possibly containing its nuclear ambitions and making the country more pliable to the West, which has the power to reduce or lift sanctions if Iran cooperates.

Adding credence to this theory, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told a Cabinet meeting earlier this month that the fall in oil prices was “politically motivated” and a “conspiracy against the interests of the region, the Muslim people and the Muslim world.”

Pipeline conspiracy

Some commentators have offered a more conspiratorial theory for the Saudis wanting to get rid of Assad. They point to a 2011 agreement between Syria, Iran and Iraq that would see a pipeline running from the Iranian Port Assalouyeh to Damascus via Iraq. The $10-billion project would take three years to complete and would be fed gas from the South Pars gas field, which Iran shares with Qatar. Iranian officials have said they plan to extend the pipeline to the Mediterranean to supply gas to Europe – in competition with Qatar, the world’s largest LNG exporter.

“The Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline – if it’s ever built – would solidify a predominantly Shi’ite axis through an economic, steel umbilical cord,” wrote Asia Times correspondent Pepe Escobar.

Global Research, a Canada-based think tank, goes further to suggest that Assad’s refusal in 2009 to allow Qatar to construct a gas pipeline from its North Field through Syria and on to Turkey and the EU, combined with the 2011 pipeline deal, “ignited the full-scale Saudi and Qatari assault on Assad’s power.”

“Today the US-backed wars in Ukraine and in Syria are but two fronts in the same strategic war to cripple Russia and China and to rupture any Eurasian counter-pole to a US-controlled New World Order. In each, control of energy pipelines, this time primarily of natural gas pipelines—from Russia to the EU via Ukraine and from Iran and Syria to the EU via Syria—is the strategic goal,” Global Research wrote in an Oct. 26 post.

Poking the Russian bear

How does Russia play into the oil price drop? As a key ally of Syria, supplying Assad with billions in weaponry, President Vladimir Putin has, along with Iran, found himself targeted by the House of Saud. Putin’s territorial ambitions in the Ukraine have also put him at odds with US President Barack Obama and leaders of the EU, which in May of this year imposed a set of sanctions on Russia.

As has been noted, Saudi Arabia’s manipulation of the oil price has twice targeted Russia. This time, the effects of a low price have hit Moscow especially hard due to sanctions already in place combined with the low ruble. Last week, in an effort to defend its currency, the Bank of Russia raised interest rates to 17 percent. The measure failed, with the ruble dropping another 20 percent, leading to speculation the country could impose capital controls. Meanwhile, Putin took the opportunity in his annual televised address to announce that while the economy is likely to suffer for the next two years and that Russians should brace for a recession, “Our economy will get diversified and oil prices will go back up.”

He may be right, but what will the effect be on Russia of a sustained period of low oil prices? Eric Reguly, writing in The Globe and Mail last Saturday, points out that with foreign exchange reserves at around $400 billion, the Russian state is “in no danger of collapse” even in the event of a deep recession. Reguly predicts the greater threat is to the Russian private sector, which has a debt overhang of some $700 billion.

“This month alone, $30-billion of that amount must be repaid, with another $100-billion coming due next year. The problem is made worse by the economic sanctions, which have made it all but impossible for Russian companies to finance themselves in Western markets,” he writes.

Will it work?

Whether one is a conspiracy theorist or a market theorist, in explaining the oil price drop, it really matters little, for the effect is surely more important than the cause. Putin has already shown himself to be a master player in the chess game of energy politics, so the suggestion that sub-$60 oil will crush the Russian leader has to be met with a healthy degree of skepticism.

Moscow’s decision on Dec. 1 to drop the $45-billion South Stream natural gas pipeline project in favor of a new pipeline deal with Turkey shows Putin’s willingness to circumvent European partners to continue deliveries of natural gas to European countries that depend heavily on Russia for its energy requirements. The deal also puts Turkey squarely in the Russian energy camp at a time when Russia has been alienated by the West.

Of course, the Russian dalliance with China is a key part of Putin’s great Eastern pivot that will keep stoking demand for Russian gas even as the Saudis and OPEC, perhaps with US collusion, keep pumping to hold down the price. The November agreement, that would see Gazprom supply Chinese state oil company CNPC with 30 billion cubic meters of gas per year, builds on an earlier deal to sell China 38 bcm annually in an agreement valued at $400 billion.

As Oilprice.com commented on Sunday, “ongoing projects are soldiering on and Russian oil output is projected to remain unchanged into 2015.”

“Russia will go down with the ship before ceding market share – especially in Asia, where Putin reaffirmed the pivot is real. Saudi Arabia and North America will have to keep pumping as Putin plans to uphold his end in this game of brinksmanship.”

The Watcher’s Council

Every week on Monday morning, the Council and our invited guests weigh in at the Watcher’s Forum with short takes on a major issue of the day, the culture or daily living. This week’s question: What Are Your Predictions For 2015?

The Noisy Room:

1. Gitmo will be emptied and closed.

2. The Republicans will facilitate and fund the full implementation of Amnesty.

3. The Republicans will facilitate and fund the full implementation of Obamacare.

4. The Republicans will support and assist Obama with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

5. Riots and violence will increase across the US and you will see a nationalization by Obama of our police forces.

6. Net Neutrality and censorship will be implemented on the Internet.

7. There will be a stock market correction or crash.

8. Inflation will begin to spiral out of control.

9. The dollar will be replaced as the international monetary standard.

10. Christians and Jews will see increased persecution worldwide.

11. Russia will bring more satellite countries into the fold and will encroach on Europe.

12. ISIS will march on and spread the Caliphate further.

13. China will expand their military.

14. Venezuela will finish going bankrupt.

15. Russia, China and Iran will gain a much bigger toe hold in South America.

16. There will be a rapid rise in the illegal alien influx, cartel violence and border skirmishes.

17. There will be a major terrorist attack in the US.

18. IRS abuses will get even worse in the coming year.

19. Taxation will increase on many fronts.

20. Employment will continue to diminish for Americans and all economic indicators will be further manipulated by the government and become utter fabrications of reality. It will be one aspect of a massive propaganda blitz by the US government to keep Americans docile.

My last prediction is that I will not be invited to any cocktail parties as I can clear a room in 10 seconds flat. ;)

The Right Planet: I’m not really one to make predictions, since I always seem to be wrong. But, I’ll take a stab at it …

The national debt will continue to skyrocket (as always) and nothing will be done about it.

Obama will continue his racial agitation, despite the fact he’s the first “black” president in U.S. history who promised a “post-racial” America.

The radical left will continue to search for the next Michael Brown in order to in order to whip even more racial animus.

Obama will continue to dismantle the military.

The GOP establishment will do nothing to stop Obamacare, despite campaign promises to the contrary.

Another massive new wave of illegal immigrants.

The GOP establishment will continue to push presidential candidates like Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, despite the base’s lack of enthusiasm for these establishment types.

The left will push for Marxist radicals like Elizabeth Warren as their next presidential candidate in 2016.

Despite the fact the GOP won a major victory in the 2014 midterms, they’ll still act like they lost.

Obama will unleash the most radical agenda ever seen in the history of the United States, because he feels he’s got nothing to lose.

Sorry, I think it’s going to be a sh*tty year for the USA. And I think it’s only going to get worse.

Laura Rambeau Lee at Right Reason: 2015 is shaping up to be a defining year for America. Lame duck President Obama will continue to push through executive orders, further undermining the balance of power and the rule of law. Even with Republican majorities in the House and Senate, I don’t see them effectively challenging him. One or two will speak out, but will be vilified as radical right extremists by the left and also by the establishment GOP.

I am afraid the events at the end of 2014, with thousands of people protesting against the police in Ferguson, MO and New York, are a precursor of things to come in 2015. The left will continue its agenda of dividing our country by race, religion, class, and cries for social justice.

As we head into the 2016 election season, younger voters will become involved in the political races based on social issues, such as same sex marriage and the legalization of marijuana and align themselves with Democrat candidates or Libertarians. Conservative Republicans will need to find a strong voice who will speak out for fiscal restraint, smaller government, and traditional values, or we can expect to see Jeb Bush being propped up as the frontrunner.

As the world continues to become more dangerous, we will be drawing down our military and will be unable and unwilling to get involved.

While we have seen a little improvement in the job market and the economy, as new regulations roll out expect small businesses to take a bigger hit and many will close their doors for good. The cost of doing business in this country has become punitive for the average small business owner.

I hope I am wrong and the Republican led Congress will work towards gutting Obamacare, cutting punitive regulations from the EPA and CFPB to name a couple, and not approving any funding for Obama’s illegal amnesty action, but I just don’t see it happening.

JoshuaPundit: Hmmm… OK, domestic politics. I’m not prepared to predict how the new congress will behave, but I will say that if it simply becomes business as usual, you will see a major revolt by the Republican Party base to the extent where we may end up with a third party that ultimately replaces it. That’s almost certain if the GOP leadership tries to foist someone like Jeb Bush on the party as a presidential nominee. I actually expect the new Congress to attack some areas, like EPA regulations that restrict coal. And don’t be surprised if you see increased opposition to the president’s amnesty bill, especially when it comes to attacking its funding. It was the one area Boehner left open, not because he wanted to, but because he had to give the conservatives in Congress something in order to get votes to pass cromnibus in the House.

Don’t be surprised if the Supremes gut ObamaCare. What will happen after that is anyone’s guess, since the health insurance industry has been monkeyed with almost beyond repair and will take some time to come back.

I also predict that we will see increased tension between the president and the new Congress, especially when it comes to his appointments, investigation of the various scandals surrounding the White House, his amnesty and the funding of certain presidential executive orders.

I think the GOP nomination will boil down to a choice between Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee and Jeb Bush. I don’t think Dr. Carson will run in 2016, nor will Ted Cruz as much as I ‘d like to see him do so, but I’m happy to be wrong on that one. Either one may end up as VP candidates.

I see the chances of Hillary Clinton running as no more than 50-50, because of her health, her unpopularity with the party’s far Left progressives and because of continued revelations on how horribly she ran the State Department, including the Benghazi fiasco. Elizabeth Warren is a more likely choice, I think.

Other domestic predictions; I regret to say that I think we’re headed for a major terrorism attack, along with a huge scandal concerning our domestic intel setup. I see it as being an attack that the media will attempt to paint as being carried out by a so-called ‘lone wolf’, but will in reality be one aided and abetted by our overseas enemies, just like 9/11 was. I hope I’m wrong on that one.

The economy will continue about how it’s been, but probably with slightly higher interest rates come midyear. The economy is a colossal con, with real unemployment and real CPI inflation far higher and our growth and GDP far lower than we’re being told, but so far we remain the best game in town in terms of relatively safe foreign investment. The reckoning will come in very gradual stages after Obama is safely out of office.

Baseball will have a resurgence next year. This year was about getting rid of the stench of the steroids scandal.

Foreign Affairs; We will continue to flail around in Iraq, with this president gradually increasing troops on the ground. His real objective is to have Iran doing more of the fighting against the Islamic State, with the result, of course, that Iran will control Iraq as part of the nuclear armed Shi’ite bloc they wish to create. 2015 will also likely be the year that Iran explodes a successful nuclear weapon unless Israel stops them. Obama will not.

Syria may well see a cease fire and an arrangement between Assad and IS to share the country, midwifed by Putin. The way things are now, neither side can win, but both sides need time to consolidate their gains and lick their wounds.

Israel will continue its move to the right politically, with Naftali Bennett continuing to rise in popularity. Israel will continue to expand its increasingly closer ties with India, China and East Asia. The EU will continue to become more hostile to Israel, perhaps even to the point of sanctions by countries like Ireland, the UK (at least in the short run), Spain, Portugal, Scandinavia, Belgium, the Netherlands and France. Other countries like Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Italy, the Balkan states and other eastern European countries will simply ignore any sanctions.

While the Obama Administration will likely veto the current UNSC resolution to unilaterally force a Palestinian state by the Palestinian Authority, the Obama regime will almost certainly abstain and allow another one to pass if it’s put before the UNSC after the Israeli elections in March. The Obama team is attempting to interfere in the Israeli elections to get the Left wing Labor Party elected and they will want to see if they can mange it before taking the political flak of allowing a UN diktat to pass… which would be opposed vociferously by Congress.

Of course, once that happens, the relationship between America and Israel is going to change quite a bit, which was what this president has wanted all along. Since getting Labor/Hatnua elected with enough seats to form a governing coalition is highly unlikely, I think that scenario is what we’re ultimately looking at. Expect continued terrorist attacks on Israel in this current Third Intifada, which will be followed by a major crackdown boo-hooed by all the usual suspects.

Russia will likely attempt to assert its authority over one or more of the Baltic States… not by invasion, but by simple intimidation ala’ Finland. I’d say Estonia is the most likely target.

Japan and Australia will rearm and increase their defense spending.They will also increase their security cooperation, which will likely include Vietnam and the Philippines. Germany will do the same; expect for an enlargement of the Bundeswehr and security coordination with its neighbors like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.

Expect UKip to do exceptionally well in the British Elections. And while French elections aren’t until 2017, unless the socialists and the extremely unpopular Hollande is forced out, expect Marine Le Pen’s right leaning Front National (FN) to continue to gain massive ground.

Rhymes With Right: Well, my friends, after having had a mixed year making projections for 2014, I’m once again at it. I’ll once again stare into that foggy crystal ball and catch a glimpse into the future — undoubtedly with mixed results. Each of my four categories will have a prediction that I feel is almost certain to come true, one I feel is somewhat more iffy, but still probable, and one that is a long-shot and will in twelve months be seen either as prophetic genius or utter folly.

World Affairs

Safe Prediction — Benjamin Netanyahu will remain Prime Minister of Israel following a challenge by a more secular and more leftist coalition. The reason for his success — which will not be expected only weeks prior to new elections — will be a renewed campaign of terrorist attacks on civilians in the wake of the UN recognition of a “State of Palestine”.

Not-So-Safe Prediction — Continued North Korean anger over The Interview will lead to more attacks on the American entertainment industry. The target? Online streaming services renting/selling The Interview and Team America: World Police .

will lead to more attacks on the American entertainment industry. The target? Online streaming services renting/selling and . Long-Shot Prediction — King Abdullah of Jordan is overthrown in an Islamist coup.

National Affairs

Safe Prediction — Barack Obama will continue to govern using the same playbook as the late Hugo Chavez, issuing executive decrees and usurping Congress’ lawmaking role despite the restrictions on executive power contained in the Constitution.

Not-So-Safe Prediction — There will be an unexpected resignation from the Supreme Court at the end of the 2014-2015 term. This will set the stage for a major confirmation fight and, after the rejection of Obama’s nominee, an effort by the President to make a recess appointment to the High Court.

Long-Shot Prediction — A bipartisan immigration reform bill will be passed by both houses of Congress and be signed by the president. It will have broad support among the American people, but will be rejected by both the progressive wing of the Democrat Party and conservative wing of the Republican Party in Congress.

Texas Affairs

Safe Prediction — Despite strong opposition by the grassroots, Joe Straus is again selected as Speaker of the House in the Texas Legislature. When the filing date for the 2016 primary passes in December, a record number of well-funded conservative challengers will have filed to run against incumbent legislators in the Republican primary.

Not-So-Safe Predictions — The resignation of Steve Munisteri as Chairman of the Republican Party of Texas will result in the election of Tom Mechler by the State Republican Executive Committee. The selection of the current RPT treasurer will be more about interim stability than the long-term direction of the state party, with everyone looking toward a major floor fight at the 2016 convention between former Harris County GOP chairman Jared Woodfill and Dallas County chairman Wade Emmert in which the grassroots will make their voices heard.

Long-Shot Prediction — Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick surprises political observers by being an even-handed consensus builder as the presiding officer over the Texas Senate.

2016 Presidential Politics

Safe Prediction — As 2015 ends, the GOP will have a spirited race for the presidential nomination underway, with the leading contenders being Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Rand Paul, followed by Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal and Paul Ryan.

Not-So-Safe Prediction — Chris Christie does not seek the Republican presidential nomination.

Long-Shot Prediction — As 2015 ends, the Hillary Clinton juggernaut faces unexpected difficulties in the race for the Democrat presidential nomination. These will come in the form of leaked documents from Hillary’s time as Secretary of State, a new Bill Clinton sex scandal that raises questions about Hillary’s sensitivity to women alleging sexual abuse/assault and an unexpectedly strong challenger from the Left.

The Glittering Eye: For many years at The Glittering Eye I would do an annual predictions post. Last year I gave up the practice. It wasn’t because my track record wasn’t pretty good — it was around 85% right — but because like everybody else I never managed to predict the really big stories of the year.

However, I’ll get into the spirit of things and give you one prediction. The Supreme Court will decide in favor of the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell with a vote of 5-4, Justice Kennedy concurring with the majority. That’s the case challenging the paying of federal subsidies to individuals who live in states that did not set up their own healthcare insurance exchanges.

New Zeal

In all the debate about President Barack Obama‘s “Executive Amnesty” for illegal aliens, few have discussed the real reason for Obama’s move.

The president has risked huge “political capital” on a very risky and possibly illegal move, that he believes will define his Presidency and secure his legacy with his “Progressive” base.

Obama is simply after the votes. He believes that by legalizing eleven to twenty million “illegals” and eventually giving them the vote, he will turn America into a permanent Democratic Party “one party state.”

Furthermore, the President intends there to be no turning back. As a long time ally of the the Gramsci-loving Marxists of Democratic Socialists of America, Obama understands that his Democratic Party is now controlled by the unions and that the unions are controlled by DSA and other Marxist groups.

He knows there will be no “20 year window” for the Republicans to build their share of the Latino vote. He understands that if the Democrats win the next one or two Presidential elections, the left will use the power of the state to divide and smash their Republican, conservative and Evangelical Christian opposition – forever.

Obama understands, even if the leadership of the GOP doesn’t, that this is not the old Republican/Democrat turnabout game. This is much more like the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948, or the socialization of Venezuela under Hugo Chavez. Obama and his Marxist allies are playing for keeps – and “Amnesty” is one of their main weapons.

Ruy Teixeira was a member of Democratic Socialists of America in Madison, Wisconsin back in the 1980s.

He is now a Senior Fellow at the leftist Center for American Progress, as well as a Fellow of the New Politics Institute. He was recently a Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institution, where he co-directed a joint Brookings-American Enterprise Institute project on political demography and geography.

Teixeira’s book, The Emerging Democratic Majority, written with fellow Marxist John Judis (Scribner, 2002), was the most widely discussed political book of that year. Teixeira’s recent writings include “New Progressive America,” “The Decline of the White Working Class and the Rise of a Mass Upper Middle Class,” “The Politics of Definition” (with John Halpin) and “Back to the Future: The Emerging Democratic Majority Re-emerges” (with Judis).

Despite the Democrat’s “shellacking” in the 2014 mid-terms, Teixeira recently told the Huffington Post that he is very confident that the Democrats can win the Presidency in 2016 and beyond:

Ruy Teixeira, a Democratic demographer, points to a group of states worth 242 electoral votes that the Democratic presidential nominee has won in every election since 1992. Hold them all, and the party is just 28 votes shy of the majority needed to win the White House next time. Barack Obama twice compiled at least 332 electoral votes by adding wins in most every competitive state. He posted double-digit wins among women, huge margins among voters younger than 30 and historically high marks among blacks and Latinos. As non-white voters continue to grow as a share of the electorate, a Democratic nominee that roughly holds Obama’s 2012 level of support across all demographic groups would win the national popular vote by about 6 percentage points and coast in the Electoral College, Teixeira estimates. “Could a Republican win? Sure,” Teixeira said. “But they have to have a lot of different things happen.

Another DSA comrade has been even more explicit on the exploitation of immigrants and “illegals” in the pursuit of an unassailable Democratic majority.

Eliseo Medina was until recently the executive vice – president of the SEIU. After the AFL-CIO was conquered by DSA in 1994-96, he led the charge to get the unions to switch from an anti-“illegal” position to a pro-“Amnesty” policy. Many readers may remember when the unions were constantly calling for increased border security and were always lobbying Congress to increase penalties for businesses caught hiring “illegals.”

Why are unions now leading the charge to legalize the “illegals”? Because Eliseo Medina and his DSA comrades worked very hard to make it happen. It took 5 years of hard core lobbying and deal-making, but Medina eventually engineered the AFL-CIO’s policy shift from anti “illegal” to pro-“Amnesty”, which was ratified at the AFL-CIOs national convention in Louisiana 2000.

Before 1994, the AFL-CIO leadership actually cared about the interests of their membership. Now they’re happy to sell their own member’s jobs and conditions down the river. It’s all the about the Revolution comrades!

In recent years, Medina has become the undisputed and very well connected leader of the “Amnesty” movement.

In 2008, Medina was one of several Marxists serving on President Obama’s Latino Advisory Council. He has had ready access to the President ever since and was reportedly personally consulted by the President before Obama started his recent push for “Amnesty.”

In December 2013, when Medina and others fasted 22 days for “Amnesty” in the National Mall, the emaciated Marxist was honored by a personal visit from the President himself.

But why does Medina do this? What is the goal?

Medina let the cat out of the bag At the ultra “Progressive” America’s Future Now! conference in Washington, DC on June 2, 2009, where he addressed attendees on the necessity of “comprehensive immigration reform” – the “Progressive’ code for “Amnesty.”

Speaking of Latino voters in the 2008 elections, Medina said “when they voted in November, they voted overwhelmingly for Progressive candidates. Barack Obama got two out of every three voters that showed up.”

So I think there’s two things that matter for the progressive community. Number one, if we are to expand this electorate to win, the progressive community needs to solidly be on the side of immigrants, that we’ll expand and solidify the progressive coalition for the future…” When you are in the middle of a fight for your life you will remember who was there with you. And immigrants count on progressives to be able to do that. Number two. “We reform the immigration laws, it puts 12 million people on the path to citizenship and eventually voters”. Can you imagine if we have, even the same ratio, two out of three? If we have eight million new voters who care about …… and will be voting. We will be creating a governing coalition for the long term, not just for an election cycle…

As Medina is a Marxist and Marxists almost never give up power voluntarily, “a governing coalition for the long term” effectively means a permanent “one party state.”

If America is to survive as a free nation, several things must happen.

The Ted Cruz/patriotic wing of the Republican Party and grass-roots conservatives across the nation must fight every aspect of “Amnesty” tooth and nail until it is defeated. They must become the dominant faction inside the GOP – very quickly.

Existing immigration laws must be strongly enforced, the Southern border must be sealed and other points of entry more effectively policed. Imagine if most Latino “illegals” voted Republican? Obama would have fenced and patrolled the southern border in his first month of office! It can be done, it just takes political will and a ton of guts.

The 20 million plus conservative and Evangelical Christians who are not even registered to vote MUST be mobilized for the 2016 elections and beyond. Ted Cruz and his equally inspiring pastor father, Rafael Cruz, could do this. Pro-“Amnesty” Jeb Bush wouldn’t have a prayer. Neither will the GOP if he is their 2016 Presidential candidate.

Socialists Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, the unions, the Marxists, Silicon Valley and the Chamber of Commerce/”cheap labor” wing of the Republican Party all want “Amnesty.” The country be damned.

Only the Ted Cruz wing of the GOP, the conservative “grass roots” leaders of “middle America” and the patriotic pastors, the “Black Robed Regiments,” can save the American Republic now.

If America goes down, every Western country will fall. There is nowhere left to run.

For all our sakes, America’s patriots better start working together and get more organized, pretty darned quick.

The Protests were Organized for one Specific Purpose – Dead Cops

In December 2012, a respected Egyptian news magazine named six Obama administration officials who were in fact agents of the international terrorist organization, the Muslim Brotherhood. They claimed that these individuals had helped change the White House “from a position hostile to Islamic groups and organizations in the world to the largest and most important supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood.”

One of these alleged agents was Imam Mohamed Magid, a Koranic scholar from Sudan. In the Obama administration, Magid was appointed to the Department of Homeland Security’s Countering Violence and Extremism working group in 2011. He is on the FBI’s Sikh, Muslim, and Arab advisory board (yes, we have one of those). He has trained and advised personnel affiliated with the FBI and other federal agencies.

Under Obama’s dictates since he entered the Oval Office, the United States government decided to publicly announce a softer approach to countering Islamic terrorism and the ideology behind jihad (i.e., war in the name of Islam). Imam Mohamed Magid has been a centerpiece in Obama’s show of tolerance (of violence) and diversity (of means of death), so much so that he and his organization have been “cited … as the primary means of outreach to the American Muslim community.”

It’s now known that Magid has a remarkable connection to the murderer of two NYPD officers this December.

Unlike his approach toward American Muslims, who apparently (at least based on policy since 2009) need the White House to reassure them that they are not “violent extremists,” Barack Hussein Obama’s attitude toward police officers has been hostile from the beginning. Multiple instances mar the six year old administration’s relationship with law enforcement.

The anti-police stance of the administration has been toxically mixed with anti-gun propaganda, and the blatant fanning of racial tensions that have resulted in violence, murder, and even city-wide chaos.

The first example came in July 2009, when Harvard Professor Henry Louis ‘Skip’ Gates was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct by the Cambridge Police department. Sgt. James Crowley saw Gates trying to break into a home, and, not realizing it was actually his own home, arrested Gates. The charges were later dropped by the police, but not before Obama said on national television that the police “acted stupidly,” and further insinuated that the arrest was racially motivated. To make everyone feel better, Obama later held a “beer summit” at the White House, hosting Gates and Crowley in what was presented as some great healing moment. (No word on whether pork or all beef hot dogs were served.)

In 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder, while noting that the number of officers killed in the line of duty jumped 13% that year, blamed the increase on illegal gun ownership. In 2013, Holder went on the record saying that he had to tell his son how to protect himself from the police, because, you guessed it, he’s black. Holder said this talk was family tradition.

For his part, Obama came out in support of the 2011 anti-cop and anarchist movement, Occupy Wall Street, who were not only occupying Wall Street, but terrorizing downtown Manhattan.

Then came the February 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida. Martin was shot by George Zimmerman, as he was being violently assaulted and threatened with death while on neighborhood patrol. In what has become a national tradition, Al Sharpton and Eric Holder descended to prey upon the citizens of a small community, calling for “justice.”

In fact, mob justice is what they were looking for.

The next stop for the Obama, Holder, and Sharpton anti-police racial mob circus was Ferguson, Missouri, following the death of Michael Brown by the gun of a police officer who he was attacking and threatening. The case is familiar and fresh enough in everyone’s minds not have to rehash in any detail. Once again, Obama and the administration issued thinly veiled attacks on the police and insinuated that the officers and the department were racially motivated haters.

The caustic and raw social tumult that ensued led to widespread looting, riots, arson (even by allegedly “peaceful” protestors), and even the murder of a friend one of the trial witnesses.

Obama’s, Holder’s, and Sharpton’s carnival of hate then went prime time, this time to the Big Apple. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. And, with a little help from the all-too-willing Mayor Bill DeBlasio, in the Staten Island death of Eric Garner, which was caused not by bullets but by a lung condition, the carnival got what they were looking for all along: the blood of police officers.

On December 20, 2014, five days before Christmas, Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were assassinated by Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley in their patrol car in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. After weeks of anti-police protests, which explicitly shouted for “dead cops,” Brinsley had bragged to pedestrians just prior to the shooting that he was going to satiate the protestors with their pound of flesh.

At this time, you may be asking what Mohamed Magid, the alleged Muslim Brotherhood agent, has to do with the assassination of two NYPD officers. This will be clear to you soon enough. But first it is necessary to understand that the supposedly grassroots protests, in Ferguson and in New York, were anything but organic.

Terresa Monroe-Hamilton at NoisyRoom.net has documented the nefarious players behind the protests, and has an incredible list of organizations involved in the protests. One of the most prominent organizing groups is ANSWER, which stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism. ANSWER is often found alongside Occupy Wall Street. A little digging into ANSWER’s coalition partners and speakers reveal their roots; groups such as the Muslim Students Association, Free Palestinian Alliance, National Council of Arab Americans, the Nicaragua Network, and Korea Truth Commission (you got me ?).

Furthermore, ANSWER is described by DiscoverTheNetworks as “a principal player in all anti-war and pro-Palestinian demonstrations… ANSWER was formed a few days after 9/11 as a ‘new anti-racism, anti-war, peace and justice’ group and led its first protest just weeks later against the impending US-led attack on Afghanistan.”

To be blunt about it, ANSWER is a pro-jihad front organization that was fully behind Hamas in this summer’s Gaza war. Hamas, it’s noted, is the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood – the same Muslim Brotherhood that the Egyptian magazine claimed Mohamed Magid was a member of.

***

Isn’t it odd that a Muslim Brotherhood front group would lead protests in New York City over the accidental death of a black man in the course of an arrest? Last time I was there, Staten Island wasn’t a center of Israeli-Palestinian debate, and there are no public pictures of Eric Garner smoking hookah or riding camels in Giza. On the contrary, Garner was dealing single cigarettes, and tobacco is decisively haram (forbidden) according to Islamic sharia law.

Puzzling, perhaps, but the Facebook page of Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley Muhammad ties the story’s loose ends together. According to his own biography on Facebook, Brinsely-Muhammad “Worked at: Islamic Society of North America.” The Islamic Society of North America, aka ISNA, is headquartered in Plainfield, Indiana. Hmm.

Who is the President of ISNA, where the cop killer said he worked? That would be Imam Mohamed Magid, Obama’s advisor to DHS and the National Security Council.

Obama himself addressed ISNA’s annual convention in 2013. You can read about one of ISNA’s greatest influences, Pakistani radical Abul A’la Maududi, here.

Here are a few other facts to consider when contemplating that the Obama and Holder-inspired cop killer was, according to himself, employed at the organization of one of Obama’s most trusted security advisors, the Islamic Society of North America.

ISNA President and Obama advisor Imam Mohamed Magid was a lecturer at Howard University, teaching courses on the Koran.

The Trayvon Martin case only caught on after it was plucked from relative obscurity from a student at Howard University. This student, Kevin Cunningham, began a petition on the website change.org. Said Cunningham, a lawyer, “that’s how I think about life, is to be a social engineer.”

Cop killer Brinsley-Muhammad, who additionally may have attended a Brooklyn mosque associated with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, martyred himself by suicide in a subway station before being apprehended by police. He’s no longer with us to answer any questions.

In light of Obama’s recent embrace of Communist Cuba, it is worth noting that one of Castro’s last acts as a revolutionary leader was to order the targeted killing of Cuba’s police officers. Why? Police keep law and order on the streets, and because they’re uniformed, they’re easy targets for revolutionaries who thrive off anarchy.

Obama’s six yearlong anti-cop jihad has serious consequences. In 2014, there was an increase of 56% in police killed by guns – 50 officers, compared to 32 in 2013. Since the assassinations in New York, many infractions are going unpunished, as police are reluctant to engage with the community, fearing targeting by assassins and mobs. This is a very tenuous and delicate situation.

It might be worth mentioning, to the next person you bump into who still has a functioning brain, that Obama’s trusted advisor, Imam Mohamed Magid, had the NYPD cop killer as an employee of his nationwide Islamic organization. This, according to his own Facebook bio.

The circumstantial evidence presented above points to a deliberate plan by the administration and the Muslim Brotherhood to stoke violence that led to cop killings. These are revolutionary tactics, creating conditions that lead to chaos, anarchy, and eventually the total dissolution of societal trust. After that occurs, people beg for order, in whatever form it offers itself.

Is 2015 the year of the American Spring? In the New Year, several detailed reports will be published that point to deliberate, witting, and eager cooperation between the Obama administration and the Muslim Brotherhood aimed at precisely this end.","2014-12-30 19:00:11","1","47.0","21.0","15.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","151.0","102.0","0.0","86.0","0.0","6.0","0","1697","94.16","72.80","16.94","9.23","22.04","26.40","76.66","42.78","7.19","2.65","0.18","0.18","0.47","1.36","0.47","4.54","8.43","14.44","6.42","2.36","4.77","0.65","9.78","4.48","1.89","1.41","2.71","1.53","4.48","1.53","2.89","0.47","2.18","0.00","7.60","0.59","0.18","0.00","1.94","7.01","1.65","1.77","0.29","1.36","1.00","1.36","1.77","0.88","0.47","0.41","0.71","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.29","10.02","2.36","0.94","5.89","0.47","0.77","4.54","4.48","0.77","13.73","1.65","7.54","4.24","5.01","0.71","0.65","0.29","2.12","1.71","0.35","0.00","0.24","0.06","0.06","0.00","18.50","4.66","7.19","0.18","0.06","0.29","0.00","1.24","1.41","2.00","1.06","0.41","8410","8.67","24.35211267605634","2664","1676","76","49.04","14.2","11.9","13.17","14.3","418","16.5","20.816133651551315","787","21.89","22","0.43","0","58","41","166","1","227","122","1","4","10","250","297","3","78","0","0","49","12","60","1","2","2","41","0","38","83","39","52","20","41","10","12","0","6"

The Islamic State, or ISIS, has been attempting to reach out to Ferguson supporters who hate America as confirmed by U.S. Attorney in Southern District of Illinois, Steve Wigginton, who said “ISIS wants people who hate the U.S. government as much they do.”

While the report from KDSK confirms this type of social media recruiting, the Washington Post, as well as the conspiracy-themed site Infowars reported on this trend almost a month ago.

KDSK quoted Wigginton as saying,

“They are trying to reach the people who are anti government to begin with. We have a number of those individuals in the U.S., whether they are sovereign citizens, whether they are anarchists, they all showed up at one point or another in the St. Louis area in the last few months.”

One of the so-called sovereign citizens was Olajuwon Ali, who, along with Brandon Baldwin (a.k.a. Brandon Muhammad) hatched a scheme to kill St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch and Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson. Additionally, the pair planned to bomb the Gateway Arch” but “could not afford to do it until one suspect’s girlfriend’s Electronic Benefit Transfer card was replenished,” as reported at BroadsideNews.

Wigginton added,

“We received intelligence reports for law enforcement showing actual tweets ISIS was putting out encouraging Americans to join the people who were burning down buildings in Ferguson to engage that kind of conduct across America.”

ISIS has been using the hashtag #Ferguson, among others, to recruit members.

This actually happened during a live CNN report:

Here are some more of the creepy tweets.

FBI special agent in charge of the Springfield Illinois area, Sean Cox was quoted as saying,

“We are very concerned by threats posed by homegrown violent extremists from individuals who live in the same community they intend to attack.”

While the KDSK report was very careful to say that ISIS is searching for criminals, and not “people fighting for social justice,” it is clear that ISIS is not making that distinction. They are just trying to recruit anyone willing to join them in their depravity.

Qatar Awareness Campaign

An Update from the Qatar Awareness Campaign

Several recent news reports point to the possibility that Qatar, the host nation of the Muslim Brotherhood, may be genuine in their attempt to reconcile with their Arab neighbors. After expelling the Qataris and isolating them diplomatically, the United Arab Emirate, Saudi Arabia, and even Egypt appear to have reached an accord with Doha. The Nazi-rooted Muslim Brotherhood was long ago banished from Saudi Arabia (in the late 1920s), and Egypt has violently suppressed them many times, notably after the assassination of Sadat. Yet the daily report out of the Middle East suggests that KSA, UAE, and Egypt may really welcome Doha back into the family.

Consider:

Yesterday, it was reported that Qatar pledged to stop funding Hamas – truly remarkable, if true.

A few months ago, they expelled prominent members of the Muslim Brotherhood.

An Interpol arrest warrant has been issued for Yusuf al-Qaradawi (the Muslim Brotherhood’s “spiritual leader”), and he will no longer broadcasting on Al Jazeera (if report are to be believed).

It is possible that the month-long Qatar Awareness Campaign, which issued an open letter to nearly 30 companies, universities, individuals, and politicians who benefited financially from a relationship with terror-sponsoring Qatar, had something to do with this apparent change of heart. The campaign identified Qatar as the primary sponsor of Islamic terror, with connections across the Middle East and North Africa to groups such as Hamas, ISIS, and Boko Haram.

But, there is another explanation for this apparent change of heart which, given Qatar’s two-faced nature, may be more realistic.

The MB could simply be shifting their bases of operation, leaving their financial hub, Qatar, alone (for the moment), thus providing their wealthy benefactor with the good press to alleviate them of the international pressure. For over the past four months, the world press had suddenly taken notice of the corrupt Gulf terror state, and its causing them trouble. FC Barcelona, for example, dropped their sponsorship deal Qatar Foundation over Qatar’s financing of Hamas.

The evidence for this “camel rearranging” is as follows:

Turkey, a close ally of Qatar and Muslim Brotherhood proxy themselves, welcomed the expelled Muslim Brothers from Qatar.

Qatar and Turkey recently reaffirmed their mutual support for “oppressed peoples” – i.e., Islamists in secularly governed countries, and Hamas in Gaza.

Other MB expelled from Qatar have gone to Libya, where the UAE/Egypt are in a proxy war with Qatar.

Hamas has been removed from the EU list of terrorist groups, providing more flexibility to terrorists in Palestine.

The White House (Obama) tacitly threatened to sanction Israel, and remains extremely hostile to Netanyahu.

Qatar’s reconciliation with their Gulf neighbors appears to be directly related to lower oil prices, which have crippled Russia’s economy and hurt Iran (Russia and Iran being no friends of Saudi Arabia). This also directly affects Syria, a Russian and Iranian client state that is under siege by Qatar, the Muslim Brotherhood, elements in Saudi Arabia, and the Obama administration.

ISIS is preparing to attack Israel.

Another development to take into account is the increasingly sharp language of the conservative press aimed at Obama and the Islamists. We may finally be reaching a point where, sooner or later, the mainstream press is going to have to face up to the possibility that Obama is not who he says he is, but in fact an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Consider, the cop killer in NYC worked for Islamic Society of North America, and the president of ISNA is a close Obama advisor, including to DHS and the National Security Council. The truth is getting harder to ignore. As many people who have spent the time investigating Obama’s roots and connections have determined, the real threat to world peace is not in fact Qatar, but the Obama administration.

Now is truly the time to make the case that the administration is the North American branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the parent organization of Al Qaeda, ISIS, Boko Haram, Taliban, and Hamas. It must be done for posterity, before it is too late!

The pro-Iran/North Korea/Cuba Workers World Party is heavily involved in many of the anti-police demonstrations currently occurring in the United States.

Listen to Workers World Party leader Larry Holmes talk of “world revolution” – linking “ant-racist struggles” to the anti-Walmart campaign and other current issues.

The left really thinks they are on a roll now. They believe they are on the verge of big revolutionary change. Just like the ’60s all over again… only this time they have a friend in the White House.

Hat Tip: BB

Richard A. Viguerie is absolutely right when he calls most of the Republican leadership “boneless wonders.” And as Senator Rand Paul correctly labeled the CRomnibus, it is an “abomination of a bill,” and it passed narrowly last night thanks to the betrayal of John Boehner. Boehner lied himself silly as he did exactly what I predicted he would do… he claimed that the Republicans didn’t dare shut down the government and had to pass the CRomnibus to find out what was in it, a la Pelosi. He also claimed the good in the bill, outweighed the bad. So many lies in such a short time. He went all the way with Obama, knowing that the President would kick him out of bed in the morning. Conservatives were Grubered by Boehner and the other Progressive RINOs who wanted everything they passed – they also gave Obama ALL he asked for and oh, so much more.

Every Republican who voted for the CRomnibus must be targeted in primaries and gotten rid of. They are cancerous to the Republic – they are Progressives on the Right side of the aisle and are every bit as much a danger to our country as the Progressive Liberals are. Every one of these Republicans owns this. They weren’t ‘forced’ into anything… they chose this because of money and power. It’s as simple as that.

You can start with House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions of Texas as one of your primary targets. He was one of the key architects of the CRomnibus. Hear that sound, Sessions? That’s you being voted out in 2016. You can join your Marxist buddies in the unemployment line or jail, whichever comes first. Then you can add Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, for his pushing this monstrosity. He was spanked by Governor Jindal and Senator Vitter over his naughty doings, but to no avail. Let’s not forget the truth-challenged House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers of Kentucky – he has earned target status as well. America needs to hold these guys and every other who voted for the betrayal of the Republic with this CRomnibus bill accountable for their actions. We won’t forget. Not a chance.

Did you know this bill gives Social Security to illegal aliens? Were you aware of the massive earmarks/pork in the bill – giving goodies all around? There’s also $250 million more than Obama requested for the Environmental Protection Agency in the “CRomnibus” and no policy rider to stop the destruction of America’s coal industry, or restrain the resulting increase in consumer electricity costs. The bill also gives $575 million to international family planning – that’s right… abortion. It funds Obamacare too. Is this what you voted for? Are these conservative principles? The whole thing stinks to high heaven as Sarah Palin astutely put it.

From Sarah Palin:

It stinks to high heaven. Did arrogant politicians not get the memo that Obama’s agenda was decisively defeated in last month’s historic midterm landslide? Good Lord, America said loud and clear not just “no” but “hell no” to Obama’s failed policies. Americans who pay attention said absolutely no to Obama’s amnesty for illegal aliens. We also said no to the mother-of-all unfunded mandates, Obamacare, and voters believed promises that they would ratchet down the $18 trillion debt. Well, our bad for apathetically trusting politicians. No, on second thought, it’s not “our bad.” Some of us warned and worked hard to elect candidates who would buck the status quo. Many conscientious Americans did all they could to open the eyes of low-information voters. It was tough going up against Obama’s lapdogs in the media and the power liberals have to play their politics of personal destruction against commonsense conservatives. But really how out-of-touch do these politicians have to be to misunderstand our recent mandate to stop Barack Obama’s fundamental transformation of the greatest nation on earth?

RINO season is officially open. Lock and load.

Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, evidently agrees with me as well. Right after this atrocious bill went through, she tweeted: “Speaker Boehner & House GOP leadership have found a way to needlessly squander political capital, after being handed a historic majority.” Not to be trite, but the deal was literally brokered in back rooms full of cigar smoke and with bourbon flowing – this time it wasn’t an SNL skit either. In that room, a devil’s pact was made over Amnesty and the RINOs enthusiastically signed their souls away.

The bill passed with just a couple of hours left before the deadline – 219 to 206. Over 1,700 pages that no one had time to read, but they had time to spend over $1 Trillion on it. Oh, yes they did. The celebration of winning the election for Republicans came to an abrupt halt – none in the Tea Party expected these corrupt birds to change the color of their feathers, but hope dies hard. I take no joy in saying ‘I told you so’ over all this.

One last minute rider in particular – a provision that would effectively raise the amount that high net-worth donors can contribute to political party committees from $97,250 to $777,600, was an egregious slap in the face to the Tea Party and conservatives. It basically ensures that fat cats are the only ones who can afford to run and it is a blatant attempt to shut out Tea Party candidates. The rider would give the Republican and Democrat Party establishments huge advantages in battles with primary challengers to incumbents.

From Rush Limbaugh:

Talk radio host Rush Limbaugh railed against provisions in the cromnibus that relaxed campaign finance rules on Friday, saying that it was designed to “basically eliminate [the Tea Party] as a viable threat,” and “how corporate America is going to defeat the Tea Party.” He explained “that campaign finance stuff…I’m going to tell you exactly what that is…the limits have practically been obliterated which means that corporate donors can just start giving left and right.” Limbaugh continued “This is how corporate America is going to defeat the Tea Party. By allowing limitless donations from that crowd under the rubric that its campaign finance and money is speech and freedom of speech and 1st Amendment, the theory is that Main Street, Tea Party people can’t come close to competing with corporate money and so it is a Republican Establishment ploy that kind of dovetails nicely with Obama siccing the IRS on the Tea Party to basically eliminate them as a viable threat by relaxing a regulation in Dodd-Frank that pretty much permits corporations to spend any kind of money they want on politics.” Earlier, he declared “our Speaker of the House [got] in bed with Obama and advances the Obama agenda, takes care of it, amnesty, Obamacare, fully funded, done deal, the election must not have mattered.”

The heroes in the House who voted against this betrayal deserve to be listed here:

Congressman Amash of Michigan

Congresswoman Bachmann of Minnesota

Congressman Brat of Virgina

Congressman Brooks of Alabama

Congressman Broun of Georgia

Congressman Gohmert of Texas

Congressman Gosar of Arizona

Congressman Huelskamp of Kansas

Congressman Jones of North Carolina

Congressman Jordan of Ohio

Congressman King of Iowa

Congressman Labrador of Idaho

Congressman Massie of Kentucky

Congressman Posey of Florida

Congressman Salmon of Arizona

Congressman Stockman of Texas

These individuals should be looked up to and thanked for their bravery, honesty and courage. Now, the CRomnibus goes to the Senate where it is sure to pass given its current political makeup.

Are the Republicans so deaf, dumb and clueless that they can’t battle corrupt Democrats even when they control the House and the Senate? Or are they just as corrupt as the Progressive Liberals? Both is the answer. Just more arrogant elitist bull crap… slapping each other on the back, wallowing in their greed for power and money – they feel as though the party will never end. But walking on the wild side always has a price and Americans won’t take this much longer. The RINOs are going to find themselves on the wrong dance card after waking with a major hangover and the realization that the tab has come due and Obama doesn’t love them in the morning. Suckers. All the back room deals, lies and manipulations, just simply delay the demise of the Republican Party. But an accounting is coming and soon.

Boehner’s dirty deals with Obama have increased spending by $3.8 Trillion in 3.8 years. It’s just flat out criminal what they are doing to this nation. It is suicide and they know it and just can’t seem to care evidently. The arrogance of Boehner and his cronies is stunning. He wouldn’t work with conservatives at all on the CRomnibus. That pretty much says it all, folks. We had a view to a kill last night in America and Boehner strangled the Republic while high-fiving his Progressive buds.

Listen to Louie Gohmert:

Representative Louie Gohmert (R-TX) said that conservatives in the House heard “not one word” from House GOP leadership on compromises to make changes to the cromnibus in order to get conservatives to vote for it even though “we were willing to work with them to compromise” on Thursday’s “Hannity” on the Fox News Channel. “There was no encouragement to conservatives. The Speaker and Majority Leader, these folks knew there’s money for abortion, money for the EPA to hurt states like Texas, Arizona. There’s just all kinds of money in there for things we don’t support. and, Sean, you and I know some of us had gone to our leadership and said, ‘look, we can do this very easily. Let’s do it together with conservatives. That’s the bulk of our conference, don’t make them take a wrong vote. Let’s fund everything for two months. Let us have a vote on defunding Obama’s amnesty, and we’ll even agree that the Senate can take it out if they take the hard vote to do that and let it go from there to the president.’ We were willing to work with them to compromise, and not one word, as you know, the calls went to the white house when in a time that the speaker needed votes he turned to somebody that he really identifies with, the president and liberal Democrats and got them to help him pass this vote” he stated.

This is what it has come to – one party… the Progressive Party. Where Boehner and the RINOs identify more with Obama and the Liberals than conservatives, the Tea Party and America in general. Let America eat cake.

New Zeal

The newly-released FBI Hate Crime Statistics for 2013 have some major issues, rendering them vastly useless to researchers and the public.

According to the FBI, there were a total of 6933 hate crime offenses that took place during 5,928 incidents “because incidents may include more than one offense type.” Of those, the FBI asserts that there were 4430 victims, and of those, 2685 attacks included actual physical harm. The breakdown is: Murder and non-negligent manslaughter (5), rape (including those that fit under the revised definition) (21), aggravated assault (734), simple assault (1925).

According to the reporting guidelines, simple assault is “an unlawful physical attack by one person upon another where neither the offender displays a weapon, nor the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, severe laceration, or loss of consciousness.” So, a simple assault could conceivably be a shove or a slap in the face; intrusive and awful for the victim, but would not result in a scar or permanent injury.

This article focuses only on those “hate crime” offenses that resulted in physical harm, including simple assault. Here are some of the reasons why the FBI Hate Crime Statistics do not measure up to scrutiny:

Convicted crimes carry the same weight as anonymous graffiti, for example, which is counted as a “hate crime” despite the fact that the perpetrator(s) could be unknown. According to the Hate Crime Data Collection Guidelines and Training Manual, “reporting agencies must examine each case for facts which clearly provide evidence that the offender’s bias motivated him/her to commit the crime.” However, FBI spokesperson Stephen G. Fischer Jr. told the author last year that convictions are not tracked. More information about how the reporters make this determination should be available. The source information is not provided, so it is impossible to match the data with the actual statistics. Considering the abundance of “hate crime hoaxes,” source information is necessary. In 1800 out of 5928 incidents, according to the report, the offender’s race is “unknown.” This begs the question: If you cannot locate the perpetrator, how could the reporting agency possibly know his or her intent? Regarding the “known offenders,” the FBI cautions: “The term known offender does not imply that the suspect’s identity is known…” (you may need to read that again). The FBI continues, “rather, the term indicates that some aspect of the suspect was identified, thus distinguishing the suspect from an unknown offender.” The question is, if the known offender is only known based on a description from the alleged victim, how can bias intent be effectively determined? White people are considered to be the “original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.” Arab Americans who commit a hate crime, therefore, are considered to be “white.” For the first time, as reported at the Examiner, FBI spokesperson Fischer said that the FBI will be “collecting offender Hispanic information starting 2013.” Perpetrators who happened to be Hispanic were previously lumped in with white people as offenders, but not as victims. But according to the 2013 statistics, only 13 “Hispanic or Latino” individuals committed a hate crime. Consider: according to the hate crime statistics for Los Angeles County alone, there were 57 incidents of Latino-on-Black hate crimes. Of the violent hate crimes, there were five incidents of “Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter.” Of those, four were committed by white people and one was of an “unknown” race. Of the aggravated assaults, 443 were committed by white people and 188 were committed by black people. Groups of “multiple races” committed 32 aggravated assaults and 31 were of an “unknown race.” Of the simple assaults, 845 were committed by white people and 451 were committed by black people. Groups of “multiple races” committed 119 aggravated assaults and 177 were of an “unknown race.” Interestingly, if one combines simple and aggravated assault, American Indians/Alaska Natives account for 32 offenses, 21 offenses can be attributed to “Asians,” and 9 can be attributed to those who are classified as Hispanic/Latino. If one removes simple assault from the equation, a total of 760 people were physically harmed during a hate crime in 2013, based on the statistics. The rest of the 6933 hate crimes can be attributed to other offenses, most prominently would be intimidation (1528), and “Destruction/damage/vandalism” (1783).

Starting in 2015, the FBI “will begin formally tracking hate crimes against Sikhs, Hindus and Arabs.” It is unclear if Arabs will still be considered as white people as offenders. This year, data on gender and gender identity biases has been added to the statistics.

The most troubling aspects of the report in a nutshell:

Convictions are not tracked, i.e., a conviction is not needed to label a “hate crime.”

The offender, even the “known offender,” is not necessarily known.

Historically, Hispanic/Latinos were lumped in with white people as offenders, but not as victims. That changed for the first time this year. However, the 2013 report inexplicably reported that only 13 instances of hate crime were perpetrated by Hispanic offenders.

People of Middle Eastern and North African descent are combined with white people.

The most infuriating thing about the fuzzy statistics is that the hate crimes themselves are not available for public scrutiny, rendering the statistics vastly useless. FBI spokesperson Fischer told the author that source information “is law enforcement sensitive and not available other than for law enforcement purposes.”

Without having the ability to review the source data, however, it is very difficult to confirm the information in the report.

"http://gulagbound.com/48265/cromnibus-a-1-trillion-betrayal-updated/","CROmnibus: a $1 Trillion Betrayal; Updated","Update: The votes are in and the massive spending bill known as “CROmnibus” has passed the House of Representatives. The Senate has been given two days to consider. Cannot imagine a successful GOP challenge there so it will be come law of the land. Democrats call this massive bill one of the best deals they’ve gotten with the GOP in decades. Congressman James Moran (D-VA) said:

In 20 years with appropriations bills, I haven’t seen a better compromise in terms of Democratic priorities. Implementing the affordable care act, there’s a lot more money for child development…We got virtually everything Democrats tried to get.

This was a massive, premeditated betrayal of the American people and the Leadership’s own party. Before the vote on Cromnibus, there was a vote on a procedural rule whether or not to allow the bill to be considered at all. A vote against the rule would have killed the bill. One congressman claimed leadership lied to him, telling him that Cromnibus was dead and if he voted for the rule it would be to clear the way for a vote on a simple short term continuing resolution funding government until the GOP took charge. So he voted for the rule. It won 214 to 212. CROmnibus then went on to pass with significant support from Democrats and way too many Republicans. Finally, GOP leadership chose the December 11 expiration date for a continuing resolution passed in September to temporarily fund government. They did this knowing full well that if the GOP won the Senate in November, it would offer Democrats one last chance to pass something in the lame duck session. Speaker Boehner, McConnell and other GOP leaders deliberately disenfranchised their fellow Republicans.

Original article posted at American Thinker yesterday:

Flush from an unprecedented nationwide GOP victory in this November’s elections, House and Senate GOP leadership determined that their essential first course of action should be to snatch defeat from its jaws. They have brought forth a spending bill for 2015 that gives President Obama almost everything he wants, while disenfranchising the very voters who delivered the GOP victory.

The $1.014 trillion Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, (HR 83), has been dubbed “CROmnibus” as it is a combined continuing resolution (CR)[1] and Omnibus spending bill. It will provide full funding for 11 of the 12 annual appropriations bills to the end of FY 2015 (September 30th), and a short term continuing resolution to February 27 for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Speaker Boehner has said he would ensure members a minimum of 72 hours to read legislation. Instead, following former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s innovative “pass the bill so that you can find out what’s in it” policy, there will only be a tiny window of no more than 52 hours to read, analyze and vote on a trillion dollar spending bill that is 1,603 pages long. For reference, the Bible (NKJV) is only 1,200 pages. In 2010, incoming Speaker Boehner sang a different tune, “I do not believe that having 2,000-page bills on the House floor serves anyone’s best interests, not the House, not for the members and certainly not for the American people,” he said. But he also said he was going to cut spending…

Well, since this monstrosity went public at around 8:30 Tuesday night, countless eyes have been poring over its provisions to make sure we don’t have to pass it to find out what’s in it. Following are some of the worst:

1. Explanatory Statement

Right from the start, the very first provision indicates this is a new animal:

Sec. 4 Explanatory Statement (P 4.) “The explanatory statement regarding this Act, printed in the House of Representatives section of the Congressional Record on or about December 11, 2014 by the Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations of the House, shall have the same effect with respect to the allocation of funds and implementation of divisions A through K of this Act as if it were a joint explanatory statement of a committee of conference.”

What it says in plain English is that the appropriations committee chairman could have authority to write in changes to any of the appropriations bills after the bill is passed. Usually this is done by a conference committee before the vote and indicates how and where they would like to see monies spent. This provision could allow the chairman to sneak in something or make other changes after the vote!

2. Executive Amnesty Is Fully Funded

The bill withholds funding for 451 separate activities, but none for executive amnesty. It provides at least $2.5 billion to handle this year’s influx of approximately 252,600 illegals. Most of the programs existed beforehand, but the legislation makes clear that increases have been provided to cover the additional costs:

Health and Human Services: $948 million for HHS’s Unaccompanied Alien Children program, $80 million more than fiscal year 2014, specifically to accommodate the “more than 57,000 children” apprehended in 2014. According to the Democrats, “It will also support legal services for children as they seek safety in the United States from extreme violence and abuse in their home countries.” This mantra is part of the Democrats’ effort to reclassify illegal aliens as “refugees,” a classification they clearly do not warrant. See p. 34 of Democrat bill summary.

Social Security: The following convoluted language actually gives illegals greater access to Social Security. By limiting denials to individuals whose actions have “formed the basis for a conviction…” implicitly everyone else is eligible, including those 4.5 million amnestied illegals. Virtually no one will be denied:

“None of the funds appropriated in this Act shall be expended or obligated by the Commissioner of Social Security, for purposes of administering Social Security benefit payments under title II of the Social Security Act, to process any claim for credit for a quarter of coverage based on work performed under a social security account number that is not the claimant’s number and the performance of such work under such number has formed the basis for a conviction of the claimant of a violation of section 208(a)(6) or (7) of the Social Security Act.” (PP. 958-959).

Department of Education: “$14 million for grants to all State educational agencies within States with at least one county where 50 or more unaccompanied children have been released to sponsors since January 1, 2014…” (P. 910) Furthermore, local agencies will be given subgrants for “supplemental academic and non-academic services and supports to immigrant children and youth.”

Department of State: $932 million. Includes a provision to assist Central American countries in improving their border security. (PP. 1303 – 1306). No funds appear to be allocated specifically to this activity but the Democrat’s bill summary identifies $260 million “to respond to a surge of unaccompanied children from Central America coming to the U.S. The funds will be used to implement a prevention and response strategy focused on border security and the reintegration of migrants, as well as the causes of the migration, including programs to improve education and employment, support families, counter gangs, coyotes and drug cartels and professionalize police forces.” See p. 53.

Note that the above does not refer to U.S. border security but that of Central American countries – an absurd gesture. The three Northern Triangle states of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador facilitated this year’s migration. Their borders are much tighter than ours. If they wanted to shut them down, they could. Flush $260 million.

Providing a short-term CR for DHS was supposed to make it appear that the GOP was going to challenge Obama’s illegal executive amnesty next year, because DHS agencies are to process new applicants under the executive order. But there is no language in the DHS CR defunding amnesty. Bill writers claimed they could not insert defund language into the DHS CR because affected programs are self-funded with user fees. Yet the bill had language restricting other user-fee based programs in other agencies. And if they couldn’t defund it now, how could they next year when the CR expires?

Between now and February 27, Obama’s executive action is fully funded, and the CR expires after the program kicks in. Meanwhile, DHS is rushing to hire new personnel to process the illegals expected to apply for the amnesty. There were so many lies and deceptions in this exercise it was almost impossible to keep up.

The GOP House leadership wants amnesty. Rep. Pete Sessions has said publicly that Republicans did not intend to repatriate the illegals who overwhelmed the border in 2014. Regarding any immigration “reform”, Sessions emphasized that the plan, “even in our wildest dream, would not be to remove any person that might be here, unless they were dangerous to this country and had committed a crime.” They structured the CROmnibus specifically to give Obama what he wants, allowing him to take the heat for it while they pretend to oppose it. Their real goal is to pass comprehensive immigration “reform” in 2015 that will look much like George W. Bush’s failed effort in 2007.

Daily Caller’s Neil Munro quoted a GOP Hill aide: “GOP leaders want to block and complicate the anti-amnesty fight because the GOP might win the fight against Obama… That victory would derail their plans for an GOP-designed amnesty in 2015, and complicate their efforts to keep immigration out of the 2016 election…”

The Leadership’s amnesty goals defy all logic. Those illegals brought with them a dictionary of new diseases, including most likely, the Enterovirus outbreak responsible for at least 8 deaths and numerous cases of serious paralysis. Illegals commit heinous crimes in disproportionate numbers. A major reason the GOP swept elections nationwide is that most Americans – including democrats and Hispanic Americans – do not like Obama’s open borders policies and want illegals sent home, not to remain here stealing jobs and overburdening our welfare system – already stressed to the max. Poll after poll indicates this.

On Wednesday, an amendment was proposed that would block funding for Obama’s executive amnesty. One of the amendment’s co-sponsors was Dave Brat, the Virginia legislator who threw Eric Cantor out of office. The amendment probably won’t get a fair hearing but good on him for trying.

3. Full Funding for Obamacare

Clever language says “no new funding” for Obamacare. But Obamacare was fully funded in the CR passed in September to keep the government open until December 11, including the contentious abortion funding and other issues. Now funding will be provided for the full fiscal year. This means no Obamacare repeal this year, and as it gradually sinks its tentacles into our Nation’s heart, it will be increasingly difficult to rip out. If a Republican becomes president in 2016, by then it will be so entrenched they won’t dare risk political capital to remove it. Difficult to believe, but the GOP Leadership appears to want Obamacare almost as much as the Democrats.

4. Millions More Muslim Refugees from Terrorist Countries

Syrian Refugees $3.06 billion has been provided, $1.01 billion above the President’s request for Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons. (P. 52 Democrat summary). Recall that in September Simon Henshaw, deputy assistant secretary of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, announced: “Next year, you will see thousands [of Syrians] entering the US. We are committed to a large program on a par with other large [refugee resettlement] programs in the past… Our commitment is to do thousands a year over many years,” he said. There are over 1 million Syrian refugees in Turkey who have fled Syria’s civil war. “Our resettlement program from Turkey is one of our largest in the world, and it will continue to grow,” he added. Refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran will also benefit. So if you like Dearbornistan, prepare for many more towns like it.

5. Aid to Syrian Rebels

Half a Billion to Nice Terrorists “$500,000,000 … to provide assistance, including training, equipment, supplies, sustainment and stipends, to appropriately vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other appropriately vetted Syrian groups or individuals for the following purposes: defending the Syrian people from attacks by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and securing territory controlled by the Syrian opposition; protecting the United States, its friends and allies, and the Syrian people from the threats posed by terrorists in Syria; and promoting the conditions for a negotiated settlement to end the conflict in Syria.”. Weren’t our friends in Libya “appropriately vetted” too? The bill denies use of these funds for “procurement or transfer of man portable air defense systems.” But how does DoD plan to enforce that? (PP 426-427).

6. A Bunch More Objectionable Provisions

EPA gets to keep on imposing “greenhouse gas” regulations that are strangling coal, while provisions reining in EPA were stripped from the bill.

Provisions supporting gun rights were removed.

$5.4 billion for Ebola efforts in Africa – more than provided to fight ISIS.

The bill contains phony budget gimmicks, but still violates spending caps

Too many others to list

Club for Growth is urging all members of Congress to vote “NO” on the Cromnibus (HR 83), as is Heritage Action for America, the political action arm of the Heritage Foundation. Conservatives may have an unlikely ally in Senator Elizabeth Warren. Warren has become the Democrat’s latest lunatic folk hero following the ignoble flameout of Wendy “Abortion Barbie” Davis. Warren has called on Democrats to deny support until one objectionable provision regarding the Dodd-Frank law is removed. The Teamsters have weighed in as well, asking members not to support Cromnibus because of changes to multi-employer pension legislation. Both sides may be willing to consider a short term 90 day CR should the CROmnibus fail to pass, but the White House understandably prefers the monster.

This bill sets horrible precedents; most importantly it blatantly dismisses overwhelming popular opposition to both executive amnesty and Obamacare. The GOP majority was elected to take action, and not the action preferred by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Obama and the Democrats, but that demanded by taxpaying voters. If allowed to stand, these two policies will rip our country apart and ensure that the GOP majority, as usual, is very short-lived.

Who is killing America?

Why is the world’s greatest nation struggling? The economic recovery is a sham. “Obamacare” is wrecking the world’s greatest healthcare system. The world’s greatest military is being gutted.

The southern border is being erased with “amnesty’ being granted to millions of illegal aliens, while millions of Americans are unemployed or “underemployed.”

The US Constitution is being trashed daily, by the very people delegated and paid to uphold and protect it.

Why is this happening? Why do America’s leaders continue to force policies like “Obamacare” and “amnesty” down the throats of America’s voters?

Clearly America has enemies. What if some of the worst of those enemies are currently serving in the US House of Representatives? What if many of them are allied with radical Marxist organizations, or even hostile foreign governments, who are intent on bringing the United States of America to its knees?

The first rule of warfare is to “know thine enemy.” Your enemies in the US Congress know everything about you. But what does the “mainstream media” let you know about them?

The 2013/2015 edition of my book “The Enemies Within: Communists, Socialists, and Progressives in the U.S. Congress” began the urgent task of exposing America’s many internal enemies.

From Amazon:

This book contains the keys for understanding the political process in America. The Communist fronts of the 1930s and 40s never disappeared, but merely changed their names or even remained as they were. The end of the Cold War, it turns out, was irrelevant for the continued advance of socialism in America. All the basic methods for infiltrating American institutions were at hand and the socialists were determined to change the country, change its economic system and eliminate capitalism as far as they were able. Everywhere, the socialists grab issues, even inventing crises where there are none. In this book we learn about the various fronts in the war of the far left to remake America as a socialist society. If you want to understand what’s really going on in the U.S., you have to read this. J.R. Nyquist Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! Who knew that it would take a New Zealander to really describe in detail the ominous processes at work to destroy countries such as the United States. It would be very informative for anyone, especially those who have fallen into the trap set to slowly bring the destruction about. Jane H. Kelley If I was teaching a course in Political Science or Government, this would be one of the required textbooks! Finally, a competent researcher who also has the courage of his convictions has shined the light where it should be: The Communist Party Internationale. If you honestly want to know the single cause of America’s problems, from social to economic to moral, look no further. Get and read this essential book! Calvin Fields

My updated version, exposing the radicals in the 2015-2017 Congress is even better!

The 2015-2017 edition of “Enemies Within” will expose covert radicals in several new states, including Hawaii, Kentucky and Rhode Island, plus, it will include new profiles from California (six), Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Wisconsin and Vermont.

Why does Red State Arizona have two communist affiliated Reps? Why does even redder Texas have four?

Why does a young new Senator work so hard to empower Colombia’s narco-terrorist Marxist guerrillas? Who is Beijing’s best friend in the US congress? Which US Senator is claimed as a member by America’s largest Marxist organization? Who are the Communist Party USA’s best friends in the House of Representatives?

How many US Congress members and Senators would fail a basic FBI security clearance? Does it matter that these people can still serve on the Homeland Security Committee, the Armed Services Committee? Even the Intelligence Committee?

My new book will be released on April 11, 2014, but you can begin to pre-order PERSONALLY SIGNED copies immediately.

As a bonus, the first 25 people to pre-order the 2015-17 edition, will earn a half hour personal phone call with author and speaker Trevor Loudon, on my next visit to the United States, commencing February of 2015.

The first 11 people to order three copies or more will get a whole hour’s conversation!

Doug Ross @ Journal

In an utterly unsurprising development this week, Jeb Bush announced that he’s “actively exploring” a 2016 Presidential run.

Allow me to offer some perspective for the GOP Elites and others suffering from the fevered delusion that Jeb Bush might someday serve as President, in this universe or any other.

1. This is one situation where an open primary benefits conservatives: I contend that Democrats will turn out in droves — like there was an announcement for free government cheese at the mall — to vote against the Bush name. Heck, you and I have heard it for years: debate any policy position with a progressive and, no matter the facts, logic, history, and reason you muster — the inevitable result is what some call Bush Tourette’s Syndrome (i.e., “But- but- but- Bush!). This sad disease is sure to manifest itself in the primaries and amplify Democrat turnout like nothing we’ve seen since the dead walked the streets of Chicago in 1960 to cast ballots for John F. Kennedy.

2. Jeb Bush’s support for Amnesty is wildly unpopular among a huge majority of Americans: 88% of Republicans, 66% of independents and even 50% of Democrats believe that the border should be locked down before any Amnesty efforts are undertaken.

3. Bush’s support for a nationalized education curriculum (also known as “Common Core”) is generally despised. Only 34% of U.S. adults with children in elementary or secondary school support the federal takeover of educational standards.

4. Should Bush secure the nomination (which, if it occurs, we can thank John Boehner’s newly uncorked personal campaign contribution limits in the CRomnibus), I believe we’ll see the first viable third-party candidate since 1992. Reince Priebus, Karl Rove and the rest of the GOP Oligarchs should know that the Republican Party will be torn asunder by a Bush nomination. Guaranteed. A third party will result and the GOP will go the way of the Whigs — deservedly so.

5. BONUS: Jeb’s formula for victory:

Jeb Bush has no chance of winning the presidency — zero, none — and anyone who tells him otherwise is lying or a paid political operative. Or, more likely, both.","2014-12-18 13:02:28","1","22.0","16.0","15.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","120.0","95.0","0.0","81.0","0.0","6.0","0","370","89.80","57.51","14.28","75.85","18.50","24.86","71.35","41.89","7.84","2.97","1.08","0.81","0.54","0.54","0.00","4.86","8.38","12.16","6.49","1.89","5.95","1.08","11.62","2.70","1.62","1.08","6.22","2.43","5.14","3.78","1.08","0.00","0.54","0.54","6.22","0.00","0.00","0.00","0.54","12.70","2.43","1.89","1.08","4.59","1.35","3.24","0.81","0.54","0.27","0.00","1.35","0.00","1.08","0.00","0.27","7.84","1.62","1.89","4.59","1.08","0.27","1.89","7.03","1.89","9.46","1.35","5.68","2.16","4.05","1.89","0.00","0.81","0.00","0.27","1.08","0.27","0.81","0.00","0.00","0.00","20.27","6.49","4.32","1.35","0.00","0.00","0.27","1.08","1.35","2.16","1.62","1.62","1763","8.92","20.0","556","375","15","54.56","13.6","11.9","11.84","14.5","96","16.833333333333332","22.240000000000002","254","18.37","11","0.42","0","16","19","43","0","45","30","0","0","8","51","59","4","15","0","0","14","0","11","1","0","2","4","0","16","6","4","6","10","11","1","2","0","1"

If you want to understand Julian Assange Wikileaks, the Edward Snowden affair and the current campaign against the United States police, watch this hour long video. From the 1980s, the video will make it clear that all these supposedly spontaneous movements are part of an ongoing, KGB and Cuban directed campaign to de-stabilize and eventually destroy America.

Firstly the House un-American Activities Committee was abolished, then the CIA and FBI were weakened, discredited and compromised. Now the military is being gutted, the NSA is severely compromised and the police are being attacked and discredited… even killed.

None of this is an accident.

This video explains exactly why America is in the position it is in today.

Bassem Masri, an infamous Ferguson agitator, has surfaced in New York City taunting police officers who were mourning the loss of their fellow colleagues, Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.

As reported by Victoria O’Kane at Broadside News:

Officer Lieu was only twenty-eight and had just been married two months earlier. Officer Ramos had just turned forty on December ninth and had a thirteen year old son who must now grow up without a father.

Masri took to the streets of New York City after the horrific execution to goad police officers as he did so many times in Ferguson. In the video, Masri encourages police to stand with “real men” of the “Palestinian resistance.”

Watch the video here, if you can stomach it:

Masri made similar statements while in Ferguson:

Bassem Masri has gotten himself plenty of attention for his activities in Ferguson, Missouri. Back in November, J.E. Dyer at Liberty Unyielding wrote about his antics as a Hamas supporter and police instigator. Dyer also revealed that Masri was tapped by the Department of Justice to act as a consultant on “police reform.”

DOJ has appointed a few of us2reform the police in the entire region that should resonate nationwide thats the director intentions #Ferguson — Bassem Masri (@bassem_masri) November 7, 2014

Why would the taxpayer-funded Department of Justice enlist in the help of a man like Masri for reforming police “nationwide?” The idea of federalizing the police has been getting some play in the media. If progressives are worried about a “police state,” the idea of a government-run police force should send shivers up their spines. Most Americans surely recognize that police officers run to criminals as others run in the opposite direction.

Considering that every single day, police officers deal with the worst among us, it is frankly shocking that there are not more fatalities and violence. After all, on any given day, one can find local news stories about police officers getting injured and even killed by criminals.

New Zeal

Everybody knows that Bernie Sanders, the grandfatherly Independent Senator from Vermont is a socialist. He’s made no secret of it over the years, proudly proclaiming to anyone who will listen. To most people it’s no big deal: “at least he’s honest,” they’ll chuckle. Most people seem to imagine that Grandpa Bernie’s socialism is benign, owing much more to Sweden than Cuba, much more to modern West Germany, than to the old German Democratic Republic.

But is Bernie Sanders really being honest? What if he is actually more of a communist? A believer in class struggle? Of crushing the free enterprise system?

Does it matter? The man is a US Senator. His vote could decide the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice, or ratify a gun banning treaty with the United Nations. He is even seriously exploring a presidential run on the Democratic ticket. Damned right his real views matter.

Firstly, I want to present evidence that Senator Sanders is not truly an Independent. That he is in fact, a member of a semi-secret political organization. Secondly, I want to prove that that organization, in spite of labeling itself ‘socialist,’ is in fact, a communist grouping – with all the negative connotations that it implies.

For years, Bernie Sanders has been closely associated with Democratic Socialists of America, the country’s largest openly leftist organization. Senator Sanders has keynoted several DSA conferences, numerous DSA fundraisers have raised money for him, DSA backed his 2006 Senate campaign and now, the group is actively encouraging him to run for the White House in 2016.

But, as far as I’m aware, there has never been any evidence that Sanders is actually a DSA member.

Until now: Madison Democratic Socialists of America has confirmed Senator Sanders’ long suspected DSA membership on page one of their Fall 2014 newsletter (though getting his state of origin incorrect).

Equally important, we featured a petition to encourage Bernie Sanders – the independent Maine Senator and DSA member – to run for president, collecting over 75 signatures.

Though they may be graduates of Common Core geography, there is no reason to believe that the Madison DSAers were either lying or mistaken about Senator Sanders’ DSA membership status. Membership status is a big deal in leftist organizations. Dues-paying membership elevates one to the elite ranks of the Progressive movement. Formal “paid up” Party membership is not taken lightly. Clearly Sanders’ DSA membership is not for public consumption. Probably the “cheesehead” socialists believed that only sympathizers would ever bother to read their little newsletter.

After all, what’s a little secret between trusted comrades?

So, now I’ve established that Senator Sanders is probably a closet DSAer, why is that of concern?

My contention is simple. Despite using the word “socialists” in its name, DSA is, for all practical purposes, a communist organization. Because most DSAers are also active Democrats, or Green Party activists, the “socialist” label doesn’t meet the degree of resistance, that the more honest description “communist” would.

DSA works very closely with three of America’s leading communist groups – the Maoist leaning Freedom Road Socialist Organization, the “old guard” Communist Party USA, and the CPUSA spin-off Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. The four groups have even seriously considered merging in recent years. In June 2013, “The Future of the Left – A Conversation on Socialist Unity” was convened in New York City by the four groups, where the idea of eventual unification was discussed in depth.

DSA draws most of its ideas and inspiration from Chicago radical, Saul Alinsky, and Italian Communist Party theoretician, Antonio Gramsci.

Orange County California DSA acknowledged the organization’s debt to Gramsci in its February 1984 newsletter.

“Antonio Gramsci was a founder of the Italian Communist Party. He developed theories on “open ended Marxism” and independent Euro-Communism. His writings have remained influential among European parties of the left for several decades. They have also formed a vital part of the ideas that brought about the formation of today’s DSA.”

In an article in DSA’s Democratic Left, Spring 2007, DSA National Political Committee member David Green of Detroit, wrote in support of the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) or “card check.”

What distinguishes socialists from other progressives is the theory of surplus value. According to Marx, the secret of surplus value is that workers are a source of more value than they receive in wages. The capitalist is able to capture surplus value through his ownership of the means of production, his right to purchase labor as a commodity, his control over the production process, and his ownership of the final product. Surplus value is the measure of capital’s exploitation of labor

Green went on to write:

Our goal as socialists is to abolish private ownership of the means of production. Our immediate task is to limit the capitalist class’s prerogatives in the workplace…

Communist enough for you folks?

Bernie Sanders is no European style social democratic “socialist.” He is a Big “C” communist and he should have the integrity to be honest about it.

By: Doug Ross

Doug Ross @ Journal

For those who are wondering how Barack Obama — a man seemingly engaged in full-time campaigning, fundraising and rabble-rousing — could also have the bandwidth to weaken America both at home and abroad, the answer is really quite simple.

The leader of the free world is actually a woman named Valerie Jarrett, a longtime crony of Barack and Michelle Obama, who appears to call all of the shots in the Oval Office.

In the White House, Jarrett has been linked to a wide variety of scandals and other policy debacles.

There are credible reports that Jarrett blocked the attack on Osama Bin Laden’s compound on three separate occasions.

Similar reports indicate that she gave the “stand down” order to would-be rescuers in Benghazi on 9/11/2012.

In 2012, she was reported to have led Obama’s “secret negotiations” with Iran’s Mullahs. Subsequent accounts depicted Jarrett as working with Iran’s nuclear experts to ensure the Islamic Republic could continue on its march to build nuclear weapons.

On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal‘s Kim Strassel summarized the ramifications of Jarrett’s litany of policy failures in stark terms: everyone but her is expendable.

Among those thrown under Jarrett’s bus: Christina Romer, Jim Jones, Bill Daley, Leon Panetta, Kathleen Sebelius, Rahm Emanuel, Austan Goolsbee, Larry Summers, Peter Orszag, Vivek Kundra, Eric Shinseki, Keith Alexander, James Clapper and, most recently, Chuck Hagel. Hagel’s ostensible replacement, Michèle Flournoy, turned down the opportunity because she didn’t “want to be a doormat.”

As Strassel asks:

Who would want to work for a boss whose experiments in big government all but guarantee their reputation will be ruined in the aftermath of a bureaucratic collapse? … And who wants to work for a boss who doesn’t have your back? … Is it possible to have any other experience working for Mr. Obama—a boss who doesn’t listen, views everything politically, always thinks he’s right, and whose policies are a recipe for a lost reputation?

Which brings us at last to the Democrats’ latest haven for race-baiting, Ferguson.

Jarrett was in contact with Missouri’s Governor Nixon in the run-up to the announcement of the Grand Jury’s decision.

While Nixon denied the administration pressured him to resist activating the National Guard to put down the violent protests, the White House has admitted that Jarrett was in close contact with the governor during the first 24 hours of violent protests.

Nixon came under heavy criticism for failing to deploy the National Guard to quash the protests, which resulted in massive property damage. It now would seem that Jarrett had a hand in that decision as well.

And who is our crypto-president?

In 2008, The Boston Globe exposed Jarrett’s background as the failed chief executive of The Habitat Company, which managed government-subsidized housing complexes in Chicago from 2001 until 2006. Her leadership, if you can call it that, resulted in violations so egregious that many units were deemed “uninhabitable” and eventually the federal government was forced to seize the properties.

That year, Judicial Watch named Jarrett to its “Ten Most Wanted Corrupt Politicians” list for her ties to the failed housing complexes and “other shady real estate scandals.”

Jarrett’s family background is equally troubling. Her father-in-law was a card-carrying Communist who worked with Obama’s mentor, Frank Marshall Davis.

Jarrett’s grandfather Robert Taylor is reported to have served in a leadership role for the Soviet Union’s American front group during World War II, when Stalin was still allied with the Third Reich. Taylor’s “American Peace Mobilization” was a Soviet initiative designed to keep America out of the war so that Hitler and Stalin could divvy up Europe and Asia virtually unopposed.

So, in short, the first female President is a hard-core Leftist with an abysmal track record for decision-making, a horrifically failed tenure as a chief executive, a stunning inability to learn and a steely refusal to take responsibilities for her many failures.

But she’s the president and you’re not.

Which explains why Jarrett — against all historic precedent — was given a Secret Service detail for protection.

Founders Code

A few years ago, Marc Thiessen wrote a book titled Courting Disaster. The spirit of the book delivers proven evidence that interrogation of enemy combatants kept America safe and offered up more actionable knowledge in the terror networks globally. Thiessen provides names, organizations and lobby groups in full opposition of black sites and Guantanamo. One needs to understand all the moving parts before they offer criticism of decisions by the Bush administration.

So as Barack Obama entered the White House, his first move was to close Gitmo while almost 7 years later there are 140 detainees still there. The question is why? The team known to be the go-to operation to close Gitmo has also proven some success in getting terrorists released from the ‘other’ Gitmo, the prison(s) in Colorado that actually has more detainees than Gitmo.

These wars across the globe against terror networks involves hundreds of thousands of fighters, hence in begs the question, who no capture and interrogate? Is killing the via drone since all ground hostilities have been terminated effective? Terror cells have grown exponentially including al Nusra, Daesh, AQAP, Boko Harem and more. Their operating territory has expanded in the last 6 years as well.

Here are some facts that cannot be disputed.

If you knew who was behind “Close-Gitmo” push, you’d be shocked

On Saturday, January 11, a coalition of “Close-Gitmo” forces is expected to march on Washington to commemorate the 12th anniversary of detention and interrogation operations.

Though the march from the White House to the National Museum of American History is purportedly about advancing “human rights” and “stopping torture,” a closer look at the key participants reveals a more troubling, some might say hidden, agenda.

If more Americans knew who is behind this campaign, there would be nationwide outrage.

While everyone is for “human rights” and “stopping torture,” Americans should not be fooled by these false flags meant to damage U.S. power and prestige.

Dig a little deeper into who has been driving the anti-Gitmo disinformation campaign these past 12 years, and you will discover an international, fervently anti-American, far-left coalition attacking the nation through a savvy propaganda effort.

Just dig a little deeper into who has been driving the anti-Gitmo disinformation campaign these past 12 years, and we discover an international, fervently anti-American, far-left coalition attacking the nation through a savvy propaganda effort.

This includes those linked to Al Qaeda financiers, communist groups, anarchist movements – backed by sympathetic press and politicians.

Regrettably, it’s a coalition President Barack Obama has sided with in his priority to release as many Al Qaeda, Taliban and “affiliates” as humanly possible.

Let’s take a look at the key players:

Amnesty International. Along with Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International was revealed as partner organization to Al Karama, a human rights non-profit run by Qatar’s Abdul Rahman Omeir Al-Naimi.

Al-Naimi was recently exposed by the U.S. Treasury Department in December 2013 as a long-term major financier of Al Qaeda. According to an expose by Eli Lake in the Daily Beast, “Terrorists for Human Rights,” the Treasury Department’s designation said he, “oversaw the transfer of hundreds of thousands of dollars to Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Iraq, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen over the last 11 years.”

Center for Constitutional Rights. CCR was founded by far-left civil rights lawyer William Kunstler in the 1960s, a man who told the press his goal was to “destroy society from within.”

Kunstler represented the “Chicago 7,” a group that was charged with conspiracy to start a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and later he defended domestic militant/terror groups like the Black Panthers, Weather Underground, and Attica Prison Rioters.

CCR is currently funded by groups like the “1848 Foundation,” named after the year Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto was published and revolutions swept through Europe.

Kunstler would be proud of CCR’s signature work over the past decade in coordinating the “Gitmo Bar Association” of 500 lawyers representing detainees.

Reprieve. A British organization led by blogger Andy Worthington, it pressures release of British citizens and residents. Ethiopia’s Binyam Mohammed, a British resident, allegedly plotted to blow up high rise apartment buildings in the U.S. with a dirty bomb; Ruhal Ahmed, Asif Iqbal, and Shafiq Rasul, a.k.a., the Tipton Three, ethnic Pakistanis went to fight for jihad in Afghanistan but were caught by the Northern Alliance in Nov. 2001; and Shaker Aamer, a Saudi citizen with British residence, alleged to have led a unit of Al Qaeda fighters in Tora Bora, and reportedly a former close associate of Usama Bin Laden, shoe-bomber Richard Reid and 20th hijacker, Zacharias Moussaoui.

World Can’t Wait. This organization is believed to have been founded by members and supporters of the Revolutionary Communist Party & Anarchists. It organized at least 24,000 supporters during Iraq War, including actor Sean Penn and anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan.

Jason Leopold. Leopold is a former Los Angeles Times investigative journalist with a checkered past. According to Fox News media critic Howard Kurtz, writing in a 2005 Washington Post feature, “Leopold says he engaged in ‘lying, cheating and backstabbing,’ is a former cocaine addict, served time for grand larceny, repeatedly tried to kill himself and has battled mental illness his whole life.”

So these are the folks Mr. Obama and Democrats in Congress are trying to appease by releasing more Gitmo detainees?

Nearly half the current population of 155 may be freed under the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014.

It would be comical if the stakes weren’t so high.

We’ve already seen Al Qaeda re-take Fallujah, site of the Iraq War’s bloodiest battles, just two years after Mr. Obama’s ordered withdrawal. And Al Qaeda and/or “affiliates” killed our Ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi.

Speaking of which, a Fox News report this week by Catherine Herridge reveals that the State Dept. will finally designate ex-Gitmo detainee, Libya’s Sufian Bin Qumu, and his group, Ansar Al-Sharia as “foreign terrorist entities” for their roles in the Benghazi Consulate attack.

Does Mr. Obama really think it’s in America’s security interests to free more terrorists from Gitmo, nearly one-third of whom have already returned to terrorism?

The silent majority must take this opportunity to speak up. Preventing the next Al Qaeda attack may depend on it.

Military tribunals have proved excruciatingly slow and imprisonment at Guantánamo hugely costly — $800,000 per inmate a year, compared with $25,000 in federal prison.

The criminal justice system, meanwhile, has absorbed the surge of terrorism cases since 2001 without calamity, and without the international criticism that Guantánamo has attracted for holding prisoners without trial. A decade after the Sept. 11 attacks, an examination of how the prisons have handled the challenge of extremist violence reveals some striking facts:

Lengthy sentences. Terrorists who plotted to massacre Americans are likely to die in prison. Faisal Shahzad, who tried to set off a car bomb in Times Square in 2010, is serving a sentence of life without parole at the Supermax, as are Zacarias Moussaoui, a Qaeda operative arrested in 2001, and Mr. Reid, the shoe bomber, among others. But many inmates whose conduct fell far short of outright terrorism are serving sentences of a decade or more, the result of a calculated prevention strategy to sideline radicals well before they could initiate deadly plots.

¶ Special units. Since 2006, the Bureau of Prisons has moved many of those convicted in terrorism cases to two special units that severely restrict visits and phone calls. But in creating what are Muslim-dominated units, prison officials have inadvertently fostered a sense of solidarity and defiance, and set off a long-running legal dispute over limits on group prayer. Officials have warned in court filings about the danger of radicalization, but the Bureau of Prisons has nothing comparable to the deradicalization programs instituted in many countries.

¶ Quiet releases. More than 300 prisoners have completed their sentences and been freed since 2001. Their convictions involved not outright violence but “material support” for a terrorist group; financial or document fraud; weapons violations; and a range of other crimes. About half are foreign citizens and were deported; the Americans have blended into communities around the country, refusing news media interviews and avoiding attention.

About 40 percent of terrorism cases since the Sept. 11 attacks have relied on informants, by the count of the Center on Law and Security at New York University, which Ms. Greenberg headed until earlier this year. In such cases, the F.B.I. has trolled for radicals and then tested whether they were willing to plot mayhem — again, a pre-emptive strategy intended to ferret out potential terrorists. But in some cases prosecutors have been accused of overreaching.

Do we really want to close Gitmo? Do we really want to keep these terrorists in prisons around the homeland? They are quietly being released by the Justice Department while being radicalized still during their prison terms.

The Ferguson riots are not what they seem and those behind them are professionals. One of the top organizers of the protesters for the Ferguson riots is Lisa Fithian, someone who was intimately involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement. She has been deemed “Professor Occupy.” In 2005 and 2008, Lisa Fithian, Root Activist Network of Trainers, (2005), Alliance for Community Trainers Inc. (2008), was voted onto the Steering Committee for United for Peace and Justice. United for Peace and Justice is a partner organization of the George Soros linked Institute for Policy Studies. Several Marxist organizations are involved in the UFPJ leadership, but the most influential has been the Communist Party USA.

Lisa Fithian joined the labor movement through the AFL-CIO Organizing Institute in 1993. She is considered a legendary organizer. She also served as a human shield in actions conducted by the International Solidarity Movement in the Palestinian cities of Jenin and Nablus and has accused Israel of “slaughter[ing] Palestinians every single day in Gaza and the Occupied territories.” These are just a few of her credits.

Fithian is known for her statement: “create crisis, because crisis is that edge where change is possible.” Sound familiar? It should, it is straight out of Holder’s and Obama’s playbook, as well as Marxism in general. Fithian was a lead organizer in the infamous 1999 Seattle riots against the World Trade Organization that devolved into violence. She is known for teaching violent tactics as well as community organizing. She specializes in aggressive “direct action” tactics. Fithian previously provided training and support for the controversial ACORN group, National People’s Action, the new version of the Students for a Democratic Society and other radical organizations. She trained somewhere around 600 protesters for Ferguson.

The following video shows anti-capitalist radical Lisa Fithian training Chicago union teachers on how to stage their arrests for the camera in 2011:

Fithian is far from alone in her Revolution organizing. She is joined by the likes of Code Pink, RevCom, the New Black Panthers, Socialist Party USA, etc. The ACLU has been in the mix from the beginning as well, along with SEIU. The UN also became involved, along with national LGBT organizations, climate environmentalists, amnesty groups, pro-Palestinian organizations, Christian social justice groups and Planned Parenthood.

LGBT organizations represented include the Human Rights Campaign, Lambda Legal, National Black Justice Coalition, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Center for Transgender Equality, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund, National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance, National Center for Lesbian Rights Action Fund and PFLAG National.

Amnesty International sent a “13-person human rights delegation” to the town to “examine” potential human rights abuses, in what they refer to as an “unprecedented” move by deploying in the United States. Many other groups joined in, such as Tauheed Youth Development Life, the Organization for Black Struggle (OBS), the Moorish Science Temple, the Coalition Against Police Crimes and Repression and the Universal African Peoples Organization (UAPO). No radical party would ever be complete without the Socialist Workers Party as well.

Pro-Palestinian groups included: St. Louis Palestine Solidarity Committee, Organization for Black Struggle, U.S. Palestinian Community Network, Muslims for Ferguson, US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, Council on American Islamic Relations – St. Louis, Palestinian BDS National Committee, National Students for Justice in Palestine, Palestinian Youth Movement, American Muslims for Palestine and African Americans for Justice in the Middle East and North Africa.

In reality, there was a great presence at the riots by those such as the Nation of Islam, the New Black Panthers, CAIR and a whole host of Jihadists and their supporters – including ISIS. Walid Shoebat is correct when he states that radical Islamists want to weaken and demilitarize the police. They are promoting Jihad in our streets and Ferguson is the perfect environment for their message. Even Iran’s Ayatollah got into the act.

From Walid Shoebat via Fox News:

Muslim groups have stepped up efforts to co-opt protests over the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., with a drive to equate the teen’s death to the death of a radical Islamist shot during an FBI raid in 2009, a Washington-based security watchdog group is warning. Using social media, conference calling and traditional outreach methods, leaders of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) are portraying Brown and Detroit mosque leader Imam Luqman Ameen Abdullah as African-American victims of police targeting, according to the Washington-based Center for Security Policy (CSP). In a conference call organized by CAIR-linked “Muslims for Ferguson, a CAIR official called Abdullah a “Shaheed,” or martyr, and said both he and Brown were victims of a national security apparatus that had “completely gone wild” and engaged in “demonizing and criminalizing Muslims.” “The reality is that this country, in law enforcement, be it local, state or federal law enforcement, people with guns have always seen black men and black people as threats,” Dawud Walid, executive director of CAIR’s Michigan Chapter, told the some 100 protest organizers on the call, made on the five-year anniversary of Abdullah’s death and which was monitored by CSP. Walid claimed Brown was a Muslim, although when pressed, Walid denied he had made such a claim. Brown was buried in August after a memorial service at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis.

Also from Shoebat, he states that another Muslim activist behind the Ferguson chaos wrote that Muslims, including CAIR have been involved since the beginning of this controversy:

From day one, Muslims have been on the ground in Ferguson. The Facebook group Muslims for Ferguson and other efforts were just later manifestations of what was already happening. Muslims were in Ferguson first and foremost because we live in the community like everyone else and are concerned about its well-being. Along with Brothers Anthony Merrill and Naji Fakhrid-deen Adams, I was on the ground in Ferguson on the first night. I grew up in the area and have been talking about issues of violence and policing and surrounding economic issues for years. For me, it was a no-brainer to stand in solidarity with those protesting in the streets. Brother Anthony also grew up in the area and has been vocal on local issues for years. Brother Naji is a reformed East St. Louis gang leader and substance-abuse counselor who works in the community every day. Talal Ahmad was also on the ground from day one. A native of the O’Fallon Park Neighborhood in North St. Louis living in Jennings Brother Talal is a local independent-journalist who emerged as a protest leader with the group Tribe X. Brother Talal was instrumental in the successful occupation and subsequent negotiations with St. Louis University. Brother Anthony Shahid of the Tawheed Youth Group and Masjid Tawheed is a long time St. Louis activist and veteran of the African-American struggle for justice. Brother Shahid was on the ground from day one and played a pivotal-role as a peacekeeper. Missouri State Senator Jamillah Nasheed and her aide Eric Vickers, both Muslim, have also been mainstays at the protests. Ministers Donald and Akbar Muhammad, members of the Fruit of Islam security, and the Final Call News and others components of the Nation of Islam have also been active on the ground as have members of the Moorish Science Temple. Mustafa Abdullah of the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri has not only been active on the ground he has taken local police to court over the “5 second rule” and other egregious abuses of civil-liberties. Faizan Syed, director of the St. Louis Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations along with community-activist and Hafiz Abdul-Basit Syed, have also been of assistance to activists starting at an early date.

Muhammad Sankari, a youth organizer with the Chicago-based Arab American Action Network, argued that black and Latino minorities should look to Muslims as the “gatekeepers of policing” in the United States because anti-terrorism efforts had provided police with greater arsenals that, he claimed, were now being turned on those communities. He said “justice” could only be found “in the streets,” and not in “marble halls and marble buildings.” Muslims are looking to cause conflict to justify instituting Shariah Law state by state, city by city across the US.

And there were others of the communist variety at the riots. One of the protest leaders was Michael McPhearson. Just like Lisa Fithian, McPhearson has connections to CPUSA and United for Peace and Justice. McPhearson is the co-chair of the Don’t Shoot Coalition and addressed the crowd together with Julia Ho, a community organizer with Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment.

Then we have Maria Chapelle-Nadal who was elected to the Senate to succeed fellow Democrat Rita Heard Days of St. Louis. Chapelle-Nadal has numerous ties to CPUSA. Communist Party USA affiliate, Julie Terbrock was a Legislative Assistant to Representative Maria Chappelle-Nadal. John L. Bowman, another CPUSA affiliate, ran her campaign to be elected as well. Chapelle-Nadal also attended the Missouri Communist Party USA’s Friends of the People’s World when they hosted their 18th annual ‘Hershel Walker Peace and Justice Awards Breakfast’ on Saturday, May 8th, 2010. You might recall Nadal as the one who said Missouri was now in a race war after the Grand Jury announcement came down.

You have the race hustlers Jesse Jackson and especially, Al Sharpton. Sharpton was a great instigator in all this, stirring up the family of Michael Brown and the protesters wherever he could. He also claims to be a personal adviser to Barack Obama.

Which brings us to Governor Nixon and Valerie Jarrett. Nixon loudly and publicly proclaimed that there was no government influence on the National Guard not showing up the first night of the riots as businesses burned and were looted, and police cars were rocked and set on fire. Nixon let the city burn as directed by Jarrett and the Obama Administration. It is acknowledged by the White House that Valerie Jarrett and Nixon were in close contact for the first 24 hours of the violent protests. It’s not hard to see who called the shots there.

Doug Ross has this to share on Jarrett:

Iranian born Valerie Jarrett is more of a President than Obama is and she is an enemy within through and through. Digging all the way down to who is behind the Fergusion riots, you find a cadre of communists, radicals, Islamists, Progressives and in the end, the face behind the chaos is the Muslim Brotherhood-connected visage of the President’s consigliere – the voice of Iran and a devout Marxist, Valerie Jarrett.","2014-11-30 19:34:04","1","56.0","19.0","15.0","1.0","23.0","0.0","162.0","97.0","0.0","87.0","0.0","6.0","0","1804","95.50","76.44","13.61","37.54","20.50","29.27","74.67","42.18","5.16","2.38","0.17","0.33","0.17","1.22","0.50","2.72","8.81","15.08","6.15","2.49","6.26","0.55","9.59","4.55","1.88","1.00","1.83","1.72","4.16","2.33","1.66","0.33","0.94","0.06","8.59","0.55","0.44","0.89","1.05","4.71","1.05","1.11","0.33","0.61","0.67","1.16","2.22","1.33","0.39","0.39","0.89","0.28","0.22","0.28","0.11","10.03","4.05","1.33","4.43","0.50","0.50","4.43","4.21","0.22","13.58","1.44","9.15","2.99","5.38","0.72","0.22","0.39","2.27","0.44","0.55","0.00","0.22","0.00","0.33","0.00","16.08","5.04","5.43","0.33","0.00","0.06","0.00","1.72","1.88","0.78","0.67","0.17","9067","8.49","25.23611111111111","2827","1773","87","50.77","13.2","11.2","13.46","13.7","431","6.357142857142857","19.883632261703326","789","21.94","40","0.4","0","73","28","176","2","242","109","2","1","6","188","487","9","95","3","0","37","11","52","0","1","5","28","0","19","69","30","51","29","43","3","10","0","5"
"http://gulagbound.com/48186/10-major-takeaways-from-the-house-benghazi-report-that-the-media-is-completely-ignoring/","10 Major Takeaways from the House Benghazi Report the Media is Completely Ignoring","By: Benjamin Weingarten

The Blaze

To hear the media tell it in the wake of the release of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) Final Benghazi Report, the Republican-led efforts to get to the bottom of the attack were an utter waste of time — there was no foul play that precipitated and no conspiracy that followed the attacks, and the investigation of Benghazi was simply a crazed right-wing political witch hunt.

When there is a unanimous conclusion among mainstream media sources on a subject — especially when it would have been impracticable given the speed of such reaction for the media to have actually consumed such a report and several hundred pages of supporting documents — it behooves others to question that narrative and dig through the documents themselves.

Having reviewed the report and documents appended to it, there are a number of damning takeaways associated with the HPSCI’s findings that the media have simply and plainly ignored in the days following the report’s release.

A word before we delve into each of these points: Given that journalism requires questioning the official line of those in power, it is interesting that members of the mainstream media would simply take at face value the material from the Committee given that:

a) It is controlled by Republicans of whom the media is generally distrustful, including its lame duck chairman who was a member of the intelligence community (IC) himself, and whose wife led a security contracting company that operated in Libya;

b) Congress may have been culpable at least tangentially with respect to any failures associated with Benghazi, and its tendency one suspects would be to cover such failures, giving HPSCI members reason to conclude there was no wrongdoing (never mind the chilling effect of the recently reported CIA’s efforts to spy on Congressional intelligence investigators to begin with); and

c) The press has been ever-critical and skeptical of the CIA and other members of the IC historically, yet uncritically accepts the veracity of findings that absolve the IC of any substantive failures, primarily beyond poorly written talking points.

What follows are the 10 major takeaways from the report that the media is ignoring:

1) The report primarily absolves the IC of failure and wrongdoing, not the State Department, Department of Defense or executive branch

2) There was no intelligence failure, if you consider finding no evidence of a potential attack a success

3) The failures of Benghazi in fact lay squarely at the feet of the State Department, according to the report

4) The report attempts to deny U.S. facilitation of weapons transfers from Libya to Syria via Benghazi, but leaves a significant amount of yet unquestioned wiggle room

5) The report continues to say that President Obama referred to Benghazi as a terrorist attack from the very beginning, on Sept. 12, 2012 in the Rose Garden

6) The government acknowledges that there was never an extraction strategy for our personnel on the ground in Benghazi in the event of an attack

7) Former Deputy CIA Director Mike Morell edited the talking points parroted publicly by Susan Rice following the attack, in a politically correct fashion, apparently so as to not offend/incite Muslims

8) The HPSCI majority members assert that the Obama administration has treated the investigation of the attack as a criminal, not counterterrorism matter, to the detriment of efforts to track down Benghazi suspects

9) James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, in testimony, continued to partially attribute the attacks in Benghazi to a YouTube video, and argues that there is “linkage” to the event with the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo Egypt; HPSCI member Democrats also continue to attribute the attacks in part potentially to a YouTube video

10) The primary lesson the CIA learned from the Benghazi attack was…not to release unclassified talking points

Here are the explanations:



1) The report primarily absolves the IC of failure and wrongdoing, NOT the State Department, Department of Defense or executive branch

This is a massive disclaimer that has largely been overlooked. The HPSCI report certainly takes into account testimony and evidence from those in government agencies outside of the CIA, FBI and plethora of other groups that comprise the IC, as indicated for example in appended testimony from Patrick Kennedy, under secretary of state for management at the State Department, but it does not reflect an extensive investigation into the various public figures in the Benghazi attack from other agencies. In multiple instances, the report specifically notes that there are unanswered questions that the committee hopes will be addressed in separate investigations.

If you take all of the report’s findings at face value, then the best assessment one can make is that it largely defends the actions before, during and after the attack on Benghazi of U.S. intelligence, and intelligence alone. Which leads to the second major ignored finding.



2) There was no intelligence failure, if you consider finding no evidence of a potential attack a success; 3) the failures of Benghazi in fact lay squarely at the feet of the State Department, according to the report

The Benghazi report states that “there was no intelligence failure prior to the attacks.”

It supports this assertion with the following statement:

The way this portion of the report reads, the CIA feels that because the IC did not obtain intelligence indicating the potential for an attack, and could not have collected intelligence to prevent the attacks, they are free from blame in what occurred.

On its face, this seems like somewhat of a flimsy argument given that the attacks occurred and certainly at the very least reflected a degree of serious sophistication given the highly accurate mortar shelling for example that took place at the CIA Annex in the second-wave attack that occurred in Benghazi.

The report argues throughout that the attacks were not pre-meditated or planned, and rather represented an “off-the-shelf” operation.

It further seeks to absolve the IC by noting the numerous warnings that the IC provided in the months prior to the Benghazi attack on the deteriorating security situation in the country:

This is awfully favorable towards the IC, and the report, as you will see in the following excerpt, seems to lay the blame almost squarely at the feet of the State Department:

The House majority adds in an appended statement:

Given the HPSCI’s clear favorable view of the IC, and conversely their criticism of the State Department, one would think that the media would highlight this aspect of the report. It also behooves them to question such a seemingly black-and-white conclusion.



4) The report attempts to deny U.S. facilitation of weapons transfers from Libya to Syria via Benghazi, but leaves a significant amount of yet unquestioned wiggle room

Note that nowhere in the report does the House Intelligence Committee define what “unauthorized activities” consist of.

The report continues:

Note that this finding specifically refers to the collection and facilitation of weapons shipments at the CIA Annex. Does this rule out that the CIA might not have facilitated arms sales “indirectly” through third-party “cut outs?” Would such activities qualify as “authorized activities?” Would such activities have to be disclosed publicly?

Consider what investigative journalist Seymour Hersh (himself no Tea Partier, in fact quite the opposite), wrote in a bombshell April 2014 article in the London Review of Books [emphasis ours]:

A highly classified annex to the report [a Senate Intelligence Committee report from January 2014], not made public, described a secret agreement reached in early 2012 between the Obama and Erdo?an administrations. It pertained to the rat line [a back channel developed in this case to transfer weapons to Syria]. By the terms of the agreement, funding came from Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar; the CIA, with the support of MI6, was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi’s arsenals into Syria. A number of front companies were set up in Libya, some under the cover of Australian entities. Retired American soldiers, who didn’t always know who was really employing them, were hired to manage procurement and shipping. The operation was run by David Petraeus, the CIA director who would soon resign when it became known he was having an affair with his biographer. (A spokesperson for Petraeus denied the operation ever took place.)

Hersh continues [emphasis ours]:

The operation had not been disclosed at the time it was set up to the congressional intelligence committees and the congressional leadership, as required by law since the 1970s. The involvement of MI6 enabled the CIA to evade the law by classifying the mission as a liaison operation. The former intelligence official [one of Hersh’s primary sources] explained that for years there has been a recognised exception in the law that permits the CIA not to report liaison activity to Congress, which would otherwise be owed a finding. (All proposed CIA covert operations must be described in a written document, known as a ‘finding’, submitted to the senior leadership of Congress for approval.) Distribution of the annex was limited to the staff aides who wrote the report and to the eight ranking members of Congress – the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate, and the Democratic and Republicans leaders on the House and Senate intelligence committees. This hardly constituted a genuine attempt at oversight: the eight leaders are not known to gather together to raise questions or discuss the secret information they receive. …‘The consulate’s only mission was to provide cover for the moving of arms,’ the former intelligence official, who has read the annex, said. ‘It had no real political role.’

Ken Timmerman, author of “Dark Forces,” with whom we spoke earlier this year on Benghazi, agrees with Seymour Hersh’s assessment, telling us recently via e-mail: “In the Benghazi-to-Syria transfers, CIA most likely operated under existing Global War on Terrorism findings and more generally under cover of ‘liaison’ operations which are not considered U.S. Covert ops.”

In testimony from a HPSCI hearing on November 15, 2012, appended to the full report, former Deputy CIA Director Mike Morell tells us:

In later testimony on May 22, 2013, in front of the HPSCI, Morell gives us some additional information on weapons transfers:

Again, questions remain.

Would a “rat line” to the degree to which there was one need to be disclosed? Were Americans supporting the activities of other nations carrying out weapons transfers to Syria, or truly solely collecting intelligence on such activities? How does the HPSCI and the officials it interviewed define “facilitation” of weapons transfers — and would indirect coordination/planning fall under such a definition?

These questions have not been asked nor answered.



5) The report continues to say that President Obama referred to Benghazi as a terrorist attack from the very beginning, on Sept. 12, 2012 in the Rose Garden

As discussed with Sharyl Attkisson in a recent interview, the Obama administration, with the help of a compliant media, sought to portray the president as classifying what occurred in Benghazi as a terrorist attack from the very beginning of the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2012. The president’s use of the phrase “acts of terror” on Sept. 12, 2012 in the Rose Garden was not made in context of Benghazi.

The report nonetheless backs the president’s narrative:

In an interview with Steve Kroft on Sept. 12, 2012 from the Rose Garden, critical portions of which CBS sat on while reporting on the Benghazi attack, Obama directly acknowledges that he did not refer to the Benghazi attack as a terrorist attack that very day:

Kroft Mr. President, this morning you went out of your way to avoid the use of the word terrorism in connection with the Libya attack. Obama Right.

It bears noting that even the Washington Post’s fact-checker believes the president misled the public regarding his statements following the attack, giving the president’s claim that he called Benghazi “an act of terrorism” “Four Pinocchios,” its worst rating in terms of truthfulness. The Post’s report states:

Perhaps Obama, in his mind, thought this [Benghazi] then was really “an act of war,” not a traditional terrorist attack, but he had not wanted to say that publicly. Or perhaps, as Republicans suggest, he did not want to spoil his campaign theme that terror groups such as al-Qaeda were on the run by conceding a terrorist attack had occurred on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Whatever the reason, when given repeated opportunities to forthrightly declare this was an “act of terrorism,” the president ducked the question. …the president’s claim that he said “act of terrorism” is taking revisionist history too far, given that he repeatedly refused to commit to that phrase when asked directly by reporters in the weeks after the attack. He appears to have gone out of his way to avoid saying it was a terrorist attack, so he has little standing to make that claim now.



6) The government acknowledges that there was never an exfiltration strategy for our personnel on the ground in Benghazi in the event of an attack

In a portion of the Benghazi report that has garnered zero media attention to date, it reads:



7) Former Deputy CIA Director Mike Morell edited the talking points in a politically correct fashion, parroted publicly by Susan Rice following the attack, apparently so as to not offend/incite Muslims

The HPSCI additional views proffered by majority members of the panel reads:



8) The HPSCI majority members assert that the Obama administration has treated the investigation of the attack as a criminal, not counterterrorism matter, to the detriment of efforts to track down Benghazi suspects

The relevant portion of the majority additional views report reads, consistent with Obama administration policy as implemented by outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder:



9) James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, in testimony, continued to partially attribute the attacks in Benghazi to a YouTube video, and argues that there is “linkage” to the event with the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo Egypt; HPSCI member Democrats also continue to attribute the attacks in part potentially to a YouTube video

Here is the relevant text from James Clapper’s testimony on November 15, 2012:

And here is the relevant text which echoes Clapper’s testimony from House Democrats on the HPSCI:

One wonders, is Mr. Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, still of the belief that we can attribute this attack to a YouTube video? Is it really reasonable to attribute an attack to “linkage” with events in Cairo?

New Zeal

The world communist press has been pushing an American/Iranian “rapprochement” for some time now.

Navid Shomali, secretary of Iran’s communist Tudeh Party’s international department, recently wrote:

The Tudeh Party of Iran supports any lowering of tension between the U.S. and Iran. It has called for years for all disputes to be resolved by negotiation in accordance with international law.

Savvy commentators like Washington DC based Michael Ledeen have been warning of President Obama’s plans for nothing less than a full fledged US/Iran alliance.

Now comes further indication of the President’s intentions, from one of the Communist Party USA‘s best friends in Congress, Washington State Rep. Jim McDermott. Long tied to the Washington Communist Party, identities such as Pat Stell and the late Will Parry, McDermott is a very reliable guide to communist thinking and strategy.

I’ve always said that if you want to know what long time Communist Party “friend” Barack Obama will do tomorrow – read the communist press today.

In a recent speech on the floor of Congress, published in full, in the Communist Party’s Peoples World, Rep. McDermott lays out the communist agenda, selling points towards a US/Iranian detente and an eventual formal alliance.

Mr. Speaker: I rise this morning on what could be the eve of a nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran, as U.S., European, and Iranian negotiators head back to Vienna for a final round of talks. With so much of the region in turmoil right now, it seems hard to imagine that we could be on the verge of arguably the most important diplomatic achievement in the Middle East in recent U.S. history. The leadership of President Obama, the tenacity of the U.S. negotiators, and the sincerity of President Rouhani and his team have set the stage for a landmark agreement that would turn the page on decades of distrust, dissension and cynicism. Here is what a nuclear deal would mean: * A profound reduction in the decades-long tension between Iran, the U.S. and our allies that had set us on a path to war. * A contained Iranian nuclear program with verifiable internationally-accepted limits. * Meaningful sanctions relief that bolsters Iran’s flagging economy and allows U.S. businesses access to a potentially vibrant market. * An opening for a broader understanding between the U.S. and Iran, as well as an opportunity to court Iran as an ally in the fight against ISIS.

Here is the bait which will be used to lure the American public onto a viciously barbed hook.

Michael Ledeen maintains that Obama has wanted an alliance with Iran since the beginning of his first term of office. Obama would know that it would take something pretty dramatic to get the American public to swallow such a repugnant policy reversal.

To accept Iran, the public would have to be conditioned to fear something even worse.

It is known that Obama knew about ISIS for months and did nothing until they gathered so much strength and committed so many atrocities that he could no longer ignore them.

Now with horrific mass killings and brutal filmed beheadings, much of the American public believes that a ragtag army of Islamist extremists is public enemy number one. Not to diminish the threat from ISIS in any way, but what about Russia and its 8,500 nukes, China with its rapidly growing political, economic and military power, and an almost nuclear capable Iran? The focus is now all on ISIS – a threat that the president was at least negligent in allowing to grow.

Did the President deliberately allow ISIS to get out of hand in order to gull the American public into accepting an alliance with their former sworn enemy, Iran?

Is Obama deliberately exploiting the “Isis Crisis” in order to create the unholiest of unholy alliances?

Was ISIS allowed to grow unchecked, so that Obama could hold out his hand in friendship to a sworn enemy of liberty and American values? To a nation that still plans to annihilate America’s only real real friend in the Middle East, Israel?

I suspect that President Obama does not plan to let the “Isis Crisis” go to waste.","2014-11-24 08:36:50","1","42.0","18.0","15.0","0.0","24.0","0.0","128.0","97.0","0.0","88.0","0.0","6.0","0","709","96.89","75.53","16.82","30.54","23.63","24.26","78.00","43.86","6.21","2.26","0.42","0.71","0.14","0.56","0.42","3.95","9.73","15.94","5.78","3.10","4.23","0.71","10.58","4.80","2.96","0.71","1.55","1.69","6.21","3.24","2.96","0.85","1.83","0.14","8.04","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.56","8.18","2.40","1.27","1.69","1.55","0.85","0.85","1.27","0.14","0.42","0.85","0.56","0.42","0.00","0.00","0.14","11.57","4.51","2.12","4.09","0.99","0.99","2.26","6.49","1.27","13.82","1.13","8.32","4.37","4.23","1.69","0.00","0.71","0.28","0.42","0.56","0.00","0.42","0.00","0.14","0.00","14.67","5.64","4.09","0.42","0.00","0.71","0.00","0.28","1.27","1.13","0.00","1.13","3362","8.23","25.857142857142858","1071","704","34","58.92","13.2","10.2","11.6","12.4","159","13.0","19.314090909090908","373","23.43","29","0.43","0","19","10","74","1","96","60","3","3","11","106","122","0","26","1","0","14","7","34","0","1","2","26","0","32","18","7","14","10","19","4","4","0","0"

Accuracy in Media

Editor’s Note: By Roger Aronoff

The report released last Friday on the September 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has once again brought to the surface this story that will not go away. Not, certainly, until those responsible are held accountable, and a truthful and accurate version of events and motivations in the months and days leading up to this tragic chapter in American history has been established.

The media embraced the report as bipartisan vindication of what the Obama administration has argued: Namely that yes, mistakes were made, we did everything we could to protect our people, and have put into place remedies, and changes in policies, so that nothing like this happens again. But the evidence and the testimony say otherwise.

Accuracy in Media took the lead in creating the Citizens’ Commission on Benghazi (CCB) in 2013 primarily to hold the Obama administration accountable—but also Congress and the media—and to do our own independent investigation. Clare Lopez, formerly a CIA officer for 20 years, and a member of the CCB, has written this rebuttal to the just-released House Intelligence report. There is even more in the Benghazi story that deserves scrutiny and explanation, such as the dereliction of duty in the failure to deploy available military assets during the attacks and the failure of the State Department to provide additional security, or close the compound altogether. The new report states that its focus is on the U.S. Intelligence Community and that it “does not assess State Department or Defense Department activities other than where those activities impact, or were impacted by, the work of the intelligence community.” We have addressed those issues in the past, and will again in the future, but for now, this article should make clear that for whatever reason, the authors of the report have chosen to ignore volumes of evidence that contradict and disprove their main findings. While this article is exclusive to Accuracy in Media, please feel free to post and distribute this article by Clare Lopez.]

Debunking the House Intelligence Report on Benghazi

By Clare Lopez

House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) Chairman Mike Rogers (R-MI) and Ranking Member C.A. “Dutch” Ruppersberger (D-MD) issued a much-anticipated “Investigative Report on the Terrorist Attacks on U.S. Facilities in Benghazi, Libya, September 11-12, 2012” late on Friday November 21, 2014 that has administration supporters crowing—and eyewitness, on-the-ground operators pushing back forcefully. A close comparison of the report and other previously released information about the September 2012 attacks on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi shows that the operators have good reason to cry “foul.” While clever wording just might give Messrs. Rogers and Ruppersberger plausible deniability on a witness stand, the overall intent of the report is clear: exonerate the Intelligence Community (IC), and, by extension, the Obama administration, of responsibility for intelligence failures prior, during, and after the terrorist attack that took the lives of Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Foreign Service Information Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Glenn Doherty and Tyrone Woods.

In simple terms, this report is a whitewash of the CIA, which, along with the State Department, was responsible for arming and assisting the very jihadist militia groups that rose to power in the first place during the 2011 rebellion against Muammar Qaddafi, and who later murdered our people in Benghazi. The biggest intelligence failure of all that is never mentioned is the failure to understand the essential hostility of the jihadist ideology of the groups with which our government was dealing.

One of the most riveting revelations from members of the CIA security team who were at the Annex the night of 11-12 September, 2012 concerns the repeated refusal of CIA Chief of Base ‘Bob’ to allow them to go to the rescue of the besieged Americans at the Special Mission Compound (SMC). While the Rogers report is adamant that “…the Committee found no evidence that there was either a stand down order or a denial of available air support,” that statement is directly contradicted by accounts of events from Mark “Oz” Geist, Kris “Tanto” Paranto, and John “Tig” Tiegen. These three members of the Annex security team are co-authors of “13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi,” and have spoken out publicly in multiple media appearances. The Rogers Committee interviewed all three of them, as well as additional members of the Annex staff, so there’s no question about its familiarity with the actual sequence of events that fateful night.

According to Oz, Tanto, and Tig, COB “Bob” specifically used the words “Stand down” and also “Hold up” and “You need to wait” to keep security team members from going to the aid of fellow Americans under terrorist assault at the SMC. Despite repeated and increasingly panicked calls from the SMC, “Bob” refused to allow the Annex security team to depart that compound for nearly half an hour after the first alarm came in—a delay team members firmly believe resulted in the needless deaths of Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith. While “Bob’s” motivations may be debated—concern for the Annex’s own security, and the supposed responsibility of the jihadist 17 February Martyrs Brigade to defend the SMC—the Rogers Committee had a solemn responsibility to report truthfully about events as they happened. In this instance, the HPSCI report failed that responsibility.

Oversight and review of actions by the Intelligence Community constitute the primary mission of the HPSCI. The Rogers report devotes considerable attention and effort to conveying the impression that there was insufficient, or insufficiently specific, warning of an impending attack against the U.S. Mission in Benghazi. Unfortunately again, on multiple counts, this impression is an inaccurate one. The Rogers report Executive Summary on page 2 states that the “Committee finds that there was no intelligence failure prior to the attacks….IC provided intelligence about previous attacks and the increased threat environment in Benghazi, but the IC did not have specific, tactical warning of the September 11 attacks.” The careful wording of this claim may be technically accurate, but it is a far cry from being fully truthful about what the IC knew or should have known in the days and hours leading up to the attacks. Once again, a misleading conclusion is conveyed that whitewashes the IC performance, which was, in fact, lacking on a number of counts.

Congressional and media reporting alike confirm that prior intelligence reporting did detail earlier al-Qa’eda-linked terrorist attacks against other Western targets in and around Benghazi, as well as against the U.S. Mission itself. The implication left with the reader is that the State Department, whose activities the Rogers report does not assess (“other than where those activities impact, or were impacted by, the work of the intelligence community”), was responsible not only for the failure to properly secure its SMC facility, but for the fact that Amb. Stevens was in Benghazi at all on such a momentous date for Islamic terrorists—especially given the local security situation, which was known to both him and the State Department.

At least two glaring intelligence failures do stand out, though. The first is the IC failure to warn either the Annex or Special Mission Compound personnel that between September 9th and 11th 2012, Muslim anger in Egypt and the broader Muslim world began to boil over on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter over the “Innocence of Muslims” YouTube video about the ife of Muhammad. The book 13 Hours notes that it was left to Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) Greg Hicks at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli to sound the alarm on September 11, 2012 with a text message to Ambassador Stevens to let him know that the U.S. Embassy in Cairo was under assault by violent demonstrators who had breached the perimeter wall and torn down the American flag. A communications officer at the SMC later telephoned the CIA Annex to convey the same information to them. The question left dangling is why it was the State Department that had to pass breaking real-time threat information to the CIA in Benghazi, when the gathering Islamic anger had been trending openly on social media sites for two whole days. In the end, of course, there were absolutely zero demonstrations or protests in Benghazi or Libya as a whole about that video, but Annex security team members have confirmed they knew nothing in advance about either the video or the online storm it generated. Given that it was their core responsibility to provide security protection to the Annex and its CIA operatives, the IC failure to ensure that they knew this information in a timely fashion left a gap in their overall situational awareness, even though their professional readiness posture to react on a 24/7 basis may not have suffered in any significant way.

The second intelligence failure involves the video that actually did matter in Benghazi: the videotaped message from al-Qa’eda (AQ) chief Ayman al-Zawahiri that went up on jihadist websites on September 10, 2012 and, in retrospect, seems obviously to have been the green light signal for the attack. Al-Zawahiri’s message called specifically on Libyans to rise up and attack Americans as revenge for the CIA drone killing of his Libyan deputy, Abu Yahya al-Libi, a few months earlier. Annex security members have confirmed they knew nothing about what should have been a red alert to the entire U.S. Mission in Benghazi. It should be noted here that even though Annex security team members were not privy to all incoming IC intel reporting, but instead were briefed by the Team Lead (a CIA case officer), they were responsible for protecting Annex and its CIA personnel. An earlier intelligence report, for example, is described on page 51 of the 13 Hours account as being extremely specific about a warning that “a Western facility or U.S. Embassy/Consulate/Government target will be attacked in the next week.” That one was considered so important that Tyrone “Rone” Woods taped a copy of it up on a white board in the security team room at the Annex, and each member of the team over the following days signed his initials to show that he’d read it. According to the book, once everyone had signed, Tanto took the report down and shredded it…on September 11, 2012.

This report got everyone’s attention (at the Annex at least), but when the commander of AQ issued an attack order that was at least equally as specific to the U.S. Mission in Benghazi, inexplicably, the IC was oblivious. This must be counted as an egregious intelligence failure and should have been identified as such in the Rogers report.

Next, on the question of the identities of the terrorist attackers, the Rogers report once again conveys a very inaccurate impression. The report’s Executive Summary says “…Committee finds that a mixed group of individuals, including those affiliated with Al-Qa’ida, participated in the attacks….although the Committee finds that the intelligence was and remains conflicting about the identities, affiliations, and motivations of the attackers.”

In light of all the threat information about al-Qa’eda, the AQ-linked Ansar al-Shariah, and jihadist 17 February Martyrs Brigade SMC guards that was abundantly available to the entire Benghazi mission, both at the Annex and the SMC, the identity of the Benghazi assault teams hardly could have been in doubt. But even if it’s conceded that the attackers included individuals from a number of different local militias, everyone in Benghazi knew, or should have known, that they were all jihadis, aka AQ affiliates. And while of late it has become unfashionable, not to mention career-threatening, within the U.S. government to mention the jihadist ideology of America’s terrorist enemies, those on the ground in harm’s way don’t have the luxury of such denial. Those in Benghazi on the night of 11-12 September 2012 knew immediately who was attacking them and reported that information up their respective chains-of-command.

There was plenty of other information available—both immediately and within days of the attack. For one thing, the closed circuit TV (CCTV) cameras mounted on the exterior of Annex and SMC buildings not only recorded for the permanent record, but live-streamed events on the ground as they were happening. That live-stream video would have been seen by dozens of U.S. government officials across the IC that night. Everyone watching knew the attackers were Islamic terrorists, well-organized, well-prepared, and well-trained for that assault. For whatever reason, however, the Annex security team members were never allowed to view this CCTV footage.

An additional and critical piece of information is revealed on page 185 of 13 Hours in Benghazi, where Tanto recalls that a member of the 17th February Martyrs Brigade handed him a Blackberry cell phone that had been recovered “outside the front of the villa” (meaning the SMC). Tanto gave the cell phone to COB “Bob” after he and other team members returned to the Annex. This phone more than likely belonged to one of the attackers. The forensic exploitation of its contents would have been completed with speed and urgency, very likely providing the Intelligence Community with a great deal of information about the entire Benghazi-based network of AQ, Ansar al-Shariah, and AQIM terrorists involved in the mission attack within days, if not hours.

Finally, the Associated Press (AP) published an excellent piece of investigative journalism on October 27th, 2012. AP reporters had gone to Benghazi and interviewed the SMC’s neighbors. Their report clearly states that the local eyewitnesses identified the attackers as Ansar al-Shariah by the logos on their trucks as they set up roadblocks around the compound prior to the attack. Obviously, if wire service reporters could get this information, Benghazi CIA officers should have acquired and reported it, too. If they did not, then that too is an intelligence failure.

The next critical element of the Rogers report that needs scrutiny involves the weapons shipments that were sent from Benghazi to Turkey for overland delivery to the Syrian al-Qa’eda-and-Muslim-Brotherhood-linked rebels fighting there against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. The relevant passage from the Rogers Executive Summary reads: “…the Committee also found no evidence that the CIA conducted unauthorized activities in Benghazi and no evidence that the IC shipped arms to Syria.” Once again, wording is everything.

According to an August 2012 report from CNN, President Obama signed an Intelligence Finding to authorize clandestine support for Syrian rebels by the CIA and other agencies sometime in early 2012. The same CNN report says that an earlier Finding was signed in 2011 to authorize CIA support to the Libyan rebels. Such Findings carry a great deal of legal weight and likely trump the U.S. Criminal Code ban on providing material support to terrorism. So, even if the IC had been providing arms, funding, intelligence, and other support to AQ in Libya in 2011 and later, in Syria in 2012, it wasn’t, strictly speaking, “unauthorized.”

Furthermore, the Rogers report itself reproduces a question-and-answer session before the HPSCI that featured testimony from Acting CIA Director Mike Morell. On page 87 of the report, Morell plainly admits that arms were leaving Benghazi and going to Syria. Sections of the exchange are redacted, but the clear implication is that the Turks were involved as middlemen in the movement of weapons from Libya destined for the Syrian rebels. Morell’s testimony tried to give HPSCI member Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) the impression that the only CIA role in this gun-running was monitoring that movement, not participating in it. At this point in the session, however, HPSCI Chairman Rogers intervened to shut the conversation down from going any further.

Fox News reporter Catherine Herridge shed further light on the shipment of weapons destined for the Syrian rebels out of Libya by way of Turkey with an important 25 October 2012 story in which she revealed that the Libyan-flagged ship, the “Al-Entisar,” reportedly loaded with weapons from Libya, had been docked in the Turkish port of Iskanderun on September 6th, 2012. Readers will recall that Ambassador Stevens’ last meeting, a mere five days later, on September 11th, was with the Turkish Consul General in Benghazi. Semantics again: the ships didn’t dock in Syria, they docked in Turkey. So, the Rogers report technically can say that the arms shipments didn’t go to Syria—even though Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier had seemed shocked during her own Congressional testimony at the suggestion that Libyan weapons shipments might have been going, precisely, to Turkey. Technically once again, it might be said that she knew perfectly well the weapons were destined ultimately for delivery in Syria, not Turkey. In any case, someone needs to reconcile these accounts.

Finally, lending some measure of credence to CIA denials of involvement in the Libya-Turkey-Syria gun-running operation is the State Department’s own in-house magazine, which in its December 2011 issue, describes how Stevens and the Libyan Muslim-Brotherhood-led Transitional National Council worked together and “launched the U.S. government’s cooperative program with the council to collect dangerous weapons such as shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles.” So, it seems possible that the Libya-Syria gun-running operation was directed by the State Department after all. Outstanding questions for the Select Committee on Benghazi might include how many of these so-called MANPADS were collected, by whom, stored where, and how they were shipped out of Benghazi.

To sum up, then, the November 21, 2014 Rogers report on the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi leaves far too many misperceptions to go unchallenged. From IC warnings about the impending attack, to the unambiguous COB “Stand Down” order to the Annex security team, to the AQ terrorist identity of the attackers, and finally to the gun-running operation itself, there is still a great deal to be investigated here. The Citizens’ Commission on Benghazi—which issued our own Interim Report last April—calls on Rep. Trey Gowdy and the entire Select Committee on Benghazi to keep investigating this tragic fiasco until there is full accountability and as much transparency as possible for the American people—and especially, for the families of those who gave their lives in Benghazi.","2014-11-25 13:07:55","1","45.0","17.0","15.0","0.0","22.0","0.0","138.0","98.0","0.0","92.0","0.0","6.0","0","3105","95.62","60.30","28.64","9.52","32.34","27.38","75.72","45.41","6.63","1.35","0.00","0.26","0.03","0.32","0.74","5.28","10.14","15.39","5.41","3.83","5.31","0.90","9.18","3.45","1.90","0.97","2.54","1.45","6.15","2.42","3.74","0.64","2.09","0.64","5.83","0.10","0.10","0.10","0.32","9.47","2.67","1.13","0.77","1.64","1.87","2.61","1.29","0.81","0.39","0.10","0.61","0.23","0.32","0.00","0.03","8.70","2.16","1.61","4.61","0.39","1.64","4.41","3.64","0.84","13.43","1.32","7.41","4.64","5.44","1.13","0.26","0.52","0.52","0.10","0.45","0.00","0.19","0.06","0.19","0.00","15.97","4.35","5.70","0.26","0.00","0.00","0.00","1.80","1.84","0.90","0.97","0.16","15411","8.15","36.92941176470588","4850","3025","112","44.07","15.2","13.8","13.64","16.9","608","16.333333333333332","20.839669421487606","1054","31.66","110","0.44","0","110","70","367","0","431","198","5","4","25","425","507","12","157","3","0","46","22","147","2","1","13","85","1","80","137","51","85","30","67","29","10","1","10"

Potential Democratic presidential nominee Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke at the George Soros-funded Center for American Progress on Wednesday, where she assured her progressive audience that the 2014 election outcome was not a referendum against big government, rather, people are worried about “who government works for.”

She declared:

This is not about big government or small government. It’s not the size of government that worries people. Rather, it’s a concern for who government works for.

While Warren is correct that Americans realize that the federal government is no longer working for them, the size of government is a major concern for those who fund the government through their taxes.

In January, a Gallup poll reported:

One reason Americans are dissatisfied with how the government system is working is that they believe it is too big and powerful. Two-thirds of Americans (66%) are unhappy with the size and power of the federal government.

Here is a chart tracking American’s dissatisfaction with the size and power of the federal government:

Democratic politicians, who pledge an oath to the Constitution, consistently make the case for big government, despite their knowledge of the system of “limited government” as envisioned and implemented by America’s founding fathers.

While speaking of the size of government, James Madison wrote in Federalist 48:

It will not be denied that power is of an encroaching nature and that it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.

Warren continued to praise the progressive style of governance, telling her audience that strict regulations on the financial sector and “investments” in state universities, roads and bridges caused Americans to thrive, but all that was taken away when Republicans sought to deregulate “Wall Street,” which caused the 2008 economic recession.

The 2008 economic recession can be traced to disparate impact policies, and believe or not, a young Barack Obama was heavily involved in the promotion of these policies. In fact, he was “a pioneering contributor to the national subprime real estate bubble.” But Obama did not start the crisis, although he was certainly a part of it. In fact, the problems began with the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which were compounded under President Bill Clinton, and then again under President George W. Bush.

Consider an excerpt from this article foreshadowing the crisis by the author of “America’s Trillion-Dollar Housing Mistake: The Failure of American Housing Policy,” Howard Husock from 2000:

The Clinton administration has turned the Community Reinvestment Act, a once-obscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law, into one of the most powerful mandates shaping American cities—and, as Senate Banking Committee chairman Phil Gramm memorably put it, a vast extortion scheme against the nation’s banks. Under its provisions, U.S. banks have committed nearly $1 trillion for inner-city and low-income mortgages and real estate development projects, most of it funneled through a nationwide network of left-wing community groups, intent, in some cases, on teaching their low-income clients that the financial system is their enemy and, implicitly, that government, rather than their own striving, is the key to their well-being.

As reported at WayneDupree.com:

Academia, the federal government, and activist organizations pushed, pushed, pushed, pushed banks to make bad loans.

The bottom line is that banks were strong-armed by groups such as the criminal enterprise once known as ACORN to give loans to people who could not afford them. The banks sadly folded under pressure perhaps, at least initially, for fear of being referred to as “racist.” If the government was not meddling in their business, those loans would never have been given because they did not make financial sense. But banks, who knew that the loans were backed by the taxpayer-funded government sadly allowed themselves to be trampled upon, adding to their bottom lines and pushing the costs, once again, on taxpayers who believe their representatives are actually representing them. Despite the fact that they are now paying a heavy price, in addition to being the scapegoat for the 2008 recession, banks can only blame themselves.

In an incredibly revealing New York Times article from 2008, the authors did a good job of proving that the crisis was due to government policies promoted by President George W. Bush. The authors, however, forgot to mention that banks were not only under pressure by George Bush, but also by activists, academia and Democrat politicians. Instead, they blamed “lenders who peddled easy credit, consumers who took on mortgages they could not afford and Wall Street chieftains who loaded up on mortgage-backed securities without regard to the risk.”

So, to summarize, banks stupidly did what they were told in lending to those who could not afford it, then they were blamed by the people who pushed them to make the bad loans in the first place as being “predatory lenders” who caused the 2008 economic recession.

In his first inaugural address, Thomas Jefferson said:

A wise and frugal government, which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned – this is the sum of good government.

The federal government was never meant to meddle in the affairs of citizens. If not for the actions of the federal government, the 2008 recession would never have happened. Banking institutions simply would not have given loans to those who could not have afforded them.

Warren’s speech has been compared to President Obama’s infamous “You Didn’t Build That” speech, where he also invoked “roads and bridges” to assure business owners that their accomplishments could not have occurred without taxpayer dollars:

Last month, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said:

Don’t let anybody tell you that, you know, it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs.

Warren made similar comments in 2011, as reported at TheBlaze:

There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own — nobody. You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate.

Trevor Loudon writes about Elizabeth Warren’s socialist ties here, here and here.

In an essay in the Boston Gazette in October 1771, Samuel Adams wrote:

The liberties of our country, the freedom of our civil Constitution are worth defending at all hazards; and it is our duty to defend them against all attacks. We have received them as a fair inheritance from our worthy ancestors. They purchased them for us with toil, and danger, and expense of treasure and blood, and transmitted them to us with care and diligence.

It would be interesting to read some of the quotes from the founding fathers on limited government to progressive politicians for their response.

New Zeal

Communists, anarchists and anti-American radicals of every stripe are converging on Ferguson, and nearby Clayton Missouri.

The Governor of the state, Jay Nixon, has declared a state of emergency and plans to mobilize the National Guard in anticipation of an imminent grand jury announcement on the Michael Brown case.

Tensions are high in the area, as residents, businesses and police brace themselves for another round of rioting in the mainly black suburb of St. Louis.

Their fears are well founded, as seasoned protest organizers are currently training activists to close in on and “shut down” the business district of nearby Clayton on the first business day after the grand jury goes public.

The key activist to be watched is Michael McPhearson, co-chair of the Don’t Shoot Coalition.

“We, as a community of people, we aren’t going to use violent power,” remarked McPhearson in a hall meeting of about 100 in St. Louis on November. 13.

Underscoring what he felt was the importance behind the continuing actions, McPhearson said, “We’re in a struggle that takes a long time to make things happen. In order for it to be a movement, we have to stay in it.”

Julia Ho, of Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment (formerly ACORN), addressed the same meeting. She has been busy training activists in “direct action” in preparation for the looming announcements.

McPhearson’s protestations of non-violence lack credibility too, given his background and affiliations.

A field artillery officer in the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division during Desert Shield/Desert Storm, McPhearson left active duty in 1992 as a captain. Unfortunately, it’s all been downhill since then.

McPhearson became a leader of Veterans for Peace – once a Communist Party USA front, but now infiltrated by radicals from several strands of US Marxism.

In the early 2000s, another old communist front, the ACLU was moved to send a letter to the FBI on behalf of McPhearson and various “peace” and Muslim activists suggesting they had been improperly monitored by the Bureau.

This was after McPhearson had traveled to Iraq as a Veterans for Peace delegation member in December of 2003, attended an international “peace” conference in Turkey in January 2004 and then a “peace” conference in Bologna, Italy, before returning to the U.S.

McPhearson, later participated in the 2008 national convention of the Black Radical Congress, an extremist organization made up of leaders of almost every major Marxist grouping in the country.

On September 21, 2010, McPhearson attended a gathering in New York’s Warwick Hotel with then Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

After an Iranian-style dinner, the gathering moved to a conference room where representatives from various organizations spoke on the plight of people inside the United States. The displacement of African Americans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the burgeoning prison-industrial complex, conditions facing political prisoners, the crisis in U.S.-Iranian relations and the overall economic crisis dominated the discussion.

Among the individuals and organizations in attendance were many affiliates of the pro-Cuba/North Korea and Iran Workers World Party, including Cynthia McKinney, a former U.S. House of Representatives member from Georgia and the Green Party’s presidential candidate in 2008; International Action Center co-director Sara Flounders; former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark; Million Worker March Movement organizer Brenda Stokely; Shafeah M’Balia of Black Workers for Justice; Phil Wilayto of Virginia Defenders for Freedom, Justice and Equality; Larry Holmes of Bail Out the People Movement; plus Ardeshir Ommani and Eleanor Ommani, co-founders of the American-Iranian Friendship Committee; and Michael McPhearson representing the national “peace” umbrella group United for Peace and Justice.

After listening for an hour and a half to 22 different speakers, President Ahmadinejad addressed the guests for approximately 45 minutes. He touched on the international struggle for peace and justice, saying that “trying to build peace is the most important and comprehensive struggle that mankind can have.”

He added, “Those who are opposed to justice are a few, a minority.”

McPhearson also attended an anti-war forum entitled “Syria & Iran: The Next War?” which was held in New York on June 10, 2013, at the Solidarity Center. It featured anti-war veterans from the Iranian, Israeli and U.S. militaries and was organized by United for Peace and Justice, Veterans for Peace and the Communist Party controlled U.S. Peace Council.

The Workers World Party’s International Action Center hosted the meeting and IAC co-founder long time WWPer Sara Flounders chaired. The meeting was designed to coordinate pressure against a war with Iran. All the speakers, including McPhearson, were members of the Veterans for Peace Iran Working Group.

While never admitting membership of any Marxist group, McPhearson is very close to the Communist Party USA – to the point he is currently on the roster of Speak Progress, the Party’s speaker’s Bureau.

This is an honor reserved for Party members in good standing – or very close sympathizers.

Michael McPhearson believes in “peace” and “non-violence” – in the same sense Mahmoud Ahmadinejad does.

Peace, to Marxists and their radical Islamist allies means nothing short of total surrender to their agenda. Any steps necessary to achieve that state of “peace,” no matter how covert, or violent, are therefore, by definition, “peaceful.”

Missourians need to be prepared for a very intense outbreak of “peace.”","2014-11-19 06:51:21","1","43.0","8.0","15.0","0.0","25.0","0.0","138.0","95.0","0.0","82.0","0.0","6.0","0","895","98.80","75.59","24.56","61.80","23.55","31.40","73.74","39.11","3.69","1.79","0.00","0.56","0.00","0.67","0.56","1.90","9.39","16.54","4.13","1.45","4.80","0.56","7.93","5.36","2.35","0.56","2.57","2.46","5.92","3.91","2.01","0.67","0.89","0.00","7.60","0.00","0.22","0.11","0.56","4.80","1.23","0.89","0.22","1.12","0.89","0.67","2.12","0.78","1.01","0.34","0.22","0.00","0.00","0.11","0.11","11.40","3.91","2.01","5.36","0.56","0.56","3.80","4.47","1.12","15.87","2.01","9.16","4.58","4.69","1.45","0.34","0.45","0.22","0.45","0.45","0.00","0.34","0.00","0.11","0.00","19.78","5.47","6.15","0.11","0.89","0.11","0.00","1.56","3.58","1.23","0.22","0.45","4615","9.14","29.387096774193548","1452","882","41","49.65","14.6","11.7","14.62","15.2","248","11.375","21.84716553287982","487","25.29","21","0.39","0","32","21","95","0","124","67","0","0","1","123","211","6","43","1","0","15","3","25","0","1","1","22","0","15","37","19","17","12","14","2","2","0","2"

Obama is… effectively nullifying the General Election of two weeks ago, establishing himself as ruler and–once and for all–rendering Congress null and void. He is effectively legalizing new Democrat voters and nullifying the existing legal American population.

——GB——

After the landslide elections on 4 November 2014, Obama was said to be even more furious with the “stupid American voters” than usual. And, with his now usual arrogant bravado he is–with his recently announced coming actions–saying to the American people “Your petty little elections mean nothing to me. I’m beyond your laws as well as your wants and needs. Once I’m fully ensconced in and with my dictatorship and can openly eliminate anyone and everyone I want to destroy…I will!”

In order to finish his destruction of the USA,. Obama plans to announce he will give Amnesty–and likely the path to or full citizenship–to millions of illegals who are still streaming across the US’ Southern Border, which is (by Obama’s command) wide open and no longer being protected by the US Border Patrol.

Recently, Obama’s lackeys have floated the line, “this is what President Reagan did.” No…it is not. When President Ronald Reagan gave what amounted to limited Amnesty (I opposed it at the time) he signed a bill that had been passed by Congress–the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (a.k.a., “Simpson-Mazzoli” bill). President Reagan signed the bill…he did not write or rewrite it! On the other hand, Obama is effectively rewriting existing law and placing himself now-firmly in the position of Dictator-in-Chief Barack Hussein Obama; a title I gave him years ago and which will now be evident to all. Obama does not have the legal authority to write or rewrite laws. But, he’s doing it, as no one has yet stopped him.

What Obama is doing is effectively nullifying the General Election of two weeks ago, establishing himself as ruler and–once and for all–rendering Congress null and void. He is effectively legalizing new Democrat voters and nullifying the existing legal American population.

Obama will, also, officially declare war against the legal American citizens–white, brown, black, Hispanic etc..–and announce he is replacing them with illegals. Obama recently announced that he will begin flying (via charter flights) children and their family members from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador…more replacements for the now-awakened American voters. Illegal and treasonous. The flights will begin next month. Guess whose paying for them…you are!

Any way we slice it, this is in-your-face treason, folks. We did the right thing with our recent elections. But–as predicted–Obama will not recognize them. He and his criminal syndicate are–and have been–completely lawless. If we vote against Obama, he and his minions simply ignore us and seize more power. What do you want to do, America? We are now on the cliff and Obama is pushing us over. Do you still want to live? Do you?

“The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan,

with all power, signs, and lying wonders.”

– II Thessalonians 2:9 (NKJ)

Right Side News

House leaders have placed Obama on OFFICIAL NOTICE to stop the usurpation of Congress by violating the Constitution with illegal Executive amnesty.

The North American Law Center (NALC), working in concert with numerous patriot groups across America, placed House Republicans on notice demanding that they use constitutional congressional power to stop Barack Obama from illegally issuing defacto amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.

House Republicans followed by placing Barack Hussein Obama on OFFICIAL NOTICE ahead of Obama’s scheduled TV event at 8:00 PM ET on Thursday the 20th.

In part, that OFFICIAL NOTICE states…

The NOTICE was signed by Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte, R-VA and Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Michael McCaul, R-TX.

The clear threat is to impeach Barack Obama if he dares to act unilaterally on Immigration and Naturalization, beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch.

Article I delegates all law making authority to Congress alone. Section 8 – the Enumerated Powers of Congress delegates all authority over Immigration and Naturalization rules to Congress alone as well.

So, any unilateral Executive action on immigration by Barack Obama is a blatant subversive act and an open attempt to usurp the constitutional authority of Congress. It may in fact rise to the level of an act of treason against the U.S. Constitution and the American people, as an overt breach of trust and violation of Barack Obama’s oath of office.

There is nothing in Article II of the U.S. Constitution granting the Oval Office the power to usurp, subvert or ignore the laws of the United States as established by Congress.

On at least twenty-five separate occasions caught on video, Obama has stated correctly and unequivocally that the Oval Office has no power to alter or ignore U.S. Immigration and Naturalization laws, rules or policies, as established by Congress. This means that the crime he is about to commit against the United States is both willful and premeditated.

The question is… what will members of Congress and the American people do about it?

Once again, Republican Party leaders are talking about suing Obama over his abuse of office. There is no precedence or legal authority granted by the Constitution to sue a president for treasonous acts. The U.S. Constitution states precisely what Congress can and must do when an Oval Office occupant is acting against the United States and beyond their Constitutional authority….

Article II – Section 4 states – “The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”

Congress must impeach Barack Obama for his unconstitutional actions. Suing Obama is nothing more than an overt attempt to escape the constitutional authority and duties of Congress by avoiding the obvious remedy prescribed for just such an occasion in the U.S. Constitution.

Before Congress can force the Executive Branch to respect the Constitution, they must respect the Constitution themselves.

In this case, Obama’s unilateral action on immigration meets the following test…

· Such an action is beyond the legal authority of the Executive Branch

· As a result, it is a direct violation of the U.S. Constitution

· The act is of, by and for La Raza and millions of illegal aliens, not the American people

· As such, it is an overt act of war against the American people

· The act directly threatens both national sovereignty, security, and the rule of law

· As such, it is again, an overt act of war against the American people and national security

· Congress has placed Obama on OFFICIAL NOTICE in advance of the act

· As a result, the act will be with the prior knowledge that it is unconstitutional and illegal

THIS IS AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE – It involves bribery from groups like La Raza via their millions in democrat campaign donations and lobby efforts. It involves numerous high crimes and misdemeanors, the result of which rises to the level of treason against the United States and the American people.

WHOM TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE?

Unfortunately, it is Republicans who sit in the hot seat on this. Republicans have all the power they need to STOP EXECUTIVE ORDER AMNESTY and they know it, proven by the OFFICIAL NOTICE delivered to Barack Obama more than 24 hours before his action.

The TOP Republicans are in charge and that makes them responsible for what happens in the next several hours. Now that they have officially threatened impeachment, they must impeach or stick their own necks in the noose!

Bob Goodlatte, R-VA

Michael McCaul, R-TX

House Speaker John Boehner, R-OH

Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY

Others who must be held accountable for this constitutional crisis are members of the media who have withheld the truth on the subject from the American people and worked with political activists to mislead citizens on foolish and cowardly concepts like filing frivolous suits. Just a few…

Megan Kelly, FOX

Bill O’Reilly, FOX

Sean Hannity, FOX

Then there are internet experts like Dr. Edwin Vieira and Devvy Kidd who claim that “Obama cannot be impeached because he isn’t really the President;” which I’m sure comes as news to the U.S. Supreme Court and every member of Congress, not to mention millions of Americans. This effort to mislead citizens away from the constitutional remedy prescribe in Article II – Section 4, Impeachment, and towards criminal charges, arrest and hanging for treason, is an overt attempt to confuse and paralyze “the people” allowing Obama to continue his assault on the Constitution.

Of course, neither Dr. Vieira nor Kidd have followed their own expert advice and filed a criminal complaint against Obama in order to prove their legal theory. No matter their intentions, the outcome is horrific.

We also have to hold political gurus like Karl Rove accountable, for playing politics with the Constitutional Republic instead of stand up to protect and preserve it at any cost.

The People?

Nobody should be asking “what will politicians do?” – Politicians will do what politicians always do, play politics, even with the total destruction of the Constitution and the Republic, unless “the people” do something to hold them accountable.

Over the next 48 hours, we are going to learn everything we want to know.

· We well learn exactly what Obama thinks of the Constitution and the American people…

· We will learn just how courageous or cowardly House Republicans are…

· We will learn just how courageous or cowardly “the people” really are…

The people have the power to force their representatives to do what must be done, if they will. If they don’t, they will likely watch their newly elected Republicans run for cover in the face of the greatest constitutional crisis to ever face our once great nation.

And that is how Obama can get away with totally destroying the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.

Evil will prevail wherever good men (and women) do nothing! This is exactly how every free society died after only 200 years or so in existence. The people let it die!

NALC issued proposed Articles of Impeachment months ago. They served notice to Congress on how to stop unconstitutional executive amnesty. House leaders have since served notice on Barack Obama.

Obama is forcing Congressional Republicans to either Impeach him or stand down as he finishes off the destruction of the U.S. Constitutional Republic. Now we wait to see how “the people” and Republicans react to Obama’s massive treason…","2014-11-20 15:55:28","1","66.0","18.0","15.0","0.0","23.0","0.0","141.0","95.0","0.0","80.0","0.0","6.0","0","1266","92.76","62.70","11.85","22.11","26.38","25.67","74.88","45.10","6.87","3.16","0.16","0.63","0.00","0.71","1.66","3.71","8.37","15.48","6.48","3.24","6.24","1.11","10.03","3.71","2.05","1.74","1.74","1.82","3.55","1.66","1.90","0.39","1.11","0.16","6.71","0.00","0.00","0.08","0.79","9.56","1.74","1.74","0.95","1.58","2.69","2.84","0.55","0.32","0.16","0.08","0.47","0.24","0.24","0.00","0.00","11.93","1.26","1.50","8.85","0.39","1.26","1.03","7.98","1.11","10.82","1.42","6.40","3.00","5.85","0.79","0.63","0.71","0.00","0.32","1.03","0.00","0.79","0.00","0.24","0.00","13.27","5.45","4.34","0.16","0.08","0.32","0.24","0.55","1.11","0.63","0.32","0.08","6248","7.8","27.25531914893617","1983","1273","55","48.03","13.7","12.3","12.83","14.4","243","17.666666666666668","18.875506677140613","521","23.45","70","0.44","0","54","16","125","0","164","86","2","2","21","133","241","20","69","3","0","39","13","46","1","0","2","37","0","54","12","21","20","34","43","2","11","0","7"

Hat Tip: BB

In an egregious violation of the separation of powers, Barack Obama last night declared that 5 million illegal aliens would be granted Amnesty. Well, in the end it will be more like 34 million, but who’s counting anymore? He does not have the legal standing to do so… however, he does have a pen and a phone and he believes that is all he needs as king. Well, the king, or more appropriately, the emperor, is a fink. One could hear the thunderous applause of the elitist Leftists and the invaders who have breached our nation in a silent coup last night. And trust me, many of them will not come from south of the border and many of them are communists. As The Hayride points out, last night was eerily similar to the proclamation by Padme Amidala, the character played by Natalie Portman in Star Wars Episode III:

So this is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause.

And so it goes that something our President swore he would never do and that was illegal 25 or more times, has come to be. All to change the voting demographic, appease the National Chamber of Commerce, Hispanics and Progressives nationwide. The Executive Order is cheap, but the price America will pay is priceless. It could even devolve into Civil War.

Flashback to what Obama has said before:

The notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order. That’s just not the case. Because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed. There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system. That for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president. – March, 2011 I can’t solve this problem by myself. We’ll have to have bipartisan support to make it happen. – April, 2011 We’re also a nation of laws. That’s part of our tradition. And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend I can do something by violating our laws. – November, 2013 I can’t simply ignore laws that are out there. I have to work to make sure they’re changed. – October, 2010 I know some wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself.

[Cheering]

But that’s not how a democracy works. See, a democracy is hard. But it’s right. Changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes one by one. – April, 2011 Sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, you know, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that’s not how a democracy works. – May, 2011 Now, I swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books. Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the law on my own. Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting.

[applauding]

I promise you. Not just on immigration reform.

[laughter]

But that’s not how our system works. – July, 2011

Evidently, Obama has been stricken with selective amnesia, because he has done exactly what he said he could not do.

In his speech last night, Obama spouted lie after lie. He claimed that border crossings are down. As Americans collectively rolled on the floor, alternately laughing and weeping, the truth still remains that it was a blatant lie. They have skyrocketed when you count the number of children and young adults alone over the last two years and the numbers are staggering. That doesn’t include your average illegal alien, terrorists, Ebola/disease ridden refugees, gang members, criminals or communists. But hey, Obama is fair minded after all – he also granted Amnesty to those who have found their way here from Ebola stricken countries. President Obama separately ordered up to 8,000 more executive pardons and special work passes for Liberians, Sierra Leoneans and Guineans illegally in the country. I’m sure people will feel smug and charitable as they lay bleeding from every orifice and dying on the streets and in the gutters. Justice and death for all.

Obama continued to assert that if the Republicans would just pass a bill, he would sign it and all this EO nonsense would go away. Just one catch… it has to be his way, or the highway. How’s that for thuggery? All that time in Chicago was well spent. As for increasing spending and security at the border, does anyone really believe that anymore?

In reference to getting rid of criminal illegals, he just set a whole slew of them free. Why in the world would he follow through with deporting them? Simple… he won’t. He figures Americans have it coming and that we deserve to be a third world hellhole. Crime and chaos add to the mix and he’s loving it.

Obama isn’t bringing people out of the shadows. He’s ushering millions more in to join those already there in the dark pit of poverty and slavery. As for him saying they won’t get healthcare or citizenship, do you believe that? I don’t. Obama is giving the Father of Lies a run for his money here.

Our immigration system is not broken. Nope. Our laws are not being enforced and our police officers and border agents are not being allowed to do their job. I’m tired of hearing from both sides on how we need to fix this. It’s easy… follow the damn laws and it is fixed. Secure the border for real and it is fixed. Stop pandering and rigging the vote and it’s fixed. Get rid of the Marxist Progressives on both sides of the aisle and it is fixed. Got it?

And for those genius Republicans out there that figure this can be reversed… that it can be funded and then defunded… you are either delusional or disingenuous in the extreme. Obama opened the floodgates last night and declared war on America. How are you going to undo millions of illegal invaders and a rigged vote when you can’t even seem to find your spine? I’m not holding my breath waiting for you to actually do something.

No president has used an Executive Order on immigration to contradict law as passed by Congress. Not Bush, not Clinton, not Reagan. The Amnesties under them as well were miniscule in comparison to this travesty. Obama is taking jobs away from actual Americans and giving them to those who are criminals. He has redistributed our hard-earned wages through Obamacare to the poor and the illegal as well. This is straight up Cloward and Piven – it’s Marxism.

Fortunately, some things did not make the cut:

Special, easy rules for illegal-alien farm workers;

A blanket legalization program for the parents of the DACA beneficiaries, those who had arrived illegally before their 16th birthday; a tabloid headline writer might have written “Devious Daddies of the DACA Dreamers Denied”; and

The admissions of lots more H-1B workers.

Cold comfort though as Obama hammered home the final nails in America’s coffin last night.

Perhaps the biggest insult last night was quoting scripture to justify his lawlessness. But that’s okay, in Islam it is okay to lie to the infidels to obtain your goals. That is what our President did last night. He lied to the stupid Americans – we’ve been Grubered.

As Senator Sessions said correctly, we have to fight this. We have no choice:

Americans defeated President Obama’s disastrous amnesty plans both in Congress and at the voting booth. Tonight, President Obama defied an entire nation and declared that he will impose his rejected amnesty through the brute force of executive order.

What Obama did last night set an evil precedent. He laid the groundwork that makes him a Monarch and Congress utterly irrelevant. It shreds the Constitution and the Republic. It was the most over-reaching Constitutional violation ever seen in our lifetime and that is not hyperbole. As Laura Ingraham said last night on Fox News, a law suit should be brought to bear, but there has to be standing. It should be filed by a member of Congress and it should reference a violation of separation of powers. Let the lawsuits nationwide begin. While we are on the subject, impeach the bastard. Even if it fails, it makes a much needed statement. Funding should also be wielded as Ted Cruz suggested, funding the military and those areas we absolutely must have as a nation, while starving behemoths such as DHS and the areas that feed the beast of Amnesty. Agencies could also be actually shut down and pressure brought to bear on areas of government that hurt Obama and his cronies. Freeze his appointments for the next two years. Don’t believe the Left or the Right when they say it is impossible to defund or to fight this. We are being played. There are many, many on the right that are screaming about what Obama has done, but it is an act. They want this and therefore threw up their hands, got on a plane and went home to celebrate over the Thanksgiving holiday.

IBD says we teeter on a Constitutional tipping point:

There’s more at stake here than mere political fortunes. We are at the constitutional tipping point that Georgetown University law professor Jonathan Turley warned us about as Obama continues to wield executive authority that he himself once said he did not have. We live in a constitutional republic, and the president who says he cannot wait for the Congress to act ignores a Constitution that says he has to. Article I, Section 8 gives Congress exclusive authority to “establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization” and Article II, Section 3 says that it’s the president’s duty “to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Professor Turley told the House Judiciary Committee at a Dec. 3 hearing that Obama’s abuse of executive power has grown to the point that “he’s becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid.” It’s time to protect the Constitution. Don’t show him the money, Congress.

In the November elections, Obama and the Left were roundly slapped around by American voters. They don’t want Obamacare and they don’t want Amnesty. They are tired of high unemployment and of wondering how they will pay their bills and put food on the table next week. A despot rises wearing a laurel wreath of golden thorns dripping poison. He has sworn to veto any bill undoing Amnesty. Obama is acting like an emperor and has issued an imperial decree. But, in reality, he is the emperor of the Caesar’s Palace of America. He has rolled the dice on the Constitution for Amnesty and America has come up snake eyes.","2014-11-21 16:18:53","1","54.0","17.0","15.0","0.0","25.0","0.0","138.0","99.0","0.0","80.0","0.0","6.0","0","1815","61.94","65.64","13.29","23.19","14.88","21.32","80.50","51.68","12.84","7.05","1.54","1.54","0.61","2.20","1.16","5.79","7.49","12.29","10.03","4.02","7.16","1.98","16.31","3.69","1.98","1.38","1.82","1.98","4.13","1.98","2.15","0.17","1.05","0.28","8.54","0.17","0.06","0.00","2.42","9.97","1.43","1.71","1.82","1.76","1.16","3.03","2.04","0.33","1.27","0.44","0.77","0.33","0.33","0.00","0.17","9.59","2.09","1.10","5.90","0.61","0.55","2.87","11.40","0.99","12.34","1.87","6.39","3.80","4.74","0.61","0.17","1.21","0.17","0.39","0.83","0.11","0.22","0.17","0.28","0.00","14.82","6.72","3.80","0.33","0.17","0.39","0.00","0.22","0.44","2.31","0.00","0.44","8235","7.28","15.605042016806722","2562","1818","120","72.97","10.2","6.9","9.5","8.4","333","7.5","15.406732673267328","763","14.45","29","0.51","0","83","31","174","0","186","113","4","1","32","214","178","10","89","2","0","126","32","87","3","1","8","54","0","89","57","46","52","70","76","11","11","0","12"
