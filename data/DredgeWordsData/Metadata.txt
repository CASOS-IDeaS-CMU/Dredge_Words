`attributes.csv` are website level attributes extracted from the SEO toolkit Ahrefs.

`backlinks.csv` we extracted the 10 domains that most backlink to each labeled target domain. This is an edge list where each row contains an edge from `domain_from` to `domain_to`. Links is the number of links/ domain-level edge weight. Unique_pages contain the number of unique webpages on `domain_from`.

`dredge_serps.csv` contains dredge words (in `qry` column) and their top 10 SERP results. Most columns are identical to those in WebSearcher (https://github.com/gitronald/WebSearcher). We added a final conditional column `target_domain` which is 1 when the the returned domain is the same as the domain associated with the dredge word phrase.
